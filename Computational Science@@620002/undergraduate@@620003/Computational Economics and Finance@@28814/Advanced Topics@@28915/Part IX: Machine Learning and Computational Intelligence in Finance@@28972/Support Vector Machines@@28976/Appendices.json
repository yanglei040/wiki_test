For example, the format should be $[0.842,0.902,0.881,1]$.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard binary classification task in machine learning, applied to the domain of computational finance. The objective is to construct and evaluate a soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for predicting mortgage default. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary data and parameters are provided. It is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution will be constructed.\n\nThe core of the solution involves solving the dual optimization problem for the soft-margin SVM. For a training set of $N$ data points $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$, where $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are feature vectors and $y_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ are labels, the dual problem is a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem formulated as follows:\n$$\n\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}} \\mathcal{L}_D(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j y_i y_j K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)\n$$\nsubject to the constraints:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i y_i = 0\n$$\n$$\n0 \\le \\alpha_i \\le C, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\ldots, N\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N)$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers, $C$ is the regularization parameter that controls the penalty for misclassification, and $K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$ is the kernel function. The problem is solved by minimizing the negative of the dual Lagrangian, $-\\mathcal{L}_D(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$, which is equivalent to minimizing $L(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^T P \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\mathbf{1}^T \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, where the matrix $P$ has elements $P_{ij} = y_i y_j K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$.\n\nThe problem specifies two types of kernel functions:\n$1$. **Linear Kernel**: This kernel corresponds to a linear decision boundary in the original feature space. It is defined as:\n$$\nK(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{x}_j\n$$\n$2$. **Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**: This kernel allows for a non-linear decision boundary by mapping the data into an infinite-dimensional feature space. It is defined as:\n$$\nK(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\exp(-\\gamma \\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\|^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma > 0$ is a parameter that controls the width of the Gaussian.\n\nThe solution is implemented by numerically solving this QP problem using the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm available in `scipy.optimize.minimize`. Upon finding the optimal vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^*$, the bias term $b$ is calculated. A robust method is to average over all support vectors for which $0 < \\alpha_i^* < C$, since for these points the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions imply the margin is exactly met:\n$$\nb = y_s - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i^* y_i K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_s)\n$$\nIf no such non-bound support vectors exist, $b$ is determined by taking the midpoint of the feasible interval defined by the margin constraints of the bounded support vectors ($\\alpha_i^* = C$).\n\nThe decision function for a new data point $\\mathbf{x}$ is then given by:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{sign}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i^* y_i K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}) + b\\right)\n$$\n\nA critical step in the methodology is **feature scaling**. The input features ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) have vastly different scales. The FICO score $x_3$ would otherwise dominate any distance-based calculation, such as in the RBF kernel. To address this, we apply standardization (Z-score normalization) to the features. Within each fold of the cross-validation, the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training data and then used to scale both the training and test data for that fold. This prevents data leakage from the test set into the training process.\n\nThe model's performance is evaluated using $k$-fold cross-validation with $k=5$. The dataset of $20$ observations is partitioned into $5$ disjoint folds of $4$ observations each. For each of the $5$ iterations, one fold is used as the test set and the remaining $4$ folds are used for training. The classification accuracy, defined as the fraction of correctly predicted labels on the test set, is computed for each fold. The final out-of-sample accuracy for a given parameter set is the mean of these $5$ accuracies.\n\nThis procedure is carried out for each of the three specified test cases (A, B, C). Finally, an indicator variable is computed. This variable is $1$ if the best-performing RBF kernel's accuracy exceeds the linear kernel's accuracy by at least $0.03$, and $0$ otherwise. This comparison allows for an inference about the geometric nature of the class separation; a significantly better RBF performance implies a non-linear decision boundary is more appropriate for this credit risk classification problem. The final output assembles the computed accuracies and the indicator into the required list format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the SVM cross-validation problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dataset definition\n    data = [\n        (0.65, 0.18, 780, -1), (0.70, 0.20, 760, -1), (0.75, 0.25, 740, -1),\n        (0.80, 0.22, 770, -1), (0.68, 0.30, 720, -1), (0.72, 0.28, 730, -1),\n        (0.85, 0.20, 750, -1), (0.90, 0.18, 760, -1), (0.78, 0.26, 740, -1),\n        (0.82, 0.27, 735, -1), (0.95, 0.45, 660, 1), (1.02, 0.40, 680, 1),\n        (0.88, 0.55, 620, 1), (0.92, 0.50, 600, 1), (1.05, 0.35, 650, 1),\n        (0.90, 0.60, 590, 1), (0.98, 0.48, 630, 1), (1.10, 0.30, 610, 1),\n        (0.84, 0.58, 605, 1), (0.70, 0.40, 580, 1)\n    ]\n    X = np.array([d[:3] for d in data])\n    y = np.array([d[3] for d in data])\n\n    # Test cases\n    test_cases = [\n        {'C': 10.0, 'kernel_type': 'linear', 'gamma': None},\n        {'C': 10.0, 'kernel_type': 'rbf', 'gamma': 0.5},\n        {'C': 10.0, 'kernel_type': 'rbf', 'gamma': 2.0},\n    ]\n\n    # --- Kernel Functions ---\n    def linear_kernel(x1, x2):\n        return np.dot(x1, x2)\n\n    def make_rbf_kernel(gamma):\n        def rbf_kernel(x1, x2):\n            return np.exp(-gamma * np.linalg.norm(x1 - x2)**2)\n        return rbf_kernel\n\n    # --- SVM Solver ---\n    def train_svm(X_train, y_train, C, kernel_func):\n        n_samples = X_train.shape[0]\n        \n        # Build Kernel/Gram matrix\n        K = np.zeros((n_samples, n_samples))\n        for i in range(n_samples):\n            for j in range(n_samples):\n                K[i, j] = kernel_func(X_train[i], X_train[j])\n        \n        # QP problem formulation for scipy.optimize.minimize\n        # Minimize: 0.5 * alpha.T * P * alpha - 1.T * alpha\n        # P_ij = y_i * y_j * K_ij\n        P = np.outer(y_train, y_train) * K\n        # Add a small regularization for numerical stability\n        P += 1e-8 * np.eye(n_samples)\n\n\n        def objective(alpha):\n            return 0.5 * alpha.T @ P @ alpha - np.sum(alpha)\n\n        # Constraints: sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0\n        eq_cons = {'type': 'eq',\n                   'fun': lambda alpha: y_train.T @ alpha,\n                   'jac': lambda alpha: y_train}\n\n        # Bounds: 0 = alpha_i = C\n        bounds = [(0, C) for _ in range(n_samples)]\n\n        # Initial guess\n        alpha0 = np.zeros(n_samples)\n\n        # Solve QP problem\n        res = minimize(objective, alpha0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=[eq_cons])\n        alpha = res.x\n\n        # Find support vectors\n        sv_mask = alpha > 1e-6\n        \n        # Compute bias term 'b'\n        non_bound_sv_mask = (alpha > 1e-6)  (alpha  C - 1e-6)\n        if np.any(non_bound_sv_mask):\n            non_bound_sv_indices = np.where(non_bound_sv_mask)[0]\n            b_values = [y_train[s] - np.sum(alpha[sv_mask] * y_train[sv_mask] * K[sv_mask, s]) for s in non_bound_sv_indices]\n            b = np.mean(b_values)\n        else: # Fallback if no non-bound SVs are found\n            sv_indices = np.where(sv_mask)[0]\n            f_vals_pos = [np.sum(alpha[sv_mask] * y_train[sv_mask] * K[sv_mask, i]) for i in sv_indices if y_train[i] == 1]\n            f_vals_neg = [np.sum(alpha[sv_mask] * y_train[sv_mask] * K[sv_mask, i]) for i in sv_indices if y_train[i] == -1]\n            \n            if not f_vals_pos or not f_vals_neg:\n                # Can happen if all SVs are from one class.

The matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $H_{ij} = y_i y_j K_{ij}$, where $K_{ij}$ is the value of the kernel function for the $i$-th and $j$-th training samples.\n\nThe kernel function is given by:\n$$\nK_{\\alpha,\\gamma}\\big((x_i,t_i),(x_j,t_j)\\big) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\big(-\\gamma \\,d_{ij}^2\\big)\\;\\cdot\\;\\exp\\!\\big(\\alpha\\,(t_i + t_j)\\big)\n$$\nwhere $d_{ij}^2 = \\|x_i - x_j\\|_2^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between the feature vectors $x_i$ and $x_j$. For the given training data:\n$x_1 = (0.00, 0.00)$, $t_1 = 1$, $y_1 = -1$\n$x_2 = (1.00, 0.20)$, $t_2 = 2$, $y_2 = +1$\n$x_3 = (0.90, 1.00)$, $t_3 = 3$, $y_3 = +1$\n$x_4 = (-0.80, -0.50)$, $t_4 = 4$, $y_4 = -1$\nWe first precompute the $n \\times n$ Gram matrix, denoted as $\\mathbf{K}$, with entries $K_{ij} = K_{\\alpha,\\gamma}\\big((x_i,t_i),(x_j,t_j)\\big)$. Then, we construct the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ using the formula $H_{ij} = y_i y_j K_{ij}$.\n\nThis constrained optimization problem is solved using a numerical QP solver. We employ the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm from the `scipy.optimize.minimize` library function. This function takes the objective $\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$, an initial guess (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$), the bounds $0 \\le \\alpha_i \\le C$ for each $i$, and the linear equality constraint $\\sum_i y_i \\alpha_i = 0$. The solver returns the optimal vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\star = [\\alpha_1^\\star, \\dots, \\alpha_n^\\star]^T$. Due to numerical precision, values of $\\alpha_i^\\star$ very close to $0$ or $C$ are clamped to these exact values.\n\nAfter obtaining $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\star$, we compute the bias term $b$. The method for this depends on the resulting $\\alpha_i^\\star$ values, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.\nLet $S$ be the set of indices for support vectors on the margin, where $0  \\alpha_i^\\star  C$.\nIf $S$ is non-empty, the bias $b$ is computed to ensure that for any $i \\in S$, the decision function yields $y_i f(x_i, t_i) = 1$. This leads to the expression:\n$$\nb_i = y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j^\\star y_j K_{ij}\n$$\nFor robustness, we average these values over all $i \\in S$: $b = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{i \\in S} b_i$.\n\nIf $S$ is empty, all $\\alpha_i^\\star$ are at the boundaries ($0$ or $C$). In this case, $b$ is not uniquely determined by a single equation but must lie in an interval defined by the KKT complementary slackness conditions:\n- For $\\alpha_i^\\star = 0$: $y_i \\big(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j^\\star y_j K_{ij} + b\\big) \\ge 1$.\n- For $\\alpha_i^\\star = C$: $y_i \\big(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j^\\star y_j K_{ij} + b\\big) \\le 1$.\nThese inequalities define a feasible interval for $b$. Let $b_{lower}$ be the maximum of the lower bounds and $b_{upper}$ be the minimum of the upper bounds derived from these conditions. The problem requires selecting $b$ as the midpoint of this tightest feasible interval: $b = (b_{lower} + b_{upper}) / 2$.\n\nFinally, with $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\star$ and $b$ determined, we classify the three new test inputs $z_1, z_2, z_3$ at timestamp $t_z = 5$. For each test point $(z, t_z)$, the decision function is evaluated:\n$$\nf(z,t_z) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^\\star y_i\\, K_{\\alpha,\\gamma}\\big((x_i,t_i),(z,t_z)\\big) \\;+\\; b\n$$\nThe predicted label $\\ell \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ is given by the sign of $f(z,t_z)$, with the convention that non-negative values map to $+1$:\n$$\n\\ell = \\begin{cases} +1  \\text{if } f(z,t_z) \\ge 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } f(z,t_z)  0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis entire process is executed for each of the four specified parameter configurations, and the resulting predictions are aggregated into the required output format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize, Bounds\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the training data from the problem statement.\n    X_train = np.array([\n        [0.00, 0.00],\n        [1.00, 0.20],\n        [0.90, 1.00],\n        [-0.80, -0.50]\n    ])\n    T_train = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    Y_train = np.array([-1, 1, 1, -1])\n    n_samples = len(X_train)\n\n    # Define the test inputs.\n    X_test = np.array([\n        [0.95, 0.70],\n        [-0.70, -0.40],\n        [0.10, 0.05]\n    ])\n    T_test = 5\n\n    # Define the parameter configurations from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 1.0, 10.0),\n        (0.5, 1.0, 10.0),\n        (1.0, 0.5, 10.0),\n        (0.0, 5.0, 1.0),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    # Numerical tolerance for floating point comparisons\n    tol = 1e-9\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha_param, gamma, C = case\n        \n        # 1.

The aim is to formalize and quantify whether the set of \"most important\" stocks, defined as the support vectors in a soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM), changes over time when the predictive task is re-estimated on rolling windows.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- The soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) solves the convex optimization problem\n  $$\n  \\min_{\\mathbf{w}, b, \\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\;\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert_2^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\xi_i\n  \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad\n  y_i \\big(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_i + b\\big) \\ge 1 - \\xi_i, \\;\\; \\xi_i \\ge 0,\n  $$\n  where $C \\ge 0$ is the regularization constant, $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are features, $y_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ are labels, and $\\xi_i$ are slack variables.\n- Its Lagrangian dual for the linear kernel can be written as the quadratic program\n  $$\n  \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} \\;\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\mathbf{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\n  \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad\n  \\mathbf{y}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = 0, \\;\\; 0 \\le \\alpha_i \\le C,\n  $$\n  where $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the matrix with entries $Q_{ij} = y_i y_j \\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\mathbf{x}_j$, $\\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of ones, and $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1,\\dots,y_m)^\\top$.\n- By the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, data points with dual variables $\\alpha_i  0$ are support vectors. Those with $0  \\alpha_i  C$ lie on the margin; those with $\\alpha_i = C$ are margin-violating or misclassified points.

It is scientifically grounded in the theory of support vector machines and convex optimization, and its application to computational finance is a legitimate area of study. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, definitions, and a clear, objective computational goal. It contains no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factually incorrect premises. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to quantify the stability of a stock's \"importance\" over time. Importance is defined in terms of being a support vector in a soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification task. The analysis is performed on a rolling-window basis. The solution is executed by following a sequence of steps derived from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the synthetic dataset. There are $N=8$ stocks, each with a fixed, two-dimensional feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Over $T=6$ time periods, the underlying classification rule changes smoothly. This is modeled by a rotating weight vector $\\mathbf{w}_t = (\\cos\\theta_t, \\sin\\theta_t)^\\top$ for a sequence of angles $\\theta_t$. The class label $y_{i,t} \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ for stock $i$ at time $t$ is determined deterministically as $y_{i,t} = \\mathrm{sign}(\\mathbf{w}_t^\\top \\mathbf{x}_i)$.\n\nSecond, we implement the rolling-window analysis. For a given window width $W$ and regularization parameter $C$, we construct a series of training datasets. The $k$-th window, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, T-W\\}$, consists of all data points $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_{i,t})$ where $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$ and $t \\in \\{k, \\dots, k+W-1\\}$. This results in a training set of size $m = N \\cdot W$ for each window.\n\nThird, for each window's training data, we solve the dual problem of the soft-margin SVM. The problem is a Quadratic Program (QP) defined as:\n$$\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} \\;\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\mathbf{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\n$$\nsubject to the constraints:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = 0\n$$\n$$\n0 \\le \\alpha_j \\le C \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, m\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers, $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of labels in the window's training set, and $\\mathbf{Q}$ is an $m \\times m$ matrix with entries $Q_{jl} = y_j y_l (\\mathbf{x}_j^\\top \\mathbf{x}_l)$. This constrained optimization problem is convex and can be solved reliably using numerical methods. We employ the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm, as implemented in the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function. We supply the objective function, its gradient (Jacobian) $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}f(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\mathbf{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\mathbf{1}$, the linear equality constraint, and the box constraints on $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n\nFourth, after solving for the optimal dual variables $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(k)}$ for window $k$, we identify the set of important stocks. According to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions of the SVM, a data point $j$ is a support vector if its corresponding Lagrange multiplier $\\alpha_j$ is strictly positive. Due to floating-point arithmetic, we use a small tolerance, identifying support vectors as those with $\\alpha_j  \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon  0$. The set of important stocks for window $k$, denoted $\\mathcal{S}_k$, is the set of all unique stock indices $i$ for which at least one corresponding data point in window $k$ is a support vector.\n\nFifth, we quantify the stability of these sets over time. The similarity between the support vector sets of two consecutive windows, $\\mathcal{S}_k$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}$, is measured by the Jaccard index:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{S}_k, \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}) = \\frac{|\\mathcal{S}_k \\cap \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}|}{|\\mathcal{S}_k \\cup \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}|}\n$$\nThe overall stability for a given $(C, W)$ pair, $\\bar{J}$, is the arithmetic mean of the Jaccard indices across all consecutive window pairs from $k=0$ to $k=K-2$, where $K = T - W + 1$ is the total number of windows.\n\nFinally, this entire pipeline is executed for each $(C, W)$ pair specified in the test suite. The computed average stability $\\bar{J}$ for each case is rounded to four decimal places and reported as the final result.
