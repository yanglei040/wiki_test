The mathematical formulation is logically consistent and based on established principles in financial modeling. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is formulated as a deterministic initial value problem. Given the initial state ($W_0$, $a_{-1}=0$) and the input sequences of prices and actions, the state of the system ($W_t, H_t, D_t$) at any future time $t$ is uniquely determined.

All terms are defined explicitly, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All parameters, including price and action sequences, initial wealth, cost rate, and drawdown threshold, are provided for each test case. The length of the price sequence determines the total duration $T$, and the action sequence has the correct corresponding length of $T$. The constraints on parameters ($p_t > 0$, $W_0 > 0$, etc.) are consistent and prevent issues such as division by zero.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Design\n\nThe problem requires a discrete-time simulation of an agent's wealth under a specific trading strategy and risk constraint. The simulation evolves step-by-step, updating the system's state variables at each time index.\n\nLet the state of the system at time $t$ be characterized by the wealth $W_t$, the high-water mark $H_t$, and the drawdown $D_t$. The simulation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization (at $t=0$)**:\n    - The initial wealth $W_0$ is given.\n    - The initial high-water mark is $H_0 = W_0$.\n    - The initial drawdown is $D_0 = 1 - W_0/H_0 = 0$.\n    - The action at the previous step is set by convention to $a_{-1} = 0$.\n    - The total simulation horizon $T$ is determined by the length of the given price sequence, specifically $T = \\text{length}(\\{p_t\\}) - 1$.\n\n2.  **Time-Stepping Loop (for $t = 0, 1, \\dots, T-1$)**:\n    At each step $t$, the state for the next time index, $t+1$, is computed.\n    - **a. Calculate Return**: The one-step gross return on the risky asset is computed from the price data:\n      $$r_{t+1} = \\frac{p_{t+1} - p_t}{p_t}$$\n    - **b. Calculate Trading Cost**: A trading cost is incurred if the action changes from the previous step. The cost is:\n      $$C_t = \\kappa\\, W_t \\, \\mathbf{1}\\{a_t \\neq a_{t-1}\\}$$\n      where $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function, which is $1$ if the condition is true and $0$ otherwise.\n    - **c. Update Wealth**: The wealth is updated based on the investment return and the trading cost:\n      $$W_{t+1} = W_t(1 + a_t r_{t+1}) - C_t$$\n    - **d. Update High-Water Mark**: The running maximum of wealth is updated:\n      $$H_{t+1} = \\max(H_t, W_{t+1})$$\n    - **e. Calculate Drawdown**: The new drawdown is calculated. Since $W_0 > 0$ and $p_t > 0$, $H_t$ will remain positive for all $t  \\tau$.\n      $$D_{t+1} = 1 - \\frac{W_{t+1}}{H_{t+1}}$$\n    - **f. Check Circuit Breaker**: The core risk management rule is checked. If the newly computed drawdown exceeds the threshold, the simulation is halted.\n      If $D_{t+1} > \\bar{d}$:\n        - Set the halting time $\\tau = t+1$.\n        - Set the halting indicator $h=1$.\n        - The process terminates. The final state is $\\{W_\\tau, D_\\tau, \\tau\\}$.\n    - **g. Update Previous Action**: For the next iteration, the current action becomes the previous action: set $a_{t-1} \\leftarrow a_t$.\n\n3.  **Termination**:\n    - If the loop is terminated early by the circuit breaker at time $\\tau$, the final results are $\\{h=1, W_\\tau, D_\\tau, \\tau\\}$.\n    - If the loop completes without the drawdown ever exceeding the threshold, the simulation runs to its full course. The termination time is $\\tau=T$. The final results are $\\{h=0, W_T, D_T, \\tau=T\\}$.\n\nAll floating-point output values ($W_\\tau$, $D_\\tau$) must be rounded to $6$ decimal places.

To ensure a unique optimal action $\\pi_t(p_t)$, the specified tie-breaking rule must be strictly enforced. When multiple actions yield the same maximal $Q$-value, the selection is refined by a lexicographical comparison. The chosen action $a^\\star$ must be the one that minimizes the following criteria in sequence:\n    a. Maximize the $Q$-value, $Q_t(p_t, a_t)$.\n    b. Minimize the absolute value of the next inventory, $|p_{t+1}|$.\n    c. Minimize the absolute value of the action, $|a_t|$.\n    d. Minimize the action value itself, with the natural ordering $-1  0  1$.\n5.  The optimal value $V_t(p_t) = Q_t(p_t, \\pi_t(p_t))$ is stored.\n6.  The optimal total expected reward for the entire trading day, starting from $p_0=0$, is $R^\\star = V_0(0)$.\n7.  To find the corresponding terminal inventory $p_T$, one can simulate the trajectory forward from the initial state $(t,p) = (0,0)$ using the computed optimal policy $\\pi_t(p_t)$. A more direct method, employed in the algorithm, is to maintain another table during the backward pass that maps each state-time pair $(t, p_t)$ to the resulting terminal inventory $p_T$ if the optimal policy is followed from that point. Let this be $P_T(t, p_t)$. Then $P_T(T, p_T) = p_T$, and for $t  T$, $P_T(t, p_t) = P_T(t+1, \\mathrm{clip}(p_t + \\pi_t(p_t), -P_{\\max}, P_{\\max}))$. The final answer for the terminal inventory is then $p_T = P_T(0, 0)$.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach guarantees the discovery of the globally optimal solution under the model's assumptions.

By systematically varying the length of the historical data window the agent observes, you will conduct an empirical study to see how what an agent 'sees' impacts its performance, mirroring the experimental process of a quantitative researcher.", "problem": "Construct a complete, runnable program that studies how the observation window length in the state representation of a trading agent affects out-of-sample performance. The trading environment is a discrete-time, frictional market with a synthetic return process and a finite action set. The agent must be trained separately under each specified window length and then evaluated on an independent test trajectory. The final output must aggregate the results for all cases into a single line as specified below.\n\nDefine the market as follows. Time is indexed by integers $t \\in \\{0,1,\\dots\\}$. Let $r_t$ denote the per-step log-return (expressed as a decimal, not a percentage sign) of a synthetic asset. The return process switches deterministically between a positively autocorrelated (trending) regime and a negatively autocorrelated (mean-reverting) regime every $L$ steps. Specifically, for a given $t$, define the regime index $z_t = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{t}{L} \\right\\rfloor \\bmod 2$. Let $(\\mu_0,\\phi_0)$ be the parameters for the trending regime and $(\\mu_1,\\phi_1)$ the parameters for the mean-reverting regime. The return process is\n$$\nr_t \\;=\\; \\mu_{z_t} \\;+\\; \\phi_{z_t}\\, r_{t-1} \\;+\\; \\sigma\\, \\varepsilon_t,\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ independent and identically distributed. The initial condition is $r_{-1} = 0$. Use the constants $L=200$, $\\mu_0=0.0005$, $\\phi_0=0.9$, $\\mu_1=0.0$, $\\phi_1=-0.9$, and $\\sigma=0.002$. The agent’s actions at each $t$ are $a_t \\in \\{-1,0,+1\\}$, representing fully short, flat, or fully long positions, respectively. The immediately realized reward per step is\n$$\nR_t \\;=\\; a_t \\, r_t \\;-\\; c \\, |a_t - a_{t-1}| \\;-\\; \\lambda \\, \\hat{v}_t \\, a_t^2,\n$$\nwhere $a_{-1}=0$, $c=0.0005$ is the transaction cost per unit change in position, and $\\lambda=10.0$ is a risk-aversion coefficient applied to a rolling variance estimate $\\hat{v}_t$ of returns computed over the most recent $W$ observed returns available prior to choosing $a_t$ (if fewer than $W$ past returns are available, use all available). The initial variance estimate may be taken as $0$ when insufficient data exist. The return process is exogenous and independent of the agent’s actions.\n\nFor state representation, the agent must form at time $t$ a feature vector using only information available prior to choosing $a_t$. Let $W$ denote the observation window length. The state summary at decision time $t$ is a vector comprising:\n- a constant bias term equal to $1$,\n- the mean of the last up to $W$ realized returns $\\{r_{t-1}, r_{t-2}, \\dots\\}$,\n- the most recent realized return $r_{t-1}$ (taken as $0$ if none),\n- the standard deviation of the last up to $W$ returns,\n- the previous position $a_{t-1}$.\n\nTraining objective: for each specified window length $W$, from first principles, construct a stationary policy $\\pi_W$ that approximately maximizes the expected discounted sum of rewards,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T_{\\text{train}}-1} \\gamma^t R_t \\right],\n$$\nwith discount factor $\\gamma = 0.95$, by interacting with the environment on training trajectories. The training horizon per episode is $T_{\\text{train}} = 1000$ steps, and the number of training episodes is $E_{\\text{train}} = 8$. The randomness in training must be generated with independent and identically distributed standard normal shocks and be reproducible across window lengths: use the training seeds $s_{\\text{train}} + e$ for episode index $e \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,E_{\\text{train}}-1\\}$ with $s_{\\text{train}} = 12345$. After training $\\pi_W$, evaluate out-of-sample performance by applying the resulting stationary policy greedily without exploration on an independent test trajectory of length $T_{\\text{test}} = 3000$, generated with a distinct seed $s_{\\text{test}} = 54321$ and the same data-generating process. The evaluation metric for each $W$ is the average realized reward per step on the test trajectory,\n$$\n\\bar{R}(W) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{test}}} \\sum_{t=0}^{T_{\\text{test}}-1} R_t,\n$$\nexpressed as a decimal.\n\nTest suite.

Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as $\\mathcal{W}$.

The primary objective is to study the effect of the observation window length, $W$, on the agent's out-of-sample performance. Before proceeding, we must validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Synthetic Return Process**: $r_t = \\mu_{z_t} + \\phi_{z_t} r_{t-1} + \\sigma \\varepsilon_t$, with $\\varepsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $r_{-1} = 0$.\n- **Regime Switching**: Index $z_t = \\lfloor t/L \\rfloor \\bmod 2$, with period $L=200$.\n- **Regime Parameters**: Trending ($z_t=0$): $\\mu_0=0.0005, \\phi_0=0.9$. Mean-reverting ($z_t=1$): $\\mu_1=0.0, \\phi_1=-0.9$.\n- **Volatility**: $\\sigma=0.002$.\n- **Agent Actions**: $a_t \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$, with initial position $a_{-1}=0$.\n- **Reward Function**: $R_t = a_t r_t - c |a_t - a_{t-1}| - \\lambda \\hat{v}_t a_t^2$.\n- **Reward Parameters**: Transaction cost $c=0.0005$, risk aversion $\\lambda=10.0$.\n- **Rolling Variance**: $\\hat{v}_t$ is the variance of the last up to $W$ returns available before time $t$.\n- **State Vector ($s_t$ at decision time $t$)**: A vector of 5 features: [$1$ (bias), mean of recent $\\le W$ returns, $r_{t-1}$, standard deviation of recent $\\le W$ returns, $a_{t-1}$].\n- **Training Objective**: Maximize $\\mathbb{E}[\\sum_{t=0}^{T_{\\text{train}}-1} \\gamma^t R_t]$.\n- **Training Parameters**: Discount factor $\\gamma = 0.95$, training horizon $T_{\\text{train}} = 1000$, number of episodes $E_{\\text{train}} = 8$. Training seeds are $s_{\\text{train}} + e$ for episode $e$, where $s_{\\text{train}} = 12345$.\n- **Evaluation**: Greedy policy (no exploration) on a test trajectory of length $T_{\\text{test}} = 3000$ using seed $s_{\\text{test}} = 54321$.\n- **Evaluation Metric**: Average per-step reward $\\bar{R}(W) = \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{test}}} \\sum_{t=0}^{T_{\\text{test}}-1} R_t$.\n- **Test Suite**: $W \\in \\mathcal{W} = [1, 5, 30, 240, 600]$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded within the field of computational finance, employing standard models like autoregressive processes for returns and a common reward structure. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, initial conditions, and evaluation metrics clearly defined. The language is objective and unambiguous. While the specific reinforcement learning algorithm is not prescribed, the directive to \"from first principles, construct a stationary policy\" in this context points toward a fundamental, model-free algorithm. Given the discrete action space and continuous (vector) state space, Q-learning with linear function approximation is the most direct and standard choice. This interpretation is consistent with the level of detail provided elsewhere. The problem is complete, consistent, and computationally feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Methodology**\nThe task is to train a trading agent using reinforcement learning. We will implement Q-learning, a model-free temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm, with a linear function approximator for the action-value function, $Q(s, a)$.\n\n**1. State and Action-Value Function**\nThe state $s_t$ at time $t$ is a $5$-dimensional feature vector as defined in the problem. The action space is discrete: $\\mathcal{A} = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We approximate the Q-function for each action $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ as a linear combination of the state features:\n$$\nQ(s_t, a; \\theta_a) = s_t^T \\theta_a\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_a$ is a $5$-dimensional weight vector for action $a$. The agent's goal is to learn the optimal weight vectors $\\theta_a^*$ for all actions.\n\n**2. Learning Algorithm: Q-Learning**\nDuring training, the agent interacts with the environment. At each step $t$, it is in state $s_t$, takes an action $a_t$, receives a reward $R_t$, and observes the next state $s_{t+1}$. The weight vector for the chosen action $a_t$ is updated using the TD error:\n$$\n\\text{TD Error: } \\delta_t = R_t + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q(s_{t+1}, a'; \\theta_{a'}) - Q(s_t, a_t; \\theta_{a_t})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Update Rule: } \\theta_{a_t} \\leftarrow \\theta_{a_t} + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_t \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta_{a_t}} Q(s_t, a_t; \\theta_{a_t})\n$$\nSince $Q(s_t, a_t; \\theta_{a_t}) = s_t^T \\theta_{a_t}$, the gradient is simply the state vector $s_t$. The update becomes:\n$$\n\\theta_{a_t} \\leftarrow \\theta_{a_t} + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_t \\cdot s_t\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the learning rate. We select a standard constant value $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n\n**3. Exploration**\nTo ensure sufficient exploration of the state-action space during training, an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy is used. With probability $\\epsilon$, the agent chooses a random action; otherwise, it chooses the action with the highest estimated Q-value (greedily):\n$$\na_t = \\arg\\max_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q(s_t, a'; \\theta_{a'})\n$$\nWe use a standard constant exploration rate of $\\epsilon = 0.1$.\n\n**4. Implementation Details**\n- **Reproducibility**: To isolate the effect of the window length $W$, the sequence of random shocks $(\\varepsilon_t)$ for the return process and the random draws for the $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration are pre-generated for each training episode and for the test run. This ensures that for a given episode index, the market dynamics and exploration choices are identical across all experiments for different values of $W$.\n- **State Calculation**: The state vector $s_t$ is constructed using returns realized up to time $t-1$. For $t=0$, where no prior returns exist, the statistical features (mean, standard deviation, last return) are set to $0$. When the number of available returns is less than $W$, all available returns are used for calculations. The standard deviation, and thus the variance term $\\hat{v}_t$ in the reward, is $0$ if fewer than two data points are available.\n- **Training and Evaluation**: For each $W \\in \\mathcal{W}$, the agent's weights are initialized to zero and then trained over $E_{\\text{train}}=8$ episodes, each of length $T_{\\text{train}}=1000$. After training, the learned policy is evaluated on a separate, longer test trajectory of $T_{\\text{test}}=3000$ steps. During evaluation, the policy is purely greedy ($\\epsilon=0$) to measure its out-of-sample performance. The final metric is the average reward per step over this test trajectory.\n\nThis systematic approach allows for a direct comparison of performance attributable solely to the change in the agent's observation window length $W$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and evaluates a reinforcement learning trading agent for various\n    observation window lengths, as specified in the problem statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Problem Parameters\n    L = 200\n    MU0, PHI0 = 0.0005, 0.9\n    MU1, PHI1 = 0.0, -0.9\n    SIGMA = 0.002\n    C = 0.0005\n    LAMBDA = 10.0\n    GAMMA = 0.95\n    T_TRAIN = 1000\n    E_TRAIN = 8\n    S_TRAIN = 12345\n    T_TEST = 3000\n    S_TEST = 54321\n    WINDOW_LENGTHS = [1, 5, 30, 240, 600]\n    ACTIONS = [-1, 0, 1]\n\n    # RL Hyperparameters\n    ALPHA = 0.01\n    EPSILON = 0.1\n\n    def get_state(t, W, rt_history, at_history):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the state vector at time t.\n        State vector: [bias, mean(r), r_{t-1}, std(r), a_{t-1}]\n        \"\"\"\n        if t == 0:\n            return np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n\n        realized_returns = rt_history[1:]  # Exclude r_{-1}\n        \n        window = realized_returns[max(0, len(realized_returns) - W):]\n        \n        r_mean = np.mean(window)\n        r_std = np.std(window) if len(window)  1 else 0.0\n        r_tm1_feat = realized_returns[-1]\n        a_tm1 = at_history[-1]\n        \n        return np.array([1.0, r_mean, r_tm1_feat, r_std, a_tm1])\n\n    # Pre-generate random numbers for reproducibility across different W\n    train_market_shocks = []\n    train_expl_draws = []\n    train_expl_actions = []\n    for e in range(E_TRAIN):\n        rng_episode = np.random.default_rng(S_TRAIN + e)\n        train_market_shocks.append(rng_episode.standard_normal(size=T_TRAIN))\n        train_expl_draws.append(rng_episode.random(size=T_TRAIN))\n        train_expl_actions.append(rng_episode.choice(ACTIONS, size=T_TRAIN))\n\n    rng_test = np.random.default_rng(S_TEST)\n    test_market_shocks = rng_test.standard_normal(size=T_TEST)\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for W in WINDOW_LENGTHS:\n        # --- Training Phase ---\n        weights = {a: np.zeros(5) for a in ACTIONS}\n        \n        for e in range(E_TRAIN):\n            at_history = [0]\n            rt_history = [0.0]\n            for t in range(T_TRAIN):\n                s_t = get_state(t, W, rt_history, at_history)\n                \n                # 1.
