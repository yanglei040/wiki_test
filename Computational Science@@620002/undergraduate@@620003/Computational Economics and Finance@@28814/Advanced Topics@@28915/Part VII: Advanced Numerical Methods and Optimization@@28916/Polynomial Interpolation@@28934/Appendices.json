Let $L_k(\\tau) = c\\tau^n + \\dots$, where $c$ is a non-zero constant. Then $L_k'(\\tau) = nc\\tau^{n-1} + \\dots$, and $\\tau L_k'(\\tau) = nc\\tau^n + \\dots$. The sum is $(n+1)c\\tau^n + \\dots$, which is a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$. Therefore, $\\Delta f(\\tau)$ is a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ (assuming $\\tilde y_k \\neq y_k$). A non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ is zero at most at $n$ distinct points. This demonstrates that the change in the forward curve is not localized but affects the entire curve, i.e., $f(\\tau)$ changes for almost all $\\tau$.\n\nFurthermore, it is a well-known deficiency of high-degree global polynomial interpolation that it is prone to large oscillations, particularly near the ends of the interpolation interval (Runge's phenomenon). A local perturbation in the data can induce or exacerbate these oscillations across the entire domain. Such oscillations in $y(\\tau)$ and its derivative $y'(\\tau)$ can lead to economically unrealistic behavior in the forward curve $f(\\tau) = y(\\tau) + \\tau y'(\\tau)$. Specifically, $f(\\tau)$ may become negative for certain maturities $\\tau > 0$, which implies an arbitrage opportunity. A non-negative forward curve is a necessary condition for monotonic discounting, since the derivative of the discount factor is $P'(\\tau) = -f(\\tau)P(\\tau) \\le 0$ requires $f(\\tau) \\ge 0$ (as $P(\\tau) > 0$). Global polynomial interpolation provides no guarantee that this no-arbitrage condition will hold.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.

The effect is global, not local. This statement describes a property of local interpolation schemes, which is not what is being used.\n\n**B. The interpolated instantaneous forward curve generally changes at all maturities, not just near $\\tau_k$, because the coefficients of the global polynomial interpolation change; the change can introduce oscillations and even violate monotonic discounting unless additional shape or no-arbitrage constraints are imposed.**\n**Correct.** This statement accurately reflects our analysis. The change is global. Global polynomial interpolants are known to introduce spurious oscillations. These oscillations can lead to the forward curve $f(\\tau)$ becoming negative, which violates the no-arbitrage condition of non-negative forward rates and, consequently, the principle of monotonic discounting.\n\n**C. The interpolated instantaneous forward curve becomes flat beyond $\\tau_k$ (i.e., constant for all $\\tau \\ge \\tau_k$) because fixing the spot rate at $\\tau_k$ pins down the tail behavior of a polynomial interpolant.**\n**Incorrect.** A non-constant polynomial of degree $n \\ge 1$ cannot be constant over any interval.
