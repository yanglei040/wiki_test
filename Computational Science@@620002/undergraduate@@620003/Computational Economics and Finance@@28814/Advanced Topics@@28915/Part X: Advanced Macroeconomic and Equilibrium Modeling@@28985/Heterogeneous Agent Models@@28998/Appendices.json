The model combines a standard Markowitz-style portfolio choice problem with an adaptive learning dynamic, which is a common structure for heterogeneous agent models in finance. There are no scientific inconsistencies, contradictions, or critical ambiguities that would prevent a unique and meaningful solution. The minor ambiguity regarding the agent indexing `i mod 4` is resolved by adopting the standard computational convention of using a zero-based index derived from the one-based agent index, i.e., `(i-1) mod 4`, which aligns with the provided multiplier indices $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of the agent's optimal decision rule from first principles, and second, the description of the simulation algorithm constructed upon this rule.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Optimal Risky Asset Share**\n\nEach agent $i$ chooses the share of their wealth $x_{i,t} \\in [0,1]$ to invest in the risky asset to maximize a one-period mean-variance objective. The gross return on the agent's portfolio, $R_{p,i,t}$, is a weighted average of the safe asset gross return, $R_f$, and the risky asset gross return, $1+r_t$:\n$$\nR_{p,i,t} \\;=\\; (1-x_{i,t})R_f + x_{i,t}(1+r_t)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in terms of the excess return of the risky asset over the safe asset:\n$$\nR_{p,i,t} \\;=\\; R_f + x_{i,t}(1+r_t - R_f) \\;=\\; R_f + x_{i,t}(r_t - (R_f-1))\n$$\nLet $r_f = R_f-1$ be the net risk-free rate.\n$$\nR_{p,i,t} \\;=\\; R_f + x_{i,t}(r_t - r_f)\n$$\nThe agent's decision is made at time $t$ before $r_t$ is known. Therefore, the agent uses their subjective expectation $E_t[\\cdot]$ based on their belief $\\mu_{i,t}$ and the known variance $\\sigma^2$. The expected portfolio return is:\n$$\nE_t[R_{p,i,t}] \\;=\\; E_t[R_f + x_{i,t}(r_t - r_f)] \\;=\\; R_f + x_{i,t}(E_t[r_t] - r_f) \\;=\\; R_f + x_{i,t}(\\mu_{i,t} - r_f)\n$$\nThe variance of the portfolio return is:\n$$\nVar_t(R_{p,i,t}) \\;=\\; Var_t(R_f + x_{i,t}(r_t - r_f)) \\;=\\; Var_t(x_{i,t}r_t) \\;=\\; x_{i,t}^2 Var_t(r_t) \\;=\\; x_{i,t}^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nThe mean-variance objective function for agent $i$ is to maximize:\n$$\nU(x_{i,t}) \\;=\\; E_t[R_{p,i,t}] - \\frac{\\gamma_i}{2} Var_t(R_{p,i,t})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected value and variance:\n$$\nU(x_{i,t}) \\;=\\; \\left( R_f + x_{i,t}(\\mu_{i,t} - r_f) \\right) - \\frac{\\gamma_i}{2} x_{i,t}^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nThis is a concave quadratic function of $x_{i,t}$. To find the optimal unconstrained share, $x_{i,t}^*$, we take the first derivative with respect to $x_{i,t}$ and set it to zero (the first-order condition for a maximum):\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}x_{i,t}} \\;=\\; (\\mu_{i,t} - r_f) - \\gamma_i \\sigma^2 x_{i,t} \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nSolving for $x_{i,t}$:\n$$\nx_{i,t}^* \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mu_{i,t} - r_f}{\\gamma_i \\sigma^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mu_{i,t} - (R_f - 1)}{\\gamma_i \\sigma^2}\n$$\nThis is the classic Merton's share. The numerator represents the perceived excess net return of the risky asset, and the denominator is the product of risk aversion and return variance.\n\nThe problem specifies a no-short-selling and no-leverage constraint, meaning $x_{i,t}$ must lie in the interval $[0,1]$. The final optimal choice is the projection of the unconstrained solution $x_{i,t}^*$ onto this feasible set:\n$$\nx_{i,t} \\;=\\; \\max\\left(0, \\min\\left(1, x_{i,t}^*\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Simulation Algorithm**\n\nThe simulation models the economy over $T$ discrete time periods for a population of $N$ heterogeneous agents.

This final exercise provides a stylized model to explore the concept of endogenous risk, where market dynamics themselves create fragility. By simulating the behavior of a single, highly-leveraged trader subject to a maximum leverage constraint, you will witness firsthand how forced selling (deleveraging) in a downturn can amplify price crashes and generate large drawdowns, illustrating a fundamental mechanism behind financial crises [@problem_id:2399105].", "problem": "Consider a discrete-time market with heterogeneous agents trading a single risky asset over $T$ periods. Time is indexed by $t \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,T\\}$. There is a continuum of baseline liquidity providers who aggregate to a linear inverse demand around a fundamental signal, and a single leveraged agent. Let the fundamental signal be $v_t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, and let the traded price be $p_t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. The baseline liquidity is summarized by a reduced-form linear price impact coefficient $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ such that, at any period $t \\ge 1$, if the leveraged agent chooses a position $q_t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (measured in shares, with $q_t \\ge 0$ interpreted as a long position), the market-clearing price satisfies\n$$\np_t \\;=\\; v_t \\;+\\; \\alpha \\, q_t.\n$$\nThe leveraged agent has equity (wealth) $W_t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with initial equity $W_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, and enters period $t \\ge 1$ with $(p_{t-1}, q_{t-1}, W_{t-1})$. The agent faces a leverage constraint specified by a target leverage $L_{\\text{target}} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ and a maximum admissible leverage $L_{\\max} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. Leverage is defined as assets over equity, namely $\\ell_t = \\dfrac{p_t \\, q_t}{W_t}$ whenever $W_t > 0$. The agent is bankrupt and exits permanently if $W_t \\le 0$, in which case $q_s = 0$ and $p_s = v_s$ for all subsequent periods $s \\ge t$.\n\nEach period $t \\ge 1$ proceeds as follows. First, the fundamental updates deterministically to\n$$\nv_t \\;=\\; v_0 \\;+\\; A \\, \\sin\\!\\Big( \\dfrac{2\\pi t}{P} \\Big),\n$$\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ is the amplitude, $P \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the period, and the sine function is evaluated in radians. Next, before the leveraged agent trades, the pre-trade price is\n$$\np_t^{\\text{pre}} \\;=\\; v_t \\;+\\; \\alpha \\, q_{t-1}.\n$$\nThe agent’s interim equity (marked to $p_t^{\\text{pre}}$) is\n$$\nW_t' \\;=\\; W_{t-1} \\;+\\; q_{t-1} \\big( p_t^{\\text{pre}} - p_{t-1} \\big).\n$$\nIf $W_t' \\le 0$, the agent defaults immediately, and the period closes at $p_t = v_t$ with $q_t = 0$ and $W_t = 0$. If $W_t' > 0$, the agent compares pre-trade leverage $\\ell_t^{\\text{pre}} = \\dfrac{p_t^{\\text{pre}} \\, q_{t-1}}{W_t'}$ to $L_{\\max}$. If $\\ell_t^{\\text{pre}} > L_{\\max}$, the agent must deleverage to the maximum, setting a post-trade leverage target $m_t = L_{\\max}$. Otherwise, the agent aims for $m_t = \\min\\{L_{\\text{target}}, L_{\\max}\\}$. The agent then chooses $(q_t, p_t)$ to satisfy the market-clearing condition and the leverage target simultaneously:\n$$\np_t \\;=\\; v_t \\;+\\; \\alpha \\, q_t,\n\\qquad\np_t \\, q_t \\;=\\; m_t \\, W_t'.\n$$\nIf $m_t = 0$, this implies $q_t = 0$ and $p_t = v_t$.
