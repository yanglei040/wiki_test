We use these accounting identities to determine the unknown transfer from Government to Households, denoted by $x$.\n\nFirst, consider the Activities account. Its receipts are from Households consumption, Government consumption, Investment demand, and Exports. Its expenditures are Value Added to Factors, Indirect Taxes to Government, and Imports to Rest of World. Let Value Added be denoted by $VA$. The Activities account balance gives\n$$\n100 + 30 + 50 + 40 \\;=\\; VA + 10 + 60.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n220 \\;=\\; VA + 70 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; VA \\;=\\; 150.\n$$\n\nNext, consider the Factors account. Its only receipt is $VA$ from Activities, and its expenditures are Factor income to Households and repatriated factor income to Rest of World. Let the factor income to Households be $Y_{FH}$. Given repatriated factor income equals $0$, the Factors account balance gives\n$$\nVA \\;=\\; Y_{FH} + 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; Y_{FH} \\;=\\; 150.\n$$\n\nNow consider the Households account. Its receipts are factor income from Factors, $Y_{FH}$, and transfers from Government, $x$. Its expenditures are consumption to Activities, direct taxes to Government, and household saving to Savings–Investment. The Households account balance implies\n$$\nY_{FH} + x \\;=\\; 100 + 50 + 20.\n$$\nSubstituting $Y_{FH} = 150$,\n$$\n150 + x \\;=\\; 170 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; x \\;=\\; 20.\n$$\n\nWe can cross-check using the Government account. Government receipts are indirect taxes from Activities and direct taxes from Households, and Government expenditures are government consumption to Activities, transfers to Households, and government saving. The Government account balance implies\n$$\n10 + 50 \\;=\\; 30 + x + 10.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n60 \\;=\\; 40 + x \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; x \\;=\\; 20,\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the value obtained from the Households account.\n\nFor completeness, we can also verify the external and savings balances. The Rest of World account has receipts equal to imports plus repatriated factor income, and expenditures equal to exports plus foreign saving, denoted $FS$. The Rest of World balance is\n$$\n60 + 0 \\;=\\; 40 + FS \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; FS \\;=\\; 20.\n$$\nThe Savings–Investment account receives household saving, government saving, and foreign saving, and spends on investment demand:\n$$\n20 + 10 + 20 \\;=\\; 50,\n$$\nwhich holds. Therefore, with $x = 20$, all accounts balance simultaneously.\n\nHence, the unique transfer from Government to Households that balances the SAM is\n$$\nx \\;=\\; 20.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "2380424"}, {"introduction": "After a policy is simulated, a CGE model produces a wealth of data, typically as percentage changes across many variables.
