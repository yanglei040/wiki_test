The global clustering coefficient $C$ (transitivity) of an undirected simple graph is defined as $C = \\dfrac{3 T}{W}$, where $T$ is the number of triangles in the graph and $W$ is the number of connected triples of vertices.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, allowing for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed with a systematic calculation of the financial brittleness index $B$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in five sequential steps: ($1$) computing the network's global clustering coefficient $C$, ($2$) computing the system's aggregate leverage $\\bar{L}$, ($3$) normalizing these two measures, ($4$) calibrating the brittleness index formula, and ($5$) computing the final value of $B$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the network topology to find the global clustering coefficient, $C = \\frac{3T}{W}$. The network consists of $N=5$ vertices (banks) $\\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$ and the edge set $\\{AB, AC, BC, BD, CD, DE\\}$.\n$T$ is the number of triangles (complete subgraphs of $3$ vertices). By inspection of the edge set:\n-   The vertex set $\\{A, B, C\\}$ forms a triangle because the edges $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ are all present.\n-   The vertex set $\\{B, C, D\\}$ forms a triangle because the edges $BC$, $BD$, and $CD$ are all present.\nNo other combination of three vertices forms a triangle. Therefore, the number of triangles is $T=2$.\n\n$W$ is the number of connected triples, which are paths of length $2$. The number of such paths centered at a vertex $v$ is given by $\\binom{d(v)}{2}$, where $d(v)$ is the degree of vertex $v$. We first compute the degrees of all vertices:\n-   $d(A) = 2$ (connected to $B, C$)\n-   $d(B) = 3$ (connected to $A, C, D$)\n-   $d(C) = 3$ (connected to $A, B, D$)\n-   $d(D) = 3$ (connected to $B, C, E$)\n-   $d(E) = 1$ (connected to $D$)\nThe total number of connected triples is the sum over all vertices:\n$$W = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C,D,E\\}} \\binom{d(i)}{2} = \\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{1}{2}$$\n$$W = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 10$$\nNow, we can compute the global clustering coefficient:\n$$C = \\frac{3T}{W} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\n\nSecond, we compute the aggregate leverage $\\bar{L}$. First, we find the leverage $L_i = \\frac{A_i}{E_i}$ for each bank:\n-   $L_A = \\frac{A_A}{E_A} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10$\n-   $L_B = \\frac{A_B}{E_B} = \\frac{150}{12.5} = 12$\n-   $L_C = \\frac{A_C}{E_C} = \\frac{120}{15} = 8$\n-   $L_D = \\frac{A_D}{E_D} = \\frac{80}{8} = 10$\n-   $L_E = \\frac{A_E}{E_E} = \\frac{50}{10} = 5$\nNext, we determine the asset-weighted average. The total assets in the system are:\n$$\\sum_{j} A_j = A_A + A_B + A_C + A_D + A_E = 100 + 150 + 120 + 80 + 50 = 500$$\nThe weights $\\omega_i = \\frac{A_i}{\\sum_j A_j}$ are:\n-   $\\omega_A = \\frac{100}{500} = 0.2$\n-   $\\omega_B = \\frac{150}{500} = 0.3$\n-   $\\omega_C = \\frac{120}{500} = 0.24$\n-   $\\omega_D = \\frac{80}{500} = 0.16$\n-   $\\omega_E = \\frac{50}{500} = 0.1$\nThe aggregate leverage $\\bar{L}$ is the weighted sum:\n$$\\bar{L} = \\sum_{i} \\omega_i L_i = (0.2)(10) + (0.3)(12) + (0.24)(8) + (0.16)(10) + (0.1)(5)$$\n$$\\bar{L} = 2.0 + 3.6 + 1.92 + 1.6 + 0.5 = 9.62$$\n\nThird, we normalize the computed values $C$ and $\\bar{L}$ using the given anchor states: the \"safe\" anchor $(C_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{S}}) = (0, 5)$ and the \"risky\" anchor $(C_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{R}}) = (0.6, 15)$.\nThe normalized clustering measure is:\n$$x_C = \\frac{C - C_{\\mathrm{S}}}{C_{\\mathrm{R}} - C_{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{0.6 - 0}{0.6 - 0} = 1$$\nThe normalized leverage measure is:\n$$x_L = \\frac{\\bar{L} - \\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{S}}}{\\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{R}} - \\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{9.62 - 5}{15 - 5} = \\frac{4.62}{10} = 0.462$$\n\nFourth, we calibrate the brittleness index $B = \\gamma + \\lambda(w x_L + (1-w) x_C)$ using the boundary conditions.\nAt the safe anchor, $(x_C, x_L)=(0,0)$ and $B=0.2$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$0.2 = \\gamma + \\lambda(w \\cdot 0 + (1-w) \\cdot 0) \\implies \\gamma = 0.2$$\nAt the risky anchor, $(x_C, x_L)=(1,1)$ and $B=0.8$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$0.8 = \\gamma + \\lambda(w \\cdot 1 + (1-w) \\cdot 1) = \\gamma + \\lambda$$\nUsing $\\gamma = 0.2$, we solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$0.8 = 0.2 + \\lambda \\implies \\lambda = 0.6$$\nThe calibrated brittleness index formula is $B = 0.2 + 0.6(w x_L + (1-w) x_C)$.\n\nFifth, we compute the final value of $B$ for the given network. We use the calculated normalized values $x_C=1$ and $x_L=0.462$, and the prescribed weight $w = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.6 \\left( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) x_L + \\left(1-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) x_C \\right)$$\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.6 \\left( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)(0.462) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(1) \\right)$$\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.6 \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 0.462 + 1}{3} \\right)$$\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.2 (0.924 + 1)$$\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.2 (1.924)$$\n$$B = 0.2 + 0.3848 = 0.5848$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

All necessary parameters and dynamics are provided with sufficient clarity and mathematical rigor. The problem is therefore valid, and a deterministic solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in tracking the evolution of bank equities under an initial shock and subsequent contagion effects. The system is defined by a set of $N$ banks, their interbank obligations, and their holdings of external assets. The financial structure is governed by the fundamental balance sheet identity for each bank $i$:\n$$\nq_i = A_i - P_i\n$$\nwhere $q_i$ is the equity, $A_i$ are the total assets, and $P_i$ are the total liabilities. A bank is considered to be in default if its equity becomes negative, $q_i < 0$, consistent with the principle of limited liability.\n\nThe total assets $A_i$ of bank $i$ are composed of its external assets $e_i$ and its interbank assets $\\bar{a}_i$, which are claims on other banks. The total liabilities $P_i$ are its interbank liabilities $\\bar{p}_i$, which are obligations to other banks. The interbank exposures are encoded in the liabilities matrix $\\mathbf{L}$, where $L_{ij}$ represents the amount bank $i$ owes to bank $j$.\nThus, for each bank $i$, we can write:\n- Total interbank liabilities: $\\bar{p}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^N L_{ij}$\n- Total interbank assets: $\\bar{a}_i = \\sum_{k=1}^N L_{ki}$\n\nThe initial, pre-shock equity of bank $i$ is therefore:\n$$\nq_{i, \\text{pre-shock}} = e_i + \\bar{a}_i - \\bar{p}_i\n$$\n\nFor the given network with $N=3$:\n- Liabilities matrix: $\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 70 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 80 \\\\ 30 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- External assets: $\\mathbf{e} = \\begin{bmatrix} 60 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nWe first compute the vector of total interbank liabilities, $\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}$, by summing the rows of $\\mathbf{L}$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0+70+0 \\\\ 0+0+80 \\\\ 30+0+0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 70 \\\\ 80 \\\\ 30 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the vector of total interbank assets, $\\bar{\\mathbf{a}}$, by summing the columns of $\\mathbf{L}$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathbf{a}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0+0+30 \\\\ 70+0+0 \\\\ 0+80+0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 30 \\\\ 70 \\\\ 80 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial, pre-shock equity vector $\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{pre-shock}}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{pre-shock}} = \\mathbf{e} + \\bar{\\mathbf{a}} - \\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 60 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 30 \\\\ 70 \\\\ 80 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 70 \\\\ 80 \\\\ 30 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 20 \\\\ 20 \\\\ 55 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAll banks are initially solvent. The contagion process begins with an exogenous shock $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ to external assets.\n\nThe contagion mechanism depends critically on the loss-given-default, which is determined by the recoveries on the regulated ($r_R=0.9$) and shadow ($r_S=0.2$) layers. The fraction of obligations shifted to the shadow layer is $s$. When a bank defaults, its creditors incur a loss. The loss is magnified by the effective loss multiplier, $m(s)$:\n$$\nm(s) = (1-s)(1-r_R) + s(1-r_S) = (1-s)(1-0.9) + s(1-0.2) = 0.1(1-s) + 0.8s = 0.1 + 0.7s\n$$\nThe cascade proceeds in discrete time steps.\n\n**Step 0: Initial Shock**\nThe initial post-shock equity vector $\\mathbf{q}^{(0)}$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{q}_{\\text{pre-shock}} - \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}\n$$\nAny bank $i$ with $q_i^{(0)} < 0$ is declared defaulted.\n\n**Step $t \\ge 1$: Contagion**\nIf a set of banks $D_{t-1}$ newly defaulted at step $t-1$, then for each non-defaulted bank $i$, its equity is updated to reflect losses from these new defaults:\n$$\nq_i^{(t)} = q_i^{(t-1)} - \\sum_{j \\in D_{t-1}} m(s) L_{ji}\n$$\nAny bank $i$ for which $q_i^{(t)}$ falls below zero becomes a new defaulter at step $t$.

The model is mathematically rigorous and widely accepted. The premises are factually sound within this framework.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the minimum of a non-negative quantity, $\\Delta C$, subject to a set of linear inequalities. This structure is well-posed. The conditions for existence and uniqueness of a solution are well-defined by the problem's constraints.\n- **Objective**: All terms are defined with mathematical precision. The instructions are clear and unambiguous, free of subjective language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary data ($L, x, i, S_0$) and definitions to formulate a solution. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical exercise in the context of a recognized economic model. A solution will now be formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the minimum non-negative capital injection, $\\Delta C_{\\min}$, required to achieve network stabilization. Stabilization is defined by the clearing payment vector $p$ being equal to the total nominal liabilities vector $\\bar{p}$, that is, $p = \\bar{p}$.\n\nThe clearing process is governed by the fixed-point equation:\n$$\np = \\min\\left\\{\\bar{p}, \\Pi^\\top p + x''\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere the minimum is taken component-wise. For stabilization to occur, we must have $p = \\bar{p}$. Substituting this condition into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\min\\left\\{\\bar{p}, \\Pi^\\top \\bar{p} + x''\\right\\}\n$$\nThis equality holds if and only if for every institution $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the following inequality is satisfied:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_k \\le (\\Pi^\\top \\bar{p})_k + x''_k\n$$\nThis system of $n$ linear inequalities represents the condition that each institution's total available funds (incoming payments from other institutions, $\\Pi^\\top \\bar{p}$, plus its own post-injection external assets, $x''$) are sufficient to cover its total nominal liabilities, $\\bar{p}$. Let us expand the matrix-vector product term:\n$$\n(\\Pi^\\top \\bar{p})_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\Pi^\\top)_{kj} \\bar{p}_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{jk} \\bar{p}_j\n$$\nThe post-injection external assets vector $x''$ depends on the initial shock $S_0$ and the capital injection $\\Delta C$, both applied to a single node $i$. Let the shocked node have index $i_{shock}$. The post-shock, pre-injection vector is $x'$.\n$$\nx'_k = x_k \\text{ for } k \\ne i_{shock} \\text{ and } x'_{i_{shock}} = \\max(x_{i_{shock}}-S_0, 0).\n$$\nThe post-injection vector is $x''$.\n$$\nx''_k = x'_k \\text{ for } k \\ne i_{shock} \\text{ and } x''_{i_{shock}} = x'_{i_{shock}} + \\Delta C.\n$$\nThe system of stability inequalities is $\\bar{p} \\le \\Pi^\\top \\bar{p} + x''$.\n\nFor any node $k \\ne i_{shock}$, the stability condition is:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_k \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{jk} \\bar{p}_j + x_k'\n$$\nThis condition is independent of the injection $\\Delta C$. Let us define the \"solvency gap\" for each node $k$, post-shock and pre-injection, as:\n$$\nG_k = \\bar{p}_k - \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{jk} \\bar{p}_j + x'_k \\right)\n$$\nFor stabilization to be possible by only injecting capital into node $i_{shock}$, all other nodes $k \\ne i_{shock}$ must be solvent. That is, for all $k \\ne i_{shock}$, it must be that $G_k \\le 0$. If there exists any $k \\ne i_{shock}$ such that $G_k > 0$, then no amount of capital injected into node $i_{shock}$ can remedy the shortfall at node $k$. In this case, stabilization is impossible, and the result is $-1.0$.\n\nFor the shocked node $k = i_{shock}$, the stability condition is:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_{i_{shock}} \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{j,i_{shock}} \\bar{p}_j + x''_{i_{shock}}\n$$\nSubstituting $x''_{i_{shock}} = x'_{i_{shock}} + \\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_{i_{shock}} \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{j,i_{shock}} \\bar{p}_j + x'_{i_{shock}} + \\Delta C\n$$\nWe can rearrange this inequality to solve for the required injection $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\ge \\bar{p}_{i_{shock}} - \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pi_{j,i_{shock}} \\bar{p}_j + x'_{i_{shock}} \\right) = G_{i_{shock}}\n$$\nSince the capital injection must be non-negative ($\\Delta C \\ge 0$), the minimum capital injection required is $\\Delta C_{\\min} = \\max\\{0, G_{i_{shock}}\\}$.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Given $L$, $x$, $i_{shock}$ (1-based), and $S_0$. Convert $i_{shock}$ to a 0-based index.\n2.  Compute the vector of total nominal liabilities $\\bar{p}$ from $L$: $\\bar{p}_i = \\sum_j L_{ij}$.\n3.  Compute the relative liability matrix $\\Pi$. For each row $i$: if $\\bar{p}_i > 0$, $\\Pi_{ij} = L_{ij} / \\bar{p}_i$; otherwise $\\Pi_{ij} = 0$.\n4.  Compute the post-shock external asset vector $x'$. Let $i_{idx} = i_{shock} - 1$.\n    - $x'_{i_{idx}} = \\max\\{x_{i_{idx}} - S_0, 0\\}$.\n    - For all $k \\ne i_{idx}$, $x'_k = x_k$.\n5.  Compute the vector of total expected incoming payments from other institutions, assuming full repayment: $v = \\Pi^\\top \\bar{p}$.\n6.  For each institution $k=0, \\dots, n-1$, compute the solvency gap $G_k = \\bar{p}_k - (v_k + x'_k)$.\n7.  Check for impossibility. For each $k \\ne i_{idx}$, if $G_k > 0$, stabilization is impossible. Return $-1.0$.\n8.
