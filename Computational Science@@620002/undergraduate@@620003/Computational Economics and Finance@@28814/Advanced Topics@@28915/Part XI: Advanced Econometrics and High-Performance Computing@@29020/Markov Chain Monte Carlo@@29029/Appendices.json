The performance is to be characterized by the acceptance rate, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the generated chain, and the resulting effective sample size (ESS).\n\nThe objective of any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is to generate a sequence of draws $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ whose distribution converges to a target distribution, in this case the posterior $\\pi(\\theta)$. For the estimates derived from this chain (e.g., the posterior mean $\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T \\theta_t$) to be precise, we require a large effective sample size. The ESS is defined as\n$$\n\\text{ESS} = \\frac{T}{1 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\rho(k)} = \\frac{T}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the nominal sample size and $\\tau = 1 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\rho(k)$ is the integrated autocorrelation time (IAT). To maximize ESS for a fixed chain length $T$, one must minimize the IAT. This is achieved when the autocorrelations $\\rho(k)$ are small and decay to zero rapidly as the lag $k$ increases. The efficiency of the sampler is thus inversely related to the persistence in the chain.\n\nThe RWM algorithm uses a proposal $\\theta' = \\theta_t + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s^2)$. The parameter $s$ is a crucial tuning parameter that governs the algorithm's efficiency. Let us analyze the two specified regimes.\n\nCase (i): The proposal scale $s$ is too large.\nIn this regime, the proposed jump $\\varepsilon$ is large. Since the target posterior $\\pi(\\theta)$ is unimodal and bell-shaped, it concentrates its mass in a relatively small region around the mode. A large jump from the current state $\\theta_t$ (which, under stationarity, is likely in a region of high posterior density) will very probably land the proposal $\\theta'$ in the tails of the distribution, where $\\pi(\\theta')$ is very small.\nConsequently, the acceptance ratio $\\frac{\\pi(\\theta')}{\\pi(\\theta_t)}$ will be much less than $1$. The acceptance probability $\\alpha(\\theta_t, \\theta') = \\min\\{1, \\frac{\\pi(\\theta')}{\\pi(\\theta_t)}\\}$ will therefore be very low.\nMost proposals are rejected, which means the chain remains at its current state for many consecutive iterations: $\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t$. This behavior—getting \"stuck\"—induces extremely high positive correlation between consecutive states. Thus, the lag-$1$ autocorrelation $\\rho(1)$ will be very close to $1$, and the entire ACF $\\rho(k)$ will decay exceedingly slowly. This leads to a very large IAT and a very small ESS. The chain explores the posterior space very inefficiently.\n\nCase (ii): The proposal scale $s$ is too small.\nIn this regime, the proposed jump $\\varepsilon$ is small. The proposal $\\theta'$ will be very close to the current state $\\theta_t$. As long as the posterior density $\\pi(\\theta)$ is continuous (which is a standard assumption), $\\pi(\\theta')$ will be very close to $\\pi(\\theta_t)$.\nThe acceptance ratio $\\frac{\\pi(\\theta')}{\\pi(\\theta_t)}$ will be very close to $1$. The acceptance probability $\\alpha(\\theta_t, \\theta')$ will therefore be very high, approaching $1$ as $s \\to 0$.\nAlthough most proposals are accepted, each step is minuscule. The chain moves through the parameter space like a slow diffusion process. $\\theta_{t+1}$ will be only marginally different from $\\theta_t$. This again implies that consecutive states are highly correlated. The lag-$1$ autocorrelation $\\rho(1)$ will again be very close to $1$, and the ACF $\\rho(k)$ will decay very slowly. This also leads to a large IAT and a small ESS. The chain explores the posterior space very inefficiently, but for a different reason than in Case (i).\n\nIn summary, both extremes of the proposal scale $s$ are detrimental to sampling efficiency. The highest efficiency (minimal IAT, maximal ESS) is achieved for an intermediate value of $s$ that balances the acceptance rate and the step size, allowing the chain to explore the full support of the posterior distribution effectively. Optimal acceptance rates are known to be approximately $0.44$ for one-dimensional problems like this one.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\nA. In both regimes, $\\rho(1)$ is large and positive with slow decay in $k$, but the acceptance rates differ: with $s$ too large, acceptance is very low and the chain exhibits repeated states; with $s$ too small, acceptance is very high but successive states are very close. In both cases, the integrated autocorrelation time is large and the effective sample size is small, improving only at intermediate $s$.\nThis statement accurately summarizes the behavior in both regimes as derived above. It correctly identifies high positive autocorrelation as the common pathology, but correctly distinguishes the mechanisms: low acceptance and getting stuck for large $s$, and high acceptance but tiny steps for small $s$. It correctly concludes that both scenarios lead to poor ESS, which is optimized at an intermediate $s$. This statement is consistent with the theory of MCMC.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. With $s$ too large, the chain frequently bounces back and forth, yielding negative $\\rho(1)$; with $s$ too small, most moves are accepted, so $\\rho(k) \\approx 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$ and the effective sample size is maximized.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, for RWM, large $s$ does not lead to \"bouncing back and forth\" and negative $\\rho(1)$. It leads to rejections and staying put, which produces high *positive* autocorrelation. Negative autocorrelation is more characteristic of other samplers, like Gibbs or HMC with specific parameterizations. Second, for small $s$, the chain moves slowly, so $\\theta_t$ and $\\theta_{t+k}$ are highly correlated for small $k$, meaning $\\rho(k)$ is close to $1$, not $0$. This minimizes, not maximizes, the effective sample size.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The ACF decays fastest when $s$ is extremely large because large jumps decorrelate the chain, and acceptance is high in that case, leading to the largest effective sample size.\nThis statement is factually wrong. When $s$ is extremely large, the acceptance rate is extremely *low*, not high. While a successful large jump is decorrelating, the chain's behavior is dominated by the far more frequent event of rejection. The result is a slow-mixing chain with an ACF that decays very slowly, not fastest. This leads to the smallest, not largest, ESS.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. For a stationary run, the ACF $\\rho(k)$ is invariant to the choice of $s$; only the burn-in length is affected by $s$.\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The proposal scale $s$ defines the transition kernel of the Markov chain. While the stationary distribution $\\pi(\\theta)$ is invariant to $s$ (by construction of the M-H algorithm), the dynamic properties of the chain, such as its rate of convergence and its autocorrelation structure under stationarity, are critically dependent on $s$. Tuning $s$ is precisely the exercise of optimizing these dynamic properties, which are measured by the ACF.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. With symmetric proposals, the acceptance rate equals $0.5$ for any $s$, implying that any observed differences in $\\rho(k)$ across choices of $s$ are due to Monte Carlo error rather than step-size selection.\nThis statement is false. The acceptance rate is not a constant $0.5$. It is a function of the proposal scale $s$ via the ratio $\\pi(\\theta')/\\pi(\\theta_t)$. There is a well-known theoretical literature on optimal acceptance rates, which are not $0.5$ (e.g., $\\approx 0.234$ in high dimensions, $\\approx 0.44$ in one dimension), but these are *targets* to be achieved by *tuning* $s$, not fixed constants. Observed differences in $\\rho(k)$ are a direct and real consequence of the choice of $s$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A provides a correct and complete description of the phenomenon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2408760"}, {"introduction": "Now let's move from theory to a complete, hands-on application.

Assume a Gamma prior for $ \\gamma $ with shape $ k $ and scale $ \\theta $, i.e., $ \\gamma \\sim \\text{Gamma}(k,\\theta) $ supported on $ (0,\\infty) $. Use a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm with a random walk on the log-parameter $z = \\log \\gamma$ to sample from the posterior of $ \\gamma $ given a sample $ \\{(G_t,R_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^T $.

Ensure scientific realism by adhering strictly to the DGP and the Bayesian construction described above.", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed exercise in Bayesian estimation for a structural model from computational economics. It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and provides all necessary information for a unique, verifiable solution. Thus, we may proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe fundamental economic relationship is the Euler equation for a representative agent with Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences. The utility function is $u(C) = \\frac{C^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The agent's first-order condition for optimal intertemporal consumption and asset allocation implies the no-arbitrage condition $\\mathbb{E}_t [m_{t+1} R_{t+1}] = 1$, where $R_{t+1}$ is the gross return on an asset and $m_{t+1}$ is the stochastic discount factor (SDF). For CRRA utility, the SDF is given by $m_{t+1} = \\beta \\left( \\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} \\right)^{-\\gamma}$, where $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor. Defining gross consumption growth as $G_t = C_{t+1}/C_t$, the condition becomes $\\mathbb{E}_t[\\beta G_t^{-\\gamma} R_{t+1}] = 1$.\n\nTo render this model empirically tractable with a finite sample of noisy data $D = \\{(G_t, R_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^T$, we adopt the specified measurement equation:\n$$\n\\beta \\, G_t^{-\\gamma} \\, R_{t+1} - 1 = \\varepsilon_t, \\quad \\varepsilon_t \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_e^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_e^2$ is the known variance of the Euler equation errors. This specification implies a Gaussian likelihood for the observed data. For a given $\\gamma$, the likelihood of a single observation $(G_t, R_{t+1})$ is the probability density of a Normal random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_e^2$ evaluated at the residual $\\varepsilon_t$. The log-likelihood for the entire sample is therefore:\n$$\n\\log L(\\gamma | D) = C_L - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_e^2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\left( \\beta G_t^{-\\gamma} R_{t+1} - 1 \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $C_L$ is a constant that does not depend on $\\gamma$.\n\nWe are to perform Bayesian inference on $\\gamma$. The prior distribution for $\\gamma$ is specified as a Gamma distribution, $\\gamma \\sim \\text{Gamma}(k,\\theta)$, with probability density function:\n$$\np(\\gamma|k, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^k} \\gamma^{k-1} e^{-\\gamma/\\theta}, \\quad \\text{for } \\gamma > 0\n$$\nThe log-prior, up to an additive constant, is:\n$$\n\\log p(\\gamma|k,\\theta) = C_p + (k-1)\\log\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\theta}\n$$\nBy Bayes' theorem, the posterior density of $\\gamma$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior, $p(\\gamma| D) \\propto L(\\gamma|D) p(\\gamma|k,\\theta)$. The log-posterior is thus proportional to the sum of their logarithms:\n$$\n\\log p(\\gamma|D) \\propto (k-1)\\log\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_e^2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\left( \\beta G_t^{-\\gamma} R_{t+1} - 1 \\right)^2\n$$\n\nThe estimation will be performed using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To accommodate the constraint $\\gamma > 0$, we perform a change of variables to $z = \\log\\gamma \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$, which implies $\\gamma = e^z$. The posterior density for the transformed parameter $z$ is given by $p(z|D) = p(\\gamma=e^z|D) \\left| \\frac{d\\gamma}{dz} \\right|$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $\\left| \\frac{d(e^z)}{dz} \\right| = e^z$. The log-posterior for $z$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\log p(z|D) \\propto \\log p(\\gamma=e^z|D) + \\log(e^z) = \\log p(\\gamma=e^z|D) + z\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma = e^z$ into our expression for the log-posterior of $\\gamma$ and adding the Jacobian term $z$ yields the target log-density for our sampler:\n$$\n\\pi(z) \\equiv \\log p(z|D) \\propto (k-1)z - \\frac{e^z}{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_e^2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\left( \\beta G_t^{-e^z} R_{t+1} - 1 \\right)^2 + z\n$$\nSimplifying, we get the final form of the kernel which we must evaluate:\n$$\n\\pi(z) \\propto kz - \\frac{e^z}{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_e^2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\left( \\beta R_{t+1} G_t^{-e^z} - 1 \\right)^2\n$$\nThe Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a random-walk proposal is implemented as follows:\n$1$. Initialize the chain at $z^{(0)}$. A reasonable starting point is the logarithm of the prior mean, $z^{(0)} = \\log(k\\theta)$.\n$2$. For each step $i=1, \\dots, N$:\n    a. Propose a new state $z'$ from a symmetric proposal distribution: $z' = z^{(i-1)} + \\eta$, where $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s^2)$.\n    b. Calculate the acceptance ratio $A = \\frac{p(z'|D)}{p(z^{(i-1)}|D)}$. In log terms, this is $\\log A = \\pi(z') - \\pi(z^{(i-1)})$.\n    c. Accept the proposal (set $z^{(i)} = z'$) with probability $\\alpha = \\min(1, A)$. Otherwise, reject (set $z^{(i)} = z^{(i-1)}$).\n$3$. The resulting sequence $\\{\\gamma^{(i)} = e^{z^{(i)}}\\}_{i=1}^N$ is a set of draws from the posterior distribution of $\\gamma$.\n$4$. After discarding the initial burn-in samples $\\{ \\gamma^{(i)} \\}_{i=1}^B$, the posterior mean of $\\gamma$ is estimated by the sample mean of the remaining draws:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[\\gamma|D] = \\frac{1}{N-B} \\sum_{i=B+1}^N \\gamma^{(i)}\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases, using synthetic data generated according to the specified Data Generating Process and distinct random number generator seeds for data generation and MCMC sampling to ensure reproducibility.
