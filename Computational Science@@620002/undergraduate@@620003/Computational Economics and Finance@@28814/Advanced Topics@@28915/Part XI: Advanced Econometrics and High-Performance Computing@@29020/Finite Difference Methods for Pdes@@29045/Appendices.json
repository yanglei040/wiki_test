We will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, the transformation of the PDE, and second, its discretization to find the specified coefficient.\n\n**Part 1: Transformation of the PDE**\n\nWe begin with the Black-Scholes equation for a contingent claim value $V(S,t)$:\n$$V_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} S^{2} V_{SS} + (r - q) S V_{S} - r V = 0$$\nWe introduce the change of variables $x = \\ln(S)$ and define $u(x,t) = V(S,t)$. We use the chain rule to express the derivatives of $V$ with respect to $S$ and $t$ in terms of derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$ and $t$.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives with respect to $S$:\n$$V_{S} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} = u_{x} \\frac{1}{S}$$\n$$V_{SS} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S} \\left( u_{x} \\frac{1}{S} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{x}}{\\partial S} \\right) \\frac{1}{S} - u_{x} \\frac{1}{S^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{x}}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} \\right) \\frac{1}{S} - \\frac{u_{x}}{S^{2}} = \\left( u_{xx} \\frac{1}{S} \\right) \\frac{1}{S} - \\frac{u_{x}}{S^{2}} = \\frac{1}{S^{2}} (u_{xx} - u_{x})$$\nThe derivative with respect to $t$ is straightforward, as $x$ does not depend on $t$:\n$$V_{t} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = u_{t}$$\nSubstituting these into the Black-Scholes PDE yields:\n$$u_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} S^{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{S^{2}} (u_{xx} - u_{x}) \\right] + (r - q) S \\left[ u_{x} \\frac{1}{S} \\right] - r u = 0$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling terms:\n$$u_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} (u_{xx} - u_{x}) + (r - q) u_{x} - r u = 0$$\nGrouping the terms by the order of the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$:\n$$u_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} u_{xx} + \\left( r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\right) u_{x} - r u = 0$$\nNext, we introduce the time-to-maturity variable $\\tau = T - t$. This implies $t = T - \\tau$, and thus $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} = -1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}$. Therefore, $u_{t} = -u_{\\tau}$.\nSubstituting this into the transformed PDE:\n$$-u_{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} u_{xx} + \\left( r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\right) u_{x} - r u = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for $u_{\\tau}$, we obtain the forward-in-$\\tau$ equation:\n$$u_{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} u_{xx} + \\left( r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\right) u_{x} - r u$$\nComparing this to the specified form $u_{\\tau} = a\\,u_{xx} + b\\,u_{x} - r\\,u$, we identify the constant coefficients:\n$$a = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$$\n$$b = r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$$\n\n**Part 2: Crank-Nicolson Discretization**\n\nWe now discretize the PDE $u_{\\tau} = a\\,u_{xx} + b\\,u_{x} - r\\,u$. Let $u_{i}^{n}$ denote the numerical approximation of $u(x_{i}, \\tau^{n})$. The Crank-Nicolson method is an implicit scheme that averages the spatial operator over the time levels $n$ and $n+1$:\n$$\\frac{u_{i}^{n+1} - u_{i}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( a\\,u_{xx} + b\\,u_{x} - r\\,u \\right)_{i}^{n+1} + \\left( a\\,u_{xx} + b\\,u_{x} - r\\,u \\right)_{i}^{n} \\right]$$\nWe use standard second-order central difference approximations for the spatial derivatives $u_{x}$ and $u_{xx}$:\n$$u_{x} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x}$$\n$$u_{xx} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_{i} + u_{i-1}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}}$$\nSubstituting these into the Crank-Nicolson formula and reordering to group terms at time level $n+1$ on the left-hand side (LHS) and terms at $n$ on the right-hand side (RHS):\n$$u_{i}^{n+1} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left[ a \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_{i}^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + b \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{2\\,\\Delta x} - r u_{i}^{n+1} \\right] = \\text{RHS}$$\nWe are only interested in the coefficients on the LHS. Let us organize the LHS to match the form $A\\,u_{i-1}^{n+1} + B\\,u_{i}^{n+1} + C\\,u_{i+1}^{n+1}$. We collect the coefficients for each nodal value $u_{j}^{n+1}$:\n\n-   For $u_{i-1}^{n+1}$: The coefficient is $A = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( \\frac{a}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} - \\frac{b}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\right)$.\n-   For $u_{i+1}^{n+1}$: The coefficient is $C = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( \\frac{a}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + \\frac{b}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\right)$.\n-   For $u_{i}^{n+1}$: The coefficient is obtained from the terms multiplying $u_{i}^{n+1}$.\n    $$B = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( a \\frac{-2}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} - r \\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( \\frac{2a}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + r \\right)$$\n\nThe question asks for the closed-form expression for the interior diagonal coefficient $B$. Simplifying the expression for $B$:\n$$B = 1 + \\frac{a\\,\\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + \\frac{r\\,\\Delta t}{2}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $a = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$ that we derived in Part 1:\n$$B = 1 + \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})\\,\\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + \\frac{r\\,\\Delta t}{2}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$B = 1 + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\,\\Delta t}{2(\\Delta x)^{2}} + \\frac{r\\,\\Delta t}{2}$$\nThis can be written more compactly by factoring out $\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$:\n$$B = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + r \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the coefficient $B$ as a function of the given parameters $\\sigma$, $r$, $\\Delta x$, and $\\Delta t$. Notice that the coefficient $B$ is independent of the dividend yield $q$, which only affects the advection term and thus the off-diagonal coefficients $A$ and $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} + r \\right)}$$", "id": "2393113"}, {"introduction": "While finding the option price is a primary goal, a finite difference grid holds a wealth of additional information crucial for risk management.

It is scientifically grounded and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) for a European call option. The PDE is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}(S,t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2}(S,t) + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}(S,t) - r V(S,t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $V(S,t)$ is the option price, $S$ is the underlying asset price, $t$ is time, $r$ is the risk-free rate, and $\\sigma$ is the volatility. The equation is defined on the domain $(S,t) \\in [0, S_{\\max}] \\times [0, T]$ with a terminal condition at time $T$, $V(S,T) = \\max(S-K, 0)$, and boundary conditions $V(0,t)=0$ and $V(S_{\\max},t) = S_{\\max} - Ke^{-r(T-t)}$.\n\nThis is a terminal value problem, which is typically solved by stepping backward in time from $t=T$ to $t=0$. To facilitate a standard forward-in-time numerical approach, we introduce a change of variable for time: $\\tau = T - t$. With this change, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}$, and the PDE transforms into an initial value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r V, \\quad \\text{for } \\tau \\in [0,T]\n$$\nwith the initial condition at $\\tau=0$ being $V(S,0) = \\max(S-K, 0)$. The boundary conditions become $V(0,\\tau) = 0$ and $V(S_{\\max},\\tau) = S_{\\max} - Ke^{-r\\tau}$.\n\nWe discretize this PDE on a uniform grid with $N_S+1$ spatial points $S_i = i\\Delta S$ for $i=0, \\dots, N_S$, and $N_t+1$ temporal points $\\tau_n = n\\Delta t$ for $n=0, \\dots, N_t$. Let $V_i^n$ denote the numerical approximation of $V(S_i, \\tau_n)$. We employ the Crank-Nicolson method, which is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate in both time and space. The scheme is formulated by averaging the spatial operator at time steps $n$ and $n+1$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_i^{n+1} - V_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (\\mathcal{L}_h V^{n+1})_i + (\\mathcal{L}_h V^n)_i \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_h$ is the discretized spatial operator. Using second-order central differences for the spatial derivatives, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the unknown values $V_i^{n+1}$ on the left-hand side and the known values $V_i^n$ on the right-hand side.

The matrix $A$ is constant through time and its diagonals are constructed from the coefficients $-l_i$, $d_i$, and $-u_i$. The right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}^n$ depends on the known values from the previous time step $\\mathbf{V}^n$. The boundary conditions are incorporated by modifying the equations for the first ($i=1$) and last ($i=N_S-1$) interior points. The condition $V_0^n=0$ simplifies the first equation. For the last equation, the known boundary value $V_{N_S}^{n+1} = S_{\\max} - K e^{-r\\tau_{n+1}}$ is moved to the right-hand side, adjusting the last element of the vector $\\mathbf{b}^n$.\n\nThe solution process begins at $\\tau=0$ ($t=T$) with the known terminal payoff.

This discrete convexity should be nonnegative for a convex function of $S$, and violations indicate oscillations. To quantify the effect of Rannacher smoothing in damping payoff-induced oscillations, compare the count of such convexity violations at the time level $t = T - \\Delta t$ between:\n- A single Crank–Nicolson step of size $\\Delta t$ taken backward from $t = T$.\n- Two Backward Euler half-steps of size $\\Delta t/2$ each, taken backward from $t = T$ to $t = T - \\Delta t$ (Rannacher smoothing).\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct the finite difference discretization as described above from first principles, using only central differences in space and the specified time-stepping choices.\n- Solve the American option linear complementarity problem at the needed time level using a projected iterative method so that the inequality constraint is satisfied at every grid point.\n- For each test case, compute an integer equal to\n$$\n\\text{diff} = \\left(\\text{number of convexity violations without smoothing at } t = T - \\Delta t\\right) - \\left(\\text{number with Rannacher smoothing at } t = T - \\Delta t\\right).\n$$\nA positive $\\text{diff}$ indicates that Rannacher smoothing reduced the oscillations relative to a plain Crank–Nicolson step.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets, where each tuple is $(K, r, \\sigma, T, S_{\\max}, N, M)$:\n- Test $1$: $(100, 0.05, 0.2, 0.25, 400, 120, 10)$\n- Test $2$: $(100, 0.03, 0.3, 0.5, 400, 80, 8)$\n- Test $3$: $(50, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, 200, 100, 10)$\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the tests above, for example, $[d_1,d_2,d_3]$, where each $d_i$ is the integer $\\text{diff}$ for test $i$. No physical units are required in the output. The numerical answer types must be integers. The computation should use only the given parameter values, and no user input is required.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-posed problem in computational finance concerning the valuation of an American put option and the analysis of numerical schemes. It is scientifically grounded in the Black-Scholes framework and mathematically sound. All parameters, boundary conditions, and objectives are clearly and objectively defined. The problem is complete and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the Black-Scholes linear complementarity problem for an American put option and to compare the numerical stability of two finite difference schemes. We are specifically asked to quantify the spurious oscillations that may arise from the non-smooth payoff function at expiry when using a standard Crank-Nicolson scheme, and to measure the damping effect of Rannacher smoothing.\n\nFirst, we transform the continuous Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) into a system of discrete equations. Let $V(S,t)$ be the option price. We discretize the asset price $S$ and time $t$ domains into a grid. The spatial grid is $S_j = j \\Delta S$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$, with $\\Delta S = S_{\\max}/N$. The time grid is $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, M$, with $\\Delta t = T/M$. We solve the problem by marching backward in time from the expiry date $t_M=T$ to $t_0=0$.\n\nThe spatial derivatives in the Black-Scholes operator, $\\mathcal{L}V = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r V$, are approximated using second-order central differences on the interior grid points $j=1, \\dots, N-1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\\bigg|_{S_j} \\approx \\frac{V_{j+1} - V_{j-1}}{2 \\Delta S}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2}\\bigg|_{S_j} \\approx \\frac{V_{j+1} - 2V_j + V_{j-1}}{(\\Delta S)^2}\n$$\nwhere $V_j(t)$ is the approximation of $V(S_j, t)$. Substituting these into the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ gives a discrete operator, which can be represented by a tridiagonal matrix $A$ of size $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$. The action of this matrix on the vector of interior option prices $\\mathbf{V} = [V_1, \\dots, V_{N-1}]^T$ is given by $(A\\mathbf{V})_i = \\alpha_{i+1} V_{i} + \\beta_{i+1} V_{i+1} + \\gamma_{i+1} V_{i+2}$ (using 0-based vector indexing for indices $i=0, \\dots, N-2$). The coefficients are:\n$$\n\\alpha_j = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 j^2 - \\frac{1}{2}r j, \\quad \\beta_j = -\\sigma^2 j^2 - r, \\quad \\gamma_j = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 j^2 + \\frac{1}{2}r j\n$$\nfor $j=1, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nThe Dirichlet boundary conditions $V(0,t) = K$ and $V(S_{\\max},t) = 0$ are incorporated into the system. The term involving $V_0=K$ affects the equation for $j=1$, introducing an affine term. The term involving $V_N=0$ for $j=N-1$ vanishes.\n\nThe time derivative is discretized using a $\\theta$-scheme, which allows us to represent both the Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler methods. Marching from time level $n$ to $n-1$ (backward in time), the PDE $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\mathcal{L}V = 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{V}^n - \\mathbf{V}^{n-1}}{\\Delta t} + (1-\\theta) (\\mathcal{A}\\mathbf{V}^n + \\mathbf{c}_b) + \\theta (\\mathcal{A}\\mathbf{V}^{n-1} + \\mathbf{c}_b) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{V}^n$ is the vector of prices at time $t_n$, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the matrix representing the discrete spatial operator, and $\\mathbf{c}_b$ is a vector for the boundary condition terms. Rearranging for the unknown $\\mathbf{V}^{n-1}$ yields a linear system:\n$$\n(I - \\theta \\Delta t \\mathcal{A})\\mathbf{V}^{n-1} = (I + (1-\\theta) \\Delta t \\mathcal{A})\\mathbf{V}^n + \\Delta t \\mathbf{c}_b\n$$\n- For the **Crank-Nicolson** scheme, $\\theta = 1/2$.\n- For the **Backward Euler** scheme, $\\theta = 1$.\n\nFor an American option, we must enforce the early exercise constraint $V(S,t) \\ge g(S)$, where $g(S) = \\max(K-S, 0)$. At each time step, this transforms the linear system into a linear complementarity problem (LCP), which we solve using the specified **Projected Successive Over-Relaxation (PSOR)** method. For a system $M\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{b}$ with constraint $\\mathbf{v} \\ge \\mathbf{g}$, the PSOR iteration updates each component $v_i$ as:\n$$\nv_i^{(k+1)} = \\max\\left(g_i, \\ v_i^{(k)} + \\frac{\\omega}{M_{ii}}\\left(b_i - \\sum_{j<i} M_{ij}v_j^{(k+1)} - \\sum_{j \\ge i} M_{ij}v_j^{(k)}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega \\in (0,2)$ is the relaxation parameter.\n\nThe task is to compare two approaches at the first time step from $t=T$ to $t=T-\\Delta t$, where the initial data is the non-smooth payoff function $V(S,T) = \\max(K-S,0)$.\n\n1.  **Standard Crank-Nicolson**: We take one full step of size $\\Delta t$ from $t=T$ to $t = T-\\Delta t$ using the Crank-Nicolson scheme ($\\theta=1/2$). We solve the corresponding LCP to find the option price vector $\\mathbf{V}_{\\text{CN}}$.\n\n2.  **Rannacher Smoothing**: We take two consecutive half-steps, each of size $\\Delta t/2$, using the Backward Euler scheme ($\\theta=1$). The first step takes us from $t=T$ to $t=T-\\Delta t/2$, and the second step from $t=T-\\Delta t/2$ to $t=T-\\Delta t$. This yields the option price vector $\\mathbf{V}_{\\text{Rannacher}}$. The high numerical dissipation of the Backward Euler scheme is intended to dampen the oscillations caused by the non-smooth initial data.\n\nFinally, we quantify the oscillations by counting the number of \"convexity violations\" for each resulting price vector. A violation at grid point $j$ occurs if the discrete second derivative is negative:\n$$\nV_{j+1} - 2V_j + V_{j-1} < 0.\n$$\nThis count is computed for $j=1, \\dots, N-1$. The desired output for each test case is the difference between the violation count from the Crank-Nicolson scheme and the count from the Rannacher-smoothed scheme. A positive difference demonstrates the effectiveness of the smoothing technique.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure: it constructs the finite difference matrices, handles boundary conditions, solves the LCP using PSOR, executes both time-stepping schemes for the first step, and computes the difference in convexity violations for each set of parameters.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_lcp_psor(A, b, g, v_initial, omega, tol, max_iter):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the linear complementarity problem corresponding to the implicit\n    time-stepping of the American option PDE using Projected Successive\n    Over-Relaxation (PSOR).\n\n    The problem is to find v such that:\n    v >= g\n    A*v - b >= 0\n    (v - g) * (A*v - b) = 0\n\n    Args:\n        A (np.ndarray): The system matrix (LHS).\n        b (np.ndarray): The system vector (RHS).\n        g (np.ndarray): The exercise payoff vector (the constraint).\n        v_initial (np.ndarray): The initial guess for the solution v.\n        omega (float): The relaxation parameter for SOR.\n        tol (float): The convergence tolerance.\n        max_iter (int): The maximum number of iterations.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The solution vector v.\n    \"\"\"\n    v = v_initial.copy()\n    n = len(v)\n    for k in range(max_iter):\n        v_old = v.copy()\n        max_abs_diff = 0.0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Sum over components already updated in this iteration (j < i)\n            s1 = np.dot(A[i, :i], v[:i])\n            # Sum over components from the previous iteration (j > i)\n            s2 = np.dot(A[i, i+1:], v_old[i+1:])\n            \n            # Standard SOR update value before projection\n            # This is equivalent to (1-omega)*v_old[i] + omega*(Gauss-Seidel update)\n            sor_val = v_old[i] + omega * ((b[i] - s1 - s2) / A[i, i] - v_old[i])\n\n            # Projection step to enforce the early exercise constraint\n            new_vi = max(g[i], sor_val)\n            \n            max_abs_diff = max(max_abs_diff, abs(new_vi - v_old[i]))\n            v[i] = new_vi\n        \n        if max_abs_diff < tol:\n            break\n            \n    return v\n\ndef count_convexity_violations(V_interior, K, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of indices j in {1, ..., N-1} where the discrete\n    second spatial derivative of the option price is negative.\n\n    Args:\n        V_interior (np.ndarray): Vector of option prices at interior points V_1, ..., V_{N-1}.\n        K (float): The strike price, used as the boundary value V_0.\n        N (float): The number of spatial divisions.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of convexity violations.\n    \"\"\"\n    V_full = np.zeros(N + 1)\n    V_full[0] = K\n    V_full[1:N] = V_interior\n    # V_full[N] is 0.0, as V(S_max, t) = 0\n    \n    # Check V_{j+1} - 2*V_j + V_{j-1} < 0 for j=1, ..., N-1\n    second_derivs = V_full[2:] - 2 * V_full[1:-1] + V_full[:-2]\n    \n    return int(np.sum(second_derivs < 0))\n\ndef compute_oscillation_diff(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Main computational routine for a single test case.
