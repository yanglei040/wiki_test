The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and distributions defined, ensuring that a unique and meaningful solution can be calculated. The language is objective and mathematically precise.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the necessary analytical expressions. The core of the problem is the calculation of various expected values involving the gross consumption growth, $g_{t+1}$. The process for log-consumption growth is given by:\n$$ \\log g_{t+1} = \\mu + \\sigma \\varepsilon_{t+1} + \\ln(1-b) J_{t+1} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{t+1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $J_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ are independent.

This exercise introduces the \"pricing kernel puzzle,\" a famous disconnect between theory and data, by having you estimate the SDF non-parametrically and test its predicted monotonicity with respect to aggregate wealth. This practice teaches a powerful estimation technique and encourages critical thinking about the limits of standard financial theories when confronted with empirical evidence [@problem_id:2421410].", "problem": "You are asked to investigate the so-called pricing kernel puzzle by testing whether an empirically estimated stochastic discount factor (also called the pricing kernel) is monotonically decreasing in aggregate wealth, as predicted by representative-agent models with concave utility. You must implement a complete program that estimates the stochastic discount factor from synthetic asset returns and then evaluates monotonicity against aggregate wealth for a provided test suite.\n\nStart from the fundamental intertemporal asset-pricing condition that for each asset $i$ with gross return $R_i$, there exists a stochastic discount factor $m$ such that the sample Euler equation holds:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\,m R_i\\,] = 1,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ denotes the empirical expectation over a finite number of equally likely states.\n\nIn a finite-state economy with $S$ states, let $m$ be represented by the length-$S$ vector $m = (m_1,\\dots,m_S)^\\top$ and let the returns across $N$ assets be given by the $S \\times N$ matrix $R$ whose $(s,i)$ entry is $R_{s,i}$. Under equal state probabilities $p_s = 1/S$ for all $s$, the Euler equation for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ can be written as the linear system\n$$\n\\frac{1}{S} R^\\top m = \\mathbf{1}_N,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_N$ is the length-$N$ vector of ones.

For each test case below, construct a returns matrix $R$ deterministically from a target stochastic discount factor $m^{\\star}$ using the following construction. Fix $S = 4$ and $N = 4$, and let $\\epsilon = 0.45$. Let $\\mathbf{1}_4$ be the $4$-vector of ones. Define four direction vectors $v_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ that are orthogonal to $m^{\\star}$ under the standard dot product, that is, $m^{\\star \\top} v_j = 0$ for all $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.

For the aggregate wealth vector $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ provided in each test case, evaluate monotonicity as follows. The theoretical prediction is that the stochastic discount factor is decreasing in aggregate wealth. Define the set of comparable state pairs\n   $$\n   \\mathcal{P} = \\{(i,j) \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}^2 \\;|\\; i \\neq j, \\; W_i > W_j\\}.\n   $$\n   A pair $(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ is a violation if $\\hat m_i \\ge \\hat m_j$. Let $V$ be the number of violations and $T = |\\mathcal{P}|$ be the number of comparable pairs. The violation rate is defined as the fraction $V/T$. Use a numerical tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-10}$ so that the inequality $\\hat m_i \\ge \\hat m_j$ is interpreted as $\\hat m_i - \\hat m_j \\ge -\\tau$.\n\n4.

A problem must be self-contained, scientifically sound, and logically consistent.\n\nFirst, we extract the given information and constraints as stated.\nGivens:\n1.  **Asset Pricing Framework**: The fundamental sample Euler equation is $\\mathbb{E}[\\,m R_i\\,] = 1$ for each asset $i$, where $m$ is the stochastic discount factor (SDF), and $R_i$ is the gross return.\n2.  **Finite-State Model**: There are $S$ states and $N$ assets. The state probabilities are uniform, $p_s = 1/S$. The returns are given by an $S \\times N$ matrix $R$. The SDF is a vector $m \\in \\mathbb{R}^S$. The Euler equations form a linear system: $\\frac{1}{S} R^\\top m = \\mathbf{1}_N$.\n3.  **SDF Estimator**: The empirical SDF estimator, $\\hat m$, is defined as the minimum Euclidean norm solution to the linear system: minimize $\\|m\\|_2$ subject to $\\frac{1}{S} R^\\top m = \\mathbf{1}_N$.\n4.  **Problem Parameters**: The model is specified with $S=4$ states and $N=4$ assets.\n5.  **Returns Matrix Construction**: The returns matrix $R$ is constructed from a target SDF $m^\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ that satisfies the normalization $\\sum_{s=1}^4 m^{\\star}_s = 4$. The columns of $R$ are given by $R_{:,j} = \\mathbf{1}_4 + \\epsilon v_j$ for $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, where $\\epsilon = 0.45$ and the vectors $v_j$ are constructed to be orthogonal to $m^\\star$ ($m^{\\star \\top} v_j = 0$):\n    -   $v_1 = (1,\\; -m^{\\star}_1/m^{\\star}_2,\\; 0,\\; 0)^\\top$\n    -   $v_2 = (1,\\; 0,\\; -m^{\\star}_1/m^{\\star}_3,\\; 0)^\\top$\n    -   $v_3 = (1,\\; 0,\\; 0,\\; -m^{\\star}_1/m^{\\star}_4)^\\top$\n    -   $v_4 = (0,\\; 1,\\; -m^{\\star}_2/m^{\\star}_3,\\; 0)^\\top$\n6.  **Monotonicity Test**: The estimated SDF, $\\hat m$, is tested for monotonicity with respect to an aggregate wealth vector $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$.\n    -   The set of comparable state pairs is $\\mathcal{P} = \\{(i,j) \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}^2 \\;|\\; i \\neq j, \\; W_i > W_j\\}$.\n    -   A violation occurs for a pair $(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ if $\\hat m_i \\ge \\hat m_j$.\n    -   Numerical tolerance for the check is $\\tau = 10^{-10}$, so a violation is registered if $\\hat m_i - \\hat m_j \\ge -\\tau$.\n    -   The violation rate is $V/T$, where $V$ is the count of violations and $T=|\\mathcal{P}|$.\n7.  **Test Suite**:\n    -   Case A: $W = (0.9,\\; 1.0,\\; 1.1,\\; 1.2)^\\top$, $m^{\\star} = (1.4,\\; 1.1,\\; 0.8,\\; 0.7)^\\top$.\n    -   Case B: $W = (0.9,\\; 1.0,\\; 1.1,\\; 1.2)^\\top$, $m^{\\star} = (1.0,\\; 1.5,\\; 0.9,\\; 0.6)^\\top$.\n    -   Case C: $W = (1.0,\\; 1.0,\\; 1.2,\\; 1.3)^\\top$, $m^{\\star} = (1.1,\\; 1.3,\\; 0.9,\\; 0.7)^\\top$.\n    -   Case D: $W = (0.9,\\; 1.0,\\; 1.1,\\; 1.2)^\\top$, $m^{\\star} = (1.2,\\; 0.98,\\; 1.0,\\; 0.82)^\\top$.\n\nValidation based on these givens confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded in asset pricing theory, objective, and well-posed. The construction of the returns matrix $R$ guarantees that the linear system for $m$ is consistent, as the target $m^\\star$ is a feasible solution. This ensures the existence of a unique minimum-norm solution. All required data and definitions are provided. The problem is deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the constrained optimization problem:\n$$\n\\text{minimize } \\frac{1}{2} m^\\top m \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad A m = b\n$$\nwhere $A = \\frac{1}{S} R^\\top$ is an $N \\times S$ matrix, $m \\in \\mathbb{R}^S$, and $b = \\mathbf{1}_N \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$. For this problem, we have $S=N=4$.\n\nThe unique minimum-norm solution to a consistent linear system $Am=b$ is given by $\\hat m = A^\\dagger b$, where $A^\\dagger$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $A$. This result from linear algebra provides a direct method for computing the estimated SDF, $\\hat m$.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Construct the Returns Matrix $R$**:\n    For a given test case with a target SDF $m^\\star = (m^\\star_1, m^\\star_2, m^\\star_3, m^\\star_4)^\\top$, we first construct the four auxiliary vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ according to the specified formulae. The components of $m^\\star$ in all test cases are non-zero, so the definitions of the $v_j$ are well-defined. We then form the $4 \\times 4$ matrix $V = [v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4]$ whose columns are these vectors. The $4 \\times 4$ returns matrix $R$ is then assembled. The $j$-th column of $R$ is $R_{:,j} = \\mathbf{1}_4 + \\epsilon v_j$, where $\\mathbf{1}_4$ is a vector of ones and $\\epsilon = 0.45$. This can be written compactly as $R = J + \\epsilon V$, where $J$ is the $4 \\times 4$ matrix of all ones.\n\n2.  **Estimate the Stochastic Discount Factor $\\hat m$**:\n    With $R$ constructed, we form the matrix $A = \\frac{1}{4}R^\\top$. The system to be solved is $Am = \\mathbf{1}_4$. We compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse $A^\\dagger$ and then find the estimated SDF as $\\hat m = A^\\dagger \\mathbf{1}_4$. It must be emphasized that the minimum-norm solution $\\hat m$ is not, in general, equal to the target vector $m^\\star$. The vector $m^\\star$ is merely one point in the affine subspace of solutions, whereas $\\hat m$ is the unique element of this subspace closest to the origin.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Monotonicity and Compute Violation Rate**:\n    Given the wealth vector $W = (W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4)^\\top$ and the estimated SDF $\\hat m = (\\hat m_1, \\hat m_2, \\hat m_3, \\hat m_4)^\\top$, we must assess whether $\\hat m$ is a decreasing function of $W$. We iterate through all distinct pairs of state indices $(i, j)$ where $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    -   We first count the total number of comparable pairs, $T$. A pair $(i, j)$ is comparable if $W_i > W_j$. We find all such ordered pairs.\n    -   _Note that we use $0$-based indexing in implementation, so we are comparing $W_i$ and $W_j$ for $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$._\n    -   For each comparable pair where $W_i > W_j$, we check for a monotonicity violation. A violation is defined to occur if the SDF does not strictly decrease, i.e., $\\hat m_i \\ge \\hat m_j$. We implement this check using the provided numerical tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-10}$ as $\\hat m_i - \\hat m_j \\ge -\\tau$.\n    -   We count the total number of such violations, $V$.\n    -   The violation rate is the ratio $V/T$. If $T=0$, the rate is $0$.\n\nThis entire procedure is encapsulated in a program which, for each test case, computes and reports the violation rate, rounded to six decimal places.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the pricing kernel puzzle problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Strictly decreasing target SDF\n        {\n            \"W\": np.array([0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2]),\n            \"m_star\": np.array([1.4, 1.1, 0.8, 0.7]),\n        },\n        # Case B: Hump-shaped target SDF\n        {\n            \"W\": np.array([0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2]),\n            \"m_star\": np.array([1.0, 1.5, 0.9, 0.6]),\n        },\n        # Case C: Ties in wealth\n        {\n            \"W\": np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3]),\n            \"m_star\": np.array([1.1, 1.3, 0.9, 0.7]),\n        },\n        # Case D: Near-monotone target SDF\n        {\n            \"W\": np.array([0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2]),\n            \"m_star\": np.array([1.2, 0.98, 1.0, 0.82]),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Constants from the problem statement\n    S = 4\n    N = 4\n    epsilon = 0.45\n    tau = 1e-10\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        W = case[\"W\"]\n        m_star = case[\"m_star\"]\n\n        # 1.
