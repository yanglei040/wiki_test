This practice explores what happens when this critical assumption is violated, demonstrating that even a small correlation between the instrument $Z$ and the error term $u$ can lead to significant bias. By analytically deriving and then simulating the asymptotic bias of the IV estimator, you will gain a deep, practical understanding of why instrument exogeneity is the central pillar supporting causal inference with IV [@problem_id:2402354].", "problem": "Consider the scalar linear structural model in which an economic outcome is generated by a potentially endogenous regressor and an unobserved disturbance.

The disturbances $u_i$, $\\varepsilon_i$, and $\\nu_i$ are mutually independent and independent of $w_i$. The instrument construction parameter $\\rho$ regulates the degree of correlation between $z_i$ and $u_i$, so that the moment condition $\\mathbb{E}[z_i u_i] = 0$ is violated whenever $|\\rho| > 0$. Assume that $(w_i,u_i,\\varepsilon_i,\\nu_i)$ are independent and identically distributed across $i$, with variances $\\operatorname{Var}(w_i) = \\sigma_w^2$, $\\operatorname{Var}(u_i) = \\sigma_u^2$, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma_\\varepsilon^2$, and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\nu_i) = \\sigma_\\nu^2$.\n\nYour task is to study the asymptotic bias that results when the parameter $\\beta$ is estimated using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with the single faulty instrument $z_i$.

The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It is a formal exercise in deriving and calculating the probability limit of an estimator. I will proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculation.\n\nThe model is defined by the following system of equations for each observation $i$:\n1. Structural equation: $y_i = \\beta x_i + u_i$\n2. First-stage equation: $x_i = \\pi w_i + \\gamma u_i + \\varepsilon_i$\n3.

The parameter $\\beta$ is the true causal effect of $x_i$ on $y_i$. The regressor $x_i$ is endogenous because it is correlated with the structural error $u_i$ whenever $\\gamma \\neq 0$, since $\\mathbb{E}[x_i u_i] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\pi w_i + \\gamma u_i + \\varepsilon_i)u_i] = \\gamma \\sigma_u^2$. The instrument $z_i$ is invalid (not exogenous) whenever $\\rho \\neq 0$, as its correlation with the structural error is non-zero: $\\mathbb{E}[z_i u_i] = \\mathbb{E}[(w_i + \\rho u_i + \\nu_i)u_i] = \\rho \\sigma_u^2$.\n\nThe single-instrument, single-regressor 2SLS estimator for $\\beta$ without an intercept is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{IV}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N z_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N z_i x_i}\n$$\nTo find the asymptotic bias, we first derive the probability limit ($\\operatorname{plim}$) of $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{IV}}$ as the sample size $N \\to \\infty$.

Let's derive them.\n\nThe first moment is the denominator term, $\\mathbb{E}[z_i x_i]$. Substitute the definitions of $z_i$ and $x_i$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[z_i x_i] = \\mathbb{E}[(w_i + \\rho u_i + \\nu_i)(\\pi w_i + \\gamma u_i + \\varepsilon_i)]\n$$\nExpanding the product and applying the expectation operator, we use the mutual independence and mean-zero properties of $w_i, u_i, \\varepsilon_i, \\nu_i$. All cross-product terms like $\\mathbb{E}[w_i u_i]$, $\\mathbb{E}[w_i \\varepsilon_i]$, etc., are zero. The only non-zero terms are from the expectations of squared variables:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[z_i x_i] = \\pi \\mathbb{E}[w_i^2] + \\rho \\gamma \\mathbb{E}[u_i^2] = \\pi \\sigma_w^2 + \\rho \\gamma \\sigma_u^2\n$$\nThis is the covariance between the instrument and the endogenous regressor. For the instrument to be relevant, this covariance must be non-zero.\n\nThe second moment is $\\mathbb{E}[z_i u_i]$, which quantifies the endogeneity of the instrument:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[z_i u_i] = \\mathbb{E}[(w_i + \\rho u_i + \\nu_i)u_i]\n$$\nAgain, due to independence, $\\mathbb{E}[w_i u_i] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\nu_i u_i] = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[z_i u_i] = \\rho \\mathbb{E}[u_i^2] = \\rho \\sigma_u^2\n$$\nNow, substitute these moments back into the expression for $\\operatorname{plim} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{IV}}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{plim} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{IV}} = \\frac{\\beta(\\pi \\sigma_w^2 + \\rho \\gamma \\sigma_u^2) + \\rho \\sigma_u^2}{\\pi \\sigma_w^2 + \\rho \\gamma \\sigma_u^2} = \\beta + \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_u^2}{\\pi \\sigma_w^2 + \\rho \\gamma \\sigma_u^2}\n$$\nThe asymptotic bias, $B_\\infty$, is defined as the difference between the probability limit of the estimator and the true parameter value $\\beta$:\n$$\nB_\\infty = \\operatorname{plim} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{IV}} - \\beta = \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_u^2}{\\pi \\sigma_w^2 + \\rho \\gamma \\sigma_u^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the asymptotic bias.

It presents a standard exercise in computational econometrics to analyze the consequences of weak instruments on the statistical power of hypothesis tests. The solution is constructed via a Monte Carlo simulation as specified.\n\nThe core of the simulation is a data-generating process (DGP) for a linear model with one endogenous regressor $x_i$ and one instrumental variable $z_i$. The model is defined by two equations:\nThe first-stage equation, $x_i = \\pi z_i + v_i$, links the endogenous regressor $x_i$ to the instrument $z_i$. The parameter $\\pi$ governs the strength of the instrument. A value of $\\pi$ close to zero signifies a \"weak instrument,\" meaning $z_i$ has little explanatory power for $x_i$.\nThe structural equation, $y_i = \\beta x_i + u_i$, defines the outcome variable $y_i$. Endogeneity arises because the error terms $v_i$ and $u_i$ are correlated, with $\\text{Corr}(v_i, u_i) = \\rho$. This correlation is explicitly constructed from independent standard normal shocks $e_{1i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $e_{2i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ by setting $v_i = e_{1i}$ and $u_i = \\rho e_{1i} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} e_{2i}$. This correlation violates the ordinary least squares assumption that the regressor is uncorrelated with the error term, necessitating the use of an instrumental variable estimator.\n\nFor each of the $R$ repetitions in a simulation run, a dataset of size $n$ is generated according to this DGP. Then, the following quantities are computed:\n\n1.  **Instrumental Variables Estimator**: The just-identified IV estimator for $\\beta$ is computed from the sample analogue of the moment condition $E[z_i(y_i - \\beta x_i)]=0$. This yields the expression $\\hat{\\beta} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i y_i\\right) / \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i x_i\\right)$. This estimator is consistent for $\\beta$ provided the instrument is valid, i.e., relevant ($\\pi \\neq 0$) and exogenous ($E[z_i u_i] = 0$, which holds by construction).\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Test**: A $t$-test for the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta=0$ is performed. The test statistic is $T = (\\hat{\\beta} - 0) / \\sqrt{\\widehat{V}(\\hat{\\beta})}$, where $\\widehat{V}(\\hat{\\beta})$ is the estimated variance of $\\hat{\\beta}$. The variance formula provided, $\\widehat{V}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\widehat{S} / (n \\widehat{Q}^2)$ with $\\widehat{S}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i\\hat{u}_i)^2$ and $\\widehat{Q}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i x_i$, is a heteroskedasticity-robust form. The null hypothesis is rejected at significance level $\\alpha$ if the absolute value of the test statistic, $|T|$, exceeds the critical value $c_\\alpha$ from the standard normal distribution, where $c_\\alpha$ is defined by $\\Pr(|Z| > c_\\alpha) = \\alpha$ for $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The empirical power of the test is the fraction of the $R$ repetitions in which $H_0$ is correctly rejected, given that the true value in the simulation is $\\beta \\neq 0$.\n\n3.  **First-Stage F-Statistic**: As a diagnostic for instrument strength, the $F$-statistic from the first-stage regression of $x_i$ on $z_i$ is calculated. Because there is only one instrument, this is equivalent to the square of the $t$-statistic for the coefficient on $z_i$, $\\hat{a}$. This $t$-statistic is $t_1 = \\hat{a} / \\operatorname{se}(\\hat{a})$. A low average $F$-statistic (commonly, a value below $10$ is used as a rule of thumb) is a widely used indicator of weak instruments.

By coding these estimators from scratch, you will solidify your understanding of both methods and appreciate how GMM's moment-based approach provides a unified and extensible foundation for estimation [@problem_id:2402325].", "problem": "Consider the linear Instrumental Variables (IV) model with potentially endogenous regressors.

It is rooted in foundational econometric theory concerning instrumental variables estimation. The concepts of 2SLS, GMM, moment conditions, and endogeneity are standard textbook material. The DGP is a valid construction for simulating an endogenous regressor model.\nThe problem is **well-posed**. It provides a clear objective and all necessary information to achieve it. The existence and uniqueness of the estimators are guaranteed under standard full-rank assumptions, which are met with high probability by the specified random data generation process. The task of numerical verification is unambiguous. The problem does not specify the matrix $\\Pi$ but correctly states it should be a \"fixed matrix\" that ensures instrument relevance. The choice of such a matrix is part of a standard simulation setup; a fixed random draw is a valid and reproducible approach.\nThe problem is **objective**. It uses precise mathematical and statistical language, devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\nThe problem meets all criteria for validity. There are no scientific flaws, no missing information that prevents a solution, and no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to demonstrate the algebraic equivalence of the 2SLS estimator and the efficient GMM estimator under homoskedasticity. We begin with the derivations.\n\nLet us first derive the GMM estimator. The GMM criterion is to minimize a quadratic form of the sample moments. Let the sample moment vector be $g_n(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{n} Z^{\\top}(y - X\\beta)$. The GMM objective function is $J(\\beta) = g_n(\\beta)^{\\top} W_n g_n(\\beta)$, where $W_n$ is a positive definite weighting matrix. For computational convenience, we can absorb the $1/n$ scaling factors into the weighting matrix and minimize the equivalent objective function:\n$$Q(\\beta) = (y - X\\beta)^{\\top}Z W Z^{\\top}(y - X\\beta)$$\nwhere $W$ is a weighting matrix. Under homoskedasticity and independence of $u_i$ and $Z_i$, the optimal choice for the asymptotic variance of the GMM estimator is achieved with a weighting matrix $W_n$ that is a consistent estimator of $(E[Z_i Z_i^{\\top}])^{-1}$. A natural sample analogue is $W_n = (\\frac{1}{n}Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1}$. Substituting this into the objective function (and ignoring the scalar $1/n$ which does not affect the minimizer), we set $W=(Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1}$. The objective function becomes:\n$$Q(\\beta) = (y - X\\beta)^{\\top}Z (Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1} Z^{\\top}(y - X\\beta)$$\nLet us define the matrix $P_Z = Z(Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\top}$. This is the orthogonal projection matrix onto the column space of $Z$. The objective function simplifies to:\n$$Q(\\beta) = (y - X\\beta)^{\\top}P_Z(y - X\\beta)$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $\\beta$. To find the minimum, we compute the gradient with respect to $\\beta$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( y^{\\top}P_Z y - 2\\beta^{\\top}X^{\\top}P_Z y + \\beta^{\\top}X^{\\top}P_Z X \\beta \\right) = -2X^{\\top}P_Z y + 2X^{\\top}P_Z X \\beta$$\nSetting the gradient to zero gives the first-order condition:\n$$X^{\\top}P_Z X \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{GMM}} = X^{\\top}P_Z y$$\nAssuming the matrix $X^{\\top}P_Z X$ is invertible, the GMM estimator is:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{GMM}} = (X^{\\top}P_Z X)^{-1}X^{\\top}P_Z y$$\nIn implementation, inverses should be computed using a numerically stable method, such as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, to handle potential near-singularity, as stipulated in the problem.\n\nNext, we derive the 2SLS estimator. This estimator is computed in two sequential stages of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n**Stage 1:** Each column of the regressor matrix $X$ is regressed on the instrument matrix $Z$. The fitted values from this regression, which we denote by $\\hat{X}$, are the projection of $X$ onto the column space of $Z$. The OLS formula for the coefficients of this regression is $\\hat{\\Pi} = (Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\top}X$. The matrix of fitted values is thus:\n$$\\hat{X} = Z\\hat{\\Pi} = Z(Z^{\\top}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\top}X = P_Z X$$\n**Stage 2:** The outcome variable $y$ is regressed on the fitted values $\\hat{X}$ from the first stage. The resulting OLS estimator for $\\beta$ is the 2SLS estimator.\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2SLS}} = (\\hat{X}^{\\top}\\hat{X})^{-1}\\hat{X}^{\\top}y$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\hat{X}$ into this formula.\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2SLS}} = ((P_Z X)^{\\top}(P_Z X))^{-1}(P_Z X)^{\\top}y$$\nThe projection matrix $P_Z$ is symmetric ($P_Z^{\\top} = P_Z$) and idempotent ($P_Z^2 = P_Z$). Using these properties, we simplify the terms in the expression.\nThe first term becomes: $(\\hat{X}^{\\top}\\hat{X}) = (P_Z X)^{\\top}(P_Z X) = X^{\\top}P_Z^{\\top}P_Z X = X^{\\top}P_Z P_Z X = X^{\\top}P_Z X$.\nThe second term becomes: $\\hat{X}^{\\top}y = (P_Z X)^{\\top}y = X^{\\top}P_Z^{\\top}y = X^{\\top}P_Z y$.\nSubstituting these simplified forms back into the expression for $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2SLS}}$ yields:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2SLS}} = (X^{\\top}P_Z X)^{-1}X^{\\top}P_Z y$$\nThis expression is identical to the one derived for $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{GMM}}$. The theoretical equivalence is thus established.\n\nThe final part of the task is to verify this equivalence numerically. The program will implement the DGP as described, then compute both estimators according to their respective definitions, and finally calculate the Euclidean distance between the resulting vectors.\nFor the 2SLS estimator, the code will first compute $\\hat{X} = P_Z X$ and then use it in the second-stage regression formula $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2SLS}} = (\\hat{X}^{\\top}\\hat{X})^{-1}\\hat{X}^{\\top}y$.\nFor the GMM estimator, the code will directly compute the components of the derived formula $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{GMM}} = (X^{\\top}P_Z X)^{-1}X^{\\top}P_Z y$.\nAlthough algebraically identical, this separate implementation path verifies that the two conceptual procedures yield the same numerical result up to machine precision. The use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse `np.linalg.pinv` is crucial for ensuring stability, especially in Case 2 where instruments are nearly collinear, and in the just-identified Case 3 where the matrices involved may be square but ill-conditioned. The fixed random seed for each test case ensures reproducibility of the simulated data and the final results.
