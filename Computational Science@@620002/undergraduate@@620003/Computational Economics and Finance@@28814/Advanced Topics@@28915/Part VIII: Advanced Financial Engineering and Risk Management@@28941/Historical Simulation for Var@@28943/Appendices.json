{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise establishes the foundational mechanics of Historical Simulation Value at Risk (VaR). You will begin by synthetically generating a realistic dataset for a portfolio of correlated assets, a core skill in financial modeling. You will then apply the historical simulation algorithm to this data to calculate the $99\\%$ VaR for various portfolio weighting schemes, providing a solid, from-the-ground-up understanding of the entire workflow ([@problem_id:2390037]).", "problem": "You are given a portfolio of $N=10$ assets. Let the portfolio weight vector be $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10}$, and let the historical returns over $T$ days be the matrix $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times 10}$ whose $t$-th row is $\\mathbf{r}_t^\\top$. The daily portfolio return is $R^p_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i r_{t,i}$ and the daily portfolio loss is $L_t = - R^p_t$. The $99\\%$ Value at Risk (Value at Risk (VaR)) is defined for a loss random variable $L$ as the smallest number $v$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(L \\le v) \\ge 0.99$. Under historical simulation, replace the distribution of $L$ with its empirical distribution from the sample $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. Using the empirical distribution function, define the empirical $p$-quantile as the order statistic at index $k = \\lceil p \\cdot T \\rceil$ (with $1$-based indexing), that is, sort $\\{L_t\\}$ in nondecreasing order to obtain $L_{(1)} \\le \\cdots \\le L_{(T)}$, and set $\\widehat{q}_p = L_{(k)}$ with $k = \\lceil p \\cdot T \\rceil$. Then the historical simulation estimate of the $99\\%$ VaR is $\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99} = \\widehat{q}_{0.99}$. All outputs must be reported as decimals (for example, report $0.025$ instead of $2.5\\%$).\n\nTo ensure a scientifically sound and reproducible dataset that captures cross-asset correlation, construct the historical returns as follows. Let the per-asset daily volatility vector be $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_{10})$ with $\\sigma_i = 0.01 + 0.002 \\cdot (i-1)$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,10\\}$. Define the correlation matrix $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10 \\times 10}$ by $C_{ij} = \\rho^{|i-j|}$ with $\\rho = 0.6$, and define the covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. For a given $T$, generate a historical sample by drawing $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times 10}$ with independent and identically distributed standard normal entries and then setting $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{L}^\\top$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ is the lower-triangular Cholesky factor of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ such that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{L}^\\top$. Use a fixed pseudo-random seed $12345$ for every dataset generation. This process induces correlated asset returns with the specified covariance, serving as the historical sample for the historical simulation. Angles are not involved in this task. No physical units apply; report all losses as unitless decimal numbers.\n\nImplement a program that computes $\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99}$ by the empirical order statistic definition above for each of the following test cases. In all cases, use the generation method and the fixed seed $12345$ to produce the $\\mathbf{R}$ matrix for the specified $T$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case A (general case): $T = 1000$, weights $w_i = 1/10$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,10\\}$.\n- Case B (concentration edge case): $T = 500$, weights $w_1 = 1$ and $w_i = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{2,\\ldots,10\\}$.\n- Case C (risk-parity style case): $T = 252$, weights given by $w_i \\propto 1/\\sigma_i$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,10\\}$, normalized so that $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i = 1$.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- Use the empirical quantile with $k = \\lceil 0.99 \\cdot T \\rceil$ as defined above (no interpolation).\n- For each case, compute the loss series $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ from the generated returns and the specified weights, and then compute $\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99}$.\n- Round each final $\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99}$ to $6$ decimal places.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the three rounded results for Cases A, B, and C, in that order, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, the output must look like $[x_A,x_B,x_C]$ with each $x$ shown to exactly $6$ decimal places.", "solution": "The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the $99\\%$ Value at Risk ($\\mathrm{VaR}_{0.99}$) for a portfolio of $N=10$ assets under three distinct scenarios. The calculation will use the historical simulation method, where the historical data is synthetically generated according to a specified statistical model.\n\n**1. Synthetic Generation of Asset Returns**\n\nThe core of the simulation is the generation of a $T \\times N$ matrix of historical returns, $\\mathbf{R}$, where $T$ is the number of days and $N=10$ is the number of assets. The returns are modeled as draws from a multivariate normal distribution with a mean of zero and a specified covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$. This covariance structure is crucial for capturing the interdependencies between asset price movements.\n\nFirst, we define the components of the covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10 \\times 10}$.\nThe per-asset daily volatility vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_{10})^\\top$, where the volatility of the $i$-th asset is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = 0.01 + 0.002 \\cdot (i-1) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}\n$$\nThis creates a spectrum of volatilities, starting from $\\sigma_1 = 0.01$ and increasing to $\\sigma_{10} = 0.028$. These volatilities form the diagonal of a matrix $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$.\n\nNext, the correlation structure is defined by a matrix $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10 \\times 10}$, where the correlation between asset $i$ and asset $j$ is:\n$$\nC_{ij} = \\rho^{|i-j|}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\rho$ is given as $0.6$. This structure implies that assets closer in index are more strongly correlated.\n\nThe covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is then assembled as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{D}\n$$\nTo generate correlated random variates, we use the Cholesky decomposition of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$. We find a lower-triangular matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ such that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{L}^\\top$.\n\nThe historical return matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ is generated by first creating a matrix $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times 10}$ of independent and identically distributed standard normal random variables ($\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$). The correlated returns are then obtained by the transformation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{L}^\\top\n$$\nEach row $\\mathbf{r}_t^\\top$ of $\\mathbf{R}$ is a random vector representing the daily returns of the $10$ assets, and these vectors are drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$. For reproducibility, the pseudo-random number generator is initialized with a fixed seed of $12345$ for each data generation process.\n\n**2. Historical Simulation for Value at Risk ($\\mathrm{VaR}$)**\n\nGiven a portfolio weight vector $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{10})^\\top$, the daily return of the portfolio, $R^p_t$, is the weighted sum of the individual asset returns:\n$$\nR^p_t = \\mathbf{r}_t^\\top \\mathbf{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i r_{t,i}\n$$\nThe corresponding daily portfolio loss is defined as the negative of the return: $L_t = -R^p_t$. This calculation is performed for each day $t$ from $1$ to $T$, yielding a sample of historical losses $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$.\n\nThe historical simulation approach estimates the $\\mathrm{VaR}$ from the empirical distribution of this loss sample. The $p$-quantile of the loss distribution is estimated by finding a specific value from the sorted loss data. We sort the losses in non-decreasing order:\n$$\nL_{(1)} \\le L_{(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le L_{(T)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the empirical $p$-quantile, $\\widehat{q}_p$, to be the $k$-th order statistic, $L_{(k)}$, where the index $k$ is given by:\n$$\nk = \\lceil p \\cdot T \\rceil\n$$\nThis is a 1-based index. For the $99\\%$ $\\mathrm{VaR}$, we set $p=0.99$, so the historical estimate is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99} = L_{(k)} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad k = \\lceil 0.99 \\cdot T \\rceil\n$$\n\n**3. Application to Test Cases**\n\nWe now apply this methodology to the three specified test cases. The covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and its Cholesky factor $\\mathbf{L}$ are common to all cases as they depend only on $N=10$ and the fixed parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\rho$.\n\n**Case A: General Case**\n-   Time periods: $T = 1000$.\n-   Portfolio weights: An equally weighted portfolio, $w_i = 1/10 = 0.1$ for all $i$.\n-   $\\mathrm{VaR}$ index: $k = \\lceil 0.99 \\cdot 1000 \\rceil = \\lceil 990 \\rceil = 990$.\n-   Procedure:\n    1.  Generate $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1000 \\times 10}$ using the seed $12345$.\n    2.  Compute the loss series $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^{1000}$ using $\\mathbf{w} = (0.1, \\dots, 0.1)^\\top$.\n    3.  Sort the losses and select the $990$-th value, $L_{(990)}$.\n\n**Case B: Concentration Edge Case**\n-   Time periods: $T = 500$.\n-   Portfolio weights: A portfolio fully concentrated in the first asset, $\\mathbf{w} = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)^\\top$.\n-   $\\mathrm{VaR}$ index: $k = \\lceil 0.99 \\cdot 500 \\rceil = \\lceil 495 \\rceil = 495$.\n-   Procedure:\n    1.  Generate $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{500 \\times 10}$ using the seed $12345$.\n    2.  Compute the loss series $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^{500}$. Here, $L_t = -r_{t,1}$.\n    3.  Sort the losses and select the $495$-th value, $L_{(495)}$.\n\n**Case C: Risk-Parity Style Case**\n-   Time periods: $T = 252$ (approximating one trading year).\n-   Portfolio weights: Weights are inversely proportional to asset volatility, $w_i \\propto 1/\\sigma_i$. This is a \"risk-parity\" inspired allocation, where less volatile assets receive higher weight. The weights must be normalized to sum to $1$:\n    $$\n    w_i = \\frac{1/\\sigma_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{10} (1/\\sigma_j)}\n    $$\n-   $\\mathrm{VaR}$ index: $k = \\lceil 0.99 \\cdot 252 \\rceil = \\lceil 249.48 \\rceil = 250$.\n-   Procedure:\n    1.  Calculate the normalized weights $\\mathbf{w}$.\n    2.  Generate $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{252 \\times 10}$ using the seed $12345$.\n    3.  Compute the loss series $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^{252}$ using the calculated $\\mathbf{w}$.\n    4.  Sort the losses and select the $250$-th value, $L_{(250)}$.\n\nFor each case, the computed $\\widehat{\\mathrm{VaR}}_{0.99}$ will be rounded to $6$ decimal places as required. The implementation will use 0-based array indexing, so the value at index $k$ in a 1-based system corresponds to the value at index $k-1$ in code.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef generate_returns(T, N, sigma_vec, corr_matrix, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a matrix of correlated asset returns.\n\n    Args:\n        T (int): Number of time periods (days).\n        N (int): Number of assets.\n        sigma_vec (np.ndarray): Vector of asset volatilities.\n        corr_matrix (np.ndarray): Asset correlation matrix.\n        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A T x N matrix of simulated daily returns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Construct the covariance matrix: Sigma = D * C * D\n    D = np.diag(sigma_vec)\n    cov_matrix = D @ corr_matrix @ D\n\n    # Perform Cholesky decomposition: Sigma = L * L^T\n    # numpy.linalg.cholesky returns the lower-triangular matrix L.\n    L = np.linalg.cholesky(cov_matrix)\n\n    # Generate independent standard normal random variables\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    Z = rng.standard_normal((T, N))\n\n    # Generate correlated returns: R = Z * L^T\n    R = Z @ L.T\n    return R\n\ndef calculate_var(T, weights, returns):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 99% Value at Risk using historical simulation.\n\n    Args:\n        T (int): Number of time periods.\n        weights (np.ndarray): Portfolio weights vector.\n        returns (np.ndarray): Matrix of historical returns.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The 99% VaR, rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate daily portfolio returns: Rp_t = R_t^T * w\n    portfolio_returns = returns @ weights\n    \n    # Calculate daily portfolio losses: L_t = -Rp_t\n    losses = -portfolio_returns\n    \n    # Sort losses in non-decreasing order\n    sorted_losses = np.sort(losses)\n    \n    # Calculate the index k for the 99% empirical quantile\n    # k = ceil(p * T), with 1-based indexing\n    p = 0.99\n    k = math.ceil(p * T)\n    \n    # Get the VaR value.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of financial risk management, specifically the Historical Simulation (HS) methodology for Value at Risk (VaR) calculation. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions, data, and constraints that permit a unique and verifiable solution. All terms are defined with mathematical precision, and the numerical examples are physically and economically plausible.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the prescribed algorithm, which is a standard industry approach. The core principle of Historical Simulation is to estimate the potential one-day profit-and-loss (P&L) distribution of a portfolio by subjecting the current portfolio to a set of historical market price movements. The VaR is then determined as a specific low-end quantile of this simulated P&L distribution, representing a potential loss that is not expected to be exceeded with a high degree of confidence.\n\nA crucial prerequisite for this method is the creation of an economically meaningful history of asset returns. Corporate actions such as stock splits cause mechanical shifts in price levels that do not reflect any change in the underlying economic value of the asset. To prevent these distortions from contaminating the historical return data, a price adjustment is necessary.\n\nThe problem defines an adjusted price series, $\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_t$, for each asset $i$. For an asset that undergoes a $s$-for-$1$ stock split at date $t_s$, the historical prices recorded before the split, $P^{(i)}_t$ for $t < t_s$, are divided by the split factor $s$. For a $2$-for-$1$ split, $s=2$. Prices at and after the split date are not adjusted. In mathematical terms:\n$$\n\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nP^{(i)}_t / s, & \\text{if } t < t_s \\text{ and asset } i \\text{ has a split at } t_s \\text{ with factor } s, \\\\\nP^{(i)}_t, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor assets with no splits, $\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_t = P^{(i)}_t$ for all $t$.\n\nFrom this consistent, adjusted price series, the historical simple returns for each asset $i$ over the lookback window $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$ are computed:\n$$\nR^{(i)}_t = \\frac{\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_t}{\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_{t-1}} - 1.\n$$\nThese returns represent the true historical percentage changes in value.\n\nThe next step is to generate the P&L scenarios. The P&L for a historical scenario $t$ is calculated by applying the historical returns $R^{(i)}_t$ to the current market value of each holding. The current value of the holding in asset $i$ is $V_i = h_i \\, P^{(i)}_T$, where $h_i$ is the number of shares and $P^{(i)}_T$ is the last recorded price. Note that the adjusted price at time $T$, $\\tilde{P}^{(i)}_T$, is always equal to the recorded price $P^{(i)}_T$ per its definition, as $T \\not< t_s$. The portfolio P&L for scenario $t$ is the sum of the P&L contributions from all $N$ assets:\n$$\n\\Pi_t = \\sum_{i=1}^N V_i \\, R^{(i)}_t = \\sum_{i=1}^N h_i \\, P^{(i)}_T \\, R^{(i)}_t.\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each day $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$ in the lookback period, yielding an empirical sample of $T$ potential P&L values, $\\{\\Pi_t\\}_{t=1}^T$.\n\nFinally, the Value at Risk is extracted from this P&L distribution. The problem defines the one-day HS VaR at confidence level $\\alpha = 0.95$ as the negative of the $p$-quantile of the P&L sample, where $p = 1 - \\alpha = 0.05$. The quantile $Q_p(\\{\\Pi_t\\})$ is found by first sorting the P&L sample in ascending order to obtain the order statistics $\\Pi_{(1)} \\le \\Pi_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le \\Pi_{(T)}$. The quantile is then the $k$-th element of this sorted sample:\n$$\nQ_p(\\{\\Pi_t\\}) = \\Pi_{(k)}, \\quad \\text{where } k = \\lceil p T \\rceil.\n$$\nThe problem specifies that if $\\lceil p T \\rceil < 1$, one should take $k=1$. The VaR is then reported as a positive value representing a loss:\n$$\n\\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha} = -Q_p(\\{\\Pi_t\\}).\n$$\nThe following is a detailed computation for Test Case $1$, which illustrates the application of this methodology.
