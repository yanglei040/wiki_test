The core of the solution lies in the error analysis of the bisection method.\n\nLet the initial interval be $[a_0, b_0]$, where the root $r^{\\ast}$ is known to lie. The length of this interval is $L_0 = b_0 - a_0$. The bisection method iteratively halves the length of the bracketing interval.

One of the most common applications of root-finding algorithms in finance is the calculation of a bond's yield, which is the interest rate that equates the present value of its future cash flows to its current market price. Since the bond price is a monotonic function of the yield, the bisection method is a perfectly suitable and robust tool for this task.\n\nIn this hands-on coding exercise [@problem_id:2437995], you will implement the bisection algorithm to compute the Yield-to-Call (YTC) for a callable bond. This task bridges the gap between abstract algorithm and concrete application, giving you direct experience in building a function from financial principles and using the bisection method to solve for a key financial metric.", "problem": "You are tasked with computing the annual nominal Yield-to-Call (YTC) for callable fixed-coupon bonds by numerically solving the bond pricing fixed-point equation using the bisection method. Work in purely mathematical terms and consider the following foundational base: the present value of future deterministic cash flows equals the observed market price when discounted at the correct yield. For a callable bond that is certain to be called after a specified number of future coupon periods, the cash flows consist of periodic coupons until the call date and a final combined payment at the call date equal to the last coupon plus the call price.

The task is to find the root of a non-linear equation derived from the principle of discounted cash flows. This is a standard application of numerical methods. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established financial theory, mathematically consistent, complete in its specification, and objective.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the equation $f(y) = 0$ for the annual nominal yield-to-call, $y$. The function $f(y)$ represents the difference between the present value ($PV$) of the bond's future cash flows and its observed market price, $P$. The cash flows consist of $n$ coupon payments and a final payment of the call price, $K$.\n\nThe pricing equation is given as:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1} \\frac{C}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{m}\\right)^t} + \\frac{C + K}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{m}\\right)^n}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the periodic coupon payment, $C = \\frac{\\kappa}{m} M$, $m$ is the number of coupon payments per year, and $n$ is the number of coupon periods until the call date. The function to solve is thus $f(y) = PV(y) - P$, where $PV(y)$ is the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nFor computational efficiency, we can recognize that the sum of discounted coupons is a geometric series. A more standard and equivalent representation of the present value is:\n$$\nPV(y) = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{m}\\right)^t} + \\frac{K}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{m}\\right)^n}\n$$\nThe summation term is the present value of an ordinary annuity, which has a closed-form expression. Letting $r = y/m$ be the periodic discount rate, the sum is $\\frac{C}{r}\\left(1 - (1+r)^{-n}\\right)$. Thus, the function $f(y)$ can be written as:\n$$\nf(y) = \\frac{C}{y/m}\\left(1 - \\left(1+\\frac{y}{m}\\right)^{-n}\\right) + K\\left(1+\\frac{y}{m}\\right)^{-n} - P\n$$\nThis formula is valid for $y \\neq 0$. In the special case where $y = 0$, we must evaluate the limit of the first term. Using L'Hôpital's rule on the term $\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}$ as $r \\to 0$, we find the limit is $n$. Therefore, for $y = 0$, the function is:\n$$\nf(0) = C \\cdot n + K - P\n$$\nThe derivative of the present value with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(PV)}{dy} = \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1} C \\cdot \\frac{-t}{m}\\left(1+\\frac{y}{m}\\right)^{-t-1} + (C+K) \\cdot \\frac{-n}{m}\\left(1+\\frac{y}{m}\\right)^{-n-1}\n$$\nSince all cash flows ($C, K$) are non-negative, and parameters $t, n, m$ are positive, this derivative is strictly negative for any $y$ in the valid domain ($y > -m$). This proves that $f(y)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of $y$. This property is crucial, as it guarantees that if a root exists within a given interval, it is unique. The bisection method is therefore an appropriate and robust choice for finding this root.\n\nThe bisection method is an iterative root-finding algorithm that operates on an interval $[a, b]$ where the function $f$ has opposite signs at the endpoints, i.e., $f(a) \\cdot f(b) \\le 0$. The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees at least one root exists in $[a, b]$. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n$1$. Initialize the search interval with $[y_{\\min}, y_{\\max}]$. Verify that $f(y_{\\min}) \\cdot f(y_{\\max}) \\le 0$. For this problem, the interval is given as $[-0.90, 1.00]$.\n\n$2$. Begin iteration, up to a maximum of $100000$ iterations.\n\n$3$. In each iteration, calculate the midpoint of the interval, $y_{mid} = \\frac{y_{\\min} + y_{\\max}}{2}$.\n\n$4$. Evaluate the function at the midpoint, $f(y_{mid})$.\n\n$5$. Check the stopping criteria:\n    - If the interval width $(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min})$ is less than or equal to the tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n    - Or if the absolute value of the function at the midpoint, $|f(y_{mid})|$, is less than or equal to $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n    - If either condition is met, the algorithm terminates and $y_{mid}$ is the approximate root.\n\n$6$. If stopping criteria are not met, update the interval. Since $f(y)$ is monotonic decreasing:\n    - If $f(y_{mid})  0$, the root must lie in the upper half of the interval. We set $y_{\\min} = y_{mid}$.\n    - If $f(y_{mid})  0$, the root must lie in the lower half. We set $y_{\\max} = y_{mid}$.\n    - If $f(y_{mid}) = 0$, the exact root is found, and we can terminate.\n\n$7$. Repeat from step $3$.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented and applied to each of the three test cases provided. For each case, the parameters $(M, \\kappa, m, n, K, P)$ define a specific instance of the function $f(y)$. The implementation will use the numerically stable and efficient closed-form expression for the present value, with special handling for the $y=0$ case.\n\nThe parameters for the three cases are:\n- Case A: $(M, \\kappa, m, n, K, P) = (1000, 0.06, 2, 1, 1010, 1000)$.\n- Case B: $(M, \\kappa, m, n, K, P) = (1000, 0.06, 2, 10, 1000, 1000)$.\n- Case C: $(M, \\kappa, m, n, K, P) = (1000, 0.00, 2, 4, 1000, 822.7024747919322)$.\n\nThe numerical settings are $y_{\\min} = -0.90$, $y_{\\max} = 1.00$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$, and maximum iterations = $100000$.

The IVT states that for a function $f$ that is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, there must exist at least one point $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=0$.\n\nIn the given scenario, the interval is $[a,b]$ where $a  -1  b$. The function $f(r)$ is discontinuous at $r=-1$. Consequently, the primary hypothesis of the IVT is violated. Therefore, even if $f(a)f(b)  0$, we cannot conclude that a root exists in $(a,b)$. The sign change can occur across the singularity at $r=-1$. For example, as $r \\to -1^+$, the sum $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$ tends to $+\\infty$ (since $C_t \\ge 0$ with at least one $C_t  0$), so $f(r) \\to +\\infty$. As $r \\to -1^-$, the signs of the terms $(1+r)^t$ will alternate depending on whether $t$ is even or odd, but the magnitude will still diverge. This discontinuity means a sign change is not indicative of a root.\n\nThe bisection algorithm proceeds by calculating the midpoint $c_k = (a_k+b_k)/2$ and evaluating $f(c_k)$. If the initial interval $[a,b]$ contains $-1$, the sequence of midpoints may eventually attempt to evaluate $f(r)$ at or very close to $r=-1$. This will result in a fatal error (division by zero) or a numerical overflow (a very large floating-point number), causing the algorithm to fail. The logic of narrowing the bracket based on the sign of $f(c_k)$ collapses because the evaluation itself is compromised.\n\nTo create a robust algorithm, one must respect the domain of the function $f(r)$. From a financial perspective, the discount factor $1+r$ must be positive, which implies $r > -1$. A yield of $-100\\%$ or lower is economically meaningless, as it implies an infinite or negative present value for positive future cash flows. The search for YTM must be restricted to the domain $r \\in (-1, \\infty)$.\n\nA robust procedure must therefore:\n1.  Ensure the initial search interval $[a,b]$ is chosen such that $a > -1$.\n2.  Verify that a valid bracket is found within this domain, i.e., $f(a)f(b)  0$ for $-1  a  b$.\n\nA more sophisticated technique to enforce the domain constraint is to reparameterize the problem. Let $x = \\log(1+r)$. This maps the domain $r \\in (-1, \\infty)$ to the entire real line $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. The inverse transformation is $r = e^x - 1$. The function becomes:\n$$g(x) = f(e^x-1) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{C_t}{(1+(e^x-1))^t} - P_{\\text{mkt}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} C_t e^{-xt} - P_{\\text{mkt}}$$\nThis function $g(x)$ is continuous and well-behaved for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The bisection method can be applied to $g(x)$ on any real interval $[x_a, x_b]$ without risk of singularities. Once a root $x^*$ is found for $g(x)$, the corresponding yield is recovered as $r^* = e^{x^*} - 1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The bisection method will still converge as long as $f(a)f(b)  0$, because a sign change is sufficient even if $f$ is undefined at $r=-1$. No special handling is needed.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The convergence guarantee of the bisection method depends critically on the continuity of the function, which is violated here. A sign change across a singularity does not imply a root, and the algorithm is susceptible to failure when evaluating the function near the singularity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nB. The bisection method can fail or return meaningless results because $f(r)$ is undefined at $r=-1$ and not continuous on $[a,b]$; a sign change across $r=-1$ does not imply a root. Robustness requires enforcing the domain $r-1$ (for example, by reparameterizing with $x=\\log(1+r)$ so $r=e^x-1$ and bracketing in $x$), and verifying a valid bracket with $f(a)f(b)0$ entirely within the feasible domain.\nThis statement correctly identifies the mathematical failure: lack of continuity invalidates the premise of the bisection method. It correctly diagnoses that a sign change is not sufficient. It correctly identifies the valid domain for the yield, $r > -1$. It proposes a valid and standard method for ensuring robustness through reparameterization, and correctly states the need to find a proper bracket within the valid domain. This analysis is complete and accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nC. The bisection method will only be affected by numerical overflow; using a smaller tolerance for the midpoint and ignoring any non-numeric evaluations is sufficient to preserve convergence even if $[a,b]$ contains $-1$.\nThis is incorrect. The issue is a fundamental mathematical discontinuity, not just a numerical precision problem. \"Ignoring a non-numeric evaluation\" is not a coherent strategy; if the function cannot be evaluated at the midpoint, the algorithm cannot decide how to proceed. Changing the tolerance does not fix the singularity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. Because bond prices are monotone in $r$, any initial $[a,b]$ will eventually lead bisection to the YTM; floating-point arithmetic will automatically skip over $r=-1$ if encountered, so no change is necessary.\nThis is incorrect. While the bond price function is monotone for $r > -1$, this property does not allow the bisection method to overcome a singularity within its search interval. The assertion that floating-point arithmetic will \"skip over\" a point of failure is nonsensical. An operation like division by zero will cause an exception or return an IEEE $754$ special value like `Inf` or `NaN`, which will break the algorithm's control flow.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2437948"}]}
