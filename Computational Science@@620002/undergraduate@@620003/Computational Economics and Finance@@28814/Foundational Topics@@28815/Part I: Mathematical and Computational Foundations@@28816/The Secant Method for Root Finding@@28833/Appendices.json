It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete, contradiction-free specification for a numerical task. The problem asks for the implementation of a specific class of root-finding algorithm to solve several well-defined problems from computational economics and finance.\n\nThe requirements for the algorithm are:\n1.  It must be a bracketing method, ensuring the root remains between two points, $a$ and $b$, such that $f(a) \\cdot f(b) \\le 0$.\n2.  All function evaluations must occur within the current bracketing interval.\n3.  It must use interpolation, based on up to three prior points, to accelerate convergence, but fall back to a safe method if the interpolated point is not satisfactory.\n4.  It must use function evaluations only, with no derivatives.\n5.  Termination must occur when either a tolerance on the interval width, $\\varepsilon_x = 10^{-10}$, or a tolerance on the function value, $\\varepsilon_f = 10^{-10}$, is met.\n\nThese constraints describe a robust, hybrid root-finding algorithm. The standard secant method does not guarantee that iterates remain inside a bracket. Therefore, a more sophisticated method is required. The specified properties are archetypal of the methods developed by Dekker and Brent, which combine a fast, open method (like the secant method or inverse quadratic interpolation) with a safe, closed method (bisection).\n\nThe algorithm implemented here is a variant of Dekker's method, a direct precursor to Brent's method. It satisfies all problem constraints.\n\n**Algorithm Design: Dekker-Brent Method**\n\nThe core of the method is to maintain a bracket $[a, b]$ and a convention that $b$ represents the best current approximation to the root $x^{\\star}$. Thus, at every step, we ensure $|f(b)| \\le |f(a)|$.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Given an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)f(b) \\le 0$, we evaluate $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. If either endpoint is a root within tolerance $\\varepsilon_f$, we terminate. Otherwise, we establish the invariant that $|f(b)| \\le |f(a)|$ by swapping $a$ and $b$ if necessary. The point $c=a$ is stored as the *previous* best guess.\n\n2.  **Iteration**: The main loop consists of generating and evaluating a new trial point, $x_{\\text{next}}$, to shrink the bracket $[a, b]$.\n\n3.  **Trial Point Generation**:\n    *   **Interpolation Step (Secant Method)**: A trial point $s$ is computed using the secant method, which forms a line through the two most recent best guesses: the current best guess $(b, f(b))$ and the previous best guess $(c, f(c))$. The formula is:\n        $$ s = b - f(b) \\frac{b - c}{f(b) - f(c)} $$\n        This step uses two previous points ($b$ and $c$) to achieve super-linear convergence.\n    *   **Bisection Step**: A guaranteed, but slower, fallback is the bisection midpoint $m = (a+b)/2$.\n\n4.  **Hybrid Strategy**: A crucial decision is made at each step. To ensure convergence and satisfy the problem constraint that evaluations occur inside the bracket, the fast secant step $s$ is accepted only if it is \"reasonable\". A simple and effective condition, central to Dekker's method, is to accept $s$ only if it lies between the current best guess $b$ and the bisection midpoint $m$. If this condition fails, we distrust the interpolation and default to the safe bisection point $m$. This ensures $x_{\\text{next}}$ is always within the current bracket $[a, b]$.\n\n5.  **Bracket Update**: After evaluating $f(x_{\\text{next}})$, the bracket is updated. If $f(a)$ and $f(x_{\\text{next}})$ have opposite signs, the new bracket becomes $[a, x_{\\text{next}}]$; otherwise, it becomes $[x_{\\text{next}}, b]$. The new points are then relabeled to maintain the invariant that $b$ is the best guess, and the process repeats.\n\n6.  **Termination**: The loop terminates if the bracket width $|b-a| \\le \\varepsilon_x$ or the function value at the best guess $|f(b)| \\le \\varepsilon_f$.\n\n**Test Case Implementation**\n\nThe four test cases are implemented as Python functions.\n- For test case B (yield to maturity), the present value is calculated by direct summation to maintain numerical stability and correctness for yield values near zero.\n- For test case C (implied volatility), the standard normal cumulative distribution function $N(x)$ is required. It is implemented using the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$, available in Python's standard `math` library, via the relation $N(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\mathrm{erf}(x/\\sqrt{2}))$.\n- For test case D, the root is exactly at the boundary of the initial interval.
