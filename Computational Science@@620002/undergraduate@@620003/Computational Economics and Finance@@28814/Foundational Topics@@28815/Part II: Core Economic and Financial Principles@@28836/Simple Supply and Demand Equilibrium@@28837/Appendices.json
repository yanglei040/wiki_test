It is a formalizable problem within the specified domain of computational economics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe determination of the market equilibrium $(Q^*, P^*)$ requires a systematic evaluation based on the provided definitions. Two possible types of equilibrium exist: one with positive production, and one with zero production (shutdown).\n\nFirst, we identify a potential equilibrium with positive production. According to the definition, this occurs if there is a quantity $Q_e$ such that the market clears, i.e., $P_D(Q_e) = P_S(Q_e)$. This is the unconstrained equilibrium point. We solve for this quantity, which we denote as $Q_e$:\n$$\n\\alpha - \\beta Q_e = \\gamma + \\delta Q_e\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha - \\gamma = (\\beta + \\delta) Q_e\n$$\n$$\nQ_e = \\frac{\\alpha - \\gamma}{\\beta + \\delta}\n$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, the denominator $(\\beta + \\delta)$ is always positive. The corresponding equilibrium price, $P_e$, is found by substituting $Q_e$ back into either the demand or supply function:\n$$\nP_e = P_D(Q_e) = \\alpha - \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - \\gamma}{\\beta + \\delta} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha(\\beta + \\delta) - \\beta(\\alpha - \\gamma)}{\\beta + \\delta} = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta + \\beta\\gamma}{\\beta + \\delta}\n$$\nGiven the constraints $\\alpha > 0, \\beta > 0, \\delta > 0, \\gamma \\ge 0$, the price $P_e$ is always non-negative.\n\nThe problem states that for a positive-production equilibrium, we must have $Q^* \\ge Q_{min}$. The only candidate for such an equilibrium is $(Q_e, P_e)$, because only at this point is the condition $P_D(Q^*) = P_S(Q^*)$ satisfied. Therefore, the central logical test is whether this unconstrained equilibrium $(Q_e, P_e)$ is feasible given the minimum capacity constraint $Q_{min}$.\n\nThis leads to a simple, dichotomous logic:\n\n**Case 1: The unconstrained equilibrium is feasible.**\nThis condition holds if and only if $Q_e \\ge Q_{min}$.\nIf this is true, the factory can and will produce at the market-clearing quantity $Q_e$. All conditions for an operating equilibrium are met: $Q_e \\ge Q_{min}$, $P_D(Q_e) = P_S(Q_e)$, and $P_e \\ge 0$.\nThus, the market equilibrium is $(Q^*, P^*) = (Q_e, P_e)$.\n\n**Case 2: The unconstrained equilibrium is not feasible.**\nThis condition holds if and only if $Q_e < Q_{min}$. This covers two scenarios:\n  a) The curves intersect at a positive quantity that is too small ($0 \\le Q_e < Q_{min}$).\n  b) The curves do not intersect at a non-negative quantity ($\\alpha \\le \\gamma$, leading to $Q_e \\le 0$).\n\nIn either scenario, the only point where $P_D(Q) = P_S(Q)$ occurs at a quantity less than $Q_{min}$. For any quantity $Q \\ge Q_{min}$, it holds that $Q > Q_e$. Since the function $P_D(Q) - P_S(Q) = (\\alpha - \\gamma) - (\\beta + \\delta)Q$ is strictly decreasing in $Q$, for any $Q > Q_e$ we have $P_D(Q) < P_S(Q)$. This means that for any production level at or above the minimum capacity, the price consumers are willing to pay is less than the price the supplier requires. Production is therefore unprofitable at any feasible level. The factory will not operate.\n\nIn this case, the market defaults to the shutdown equilibrium defined in the problem statement: market supply is zero, and the equilibrium is $(Q^*, P^*) = (0, \\alpha)$.\n\n**Algorithmic Summary:**\n1. Given parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, Q_{min})$, calculate the unconstrained equilibrium quantity $Q_e = \\frac{\\alpha - \\gamma}{\\beta + \\delta}$.\n2. If $Q_e \\ge Q_{min}$, the equilibrium is $Q^* = Q_e$ and $P^* = \\alpha - \\beta Q_e$.\n3. If $Q_e < Q_{min}$, the equilibrium is $Q^* = 0$ and $P^* = \\alpha$.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented to solve for the given test cases.

This exercise [@problem_id:2429889] demonstrates how to resolve this interdependence by formulating a fixed-point problem and deriving a \"reduced-form\" inverse demand curve. We will then apply this sophisticated model to a classic policy question—calculating the deadweight loss from a tax—to illustrate how advanced equilibrium analysis serves as a crucial tool for modern welfare economics.", "problem": "Consider a single-good competitive market with linear supply and linear demand subject to a linear network externality on the demand side. There is a specific (per-unit) tax charged to consumers. You must compute, numerically and exactly, the deadweight loss (DWL) of the tax for several parameter sets.\n\nFundamental primitives and definitions:\n- The inverse supply schedule is given by $P_S(Q) = s_0 + s_1 Q$, where $s_1 > 0$, $Q \\ge 0$, and $P_S(Q)$ is the price received by producers.\n- The direct demand with a linear network externality is given by $Q_D(P_c, Q) = a - b P_c + m Q$, where $b > 0$, $m < 1$, $Q \\ge 0$, and $P_c$ is the price paid by consumers. The parameter $m$ captures the network effect: a higher $m$ increases demand as the equilibrium quantity $Q$ rises.\n- A specific tax with rate $t \\ge 0$ is levied on consumers, so that consumers pay $P_c = P + t$ while producers receive $P$, where $P$ is the market price consistent with the supply schedule.\n- Market equilibrium under any tax rate $t$ is defined by the fixed-point system $Q = Q_D(P + t, Q)$ and $P = P_S(Q)$, together with the feasibility constraint $Q \\ge 0$.\n- Total surplus at a given equilibrium quantity $Q$ is defined as the area between the private marginal willingness-to-pay schedule (inverse demand) and the inverse supply schedule, that is, the definite integral over quantity of inverse demand minus inverse supply from $0$ to $Q$. Deadweight loss (DWL) of the tax is the loss in total surplus that is not offset by government revenue, equivalently the difference between the no-tax total surplus and the with-tax total surplus that includes government revenue.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the fundamental definitions above, derive the reduced-form inverse demand (private marginal willingness-to-pay as a function of $Q$) that is consistent with the fixed-point demand $Q_D(P_c, Q)$ and the linear network externality parameter $m$. Then, using the condition $P_S(Q) = P$, formulate the no-tax equilibrium quantity $Q_0$ and the with-tax equilibrium quantity $Q_t$ as functions of the primitives $(a, b, m, s_0, s_1, t)$, imposing the feasibility constraint $Q \\ge 0$.\n2. Using the standard total surplus definition as the definite integral from $0$ to $Q$ of inverse demand minus inverse supply, express deadweight loss (DWL) as a function of $Q_0$ and $Q_t$ and the primitives $(a, b, m, s_0, s_1)$.

It is a standard microeconomic model of supply and demand with a network externality and taxation. All terms are defined formally and without ambiguity. The parameters are constrained ($s_1 > 0, b > 0, m < 1$) to ensure well-behaved supply and demand functions, leading to a unique, stable equilibrium. The tasks are a direct application of economic principles to the given model. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or missing information. The problem is a formal exercise in computational economics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the reduced-form inverse demand schedule, which represents the private marginal willingness-to-pay. This is found by rearranging the direct demand function, $Q = a - b P_c + m Q$, to solve for the consumer price $P_c$ as a function of quantity $Q$.\n$$Q(1-m) = a - b P_c$$\n$$b P_c = a - (1-m)Q$$\nThe inverse demand schedule, which we denote $P_D(Q)$, is therefore:\n$$P_D(Q) = \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{1-m}{b}Q$$\nSince $m < 1$ and $b > 0$, the slope $-\\frac{1-m}{b}$ is negative, which is consistent with a downward-sloping demand curve. The inverse supply schedule is given as $P_S(Q) = s_0 + s_1 Q$.\n\nSecond, we determine the market equilibrium quantity. Equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. The price consumers are willing to pay, $P_D(Q)$, must equal the price suppliers require, $P_S(Q)$, plus any per-unit tax, $t$. The equilibrium condition is $P_D(Q) = P_S(Q) + t$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_D(Q)$ and $P_S(Q)$:\n$$\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{1-m}{b}Q = (s_0 + s_1 Q) + t$$\nWe solve for the equilibrium quantity $Q$, which we denote $Q_t$ for a tax rate $t$:\n$$\\frac{a}{b} - s_0 - t = s_1 Q + \\frac{1-m}{b}Q$$\n$$\\frac{a - bs_0 - bt}{b} = \\left(\\frac{bs_1 + 1 - m}{b}\\right)Q_t$$\n$$Q_t = \\frac{a - bs_0 - bt}{1 - m + bs_1}$$\nThe denominator $1 - m + bs_1$ is strictly positive given $m < 1$, $b > 0$, and $s_1 > 0$. The quantity $Q_t$ must be non-negative. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity is:\n$$Q_t = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{a - bs_0 - bt}{1 - m + bs_1}\\right)$$\nThe no-tax equilibrium quantity, $Q_0$, is the special case where $t=0$:\n$$Q_0 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{a - bs_0}{1 - m + bs_1}\\right)$$\n\nThird, we derive the formula for deadweight loss (DWL). DWL is the loss of total surplus resulting from the tax. Total surplus is the area between the private inverse demand curve $P_D(Q)$ and the inverse supply curve $P_S(Q)$. The tax causes the quantity to move from the efficient level $Q_0$ to the distorted level $Q_t$. The DWL is the surplus lost on this quantity reduction, which is the definite integral of the difference between the demand and supply curves from $Q_t$ to $Q_0$.\n$$DWL = \\int_{Q_t}^{Q_0} [P_D(Q) - P_S(Q)] dQ$$\nLet the integrand be $f(Q) = P_D(Q) - P_S(Q)$.\n$$f(Q) = \\left(\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{1-m}{b}Q\\right) - (s_0 + s_1 Q) = \\left(\\frac{a}{b} - s_0\\right) - \\left(s_1 + \\frac{1-m}{b}\\right)Q$$\nThis is a linear function of $Q$. The integral represents the area of a trapezoid. A more robust method is to use this functional form directly. Let $C_1 = s_1 + \\frac{1-m}{b}$ be the magnitude of the slope of $f(Q)$. The integral becomes:\n$$DWL = \\int_{Q_t}^{Q_0} f(Q) dQ = \\left[\\left(\\frac{a}{b} - s_0\\right)Q - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(s_1 + \\frac{1-m}{b}\\right)Q^2\\right]_{Q_t}^{Q_0}$$\nThis expression can be simplified. Note that $Q_0 - Q_t = \\frac{bt}{1 - m + bs_1} = \\frac{t}{C_1}$. The area of the trapezoid is also given by $\\frac{1}{2}(f(Q_t) + f(Q_0))(Q_0 - Q_t)$.\nIf $Q_0 > 0$, then $f(Q_0) = P_D(Q_0) - P_S(Q_0) = 0$.\nIf $Q_t > 0$, then $f(Q_t) = P_D(Q_t) - P_S(Q_t) = t$. In this interior case, $DWL = \\frac{1}{2}(t+0)(Q_0 - Q_t)$.\nHowever, if the tax is prohibitive such that $Q_t=0$ while $Q_0>0$, this simple formula is incorrect. The DWL becomes the entire initial surplus.\nA universally correct formula is derived from the properties of the linear functions:\n$$DWL = \\frac{1}{2} C_1 (Q_0 - Q_t)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(s_1 + \\frac{1-m}{b}\\right) (Q_0 - Q_t)^2$$\nThis formula correctly computes the area of the surplus triangle/trapezoid for all cases, including interior solutions ($Q_t > 0$), corner solutions where the tax drives quantity to zero ($Q_t = 0$), and the no-tax case ($t=0$, where $Q_t=Q_0$ and $DWL=0$).\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each set of parameters $(a, b, m, s_0, s_1, t)$:\n2. Calculate the common denominator: $D = 1 - m + b s_1$.\n3. Calculate the no-tax equilibrium quantity: $Q_0 = \\max(0, (a - b s_0) / D)$.\n4. Calculate the with-tax equilibrium quantity: $Q_t = \\max(0, (a - b s_0 - b t) / D)$.\n5. Calculate the slope coefficient: $C_1 = s_1 + (1 - m) / b$.\n6. Calculate the deadweight loss: $DWL = 0.5 \\times C_1 \\times (Q_0 - Q_t)^2$.\n7.
