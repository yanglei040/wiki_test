The concept of a risk-free asset being subject to default risk (e.g., sovereign credit risk for government bonds) is a standard and important extension of the basic MPT models. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the qualitative change in the geometry of the investment opportunity set when a core assumption (existence of a truly risk-free asset) is relaxed. The new geometry is uniquely determined by the principles of portfolio mathematics.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language common to finance and economics. There is no ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a clear, consistent, and scientifically sound question within the domain of computational economics and finance. A rigorous derivation can proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nLet us first establish the baseline case, which is the standard Capital Allocation Line (CAL). Let $R_f$ be the return of a truly risk-free asset, so its expected return is $E[R_f] = r_f$ and its variance is $\\text{Var}(R_f) = \\sigma_f^2 = 0$. Let $P$ be a risky portfolio with expected return $E[R_P] = \\mu_P$ and standard deviation $\\text{StdDev}(R_P) = \\sigma_P > 0$.\n\nA new portfolio, $N$, is constructed with a weight $w$ in the risky portfolio $P$ and $(1-w)$ in the risk-free asset.\nThe expected return of this portfolio is:\n$$ \\mu_N = w \\mu_P + (1-w) r_f $$\nThe variance of the portfolio is:\n$$ \\sigma_N^2 = w^2 \\sigma_P^2 + (1-w)^2 \\sigma_f^2 + 2w(1-w)\\text{Cov}(R_P, R_f) $$\nSince the risk-free asset has zero variance, $\\sigma_f = 0$, and its covariance with any other asset is also zero. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_N^2 = w^2 \\sigma_P^2 \\implies \\sigma_N = |w| \\sigma_P $$\nAssuming the investor takes a long position in the risky asset ($w \\ge 0$), we have $w = \\sigma_N / \\sigma_P$. Substituting this into the expected return equation:\n$$ \\mu_N = r_f + \\frac{\\sigma_N}{\\sigma_P}(\\mu_P - r_f) = r_f + \\left( \\frac{\\mu_P - r_f}{\\sigma_P} \\right) \\sigma_N $$\nThis is the equation of a straight line in the $(\\sigma, \\mu)$ plane, with a vertical-axis intercept at $(0, r_f)$. This line is the CAL.\n\nNow, we introduce the modification described in the problem. The \"risk-free\" asset is replaced by a defaultable \"cash\" asset, which we will call $C$. Let its return be the random variable $R_C$. The problem states it has a default probability $p_d \\in (0,1)$ and thus a positive variance. Let's formalize this. Suppose the asset yields a return $r_{ok}$ in the no-default state (with probability $1-p_d$) and a lower return $r_{fail}$ in the default state (with probability $p_d$).\nThe expected return is $\\mu_C = E[R_C] = (1-p_d)r_{ok} + p_d r_{fail}$.\nThe variance is $\\sigma_C^2 = \\text{Var}(R_C) = p_d(1-p_d)(r_{ok} - r_{fail})^2$. Since $p_d \\in (0,1)$ and $r_{ok} \\neq r_{fail}$ for the risk to be meaningful, it is clear that $\\sigma_C^2 > 0$.\n\nThus, the investor is now combining two risky assets: the portfolio $P$ (with characteristics $\\mu_P, \\sigma_P$) and the defaultable asset $C$ (with characteristics $\\mu_C, \\sigma_C > 0$).\nLet's form a new portfolio, $N'$, with weight $w$ in $P$ and $(1-w)$ in $C$.\nThe expected return is:\n$$ \\mu_{N'} = w \\mu_P + (1-w) \\mu_C $$\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{N'}^2 = w^2 \\sigma_P^2 + (1-w)^2 \\sigma_C^2 + 2w(1-w)\\rho_{PC}\\sigma_P\\sigma_C $$\nwhere $\\rho_{PC}$ is the correlation coefficient between the returns of $P$ and $C$. Default risk is typically a component of systematic risk, so it is reasonable to assume $\\rho_{PC}$ is not zero.\n\nThis is the standard formulation for a portfolio of two risky assets. The set of attainable $(\\sigma_{N'}, \\mu_{N'})$ pairs, as the weight $w$ is varied, traces out a hyperbola in the mean-standard deviation plane. It is not a straight line unless in the degenerate case where $\\rho_{PC} = \\pm 1$.\n\nKey consequences are:\n1.  **Curvature**: The opportunity set is no longer linear. It is a curve (a branch of a hyperbola).\n2.  **No Zero-Risk Intercept**: The defaultable asset $C$ itself has a positive standard deviation $\\sigma_C > 0$. The portfolio consisting of $100\\%$ of asset $C$ is represented by the point $(\\sigma_C, \\mu_C)$. The minimum-variance portfolio that can be formed by combining $P$ and $C$ will also have a positive variance (unless $\\rho_{PC}=-1$ and weights are precisely chosen, which is a specific case and not a general property). Therefore, the new opportunity set does not touch the vertical axis where $\\sigma=0$.\n3.  **Dominated by Original CAL**: The original CAL represented the best possible risk-return trade-offs. Introducing an imperfection (risk in the \"risk-free\" asset) must result in a strictly worse set of investment opportunities. The new curved frontier will lie \"inward\" from the original straight-line CAL, meaning for any given level of risk $\\sigma > \\sigma_C$, the achievable expected return $\\mu_{N'}$ will be lower than the return on the original CAL.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The CAL is unchanged: it remains a straight line through the risk-free rate because a small $p_d$ only lowers the expected return but does not affect the geometry.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The presence of default risk, $p_d > 0$, fundamentally changes the nature of the \"cash\" asset from risk-free to risky ($\\sigma_C > 0$). The combination of two risky assets yields a curved (hyperbolic) opportunity set, not a straight line. The geometry is profoundly affected.\n\n**B. The CAL remains a straight line and simply shifts to start at the expected return of the defaultable asset, with the same slope as before.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. It makes two errors. First, the opportunity set is not a straight line. Second, it cannot \"start\" on the vertical axis, as the defaultable asset itself has positive risk, $\\sigma_C > 0$.\n\n**C. The CAL ceases to be a straight line: with $p_d>0$ the “cash” asset has positive variance and generally non-zero covariance with the risky portfolio, so the set of attainable mean–standard deviation pairs from mixing the two is curved; there is no zero-variance intercept, and the attainable set shifts inward relative to the true risk-free case.**\nThis is **Correct**. This option accurately summarizes all the consequences of the modification.\n- \"ceases to be a straight line... is curved\": Correct, it becomes a hyperbola.\n- \"`cash` asset has positive variance\": Correct, as derived $\\sigma_C^2 > 0$.\n- \"generally non-zero covariance\": Correct, as default events are typically linked to broader market conditions.\n- \"no zero-variance intercept\": Correct, the minimum variance portfolio has $\\sigma_{min} > 0$.\n- \"attainable set shifts inward\": Correct, the new opportunity set is dominated by the original CAL.\n\n**D. The CAL becomes steeper because the default risk adds a spread to the “risk-free” asset’s expected return that dominates the added variance.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The primary flaw is that the opportunity set is no longer a line, so describing its \"slope\" as \"steeper\" is meaningless. The premise that default risk adds a spread to the expected return is also a confusing statement in this context; if anything, for a given promised return, default risk lowers the expected return.\n\n**E. The CAL becomes a straight line with a kink at the tangency portfolio due to default risk, but still intercepts the vertical axis at the defaultable asset’s expected return.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. A kinked line is not the correct shape; the shape is a smooth hyperbola. Furthermore, the set does not intercept the vertical axis.

All terms are mathematically defined, and the premises are standard in quantitative finance. The problem is therefore valid, and we proceed to find the solution.\n\nFirst, we formalize the objective function. The convexity $C$ is found by differentiating the portfolio return function twice with respect to $R_{m}$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dr_{p}}{dR_{m}} = \\frac{d}{dR_{m}} \\left( w_{1}R_{m} + w_{2}(R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2}) \\right) = w_{1} + 2w_{2}R_{m}$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}r_{p}}{dR_{m}^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dR_{m}} (w_{1} + 2w_{2}R_{m}) = 2w_{2}$$\nThe local convexity is this second derivative evaluated at $R_{m}=0$. As the second derivative is a constant, the local convexity is simply $C = 2w_{2}$.\nTherefore, maximizing the local convexity is equivalent to maximizing the weight $w_{2}$.\n\nNext, we apply the constraints to find the permissible values for $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$.\n\nConstraint 1: Zero first-order sensitivity at $R_{m}=0$.\nWe evaluate the first derivative at $R_{m}=0$:\n$$\\frac{dr_{p}}{dR_{m}}|_{R_{m}=0} = w_{1} + 2w_{2}(0) = w_{1}$$\nThe constraint requires this to be zero, so we have:\n$$w_{1} = 0$$\nThis result is significant. It implies that for the portfolio to have zero first-order sensitivity to market movements around $R_{m}=0$ (a property known as delta-neutrality in options terminology), it must have no exposure to the linear market factor $R_{m}$. The portfolio return function simplifies to:\n$$r_{p}(R_{m}) = w_{2}(R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2})$$\n\nConstraint 2: Unit variance of the portfolio return.\nWe must compute the variance of the simplified portfolio return:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[r_{p}(R_{m})] = \\mathrm{Var}[w_{2}(R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2})]$$\nUsing the variance property $\\mathrm{Var}[aX] = a^{2}\\mathrm{Var}[X]$ where $a$ is a constant, we get:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[r_{p}(R_{m})] = w_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2}]$$\nSince $\\sigma_{m}^{2}$ is a constant, it does not affect the variance, so $\\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2}] = \\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2}]$. The variance constraint becomes:\n$$w_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2}] = 1$$\nTo proceed, we must calculate $\\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2}]$.

For a centered Normal distribution ($X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^{2})$), the general formula for even moments is $E[X^{2n}] = (2n-1)!! \\sigma^{2n}$.\nFor $n=1$, we find the second moment:\n$$E[R_{m}^{2}] = (2(1)-1)!! \\sigma_{m}^{2(1)} = 1!! \\sigma_{m}^{2} = \\sigma_{m}^{2}$$\nThis is consistent with the definition of variance for a zero-mean variable, $\\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}] = E[R_{m}^{2}] - (E[R_{m}])^{2} = \\sigma_{m}^{2} - 0^{2} = \\sigma_{m}^{2}$.\nFor $n=2$, we find the fourth moment:\n$$E[R_{m}^{4}] = (2(2)-1)!! \\sigma_{m}^{2(2)} = 3!! \\sigma_{m}^{4} = (3 \\cdot 1) \\sigma_{m}^{4} = 3\\sigma_{m}^{4}$$\nNow we can compute the variance of $R_{m}^{2}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[R_{m}^{2}] = E[R_{m}^{4}] - (E[R_{m}^{2}])^{2} = 3\\sigma_{m}^{4} - (\\sigma_{m}^{2})^{2} = 3\\sigma_{m}^{4} - \\sigma_{m}^{4} = 2\\sigma_{m}^{4}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the variance constraint equation:\n$$w_{2}^{2} (2\\sigma_{m}^{4}) = 1$$\nSolving for $w_{2}^{2}$:\n$$w_{2}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m}^{4}}$$\nThis gives two possible solutions for $w_{2}$:\n$$w_{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m}^{4}}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{m}^{2}}$$\nOur objective is to maximize $w_{2}$. Comparing the two possible values, we must choose the positive root. The optimal weight $w_{2}$ is therefore:\n$$w_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{m}^{2}}$$\n\nHedging Properties of the Optimal Portfolio:\nThe resulting optimal portfolio has a return function given by $r_{p}^{*}(R_{m}) = w_{2}^{*}(R_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2})$, where $w_{2}^{*} = (\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{m}^{2})^{-1} > 0$.\nThe characteristics of this portfolio can be understood through its sensitivities to the market factor, known as 'Greeks' in derivatives pricing.\n1. The first-order sensitivity, or 'Delta', is $\\frac{dr_{p}^{*}}{dR_{m}} = 2w_{2}^{*}R_{m}$. At $R_{m}=0$, the Delta is zero, as imposed by the constraint. This means the portfolio is insensitive to infinitesimally small market moves around its center. It is not a directional bet on the market.\n2. The second-order sensitivity, or 'Gamma', is $\\frac{d^{2}r_{p}^{*}}{dR_{m}^{2}} = 2w_{2}^{*}$. Since $w_{2}^{*} > 0$, the portfolio has positive and constant Gamma. This is the convexity we maximized.\nA portfolio that is Delta-neutral and has positive Gamma profits from market movements, regardless of their direction. The return function $r_{p}^{*}(R_{m})$ is a parabola opening upwards, with its minimum at $R_{m}=0$. For any non-zero market return $R_{m}$, the term $R_{m}^{2}$ is positive, and the portfolio's return increases as the magnitude $|R_{m}|$ increases. This payoff structure is characteristic of a long volatility position, such as a long options straddle.\nTherefore, this portfolio acts as a hedge against market stability. An investor holding this portfolio profits from large market shocks (high realized volatility) and incurs a loss if the market remains static (which it does in expectation, as $E[r_{p}^{*}(R_{m})] = w_{2}^{*}(E[R_{m}^{2}] - \\sigma_{m}^{2}) = w_{2}^{*}(\\sigma_{m}^{2} - \\sigma_{m}^{2}) = 0$). It is an instrument designed to provide returns when the market experiences a move larger than what is implicitly priced in. Conversely, it could be used to hedge a position that is 'short volatility'—one that loses money during large market swings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{m}^{2}}}$$", "id": "2374842"}]}
