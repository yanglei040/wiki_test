{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Deep learning models can often feel like 'black boxes,' but their fundamental operations are built on understandable mathematical principles. This first practice problem demystifies one of the core components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – the filter. By asking you to design a filter from scratch to perfectly detect a specific biological motif (the Shine-Dalgarno sequence), you will gain a concrete intuition for how these networks learn to recognize patterns in sequence data [@problem_id:2373361].", "problem": "A prokaryotic messenger ribonucleic acid sequence is encoded for input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a one-hot tensor over the alphabet $\\{A,C,G,U\\}$. At each nucleotide position $i$, the encoding is a column vector $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}^{4}$ with channel order $(A,C,G,U)$, where exactly one entry equals $1$ and the others equal $0$. Consider a one-dimensional convolutional filter with kernel size $k=6$, input channels $4$, a single output channel, weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 6}$, and scalar bias $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Provide your answer as a single row vector by flattening $W$ column-wise in the order $[A_0, C_0, G_0, U_0, A_1, C_1, G_1, U_1, \\dots, A_5, C_5, G_5, U_5]$ and then appending $b$ as the final entry, yielding a vector of length $25$. Express all entries as exact integers. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a clear task in designing a component of a convolutional neural network for a specific bioinformatics application.\n\nThe task is to design a one-dimensional convolutional filter, defined by its weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 6}$ and scalar bias $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, that acts as a perfect detector for the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence `AGGAGG`. The filter's score $s$ must equal $6$ if the length-$6$ input window is exactly `AGGAGG`, and must be strictly less than $6$ for any other sequence.\n\nThe input at each position $i$ is a one-hot encoded vector $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$ corresponding to one of the four nucleotides in the alphabet $\\{A, C, G, U\\}$, with the channel order $(A, C, G, U)$. For a given nucleotide, only the corresponding entry in its vector representation is $1$, while all others are $0$. Let the weight vector for position $i$ be the $i$-th column of $W$, denoted as $w_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The components of $w_i$ are $(w_{i,A}, w_{i,C}, w_{i,G}, w_{i,U})^{\\top}$. The filter's score for a window $(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_5)$ is given by:\n$$s = \\sum_{i=0}^{5} w_i^{\\top} x_i + b$$\nDue to the one-hot encoding, the dot product $w_i^{\\top} x_i$ serves to select exactly one weight from the vector $w_i$. If the nucleotide at position $i$ is $N_i$, then $w_i^{\\top} x_i = w_{i, N_i}$. The score can thus be rewritten as:\n$$s = \\sum_{i=0}^{5} w_{i, N_i} + b$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the nucleotide at position $i$ in the input window.\n\nThe target sequence is $S^* = \\text{AGGAGG}$. The corresponding sequence of nucleotides is $(N^*_0, N^*_1, N^*_2, N^*_3, N^*_4, N^*_5) = (A, G, G, A, G, G)$.\nOur objective is to create a matched filter. For each position $i$, the filter should assign the highest possible score contribution if the nucleotide $N_i$ matches the target $N^*_i$, and a lower contribution otherwise. To maximize the score for the target sequence and penalize any deviation, we will assign a weight of $1$ for a match at each position and a lesser value for a mismatch. The most straightforward design, which we will adopt, is to set the weight for a mismatch to $0$.\n\nFormally, for each position $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 5\\}$, we define the weights $w_{i,N}$ for each nucleotide $N \\in \\{A, C, G, U\\}$ as follows:\n$$w_{i,N} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } N = N^*_i \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } N \\neq N^*_i \\end{cases}$$\n\nApplying this rule to the target sequence `AGGAGG`:\n-   For $i=0$, $N^*_0 = A$. So, $w_{0,A}=1$ and $w_{0,C}=w_{0,G}=w_{0,U}=0$. Thus, $w_0 = [1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}$.\n-   For $i=1$, $N^*_1 = G$. So, $w_{1,G}=1$ and $w_{1,A}=w_{1,C}=w_{1,U}=0$. Thus, $w_1 = [0, 0, 1, 0]^{\\top}$.\n-   For $i=2$, $N^*_2 = G$. So, $w_{2,G}=1$ and $w_{2,A}=w_{2,C}=w_{2,U}=0$. Thus, $w_2 = [0, 0, 1, 0]^{\\top}$.\n-   For $i=3$, $N^*_3 = A$. So, $w_{3,A}=1$ and $w_{3,C}=w_{3,G}=w_{3,U}=0$. Thus, $w_3 = [1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}$.\n-   For $i=4$, $N^*_4 = G$. So, $w_{4,G}=1$ and $w_{4,A}=w_{4,C}=w_{4,U}=0$. Thus, $w_4 = [0, 0, 1, 0]^{\\top}$.\n-   For $i=5$, $N^*_5 = G$. So, $w_{5,G}=1$ and $w_{5,A}=w_{5,C}=w_{5,U}=0$. Thus, $w_5 = [0, 0, 1, 0]^{\\top}$.\n\nNow we determine the bias $b$. The first condition states that if the input is the target sequence `AGGAGG`, the score must be $s=6$. For this sequence, every nucleotide $N_i$ equals the target nucleotide $N^*_i$. The score contribution from each position is therefore $w_{i,N^*_i} = 1$.\nThe total score $s^*$ is:\n$$s^* = \\sum_{i=0}^{5} w_{i,N^*_i} + b = (1+1+1+1+1+1) + b = 6 + b$$\nTo satisfy the condition $s^*=6$, we must have $6+b=6$, which implies $b=0$.\n\nNow we must verify the second condition: for any input sequence other than `AGGAGG`, the score must be strictly less than $6$.\nLet an arbitrary input sequence be $(N_0, N_1, \\dots, N_5)$. The score is $s = \\sum_{i=0}^5 w_{i,N_i} + 0$.\nThe contribution from each position, $w_{i,N_i}$, is $1$ if $N_i = N^*_i$ (a match) and $0$ if $N_i \\neq N^*_i$ (a mismatch).\nThe total score $s$ is therefore equal to the number of positions where the input sequence matches the target sequence `AGGAGG`. Let this number of matches be $m$. Then $s=m$.\nIf the input sequence is not `AGGAGG`, it must have at least one mismatch. Therefore, the number of matches $m$ must be less than $6$, i.e., $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nThis means the score will be $s = m \\le 5$, which satisfies the condition $s  6$.\nThe design is therefore correct.\n\nThe weight matrix $W$ is formed by these column vectors:\n$$W = \\begin{pmatrix} w_0  w_1  w_2  w_3  w_4  w_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  1  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe bias is $b=0$.\n\nThe final answer must be a single row vector obtained by flattening $W$ column-wise and appending $b$.\nThe flattened vector from $W$ is $[w_{0,A}, w_{0,C}, w_{0,G}, w_{0,U}, w_{1,A}, \\dots, w_{5,U}]$.\nThis corresponds to concatenating the transposes of the column vectors $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_5$.\nFlattened $W$: $[1, 0, 0, 0, \\quad 0, 0, 1, 0, \\quad 0, 0, 1, 0, \\quad 1, 0, 0, 0, \\quad 0, 0, 1, 0, \\quad 0, 0, 1, 0]$.\nAppending the bias $b=0$ at the end gives the final vector of length $25$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2373361"}, {"introduction": "A successful deep learning model is not just one with a clever architecture, but one that has been trained to be robust and to generalize well to new, unseen data. Data augmentation is a critical technique for achieving this, especially in bioinformatics where data can be limited or contain systematic biases. This exercise challenges you to think like a machine learning practitioner, evaluating different data augmentation strategies for a gene-finding model and reasoning about their biological validity and impact on model robustness [@problem_id:2373380].", "problem": "You are training a deep sequence model $f_{\\theta}$ for gene finding in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) that maps a one-hot encoded window $x \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}^{L}$ of fixed length $L$ to a binary label $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether a true splice donor site occurs anywhere within the window, irrespective of strand. During training you consider three label-preserving input augmentations:\n\n1) Random within-window shifts: for each $x$, sample an integer offset $\\delta$ uniformly from $\\{-s,-s+1,\\dots, s\\}$ with $s \\ll L$, apply a circular shift by $\\delta$ positions (so that the multiset of $k$-mers is preserved and the annotated site remains inside the window by construction), and keep the same label $y$.\n\n2) Strand symmetrization: you consider either pure reversal of the sequence order or the reverse-complement transform that reverses the order and complements each nucleotide ($A \\leftrightarrow T$, $C \\leftrightarrow G$). Labels are defined to be strand-agnostic.\n\n3) Sparse random point mutations: for each non-critical position (positions not part of the minimal motif required to define $y=1$), independently with probability $\\mu$ (where $0  \\mu \\ll 1$), replace the nucleotide with a uniformly sampled different base from $\\{A,C,G,T\\} \\setminus \\{\\text{current base}\\}$, and keep the same label $y$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly explain why these augmentations can help train a robust model and what pitfalls must be avoided?

Apply a circular shift by $\\delta$ to $x$. The label $y$ is preserved.\n-   **Augmentation 2 (Strand Symmetrization)**: Two methods are considered: (a) pure reversal of the sequence order, and (b) the reverse-complement transform (reversal of order followed by complementing nucleotides: $A \\leftrightarrow T$, $C \\leftrightarrow G$). Labels are defined as strand-agnostic.\n-   **Augmentation 3 (Sparse Random Point Mutations)**: For each non-critical position (not part of the minimal splice donor motif), replace the nucleotide with a different base, chosen uniformly, with an independent probability $\\mu$, where $0  \\mu \\ll 1$. The label $y$ is preserved.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in computational biology and deep learning. Splice site prediction is a canonical problem. The input representation (one-hot DNA), model class (deep sequence model), and augmentation techniques (shifts, reverse-complement, point mutations) are standard in the field. The distinction between pure reversal and reverse-complement is biologically critical and correctly presented as two distinct possibilities to evaluate.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a qualitative analysis of the effects of specific data augmentations. The descriptions are sufficiently clear to allow for rigorous reasoning based on established principles of machine learning and molecular biology. A meaningful analysis is possible.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, technical language and is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information. There are no internal contradictions. The term \"strand-agnostic\" is a key concept, and the problem correctly prompts an evaluation of how to implement this property (reversal vs. reverse-complement).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-formulated conceptual question about standard practices in deep learning for genomics. I will proceed with the detailed analysis of each option.\n\n**Analysis of the Augmentations and Evaluation of Options**\n\n**Option A: By exposing $f_{\\theta}$ to random within-window shifts that preserve $y$, the training implicitly encourages approximate invariance of $f_{\\theta}$ to translations within the window, restricting the effective hypothesis class to functions that do not overfit absolute coordinates, which can reduce generalization error at a fixed sample size.**\n-   **Reasoning**: Data augmentation by applying transformations that preserve the label is a form of regularization. By training the model $f_{\\theta}$ with shifted versions of an input $x$ while keeping the label $y$ constant, the learning algorithm is implicitly penalized for producing different outputs for these equivalent inputs. This encourages the learned function to be approximately invariant to the position of the motif within the window. Limiting the model to a smaller set of functions (the hypothesis class) that exhibit this invariance property reduces the model's capacity to \"memorize\" the training data, including the absolute positions of features. For a finite-sized training set, reducing model complexity in a principled way generally leads to a lower generalization error. This statement accurately describes the theoretical motivation for translation augmentation.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: Applying a pure reversal (without complement) is a valid label-preserving symmetry for strand-agnostic splice donor detection because Watson–Crick pairing implies equivalence of reversed sequences.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This statement is biologically incorrect. The two strands of a DNA double helix have opposite polarity ($5' \\to 3'$ and $3' \\to 5'$). Biological machinery, such as RNA polymerase, reads the DNA template in a specific direction ($5' \\to 3'$). A gene on the forward ('+') strand is represented by a sequence, say $S$. The corresponding gene on the reverse ('-') strand is encoded on the complementary strand, which, when read in the standard $5' \\to 3'$ direction, corresponds to the reverse-complement of $S$. For example, the canonical splice donor motif `GT` on the forward strand corresponds to `AC` on the reverse strand (reverse of `GT` is `TG`, complement is `AC`). A pure reversal (e.g., `GT` $\\to$ `TG`) has no such biological equivalence. Therefore, pure reversal is not a valid label-preserving symmetry for this task. The justification provided is also fallacious; Watson-Crick pairing is the basis for the *complement* operation, not for equivalence of reversed sequences.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C: Reverse-complement augmentation can reduce spurious correlations between $y$ and strand-specific artifacts (for example, coverage or batch effects biased toward one strand), thereby improving robustness when deploying across different laboratories or protocols.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This is a correct and important practical consideration. High-throughput sequencing data can contain systematic biases. For instance, certain library preparation methods might lead to an over-representation of sequences from one strand. If, by chance, the training data has most positive examples on the forward strand and most negative examples on the reverse strand, a naive model might learn a spurious correlation between strand identity and the label $y$. By augmenting the training set with reverse-complemented versions of all sequences (and their corresponding labels), we force the data to be balanced with respect to strand. This prevents the model from relying on such strand-specific artifacts and forces it to learn the true, strand-invariant biological signal. This makes the model more robust and generalizable to new datasets from different sources, which may have different biases.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D: Introducing random mutations at a low rate $\\mu$ everywhere in the window, including within the canonical dinucleotide motif that defines a splice donor, is harmless because modern deep networks can learn to ignore occasional label violations.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This statement is incorrect and dangerous from a modeling perspective. The problem statement carefully specifies that mutations are introduced in \"non-critical\" positions. This option proposes mutating *everywhere*, including the essential, label-defining motif (e.g., the `GT` dinucleotide). Mutating this motif would, in most cases, abolish the biological function, meaning the correct label for the mutated sequence should be $y=0$, not $y=1$. Applying such a mutation while preserving the label is equivalent to introducing label noise. While deep networks possess some resilience to random label noise, intentionally corrupting the most informative and critical feature of a class is counterproductive. It would confuse the model and teach it an incorrect biological rule, likely degrading its performance and ability to recognize the true signal.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E: If the architecture already uses convolution with Global Average Pooling (GAP), shift augmentation is redundant and cannot improve performance because perfect shift invariance is already guaranteed.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This statement oversimplifies the properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While a combination of convolutions and global pooling is designed to achieve translation invariance, this invariance is not \"perfect\" in practice for several reasons. First, convolutions are *equivariant*, not invariant. It is the final pooling layer that induces invariance. Second, this invariance is most effective for shifts that are small relative to the feature map size and away from the boundaries. Near the edges of the input window, padding strategies ('valid', 'same', 'causal') introduce boundary effects that break perfect equivariance. The circular shift described in the problem is a particularly challenging transformation that is not naturally handled by standard convolutional layers. Thus, explicitly training the model with shifted examples (shift augmentation) helps it learn to be robust to these boundary effects and large shifts, making the learned invariance more robust than what is provided by the architecture alone. The augmentation is not redundant.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option F: Mutation augmentation that excludes label-defining positions draws training samples from a plausible neighborhood of $p(x \\mid y)$ under sequencing errors and natural polymorphisms, which can increase robustness and can improve calibration when encountering previously unseen variants at test time.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This statement provides a precise and accurate description of the benefits of the mutation strategy as defined in the problem. The process of applying sparse random mutations to non-essential parts of the sequence simulates two real-world processes: natural genetic variation (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and technical errors introduced during sequencing. By exposing the model to these slightly perturbed samples from the data distribution $p(x \\mid y)$, we are effectively regularizing it. This encourages the model to learn a decision boundary that is smoother and less sensitive to minor input variations, thereby increasing its robustness. A model trained on this enriched data is also likely to be better calibrated; its output probabilities will more accurately reflect the true posterior probability when it encounters novel variants at test time, as it has learned to generalize across a local neighborhood of sequence space rather than memorizing specific exemplars.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACF}$$", "id": "2373380"}, {"introduction": "Building a complex model like a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is an iterative process, and initial attempts often fall short of performance goals.

A reliable diagnostic workflow must employ controlled experiments to isolate the contribution of each component to the model's performance. The evaluation metric is the validation micro-$F_{1}$ score.\n\nThe core principle of scientific diagnosis is the isolation of variables. A GNN's predictive power, $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X;\\theta)$, is a function of three intertwined components: the initial information at each node ($X$), the relational structure through which information propagates ($E$), and the transformation/aggregation function that constitutes the message passing ($f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}$'s architecture). A rigorous diagnostic procedure must systematically assess the value of each component.\n\nLet us analyze each proposed workflow.\n\n**A. Train a node-wise baseline $f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}(X;\\phi)$ that ignores $E$ and compare its validation micro-$F_{1}$ to that of $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X;\\theta)$.

It measures the predictive power contained within $X$ without any graph information. If this baseline is already low, it strongly suggests the features $X$ are a primary problem.\n2.  **Isolating Graph Structure Contribution ($E$)**:\n    *   The comparison between $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X;\\theta)$ and the $f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}(X;\\phi)$ baseline directly quantifies the marginal benefit of using the graph structure $E$. If the GNN does not significantly outperform the MLP, the message passing over $E$ is not providing value.\n    *   The degree-preserving edge rewiring experiment creates a randomized graph $G'$ with identical node degrees. Comparing the performance of $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X;\\theta)$ with $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G',X;\\theta)$ tests whether the *specific* connectivity of the protein-protein interaction network is important, or if the model is only learning from node degree. If performance is similar, the specific edge information in $E$ is not being effectively used.\n3.  **Isolating Feature-Node Association**: The feature permutation experiment, creating $X' = P_{\\pi}X$, breaks the link between a node and its specific features. If $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X';\\theta)$ performs similarly to the original model, it implies the model is ignoring the node features, which is a critical failure. This is a robust test for the utility of $X$ within the GNN framework.\n4.  **Isolating Message-Passing Mechanism**: Ablating the aggregation step (e.g., identity map) effectively turns the GNN into an MLP.

This makes it impossible to attribute any observed change in performance to a single cause. It violates the core tenet of controlled experimentation.\n2.  **Incorrect Model Selection Criterion**: Selecting a model based on minimum *training loss* is incorrect practice. This encourages overfitting and does not reflect the model's ability to generalize, which is measured by a validation metric.\n3.  **Spurious Diagnostic Logic**: The reasoning provided is arbitrary and not based on established machine learning principles. For example, the condition \"training loss decreases while validation micro-$F_{1}$ remains low\" is the classic definition of overfitting. Overfitting can be caused by noisy features, a noisy graph that encourages memorization, or a model that is too complex for the data. Attributing it solely to $X$ is an unsubstantiated leap. The other rules are equally baseless.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This approach is unscientific and would likely lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\n**C. Use $k$-fold cross-validation to select the learning rate and weight decay, apply early stopping on validation loss, and visualize the final-layer embeddings with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. If the visualization shows overlapping clusters between functional classes, conclude that message passing is inadequate; if clusters are separated, conclude the graph $E$ is informative; if there is no clear structure, conclude the features $X$ are at fault.**\n\nThis workflow has significant weaknesses.\n1.  **Redundancy**: The problem states that hyperparameter tuning has already been performed. Suggesting a standard tuning protocol does not address the diagnostic need.\n2.  **Subjectivity of Visualization**: t-SNE is a tool for visualization and exploratory data analysis, not for rigorous quantitative diagnosis. The resulting 2D projection is sensitive to its own hyperparameters (e.g., perplexity) and can produce visually different outputs from the same data. It does not guarantee preservation of the true high-dimensional structure.\n3.  **Ambiguous and Unreliable Logic**: The diagnostic rules are based on subjective visual interpretation and are not logically sound.\n    *   \"Overlapping clusters\" is a symptom of poor overall model performance; it could be due to bad features $X$, a noisy graph $E$, or a flawed model architecture. It does not specifically implicate message passing.\n    *   \"Separated clusters\" indicates the model has learned some separable representation, but it does not isolate the contribution of the graph $E$. A simple MLP on highly informative features $X$ could also produce well-separated clusters.\n    *   \"No clear structure\" is the expected visual result of a failing model, but it provides no information about the cause of failure.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This workflow relies on subjective and unreliable methods and fails to isolate the potential sources of error.\n\n**D. Train the original $f_{\\mathrm{GNN}}(G,X;\\theta)$ while applying edge dropout with probability $p$ during training and record the validation micro-$F_{1}$ as a function of $p$. If performance does not drop as $p$ increases toward $1$, conclude the graph $E$ is not carrying useful information; if performance drops steeply at small $p$, conclude message passing is strong. No comparison to a features-only baseline or feature randomization is needed.**\n\nThis workflow is incomplete.\n1.  **Incomplete Diagnosis**: This experiment, known as an analysis of model sensitivity to edge removal, primarily probes the importance of the graph structure $E$. It offers no mechanism to diagnose problems with the node features $X$. The problem explicitly requires a workflow to distinguish among issues in $E$, $X$, and the message-passing mechanism. This option fails to address the role of $X$.\n2.  **Weak Diagnostic Logic**: While concluding that $E$ is not useful if performance is insensitive to edge dropout is a reasonable inference, the second conclusion is weak. A steep performance drop only indicates that the model is *sensitive* to the graph structure. This does not necessarily mean the \"message passing is strong\" or learning useful information; the model could simply be overfitting to noise in the edges.\n3.  **Lack of Baseline**: The statement \"No comparison to a features-only baseline... is needed\" is a critical error. Without the MLP baseline, one cannot know the performance floor provided by the features alone. For instance, if performance is poor and does not change as $p \\to 1$, it could be because the graph is useless, but it could also be because the features are useless, so neither the GNN nor the effective MLP (at $p \\approx 1$) can learn anything. This method cannot disentangle these two possibilities.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This is an incomplete diagnostic tool that cannot fulfill the requirements of the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a rigorous, systematic, and comprehensive plan for diagnosing model failure by isolating each critical component through controlled experiments and logical inference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2373344"}]}
