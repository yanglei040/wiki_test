You must detect both crossing events and exact hits to within a small tolerance.\n- Infer A-stability on the real axis by checking whether $|R(z)|\\le 1$ for all $z\\in[-50,0]$ on the grid (this is an empirical inference restricted to the negative real axis). Report this inference as a boolean.\n- Infer L-stability by checking whether $|R(z)|$ evaluated at a large negative real value $z=-1000$ is below $0.01$.

It determines the range of time steps $h$ for which the numerical solution to a differential equation remains bounded. The standard approach involves applying the method to the linear test problem $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$, where $\\lambda$ is a complex number with $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda) \\le 0$. This models the behavior of stiff systems, where different components evolve on vastly different time scales. Applying a one-step numerical method to this equation yields a recurrence relation of the form $y_{n+1} = R(z) y_n$, where $z = h\\lambda$ and $R(z)$ is the stability function. For the numerical solution to be stable, we require $|R(z)| \\le 1$.\n\nA general $s$-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) method is defined by its Butcher tableau, consisting of a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s \\times s}$ and a vector of weights $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^s$. When applied to the test problem $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$, the update rule is:\n$$ y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i k_i $$\nThe internal stage derivatives $k_i$ are given by:\n$$ k_i = f(t_n + c_i h, Y_i) = \\lambda Y_i = \\lambda \\left( y_n + h \\sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} k_j \\right) $$\nfor $i=1, \\dots, s$.

The equations for the stage derivatives become:\n$$ k_i = \\frac{z}{h} \\left( y_n + h \\sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} k_j \\right) = \\frac{z}{h} y_n + z \\sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} k_j $$\nThis is a system of $s$ linear equations for the vector $\\mathbf{k} = [k_1, \\dots, k_s]^T$. In matrix form, with $\\mathbf{1}$ being the vector of ones:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} - z A \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{z}{h} y_n \\mathbf{1} \\implies (I - zA) \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{z}{h} y_n \\mathbf{1} $$\nSolving for $\\mathbf{k}$ yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{z}{h} y_n (I - zA)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} $$\nSubstituting this back into the update formula for $y_{n+1}$, written with vector notation as $y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{k}$:\n$$ y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\mathbf{b}^T \\left( \\frac{z}{h} y_n (I - zA)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} \\right) = y_n + z y_n \\mathbf{b}^T (I - zA)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} $$\nFactoring out $y_n$, we identify the stability function $R(z)$:\n$$ R(z) = 1 + z \\mathbf{b}^T (I - zA)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} $$\nThis general formula allows us to derive $R(z)$ for any RK method given its Butcher tableau $(A, b)$.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the specified methods.\n\n1.  **Explicit (Forward) Euler Method**:\n    The Butcher tableau is $s=1$, $A=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\end{bmatrix}$, $b=\\begin{bmatrix}1\\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The matrix $(I - zA)$ is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[1 - z(0)] = [1]$, whose inverse is $[1]$.\n    $$ R(z) = 1 + z [1] [1] [1] = 1 + z $$\n\n2.  **Implicit (Backward) Euler Method**:\n    The Butcher tableau is $s=1$, $A=\\begin{bmatrix}1\\end{bmatrix}$, $b=\\begin{bmatrix}1\\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The matrix $(I - zA)$ is $[1 - z(1)] = [1-z]$, whose inverse is $[(1-z)^{-1}]$.\n    $$ R(z) = 1 + z [1] [(1-z)^{-1}] [1] = 1 + \\frac{z}{1-z} = \\frac{1-z+z}{1-z} = \\frac{1}{1-z} $$\n\n3.  **Trapezoidal Rule**:\n    This is a $2$-stage implicit method with $A=\\begin{bmatrix}0  0 \\\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ and $b=\\begin{bmatrix}\\tfrac{1}{2}  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n    First, we compute $(I - zA)^{-1}$:\n    $$ I - zA = \\begin{bmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  1\\end{bmatrix} - z\\begin{bmatrix}0  0 \\\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1  0 \\\\ -z/2  1 - z/2\\end{bmatrix} $$\n    The inverse is:\n    $$ (I - zA)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1(1-z/2) - 0} \\begin{bmatrix}1 - z/2  0 \\\\ z/2  1\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{1 - z/2} \\begin{bmatrix}1 - z/2  0 \\\\ z/2  1\\end{bmatrix} $$\n    Now we substitute this into the formula for $R(z)$:\n    $$ R(z) = 1 + z \\begin{bmatrix}\\tfrac{1}{2}  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{1-z/2} \\begin{bmatrix}1-z/2  0 \\\\ z/2  1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} $$\n    $$ R(z) = 1 + \\frac{z}{1-z/2} \\begin{bmatrix}\\tfrac{1}{2}  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1-z/2 \\\\ 1+z/2\\end{bmatrix} = 1 + \\frac{z}{1-z/2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(1-z/2) + \\frac{1}{2}(1+z/2) \\right) $$\n    $$ R(z) = 1 + \\frac{z}{1-z/2} (1) = \\frac{1-z/2+z}{1-z/2} = \\frac{1+z/2}{1-z/2} $$\n\nThe numerical experiment is designed as follows:\n\n1.  **Stability Function Implementation**: A general function is created that takes $A$ and $b$ and returns the corresponding stability function $R(z)$. This function computes $R(z) = 1 + z \\mathbf{b}^T (I - zA)^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$ and is vectorized to operate over an array of $z$ values.\n\n2.  **Grid Generation**: A uniform grid of $5001$ complex-valued points is generated for $z$ on the real-axis interval $[-50, 0]$.\n\n3.  **Boundary Point Counting**: To find where $|R(z)| = 1$, we analyze the function $g(z) = |R(z)| - 1$ on the grid. We count the number of \"boundary events\" using a stateful algorithm that iterates through the grid. An event is counted if we encounter a contiguous region of points where $|g(z_i)| \\le 10^{-8}$ (a \"hit\") or if there is a sign change $g(z_i)g(z_{i+1})  0$ between two non-hit points (a \"crossing\"). This prevents double-counting.\n\n4.  **A-stability Inference**: A-stability requires $|R(z)| \\le 1$ for all $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 0$. Our experiment provides an empirical test restricted to the negative real axis. We compute $\\max(|R(z)|)$ over our grid $z \\in [-50, 0]$ and check if this maximum is less than or equal to $1$ (allowing for a small tolerance of $10^{-8}$). The result is a boolean.\n\n5.  **L-stability Inference**: L-stability requires A-stability and $\\lim_{|z|\\to\\infty,\\,\\operatorname{Re}(z)0} R(z)=0$. We test this second condition empirically by evaluating $|R(z)|$ at a large-magnitude negative real value, $z=-1000$. If the method is inferred to be A-stable from the previous step and $|R(-1000)|  0.01$, we infer it is L-stable. The result is a boolean.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three methods, and the results are compiled.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and analyzes the stability functions for three Runge-Kutta methods.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_stability_function(A, b):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructs the stability function R(z) for a given Butcher tableau.\n        \n        Args:\n            A (np.ndarray): The A matrix of the Butcher tableau.\n            b (np.ndarray): The b vector of the Butcher tableau.\n\n        Returns:\n            A function that computes R(z) for a scalar or vector z.\n        \"\"\"\n        s = A.shape[0]\n        I = np.identity(s)\n        ones_s = np.ones((s, 1))\n        b_T = b.reshape(1, -1)\n\n        def R(z):\n            \"\"\"The stability function R(z).\"\"\"\n            # Vectorized implementation\n            if not np.isscalar(z):\n                z = np.asarray(z, dtype=np.complex128)\n                results = np.zeros_like(z, dtype=np.complex128)\n                for i, z_val in enumerate(z):\n                    if z_val == 0:\n                        results[i] = 1.0 + 0.0j\n                        continue\n                    try:\n                        mat_inv = np.linalg.inv(I - z_val * A)\n                        r_val = 1.0 + z_val * b_T @ mat_inv @ ones_s\n                        results[i] = r_val.item()\n                    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n                        results[i] = np.inf + 0.0j\n                return results\n\n            # Scalar implementation\n            z = complex(z)\n            if z == 0:\n                return 1.0 + 0.0j\n            try:\n                mat_inv = np.linalg.inv(I - z * A)\n                r_val = 1.0 + z * b_T @ mat_inv @ ones_s\n                return r_val.item()\n            except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n                return np.inf + 0.0j\n        \n        return R\n\n    # Define the Butcher tableaus for the methods in the test suite.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Explicit (Forward) Euler\",\n            \"A\": np.array([[0.0]]),\n            \"b\": np.array([1.0]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Implicit (Backward) Euler\",\n            \"A\": np.array([[1.0]]),\n            \"b\": np.array([1.0]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Trapezoidal Rule\",\n            \"A\": np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5]]),\n            \"b\": np.array([0.5, 0.5]),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    # Numerical parameters from the problem statement\n    z_min = -50.0\n    z_max = 0.0\n    num_points = 5001\n    tolerance = 1e-8\n    l_stability_z = -1000.0\n    l_stability_threshold = 0.01\n\n    z_grid = np.linspace(z_min, z_max, num_points)\n    \n    final_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        A = case[\"A\"]\n        b = case[\"b\"]\n        \n        # 1.

The Explicit Runge-Kutta Method and the Stability Function\n\nAn $s$-stage explicit Runge–Kutta (ERK) method for solving the initial value problem $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ is defined by the equations:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i k_i \\\\\nk_i = f\\left(t_n + c_i \\Delta t, y_n + \\Delta t \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} k_j\\right)\n$$\nThe coefficients $a_{ij}$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ are given by a Butcher tableau, which for an explicit method has a strictly lower triangular matrix $A = (a_{ij})$.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the method, we apply it to the Dahlquist test equation, $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$, where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$. In this case, $f(t, y) = \\lambda y$. The stage values $k_i$ become:\n$$\nk_i = \\lambda \\left(y_n + \\Delta t \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} k_j\\right)\n$$\nLet us define the scaled time step $z = \\Delta t \\lambda$. We can observe that each stage vector $k_i$ must be proportional to $\\lambda y_n$. Let $k_i = K_i(z) \\lambda y_n$ for some function $K_i(z)$. Substituting this into the stage equation:\n$$\nK_i(z) \\lambda y_n = \\lambda \\left(y_n + \\Delta t \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} (K_j(z) \\lambda y_n)\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $\\lambda y_n$ (assuming $\\lambda, y_n \\neq 0$), we obtain a recurrence relation for the stage polynomials $K_i(z)$:\n$$\nK_i(z) = 1 + z \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} K_j(z)\n$$\nwith $K_1(z) = 1$ since the sum is empty for $i=1$. Because $A$ is strictly lower triangular, we can compute each $K_i(z)$ sequentially. $K_i(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree $i-1$.\n\nThe numerical solution is updated as:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i (K_i(z) \\lambda y_n) = y_n \\left(1 + z \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i K_i(z)\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the amplification factor, which maps $y_n$ to $y_{n+1}$. This is the stability function $R(z)$:\n$$\nR(z) = 1 + z \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i K_i(z)\n$$\nFor an $s$-stage ERK method, $R(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree at most $s$.\n\n### 2.

Stability Criterion for Linear Systems\n\nFor the system of ODEs $y'(t) = A_{\\text{sys}} y(t)$, assuming $A_{\\text{sys}}$ is diagonalizable, there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A_{\\text{sys}} = P \\Lambda P^{-1}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of $A_{\\text{sys}}$.\nBy the change of variables $u(t) = P^{-1} y(t)$, the system decouples into a set of independent scalar equations: $u_i'(t) = \\lambda_i u_i(t)$.\nApplying a Runge-Kutta method to the original system $y' = A_{\\text{sys}} y$ is equivalent to applying the same method to each of these scalar equations. The update rule for the transformed variables is:\n$u_{i, n+1} = R(\\Delta t \\lambda_i) u_{i, n}$.\nFor the numerical solution $y_n$ to remain bounded as $n \\to \\infty$, all components $u_{i,n}$ must remain bounded. This requires that the amplification factor for each component has a magnitude no greater than one:\n$$\n|R(\\Delta t \\lambda_i)| \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{for all eigenvalues } \\lambda_i \\text{ of } A_{\\text{sys}}\n$$\nThis is the condition for numerical stability.\n\n### 4. Algorithm for Maximal Stable Time Step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$\n\nWe seek the largest $\\Delta t \\geq 0$ that satisfies the stability condition for all eigenvalues simultaneously. This is $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\sup\\{\\Delta t \\geq 0 \\mid |R(\\Delta t \\lambda_i)| \\leq 1 \\text{ for all } i\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Compute the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ of the matrix $A_{\\text{sys}}$.\n2.  For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$:\n    a. If $\\Re(\\lambda_i)  0$, the physical system is unstable. The numerical method will also be unstable for any $\\Delta t  0$, because for small $z=\\Delta t \\lambda_i$, $|R(z)| \\approx |1+z| = \\sqrt{(1+\\Delta t \\Re(\\lambda_i))^2 + (\\Delta t \\Im(\\lambda_i))^2}  1$. Thus, $\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0$.\n    b. If $\\lambda_i=0$, $R(0)=1$, so this eigenvalue imposes no restriction on $\\Delta t$.\n    c. If $\\Re(\\lambda_i) \\leq 0$ and $\\lambda_i \\neq 0$, we must find the smallest positive $\\Delta t_i^*$ such that $|R(\\Delta t_i^* \\lambda_i)| = 1$. This value represents the boundary of the stability region along the ray defined by $\\lambda_i$.\n3.  The overall maximal stable time step is the minimum of these individual limits: $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min_{i} \\{\\Delta t_i^*\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\Delta t_i^*$, we solve the equation $|R(\\Delta t \\lambda_i)| - 1 = 0$ for the smallest positive root $\\Delta t$. This is a nonlinear equation that we can solve numerically. A robust approach is to first bracket the root and then use a root-finding algorithm like Brent's method.\n-   **Bracketing**: For a given $\\lambda_i$ with $\\Re(\\lambda_i) \\le 0$, the function $h(\\Delta t) = |R(\\Delta t \\lambda_i)| - 1$ is non-positive for small $\\Delta t0$. Since the stability region of any explicit RK method is bounded, we can find an upper bound $b$ where $h(b)  0$ by starting with a guess and increasing it (e.g., by doubling) until the condition is met. This provides an interval $[a, b]$ containing the root.\n-   **Root-finding**: With the root bracketed in $[a, b]$, `scipy.optimize.brentq` can efficiently find the precise value of $\\Delta t_i^*$.\n\nThe implementation will compute $R(z)$ from the Butcher tableau as derived, then execute this numerical search for each test matrix.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    It computes the maximum stable time step for the classical RK4 method\n    for several linear systems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Butcher tableau for the classical 4-stage Runge-Kutta method (RK4)\n    A_rk4 = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]\n    ], dtype=float)\n    b_rk4 = np.array([1/6, 1/3, 1/3, 1/6], dtype=float)\n\n    # Test suite of system matrices A_sys\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: general negative real eigenvalues\n        np.array([[-2.0, 0.0], [0.0, -5.0]], dtype=float),\n        # Case 2: positive real eigenvalues\n        np.array([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5]], dtype=float),\n        # Case 3: complex-conjugate pair with negative real part\n        np.array([[-1.0, -4.0], [1.0, -1.0]], dtype=float),\n        # Case 4: highly oscillatory with small damping\n        np.array([[-0.1, 10.0], [-10.0, -0.1]], dtype=float)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for A_sys in test_cases:\n        max_dt = find_max_dt(A_sys, A_rk4, b_rk4)\n        results.append(f\"{max_dt:.8f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef compute_R_from_tableau(z, A, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the value of the stability function R(z) for a given z\n    and a Runge-Kutta method specified by its Butcher tableau (A, b).\n    \"\"\"\n    s = len(b)\n    K = np.zeros(s, dtype=np.complex128)\n    for i in range(s):\n        # K_i(z) = 1 + z * sum(a[i,j] * K_j(z) for j  i)\n        stage_sum = np.dot(A[i, :i], K[:i])\n        K[i] = 1.0 + z * stage_sum\n    \n    # R(z) = 1 + z * sum(b_i * K_i(z))\n    return 1.0 + z * np.dot(b, K)\n\ndef find_max_dt(A_sys, butcher_A, butcher_b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum stable time step dt for a system y'(t) = A_sys*y(t)\n    using the stability function derived from the provided Butcher tableau.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_sys)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # If any eigenvalue has a positive real part, the system is unstable,\n    # and the time integration will be unstable for any dt  0.\n    if any(lam.real  1e-9 for lam in eigenvalues):\n        return 0.0\n        \n    min_dt_root = float('inf')\n    \n    for lam in eigenvalues:\n        if abs(lam)  1e-9:  # An eigenvalue of 0 imposes no stability constraint.\n            continue\n\n        def h(dt):\n            \"\"\"Target function for root finding: |R(dt*lam)| - 1.\"\"\"\n            z = dt * lam\n            R_val = compute_R_from_tableau(z, butcher_A, butcher_b)\n            return abs(R_val) - 1.0\n\n        # Search for the smallest positive root of h(dt) = 0.\n        # This determines the stability limit for this eigenvalue.\n        \n        # Step 1: Bracket the root.

This selection process must be performed for five distinct test cases.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the concept of absolute stability. For the scalar test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, a one-step method with step size $h$ yields an iteration $y_{k+1} = R(z) y_k$, where $z = h\\lambda$ and $R(z)$ is the method's stability function. The method is stable for a given $z$ if and only if $|R(z)| \\le 1$. The set of all such $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ constitutes the absolute stability region.\n\nFirst, we must establish the properties of the four candidate methods. The properties include the method's index, order of accuracy, per-step computational cost, stability function $R(z)$, and its classification regarding $A$-stability and $L$-stability.\n\nThe four methods are:\n- Index $0$: Explicit Euler (EE), Order $1$, Cost $1$.\n- Index $1$: Classical Runge-Kutta of order $4$ (RK4), Order $4$, Cost $4$.\n- Index $2$: Backward Euler (BE), Order $1$, Cost $30$.\n- Index $3$: Trapezoidal Rule (TR), Order $2$, Cost $50$.\n\nThe stability functions $R(z)$ are derived from applying each method to the test equation $y'=\\lambda y$.\n1.  **Explicit Euler (Method 0)**: The update is $y_{k+1} = y_k + h (\\lambda y_k) = (1+h\\lambda)y_k$.\n    $$R_0(z) = 1 + z$$\n    The stability region is $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |1+z| \\le 1\\}$, a disk of radius $1$ centered at $z=-1$. This does not contain the left half-plane $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 0\\}$, so the method is **not $A$-stable**.\n\n2.  **Classical Runge-Kutta (Method 1)**: This method's stability function is the truncated Taylor series of the exponential function, up to the order of the method. For order $4$, we have:\n    $$R_1(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{6} + \\frac{z^4}{24}$$\n    The stability region is bounded and does not contain the entire left half-plane.

Solving for $y_{k+1}$ gives $y_{k+1}(1-h\\lambda) = y_k$, so $y_{k+1} = (1-h\\lambda)^{-1}y_k$.\n    $$R_2(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$$\n    For any $z = x+iy$ with $x = \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 0$, we have $|R_2(z)|^2 = |\\frac{1}{1-x-iy}|^2 = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2 + y^2}$.

The condition is met, so the method is **$L$-stable**.\n\n4.  **Trapezoidal Rule (Method 3)**: The implicit update is $y_{k+1} = y_k + \\frac{h}{2}(\\lambda y_k + \\lambda y_{k+1})$. Solving for $y_{k+1}$ gives $y_{k+1}(1 - \\frac{h\\lambda}{2}) = y_k(1 + \\frac{h\\lambda}{2})$.\n    $$R_3(z) = \\frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2}$$\n    For any $z=x+iy$ with $x = \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 0$, $|R_3(z)|^2 = \\frac{|1+x/2+iy/2|^2}{|1-x/2-iy/2|^2} = \\frac{(1+x/2)^2+(y/2)^2}{(1-x/2)^2+(y/2)^2} = \\frac{1+x+x^2/4+y^2/4}{1-x+x^2/4+y^2/4}$. Since $x \\le 0$, the numerator is less than or equal to the denominator, so $|R_3(z)| \\le 1$. The method is **$A$-stable**.\n    For $L$-stability, we check the limit: $\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} R_3(z) = \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} \\frac{1+z/2}{1-z/2} = -1$.

Check the stability constraint: for all computed $z$ values, verify that $|R_i(z)| \\le 1$.\n    d. A method is feasible if both constraints are met.\n5.  From the set of all feasible methods, construct a preferred set.\n    a. If $\\sigma \\ge \\tau$, the preferred set consists of all feasible methods that are $L$-stable. If this set is empty, the preferred set defaults to all feasible methods.\n    b. If $\\sigma  \\tau$, the preferred set is simply the set of all feasible methods.\n6.  If the preferred set is empty, no solution exists, and the result is $-1$. Otherwise, select a single method from the preferred set using a tie-breaking hierarchy:\n    a. Choose the method with the minimum total work $W$.\n    b. If work is tied, choose the method with the highest order of accuracy.\n    c. If still tied, choose the method with the smallest index.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\n**Case 1**: $\\lambda \\in \\{-1.0, -2.0\\}$, $T=1.0$, $h=0.2$, $W_{\\max}=6$, $\\tau=25$.\n- $N_{\\text{steps}} = \\lceil 1.0/0.2 \\rceil = 5$.\n- $z \\in \\{0.2(-1.0), 0.2(-2.0)\\} = \\{-0.2, -0.4\\}$.\n- $\\sigma = \\max(0.2, 0.4) = 0.4$.
