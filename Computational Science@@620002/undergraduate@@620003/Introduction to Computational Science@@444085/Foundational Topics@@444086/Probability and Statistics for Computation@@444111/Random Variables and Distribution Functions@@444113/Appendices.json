For a mixed random variable, this involves integrating the probability density function $f_X(x)$ and adding the masses of any atoms at locations less than or equal to $x$.\n\n1.  **For $x < 0$**: The support of $X$ is on $[0, 2]$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}(X \\le x) = 0$.\n    $F_X(x) = 0$.\n\n2.  **For $0 \\le x < 0.5$**: The probability accumulates solely from the continuous density $f_X(t) = 0.4$.\n    $F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t) \\,dt = \\int_0^x 0.4 \\,dt = 0.4x$.\n\n3.  **At $x = 0.5$**: There is an atom of mass $p_1 = 0.1$. The CDF jumps at this point.\n    The value just before the jump is $F_X(0.5^-) = \\lim_{t \\uparrow 0.5} F_X(t) = 0.4(0.5) = 0.2$.\n    The CDF at $x=0.5$ is $F_X(0.5) = F_X(0.5^-) + \\mathbb{P}(X=0.5) = 0.2 + p_1 = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3$.\n\n4.  **For $0.5 \\le x < 1$**: The probability is the sum of the mass up to and including $x=0.5$, plus the accumulated probability from the density $f_X(t)=0.4$ on $(0.5, x]$.\n    $F_X(x) = F_X(0.5) + \\int_{0.5}^x 0.4 \\,dt = 0.3 + 0.4(x - 0.5) = 0.3 + 0.4x - 0.2 = 0.4x + 0.1$.\n    Note that this expression correctly gives $F_X(0.5) = 0.4(0.5)+0.1 = 0.3$.\n\n5.  **For $1 \\le x < 2$**: The CDF is continuous at $x=1$ as there is no atom.\n    $F_X(1) = F_X(1^-) = 0.4(1) + 0.1 = 0.5$.\n    For $x \\in [1, 2)$, we add the accumulated probability from the density $f_X(t) = 0.8(2-t)$.\n    $F_X(x) = F_X(1) + \\int_1^x 0.8(2-t) \\,dt = 0.5 + 0.8\\left[2t - \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_1^x$\n    $F_X(x) = 0.5 + 0.8\\left( (2x - \\frac{x^2}{2}) - (2 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\right) = 0.5 + 0.8\\left(2x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)$\n    $F_X(x) = 0.5 + 1.6x - 0.4x^2 - 1.2 = -0.4x^2 + 1.6x - 0.7$.\n\n6.  **At $x = 2$**: There is an atom of mass $p_2 = 0.1$.

We invert $u = 0.4x$.\n    $x = u / 0.4 = 2.5u$. So, $F_X^{-1}(u) = 2.5u$.\n\n2.  **For $u \\in [0.2, 0.3]$**: This range of $u$ corresponds to the jump in $F_X$ at $x=0.5$.\n    $F_X(0.5^-)=0.2$ and $F_X(0.5)=0.3$. For any $u \\in [0.2, 0.3]$, the set $\\{x : F_X(x) \\ge u\\}$ is $[0.5, \\infty)$. The infimum of this set is $0.5$.\n    Thus, $F_X^{-1}(u) = 0.5$.\n\n3.  **For $u \\in (0.3, 0.5]$**: This corresponds to $x \\in (0.5, 1]$. We invert $u = 0.4x + 0.1$.\n    $0.4x = u - 0.1 \\implies x = (u - 0.1)/0.4 = 2.5u - 0.25$.\n    So, $F_X^{-1}(u) = 2.5u - 0.25$.\n\n4.  **For $u \\in (0.5, 0.9]$**: This corresponds to $x \\in (1, 2]$. We invert $u = -0.4x^2 + 1.6x - 0.7$.\n    Rearranging gives a quadratic equation for $x$: $0.4x^2 - 1.6x + (u+0.7) = 0$.\n    Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{1.6^2 - 4(0.4)(u+0.7)}}{2(0.4)} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{2.56 - 1.6u - 1.12}}{0.8} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{1.44 - 1.6u}}{0.8}$.\n    This simplifies to $x = 2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{1.44 - 1.6u}}{0.8} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2.25 - 2.5u}$.\n    Since $x$ must be in the interval $(1, 2]$, we must choose the negative root.\n    $F_X^{-1}(u) = 2 - \\sqrt{2.25 - 2.5u}$.\n\n5.  **For $u \\in (0.9, 1.0]$**: This range of $u$ corresponds to the jump at $x=2$.\n    $F_X(2^-)=0.9$ and $F_X(2)=1.0$. For any $u \\in (0.9, 1.0]$, the set $\\{x : F_X(x) \\ge u\\}$ is $[2, \\infty)$. The infimum of this set is $2$.\n    Thus, $F_X^{-1}(u) = 2$.\n\nCombining these pieces, the complete inverse CDF is:\n$$\nF_X^{-1}(u) = \\begin{cases}\n2.5u & \\text{if } 0 \\le u < 0.2 \\\\\n0.5 & \\text{if } 0.2 \\le u \\le 0.3 \\\\\n2.5u - 0.25 & \\text{if } 0.3 < u \\le 0.5 \\\\\n2 - \\sqrt{2.25 - 2.5u} & \\text{if } 0.5 < u \\le 0.9 \\\\\n2 & \\text{if } 0.9 < u \\le 1.0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Implementation\n\nThe derived expression for $F_X^{-1}(u)$ is implemented in Python. The function takes a uniform random variable sample $u$ and returns a sample $x$ from the distribution of $X$. This function is then used to perform the validation tests described in the problem statement. The code defines the piecewise inverse CDF and then executes four test cases: deterministic mapping of spikes, two sampling validations with different sample sizes and tolerances, and a monotonicity check. The results of these boolean tests are collected and printed in the specified format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the solution by deriving the inverse CDF, and then running the specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def inverse_cdf_scalar(u):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the generalized inverse CDF F_X^{-1}(u) for a scalar u.\n        This function implements the piecewise formula derived in the solution.\n        \"\"\"\n        if u < 0.0:\n            # Although u should be in [0,1], handle out-of-bounds for robustness.\n            return 0.0\n        elif u < 0.2:\n            # Corresponds to x in [0, 0.5)\n            return 2.5 * u\n        elif u <= 0.3:\n            # Corresponds to the atom at x = 0.5\n            return 0.5\n        elif u <= 0.5:\n            # Corresponds to x in [0.5, 1)\n            return 2.5 * u - 0.25\n        elif u <= 0.9:\n            # Corresponds to x in [1, 2)\n            # This is the solution to 0.4x^2 - 1.6x + (u+0.7) = 0\n            return 2.0 - np.sqrt(2.25 - 2.5 * u)\n        else: # u > 0.9\n            # Corresponds to the atom at x = 2 and u > 1\n            return 2.0\n\n    # Vectorize the scalar function for efficient application to numpy arrays.\n    inverse_cdf = np.vectorize(inverse_cdf_scalar)\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Case 1: Deterministic spike mapping\n    u_vals_1 = np.array([0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0])\n    expected_x = np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0])\n    actual_x = inverse_cdf(u_vals_1)\n    # Use np.allclose for safe floating-point comparison\n    results.append(np.allclose(actual_x, expected_x))\n\n    def run_sampling_test(N, seed, epsilon):\n        \"\"\"\n        Helper function for Cases 2 and 3.\n        Generates N samples and validates their distribution against expected probabilities.\n        \"\"\"\n        np.random.seed(seed)\n        u_samples = np.random.rand(N)\n        x_samples = inverse_cdf(u_samples)\n\n        # Calculate empirical probabilities for the five disjoint sets.\n        # The comparisons are exact since the inverse CDF returns exact values for atoms.\n        p1_emp = np.sum(x_samples < 0.5) / N   # S1: X < 0.5\n        p2_emp = np.sum(x_samples == 0.5) / N  # S2: X = 0.5\n        p3_emp = np.sum((x_samples > 0.5) & (x_samples < 1.0)) / N # S3: 0.5 < X < 1\n        p4_emp = np.sum((x_samples >= 1.0) & (x_samples < 2.0)) / N # S4: 1 <= X < 2\n        p5_emp = np.sum(x_samples == 2.0) / N  # S5: X = 2\n\n        p_emp = np.array([p1_emp, p2_emp, p3_emp, p4_emp, p5_emp])\n        p_exp = np.array([0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1])\n        \n        # Check if the maximum absolute deviation is within the tolerance.\n        max_deviation = np.max(np.abs(p_emp - p_exp))\n        return max_deviation <= epsilon\n\n    # Case 2: Sampling, moderate size\n    results.append(run_sampling_test(N=5000, seed=123, epsilon=0.02))\n\n    # Case 3: Sampling, larger size\n    results.append(run_sampling_test(N=50000, seed=456, epsilon=0.005))\n    \n    # Case 4: Monotonicity of the quantile function\n    u_grid = np.array([0.0, 0.1, 0.19, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.31, 0.49, 0.5, 0.7, 0.89, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0])\n    x_vals = inverse_cdf(u_grid)\n    # Check if the sequence of x values is non-decreasing using np.diff.\n    # A small tolerance is used for floating point arithmetic safety.\n    is_monotonic = np.all(np.diff(x_vals) >= -1e-9)\n    results.append(is_monotonic)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, [bool(r) for r in results]))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3183232"}]}
