The scheduling algorithm is preemptive fixed-priority, with priorities assigned according to the Rate Monotonic (RM) discipline. For RM, a shorter period $T_{i}$ implies a higher priority. The given priorities ($\\tau_{1} > \\tau_{2} > \\tau_{3} > \\tau_{4}$) are consistent with the periods ($T_{1}  T_{2}  T_{3}  T_{4}$).\n\nThe worst-case response time for a task occurs under a \"critical instant,\" which is a point in time where a job of the task is released simultaneously with jobs of all higher-priority tasks. The problem explicitly directs us to construct this scenario by aligning all releases at time $t=0$.\n\nThe response time $R_{i}$ of a task $\\tau_{i}$ is the total time elapsed from its release until its completion. This time is composed of its own worst-case execution time $C_{i}$ and the total interference from all higher-priority tasks that preempt it.

For task $\\tau_{4}$, $hp(4) = \\{\\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}, \\tau_{3}\\}$.\n\nThe interference on $\\tau_{i}$ during a time interval of length $t$ is the sum of the execution demands of all higher-priority tasks released within that interval. For any task $\\tau_{j} \\in hp(i)$, the number of its jobs released in an interval of length $t$ is given by $\\lceil \\frac{t}{T_{j}} \\rceil$. The total execution time demanded by these jobs is $\\lceil \\frac{t}{T_{j}} \\rceil C_{j}$.\n\nThe worst-case response time $R_{i}$ is the smallest positive value of $t$ that satisfies the completion time equation:\n$$t = C_{i} + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{t}{T_{j}} \\right\\rceil C_{j}$$\nThis equation expresses that the task $\\tau_i$ completes when the CPU time available to it equals its own execution time $C_i$ plus all the time it was preempted by higher-priority tasks.\n\nThis equation is solved using an iterative recurrence relation. Let $R_{i}^{(k)}$ be the estimate of the response time at iteration $k$.

The analysis must account for release offsets and blocking.\n\nFirst, we establish the priority ordering based on the Deadline Monotonic (DM) policy, where a shorter relative deadline $D_i$ corresponds to a higher priority. The deadlines are given as $D_1 = 6$, $D_2 = 12$, and $D_3 = 25$. Since $D_1  D_2  D_3$, the priority ordering is $\\tau_1  \\tau_2  \\tau_3$.

The problem states to \"Treat a higher-priority task’s offset as a worst-case release jitter that advances its arrivals relative to the analyzed job.\" This phrasing corresponds to a known method for offset-aware RTA.
