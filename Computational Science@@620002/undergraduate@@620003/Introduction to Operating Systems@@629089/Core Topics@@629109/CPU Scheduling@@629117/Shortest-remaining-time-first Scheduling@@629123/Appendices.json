This hands-on simulation will not only solidify your understanding of SRTF's preemption logic but also highlight its performance benefits by comparing it directly with the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) algorithms [@problem_id:3683158].", "problem": "Consider a single-processor system with zero context-switch overhead and a single ready queue. Three classical scheduling policies are to be applied to the same workload: Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF), First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), and Round Robin (RR). For Round Robin, use a fixed time quantum $q=2$ milliseconds. All processes are sequential; each process alternates between Central Processing Unit (CPU) bursts and Input/Output (I/O) events as specified, blocking during I/O. The I/O device is independent of the CPU and services processes concurrently; an I/O event duration is the time a process remains blocked before its next CPU burst becomes available.\n\nWorkload trace (all times in milliseconds):\n- Process $P_1$: arrival at $t=0$; CPU burst $3$, I/O duration $4$, CPU burst $5$.\n- Process $P_2$: arrival at $t=1$; CPU burst $6$, I/O duration $3$, CPU burst $2$.\n- Process $P_3$: arrival at $t=2$; CPU burst $4$.\n- Process $P_4$: arrival at $t=7$; CPU burst $3$, I/O duration $2$, CPU burst $4$.\n\nScheduling semantics:\n- Under SRTF, at any decision point the scheduler selects the ready process with the least remaining time in its current CPU burst; preemption occurs immediately if a newly ready process has a strictly smaller remaining time than the currently running process. Ties in remaining time are broken by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n- Under FCFS, the ready queue is strictly First-In-First-Out; when a process blocks for I/O or completes, the next process at the head of the ready queue is scheduled. When multiple processes become ready at the same time, they are enqueued by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n- Under RR, the ready queue is First-In-First-Out and a running process is preempted after $q=2$ milliseconds if its CPU burst has not completed; upon preemption it is enqueued at the tail. If a CPU burst completes before the quantum expires, the process immediately blocks for I/O or terminates (as appropriate), and the next ready process is scheduled. When multiple processes become ready at the same time, they are enqueued by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n\nSimultaneous-event order at a time instant $t$ is: CPU burst completions, then time-slice expirations, then I/O completions, then new arrivals; after applying these transitions, the scheduler selects the next process to run according to the policy.\n\nDefinitions to use:\n- For a process $P$, the response time is $T_{\\text{resp}}(P)=T_{\\text{first\\_CPU\\_start}}(P)-T_{\\text{arrival}}(P)$.\n- The turnaround time is $T_{\\text{turn}}(P)=T_{\\text{completion}}(P)-T_{\\text{arrival}}(P)$.\n- The total waiting time in the ready queue is $T_{\\text{wait}}(P)=T_{\\text{turn}}(P)-T_{\\text{cpu}}(P)-T_{\\text{io}}(P)$, where $T_{\\text{cpu}}(P)$ is the sum of all CPU burst durations for $P$, and $T_{\\text{io}}(P)$ is the sum of all I/O durations for $P$.\n\nTask:\n- For SRTF, derive the full schedule from first principles and compute the average waiting time, average response time, and average turnaround time over the set $\\{P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4\\}$.\n- Compute the same three averages for FCFS and RR (with $q=2$ milliseconds).\n- Express all intermediate times and the final averages in milliseconds. No rounding is required; provide exact values.\n- As your final answer, provide the nine averages in a single row matrix in the following order: SRTF-average-wait, SRTF-average-response, SRTF-average-turnaround, FCFS-average-wait, FCFS-average-response, FCFS-average-turnaround, RR-average-wait, RR-average-response, RR-average-turnaround.

Its response time is $R_0 = C_0 - A_0 = 100 - 0 = 100$.\n- While $J_0$ runs, all ten short jobs arrive and queue. After $J_0$ completes, they run sequentially.\n- For a short job $J_k$ (arriving at $A_k=k$, service time $S_k=1$), its execution starts after $J_0$ and the preceding $k-1$ short jobs, at time $t = 100 + (k-1)$. It completes at $C_k = 100 + k$.\n- The response time for $J_k$ is $R_k = C_k - A_k = (100+k) - k = 100$.\n- All 11 jobs have a response time of $100$.\n- The average response time is $100$.\n- The $95\\%$ percentile (maximum) response time is $100$.\n- Since $100 \\le 105$, **FCFS meets the SLO**.\n\n**Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) Analysis:**\nUnder the preemptive SRTF policy, the scheduler always runs the job with the least remaining time.\n- Job $J_0$ starts at $t=0$. At $t=1$, short job $J_1$ (service time $S_1=1$) arrives. Since its service time ($1$) is less than the remaining time of $J_0$ ($99$), $J_1$ preempts $J_0$.\n- This pattern continues. For each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, job $J_k$ arrives at $t=k$, immediately preempts $J_0$, runs from $t=k$ to $t=k+1$, and completes. The response time for each short job is $R_k = C_k - A_k = (k+1) - k = 1$.\n- All ten short jobs complete by $t=11$, each with a response time of $1$.\n- The long job $J_0$ ran only from $t=0$ to $t=1$. It resumes at $t=11$ with $99$ units of work remaining. It completes at $t = 11 + 99 = 110$.\n- The response time for $J_0$ is $R_0 = C_0 - A_0 = 110 - 0 = 110$.\n- The average response time is $\\frac{110 + (10 \\times 1)}{11} = \\frac{120}{11} \\approx 10.91$.\n- The $95\\%$ percentile (maximum) response time is $110$.\n- Since $110 > 105$, **SRTF violates the SLO**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSRTF provides a much lower average response time ($\\approx 10.91$) compared to FCFS ($100$).

Under SRTF, at an arrival instant, the processor would switch to the job with the strictly smallest remaining processing time. To reduce context-switch overhead, the scheduler is modified by a policy: “do not preempt if the running job’s remaining time $r$ is less than a threshold $r_{\\min}$.” Concretely, upon a new arrival with processing requirement $s_{\\text{new}}$, a preemption occurs only if both $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ and $r \\ge r_{\\min}$; otherwise the currently running job continues. Ties in remaining time are broken without preemption (that is, if $s_{\\text{new}} = r$, the current job continues).

Context-switch time is negligible and does not extend any job’s processing time.

This is one preemption.\n- $t=4-5$: $J_2$ runs. $C_2=5$.\n- At $t=5$, $J_1$ resumes with remaining time $r_1=6$. It runs from $t=5$ to $t=9$.\n- At $t=9$, $J_3$ arrives ($S_3=1$). $J_1$ has now run for a total of $4+(9-5)=8$ quanta. Its new remaining time is $r_1 = 10-8=2$.\nAnother preemption decision is made. The condition is $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ ($1  2$, true) and $r \\ge r_{\\min}$ ($2 \\ge r_{\\min}$).\n- If $r_{\\min} \\le 2$, a second preemption occurs.\n- If $r_{\\min} > 2$ (i.e., $3 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 6$), no second preemption occurs.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.1: $3 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 6$ (One Preemption Total)\n$P=1$. At $t=9$, $J_1$ is not preempted and continues to run.\n- $t=9-11$: $J_1$ runs and completes. $C_1=11$.\n- At $t=11$, the ready queue has $J_3(S=1)$ and $J_4(S=2)$. $J_3$ runs.\n- $t=11-12$: $J_3$ runs. $C_3=12$.\n- $t=12-14$: $J_4$ runs. $C_4=14$.\nResponse times: $T_1=11-0=11$, $T_2=5-4=1$, $T_3=12-9=3$, $T_4=14-10=4$.\nMean response time: $\\overline{T} = \\frac{11+1+3+4}{4} = \\frac{19}{4} = 4.75$.\nObjective function: $R = 0.8 \\cdot 1 + 4.75 = 5.55$. This holds for $r_{\\min} \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.2: $0 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 2$ (Two Preemptions Total)\n$P=2$. At $t=9$, $J_1$ is preempted by $J_3$.\n- $t=9-10$: $J_3$ runs. $C_3=10$.\n- At $t=10$, $J_4$ arrives ($S_4=2$). Ready queue has $J_1(r=2)$ and $J_4(S=2)$. With a non-preemptive tie-break, $J_1$ (the incumbent) would continue, but here we are selecting a new job. Using FCFS tie-break, $J_1$ is chosen.\n- $t=10-12$: $J_1$ runs. $C_1=12$.\n- $t=12-14$: $J_4$ runs. $C_4=14$.\nResponse times: $T_1=12-0=12$, $T_2=5-4=1$, $T_3=10-9=1$, $T_4=14-10=4$.\nMean response time: $\\overline{T} = \\frac{12+1+1+4}{4} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.5$.\nObjective function: $R = 0.8 \\cdot 2 + 4.5 = 1.6 + 4.5 = 6.1$. This holds for $r_{\\min} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have calculated the value of the objective function $R$ for all possible non-negative integer values of $r_{\\min}$:\n- For $r_{\\min} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, $R = 6.1$.\n- For $r_{\\min} \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, $R = 5.55$.\n- For $r_{\\min} \\ge 7$, $R = 6.0$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum value of $R$ is $5.55$. This minimum is achieved for any $r_{\\min}$ in the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The problem requires selecting the smallest $r_{\\min}$ if there are multiple minimizers. The smallest value in this set is $3$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal value of $r_{\\min}$ is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3683161"}]}
