The gradient of $\\phi(x,y)$ is $\\nabla\\phi = \\langle\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\rangle = \\langle 2x, -2y \\rangle$.

This gives the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the orthogonal family:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{y}{x}\n$$\nThis is a separable ODE.
