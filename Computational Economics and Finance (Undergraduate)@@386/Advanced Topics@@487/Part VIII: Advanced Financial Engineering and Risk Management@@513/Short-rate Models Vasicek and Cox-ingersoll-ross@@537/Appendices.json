The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. It is a standard problem in quantitative finance, grounded in established mathematical theory. We may, therefore, proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nOur objective is to compute the probability of the yield curve inversion event at time $t=1$, defined by the inequality $y(1,10) < y(1,1)$, for each candidate parameter set $(\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma)$. The probability is conditioned on the initial short rate $r_0$. The parameter set that yields the highest probability will be selected.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the continuously-compounded yield $y(t,\\tau)$ and the instantaneous short rate $r_t$. The Vasicek model is an affine term-structure model, for which the price of a zero-coupon bond $P(t, t+\\tau)$ has an exponential-affine form:\n$$\nP(t, t+\\tau) = e^{A(\\tau) - B(\\tau)r_t}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the time to maturity. The functions $A(\\tau)$ and $B(\\tau)$ depend on the model parameters $(\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma)$. Standard theory for the Vasicek model provides the following expressions:\n$$\nB(\\tau) = \\frac{1 - e^{-\\kappa\\tau}}{\\kappa}\n$$\n$$\nA(\\tau) = \\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\kappa^2}\\right) [B(\\tau) - \\tau] - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4\\kappa} B(\\tau)^2\n$$\nThe continuously-compounded yield is defined as $y(t,\\tau) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\ln P(t,t+\\tau)$. Substituting the bond price formula, we obtain a linear relationship between the yield and the short rate:\n$$\ny(t,\\tau) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} (A(\\tau) - B(\\tau)r_t) = \\frac{B(\\tau)}{\\tau}r_t - \\frac{A(\\tau)}{\\tau}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the yield curve inversion condition $y(1,10) < y(1,1)$. Substituting the expression for the yield, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{B(10)}{10}r_1 - \\frac{A(10)}{10} < \\frac{B(1)}{1}r_1 - \\frac{A(1)}{1}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $r_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{A(1)}{1} - \\frac{A(10)}{10} < r_1 \\left( \\frac{B(1)}{1} - \\frac{B(10)}{10} \\right)\n$$\nThe coefficient of $r_1$ is $\\frac{B(1)}{\\tau_1} - \\frac{B(10)}{\\tau_2}$ with $\\tau_1=1$ and $\\tau_2=10$. The function $h(\\tau) = B(\\tau)/\\tau = \\frac{1-e^{-\\kappa\\tau}}{\\kappa\\tau}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $\\tau$ for $\\kappa > 0$. Thus, $h(1) > h(10)$, and the coefficient of $r_1$ is positive. We can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\nr_1 > \\frac{A(1) - A(10)/10}{B(1) - B(10)/10}\n$$\nWe define the right-hand side as the critical short rate, $r_{\\text{crit}}$. The inversion event occurs if and only if the short rate at time $t=1$ exceeds this threshold: $r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}}$. It is computationally advantageous to simplify the expression for $r_{\\text{crit}}$. By substituting the formula for $A(\\tau)$, we find:\n$$\nr_{\\text{crit}} = \\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\kappa^2}\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4\\kappa} \\frac{B(1)^2 - B(10)^2/10}{B(1) - B(10)/10}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the probability of this event, $\\mathbb{P}(r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}} | r_0)$. This requires the conditional distribution of $r_1$ given $r_0$. The stochastic differential equation for the Vasicek model describes an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The solution at time $t=1$ starting from $r_0$ at $t=0$ is:\n$$\nr_1 = r_0 e^{-\\kappa} + \\theta(1-e^{-\\kappa}) + \\sigma \\int_0^1 e^{-\\kappa(1-s)} dW_s\n$$\nFrom this, it follows that $r_1$ is normally distributed with conditional mean $\\mu$ and variance $v^2$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[r_1 | r_0] = r_0 e^{-\\kappa} + \\theta(1-e^{-\\kappa})\n$$\n$$\nv^2 = \\text{Var}[r_1 | r_0] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\kappa}(1-e^{-2\\kappa})\n$$\nThe probability of inversion is therefore the probability that a normally distributed random variable $r_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, v^2)$ exceeds $r_{\\text{crit}}$. This can be expressed using the standard normal cumulative distribution function $\\Phi(z)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{r_1 - \\mu}{v} > \\frac{r_{\\text{crit}} - \\mu}{v}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{crit}} - \\mu}{v}\\right)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the survival function of the normal distribution, which is numerically more stable to compute.\n\nA special case arises when $\\sigma = 0$. The model becomes deterministic, the variance $v^2$ is zero, and $r_1$ takes the fixed value $r_1 = \\mu = r_0 e^{-\\kappa} + \\theta(1-e^{-\\kappa})$. In this case, the probability $\\mathbb{P}(r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}})$ is either $1$ if $r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}}$, or $0$ otherwise. For $\\sigma=0$, the expression for $r_{\\text{crit}}$ simplifies to $\\theta$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case, defined by an initial rate $r_0$.\n2. Iterate through each candidate parameter triple $(\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma)$.\n3. Calculate the critical rate $r_{\\text{crit}}$ using the derived formula.\n4. Calculate the conditional mean $\\mu$ and variance $v^2$ of $r_1$.\n5. Handle the deterministic case ($\\sigma = 0$) and stochastic case ($\\sigma > 0$) separately to compute the probability $\\mathbb{P}(r_1 > r_{\\text{crit}})$.\n6. Compare the computed probabilities for all candidates and identify the index of the candidate yielding the maximum probability, applying the specified tie-breaking rule (select the smaller index if probabilities are equal within a tolerance of $10^{-12}$).\n7.

A complete derivation of the solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe time-$0$ price, $C(0)$, of the European call option is given by the risk-neutral valuation principle. This states that the price is the discounted expectation of the payoff under the risk-neutral measure $Q$.\n$$\nC(0) = E^Q_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T r_s ds\\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i\\,P(T,T_i) - K \\right)^{+} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $E^Q_0[\\cdot]$ denotes the expectation conditional on the information at time $t=0$.\n\nThe price of the underlying coupon-bearing bond at the option's expiration time $T$ is the sum of the prices of the zero-coupon bonds corresponding to each future cash flow:\n$$\nV_B(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i P(T, T_i)\n$$\nIn the CIR model, the price of a zero-coupon bond $P(T, T_i)$ is an exponential-affine function of the short rate $r_T$:\n$$\nP(T, T_i) = A(T, T_i) \\exp(-B(T, T_i) r_T)\n$$\nThe parameters of the CIR model, $\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma$, are positive. The standard CIR bond pricing functions $A(t,T)$ and $B(t,T)$ are strictly positive for $t < T$. We assume the cash flows $c_i$ are also positive, as is standard for coupon payments.\n\nTo apply Jamshidian's decomposition, we must establish that the price of the coupon bond at time $T$, $V_B(T)$, is a monotonic function of the single state variable, $r_T$. Taking the derivative of $V_B(T)$ with respect to $r_T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_B(T)}{\\partial r_T} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_T} \\left[ A(T, T_i) \\exp(-B(T, T_i) r_T) \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i A(T, T_i) \\exp(-B(T, T_i) r_T) \\left( -B(T, T_i) \\right)\n$$\nSince $c_i > 0$, $A(T,T_i) > 0$, and $B(T,T_i) > 0$, each term in the sum is negative. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial V_B(T)}{\\partial r_T} < 0$, which means $V_B(T)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $r_T$.\n\nBecause of this strict monotonicity, there exists a unique critical value of the short rate, which we denote $r_T^*$, such that the bond price equals the strike price:\n$$\nV_B(r_T^*) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i A(T, T_i) \\exp(-B(T, T_i) r_T^*) = K\n$$\nThis equation defines $r_T^*$. While an analytical solution for $r_T^*$ is generally not available, its existence is guaranteed. The option is in-the-money if $V_B(T) > K$, which is equivalent to $r_T < r_T^*$. The payoff can thus be written using an indicator function $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$:\n$$\n\\left( V_B(T) - K \\right)^{+} = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i\\,P(T,T_i) - K \\right) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the pricing formula and using the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nC(0) = E^Q_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T r_s ds\\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i\\,P(T,T_i) - K \\right) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nC(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i E^Q_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T r_s ds\\right) P(T,T_i) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) \\right] - K E^Q_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T r_s ds\\right) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) \\right]\n$$\nThis decomposes the option on a portfolio into a portfolio of digital-style options. We now analyze each term using a change of numeraire technique.\n\nFor the $i$-th term in the sum, we use the zero-coupon bond $P(t, T_i)$ as the numeraire. The corresponding forward measure is denoted $Q^{T_i}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative is $\\frac{dQ^{T_i}}{dQ} |_{\\mathcal{F}_t} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\int_0^t r_s ds) P(t, T_i)}{P(0, T_i)}$. The term becomes:\n$$\nc_i E^Q_0 [ \\exp(-\\int_0^T r_s ds) P(T,T_i) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) ] = c_i P(0, T_i) E^{Q^{T_i}}_0 [ \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) ] = c_i P(0, T_i) Q^{T_i}(r_T < r_T^*)\n$$\nFor the second part of the expression involving the strike $K$, we use the zero-coupon bond $P(t, T)$ as the numeraire. The corresponding forward measure is $Q^T$. The term becomes:\n$$\nK E^Q_0 [ \\exp(-\\int_0^T r_s ds) \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) ] = K P(0, T) E^{Q^T}_0 [ \\mathbb{I}(r_T < r_T^*) ] = K P(0, T) Q^T(r_T < r_T^*)\n$$\nCombining these results, the option price is:\n$$\nC(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i P(0, T_i) Q^{T_i}(r_T < r_T^*) - K P(0, T) Q^T(r_T < r_T^*)\n$$\nThe problem now reduces to computing the probabilities $Q^S(r_T < r_T^*)$ for $S \\in \\{T_1, \\dots, T_N, T\\}$. It is a known result for the CIR model that such probabilities under any forward measure can be expressed in terms of the non-central chi-square CDF.\n\nLet us define a generic function $\\mathbb{P}(t, T, S, z)$ for the time-$t$ conditional probability that $r_T < z$ under the $S$-forward measure $Q^S$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(t, T, S, z) := Q^S(r_T < z | \\mathcal{F}_t)\n$$\nThis probability is given by the CDF of a non-central chi-square distribution. Let $\\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}(x; d, \\lambda)$ denote this CDF with $x$ as the variable, $d$ degrees of freedom, and $\\lambda$ the non-centrality parameter. We define the following quantities:\n-   $\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\kappa^2 + 2\\sigma^2}$\n-   $d = \\frac{4\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2}$ (degrees of freedom)\n-   $\\phi(t,T) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^2(\\exp(\\gamma(T-t))-1)}$\n-   $\\psi = \\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{\\sigma^2}$\n\nWith these definitions, the probability function is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(t, T, S, z) = \\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}\\left( 2z \\left(\\phi(t,T)+\\psi+B(T,S)\\right); d; \\frac{2(\\phi(t,T))^2 r_t \\exp(\\gamma(T-t))}{\\phi(t,T)+\\psi+B(T,S)} \\right)\n$$\nFor our problem, $t=0$. The option price can be written as:\n$$\nC(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i P(0, T_i) \\mathbb{P}(0, T, T_i, r_T^*) - K P(0, T) \\mathbb{P}(0, T, T, r_T^*)\n$$\nNote that for the last term, the numeraire maturity $S$ is equal to the option expiry $T$. In this case, $B(T,T)=0$. The formula remains valid.\n\nThe final expression is obtained by substituting the explicit form of $\\mathbb{P}$ into the price formula. The critical rate $r_T^*$ is implicitly defined as the unique positive solution to $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i A(T,T_i) \\exp(-B(T,T_i) r_T^*) = K$.\n\nFinal expression is constructed by letting:\n-   $\\phi_T = \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^2(\\exp(\\gamma T)-1)}$\n-   $\\mathbb{P}_i = \\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}\\left( 2r_T^*(\\phi_T+\\psi+B(T,T_i)); d; \\frac{2\\phi_T^2 r_0 \\exp(\\gamma T)}{\\phi_T+\\psi+B(T,T_i)} \\right)$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n-   $\\mathbb{P}_K = \\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}\\left( 2r_T^*(\\phi_T+\\psi); d; \\frac{2\\phi_T^2 r_0 \\exp(\\gamma T)}{\\phi_T+\\psi} \\right)$ (since $B(T,T)=0$).\n\nThe option price is $C(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i P(0, T_i) \\mathbb{P}_i - K P(0, T) \\mathbb{P}_K$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i P(0, T_i) \\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}\\left( 2r_T^*\\left(\\phi_T+\\psi+B(T,T_i)\\right); d; \\frac{2\\phi_T^2 r_0 \\exp(\\gamma T)}{\\phi_T+\\psi+B(T,T_i)} \\right) - K P(0, T) \\chi^2_{\\text{cdf}}\\left( 2r_T^*\\left(\\phi_T+\\psi\\right); d; \\frac{2\\phi_T^2 r_0 \\exp(\\gamma T)}{\\phi_T+\\psi} \\right)}\n$$"}]}
