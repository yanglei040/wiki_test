It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total expected revenue over two years, $Z(x_1, x_2) = R_1(x_1) + R_2(x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the fractions of acreage allocated to corn in year $1$ and year $2$, respectively.

As the objective function is concave and the constraint set is convex, the optimal solution must lie on the boundary defined by the binding constraint. That is, at the optimum, we must have $\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 0.6$.\n\nTo find the Lagrange multiplier (shadow value) associated with this constraint, we formulate the Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}$. Let $\\lambda$ be the multiplier for the crop-rotation constraint. We ignore the box constraints for the moment as the unconstrained optimum $x_i = 2/3$ is within $[0,1]$ and the constrained optimum will be even closer to the center of the feasible set.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) = Z(x_1, x_2) - \\lambda \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} - 0.6\\right)\n$$\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for an optimal solution $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ are:\n1.

Complementary Slackness: $\\lambda \\left(\\frac{x_1^* + x_2^*}{2} - 0.6\\right) = 0$\n\nFrom the stationarity conditions, we have $-600x_1^* + 400 = -600x_2^* + 400$, which implies $x_1^* = x_2^*$. This result is expected due to the symmetry of the objective function and the constraint.\n\nAs established, the constraint must be binding, so $\\frac{x_1^* + x_2^*}{2} = 0.6$. Substituting $x_1^* = x_2^*$ into this equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{x_1^* + x_1^*}{2} = x_1^* = 0.6\n$$\nThus, the optimal allocation is $x_1^* = x_2^* = 0.6$.
