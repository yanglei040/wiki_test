Furthermore, by comparing your implementation to a numerically robust log-domain version, you will also confront a critical challenge in computational statistics: ensuring calculations remain stable and accurate.", "id": "2425912", "problem": "Implement from first principles a filtering algorithm for a two-state Markov-switching (regime-switching) Gaussian mean model and verify its correctness by comparing it against an independent, numerically stable forward implementation that mirrors the approach used in standard software. Consider a latent state process $\\{s_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ taking values in $\\{1,2\\}$ and an observed process $\\{y_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. The latent process is a first-order time-homogeneous Markov chain with transition probabilities collected in a matrix $P$, where the entry $P_{ij}$ is $P(s_t=j \\mid s_{t-1}=i)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$. The observation density is Gaussian with regime-dependent mean and common variance: $y_t \\mid s_t=j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_j,\\sigma^2)$, with known $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$, and $\\sigma>0$. The initial regime distribution is a probability vector $\\pi_0$ on $\\{1,2\\}$. Starting from Bayes’ rule, the law of total probability, and the Markov property, derive the recursive filtering logic to compute the filtered probabilities $p_t(j) \\equiv P(s_t=j \\mid y_1,\\dots,y_t)$ for $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ at each $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$, where $y_1,\\dots,y_T$ are the realized observations and $\\{p_t(j)\\}$ is updated sequentially. Implement this “Hamilton filter” purely in probability space. Separately, implement an independent reference computation using a log-domain forward recursion for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in which you propagate joint log-probabilities $\\log P(s_t=j,y_1,\\dots,y_t)$ and then normalize to obtain the same filtered probabilities; use the Log-Sum-Exp transformation to maintain numerical stability. Your program must, for each test case specified below, compute both sets of filtered probabilities over time and report the maximum absolute difference between the two implementations across all $t$ and both states. The difference for a test case is defined as $\\max_{t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\},\\, j \\in \\{1,2\\}} \\left| \\hat{p}_t(j) - \\tilde{p}_t(j) \\right|$, where $\\hat{p}_t(j)$ are the filtered probabilities from your Hamilton filter and $\\tilde{p}_t(j)$ are from your log-domain forward recursion.\n\nUse the following four test cases; in each case, the observation vector $y$ is given explicitly (no randomness is required), and all parameters are fixed. All numbers listed below are exact inputs and must be used as-is.\n\n- Test case $1$ (general case):\n  - $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.90 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.05 & 0.95 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n  - $\\mu = [0.0, 1.0]$,\n  - $\\sigma = 0.3$,\n  - $\\pi_0 = [0.5, 0.5]$,\n  - $y = [0.10, 0.90, 1.10, -0.20, 0.00, 0.80, 0.95, 0.05, 1.20, -0.10]$.\n\n- Test case $2$ (nearly absorbing regimes and strongly separated means):\n  - $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.99 & 0.01 \\\\ 0.02 & 0.98 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n  - $\\mu = [-1.0, 1.0]$,\n  - $\\sigma = 0.2$,\n  - $\\pi_0 = [0.9, 0.1]$,\n  - $y = [-0.8, -1.1, 0.9, 1.1, -0.9, -1.2]$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (identical means; observations uninformative about state):\n  - $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n  - $\\mu = [0.5, 0.5]$,\n  - $\\sigma = 0.4$,\n  - $\\pi_0 = [0.3, 0.7]$,\n  - $y = [0.2, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7]$.\n\n- Test case $4$ (very small variance; likelihoods sharply peaked):\n  - $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.85 & 0.15 \\\\ 0.10 & 0.90 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n  - $\\mu = [0.0, 1.0]$,\n  - $\\sigma = 0.05$,\n  - $\\pi_0 = [0.5, 0.5]$,\n  - $y = [0.02, 0.98, 0.01, 1.02]$.\n\nYour program must, for each of the four test cases above, compute the Hamilton filter and the log-domain forward filter described earlier and then compute the maximum absolute difference between the two sets of filtered probabilities across all times and states. The final output must be a single line containing these four differences, in the same order as the test cases, formatted as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each difference rounded to within $10^{-12}$ using scientific notation with a lower-case $e$ (for example, $[1.234000000000e-12,3.400000000000e-15, \\dots]$). No physical units, angles, or percentages are involved.", "solution": "The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and provides all necessary information for a complete solution. It describes a standard two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Gaussian emissions, a cornerstone of computational statistics and econometrics. The task is to derive and implement the canonical filtering algorithm, known as the Hamilton filter, and to verify its numerical output against a robust log-domain implementation of the HMM forward algorithm.\n\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Model Specification\n\nLet $\\{s_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ be a latent state variable representing the unobserved regime at time $t$, where $s_t \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. This process is a first-order, time-homogeneous Markov chain with a $2 \\times 2$ transition probability matrix $P$, where $P_{ij} = P(s_t = j \\mid s_{t-1} = i)$. The initial state distribution at $t=1$ is given by the vector $\\pi_0 = [P(s_1=1), P(s_1=2)]^T$.\n\nThe observed process is $\\{y_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. The observation $y_t$ at time $t$ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution whose mean depends on the current state $s_t$. The conditional density of $y_t$ is given by:\n$$\ny_t \\mid (s_t = j) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_j, \\sigma^2)\n$$\nThe corresponding probability density function (PDF) is denoted $f(y_t \\mid s_t=j)$. We assume that, conditional on the current state $s_t$, the observation $y_t$ is independent of all previous states and observations.\n\nThe objective of filtering is to compute the sequence of posterior probabilities of the latent state, $p_t(j) \\equiv P(s_t=j \\mid Y_t)$, for $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and $t=1, \\dots, T$, where $Y_t = \\{y_1, \\dots, y_t\\}$ denotes the history of observations up to time $t$.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Hamilton Filter (Probability Space)\n\nThe Hamilton filter is a recursive algorithm consisting of a prediction step and an update step. We derive the recursion for updating the filtered probability from $p_{t-1}(i) \\equiv P(s_{t-1}=i \\mid Y_{t-1})$ to $p_t(j) \\equiv P(s_t=j \\mid Y_t)$.\n\n**Step 1: Prediction**\nFirst, we compute the probability of being in state $j$ at time $t$ given the information up to time $t-1$. This is the predicted probability, $p_{t|t-1}(j) = P(s_t=j \\mid Y_{t-1})$. Using the law of total probability and the Markov property:\n$$\np_{t|t-1}(j) = P(s_t=j \\mid Y_{t-1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P(s_t=j, s_{t-1}=i \\mid Y_{t-1})\n$$\nApplying the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\np_{t|t-1}(j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P(s_t=j \\mid s_{t-1}=i, Y_{t-1}) P(s_{t-1}=i \\mid Y_{t-1})\n$$\nBy the Markov property of the state process, the transition to state $s_t$ depends only on the previous state $s_{t-1}$, not the past observations $Y_{t-1}$. Thus, $P(s_t=j \\mid s_{t-1}=i, Y_{t-1}) = P(s_t=j \\mid s_{t-1}=i) = P_{ij}$. This yields the prediction step:\n$$\np_{t|t-1}(j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P_{ij} \\, p_{t-1}(i)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Update**\nNext, we incorporate the new observation $y_t$ using Bayes' rule to update the predicted probability to the filtered probability:\n$$\np_t(j) = P(s_t=j \\mid Y_t) = P(s_t=j \\mid y_t, Y_{t-1}) = \\frac{f(y_t \\mid s_t=j, Y_{t-1}) P(s_t=j \\mid Y_{t-1})}{f(y_t \\mid Y_{t-1})}\n$$\nDue to the conditional independence of observations, $f(y_t \\mid s_t=j, Y_{t-1}) = f(y_t \\mid s_t=j)$. The denominator is a normalizing constant, calculated by summing the numerator over all possible states $k$:\n$$\nf(y_t \\mid Y_{t-1}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} f(y_t \\mid s_t=k) P(s_t=k \\mid Y_{t-1})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the update equation gives:\n$$\np_t(j) = \\frac{f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) \\, p_{t|t-1}(j)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} f(y_t \\mid s_t=k) \\, p_{t|t-1}(k)}\n$$\n\n**Initialization ($t=1$)**:\nThe recursion starts at $t=1$. The \"predicted\" probability for the first time step is the initial distribution: $p_{1|0}(j) = \\pi_0(j)$. The first filtered probability is then:\n$$\np_1(j) = \\frac{f(y_1 \\mid s_1=j) \\, \\pi_0(j)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} f(y_1 \\mid s_1=k) \\, \\pi_0(k)}\n$$\nThis formulation, while mathematically correct, can suffer from numerical underflow if the observation sequence is long or if likelihoods $f(y_t \\mid s_t=j)$ are very small, as probabilities will tend towards zero.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Log-Domain Forward Algorithm\n\nTo ensure numerical stability, we can work with joint log-probabilities. This is the standard forward algorithm for HMMs. Let $\\alpha_t(j) = P(s_t=j, Y_t)$ be the joint probability of being in state $j$ at time $t$ and observing the sequence $Y_t$.\n\n**Recursion for $\\alpha_t(j)$**:\nWe can express $\\alpha_t(j)$ in terms of $\\alpha_{t-1}(i)$:\n$$\n\\alpha_t(j) = P(s_t=j, y_t, Y_{t-1}) = f(y_t \\mid s_t=j, Y_{t-1}) P(s_t=j, Y_{t-1})\n$$\nUsing conditional independence and the law of total probability:\n$$\n\\alpha_t(j) = f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P(s_t=j, s_{t-1}=i, Y_{t-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_t(j) = f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P(s_t=j \\mid s_{t-1}=i, Y_{t-1}) P(s_{t-1}=i, Y_{t-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_t(j) = f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P_{ij} \\, \\alpha_{t-1}(i)\n$$\n\n**Log-Domain Implementation**:\nTo prevent underflow, we work with $\\ell_t(j) = \\log \\alpha_t(j)$. Taking the logarithm of the recursion above:\n$$\n\\ell_t(j) = \\log f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) + \\log\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{2} P_{ij} \\exp(\\ell_{t-1}(i)) \\right)\n$$\nThe summation term is numerically unstable. We rewrite it as:\n$$\n\\ell_t(j) = \\log f(y_t \\mid s_t=j) + \\log\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\exp(\\log P_{ij} + \\ell_{t-1}(i)) \\right)\n$$\nThe sum is computed using the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) transformation: $\\text{LSE}(x_1, \\dots, x_N) = \\log(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\exp(x_i)) = M + \\log(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\exp(x_i - M))$, where $M = \\max(x_1, \\dots, x_N)$. This stabilizes the computation.\n\n**Initialization ($t=1$)**:\n$$\n\\alpha_1(j) = P(s_1=j, y_1) = P(y_1 \\mid s_1=j) P(s_1=j) = f(y_1 \\mid s_1=j) \\pi_0(j)\n$$\nIn the log domain:\n$$\n\\ell_1(j) = \\log f(y_1 \\mid s_1=j) + \\log \\pi_0(j)\n$$\n\n**Recovering Filtered Probabilities**:\nThe filtered probability $p_t(j)$ is obtained by normalizing the joint probabilities $\\alpha_t(j)$:\n$$\np_t(j) = P(s_t=j \\mid Y_t) = \\frac{P(s_t=j, Y_t)}{P(Y_t)} = \\frac{\\alpha_t(j)}{\\sum_{k=1}^2 \\alpha_t(k)}\n$$\nIn the log domain, this is a numerically stable softmax operation:\n$$\np_t(j) = \\frac{\\exp(\\ell_t(j))}{\\sum_{k=1}^2 \\exp(\\ell_t(k))} = \\exp(\\ell_t(j) - \\text{LSE}(\\ell_t(1), \\ell_t(2)))\n$$\nThis second implementation provides a numerically robust benchmark against which the direct Hamilton filter can be verified.

The concept of a non-recurrent or absorbing state is a fundamental element of Markov chain theory. The model is a well-established statistical tool.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. It asks for the most appropriate modeling strategy to implement a specific, mathematically defined constraint on the dynamics of the Markov chain. The question is unambiguous and admits a specific answer based on principles of probability theory and statistical modeling.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and free of subjectivity. The term \"non-recurrent\" is explicitly defined in probabilistic terms, leaving no room for interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is the implementation of the theoretical constraint that \"once the process leaves regime $1$ it can never return to regime $1$ thereafter\". This is explicitly formalized as $\\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid S_{t-1}=2) = 0$.\n\nIn the notation of the transition matrix $P$, the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ is $p_{ij}$. The probability of transitioning from regime $2$ to regime $1$ is therefore $p_{21} = \\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid S_{t-1}=2)$. The constraint directly implies that $p_{21}$ must be equal to $0$.\n\nThe transition matrix for a general two-state Markov chain is:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\np_{11} & p_{12} \\\\\np_{21} & p_{22}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows of a transition matrix must sum to $1$. Thus, we have the relations $p_{11} + p_{12} = 1$ and $p_{21} + p_{22} = 1$.\n\nImposing the constraint $p_{21} = 0$ on the second row gives $0 + p_{22} = 1$, which implies $p_{22} = 1$. The first row remains governed by $p_{12} = 1 - p_{11}$. The constrained transition matrix must therefore take the form:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\np_{11} & 1 - p_{11} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis structure has a clear interpretation:\n- If the system is in regime $1$, it can either stay in regime $1$ (with probability $p_{11}$) or switch to regime $2$ (with probability $1 - p_{11}$).\n- If the system is in regime $2$, it must stay in regime $2$ (with probability $1$).\n\nRegime $2$ is an **absorbing state**. Once the process enters regime $2$, it can never leave. This means that a switch can happen at most once in the history of the process, from regime $1$ to regime $2$. This specification perfectly captures the theoretical constraint. The remaining unknown parameter of the transition process, $p_{11}$, must be estimated from the data along with the other model parameters ($\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\sigma^2$), typically by maximizing the likelihood function subject to this constrained structure. The parameter space for $p_{11}$ is typically the open interval $(0,1)$ to avoid trivial cases where the process is permanently stuck in regime $1$ ($p_{11}=1$) or switches immediately ($p_{11}=0$).\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Constrain the transition matrix to\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\np_{11} & 1 - p_{11} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p_{11} \\in (0,1),\n$$\nso that regime $2$ is absorbing and a switch from regime $1$ to regime $2$ can occur at most once. Estimate all parameters, including $p_{11}$, by maximum likelihood under these constraints.**\n\nThis option aligns exactly with the derivation above. It correctly identifies $p_{21}=0$ as the necessary constraint, derives the correct structure for the transition matrix, correctly interprets regime $2$ as an absorbing state, and proposes the standard statistical procedure (constrained maximum likelihood) for estimation. This is the direct, rigorous, and most appropriate method for incorporating the theoretical information into the model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Keep a fully ergodic Markov chain with $p_{12} > 0$ and $p_{21} > 0$, but set the initial distribution to satisfy $\\mathbb{P}(S_0 = 1)$ very small; estimate without imposing any constraints on $P$.**\n\nThis approach is fundamentally incorrect. The problem requires that the process *cannot* return to regime $1$ from regime $2$. A model with $p_{21} > 0$ explicitly allows for such a return. The constraint is on the transition dynamics for all time $t$, not on the initial condition at $t=0$. Adjusting the initial distribution $\\mathbb{P}(S_0=1)$ does not prevent the forbidden transition $\\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid S_{t-1}=2)$ from occurring at any subsequent time. This method fails to impose the structural constraint demanded by the theory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Replace the Markov chain by an independent and identically distributed regime indicator, taking $S_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(q)$ independently across $t$, and estimate $q$ by maximum likelihood; this ensures non-recurrence.**\n\nThis is a complete alteration of the model's structure. A Markov chain has memory, where the state at time $t$ depends on the state at $t-1$. An i.i.d. Bernoulli process for $S_t$ has no memory. In such a model, $\\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid S_{t-1}=2) = \\mathbb{P}(S_t=1) = q$. The non-recurrence constraint $\\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid S_{t-1}=2)=0$ would force $q=0$, which means $S_t=2$ for all $t$, reducing the model to a single-regime model. This is almost certainly not the intended model. Therefore, the assertion that this procedure \"ensures non-recurrence\" is false in any non-trivial context. This option discards the Markovian dependence structure central to the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Do not change the transition matrix, but interpret non-recurrence as an asymptotic property by choosing $p_{21}$ very close to $0$ while leaving it strictly positive; estimate all entries of $P$ freely from the data.**\n\nThe theoretical constraint is absolute: \"never return\", which means $p_{21}=0$. This option suggests an approximation ($p_{21} \\approx 0$) rather than an exact implementation. Furthermore, it suggests estimating the parameters \"freely\", which means *not* imposing the constraint during estimation. If the data happen to suggest a non-negligible value for $p_{21}$, a free estimation will produce such a value, thereby ignoring the theoretical constraint. A proper imposition of a constraint involves restricting the parameter space during estimation, not merely hoping for a particular outcome. This approach is an ad-hoc approximation and is not the \"most appropriate\" way to enforce a strict theoretical requirement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "One of the primary applications of time series models is forecasting, and regime-switching models offer a sophisticated framework for this task.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of Markov-switching models, a standard topic in computational economics and finance. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and conditions to compute a unique conditional expectation. The language is objective and mathematically precise, leaving no room for ambiguity. I will therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the $h$-step-ahead forecast of a scalar time series $y_t$ governed by a Markov-switching autoregressive model of order one, MS-AR(1). The forecast is the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[y_{t+h} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t]$, where $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is the information set at time $t$, which includes the value $y_t$ and allows for the determination of the filtered state probabilities $\\pi_t$.

A direct recursion on the scalar forecast $\\hat{y}_{t+k|t} = \\mathbb{E}[y_{t+k} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t]$ is complicated by a correlation term $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi_{S_{t+k}} y_{t+k-1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t]$. A more robust approach involves defining a state vector for the recursion that carries sufficient information for propagation.\n\nLet us define a column vector $\\mathbf{z}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ for each forecast step $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, h\\}$ as:\n$$ (\\mathbf{z}_k)_i = \\mathbb{E}[y_{t+k} \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_{t+k}=i\\}} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t] $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_{t+k}=i\\}}$ is the indicator function for the event $S_{t+k}=i$.

The sum $\\sum_{j=1}^N P_{ji} (\\mathbf{z}_{k-1})_j$ is the $i$-th element of the vector product $P^T \\mathbf{z}_{k-1}$.\nCombining all pieces, we obtain the recursion for the $i$-th component of $\\mathbf{z}_k$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{z}_k)_i = \\mu_i \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_t P^k)_i + \\phi_i \\cdot (P^T \\mathbf{z}_{k-1})_i $$\nThis can be written in matrix form.
