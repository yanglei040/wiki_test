It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and definitions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected value and standard deviation of the real simple return on a nominal Treasury bill, and the implication for the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) in real terms.\n\nFirst, we define and analyze the random variable for the real simple return, $R_f^{\\text{real}}$.\nGiven data:\nThe nominal risk-free simple return is $r_f^{N} = 0.03$.\nThe gross nominal return on the Treasury bill is therefore $1 + r_f^{N} = 1.03$, which is a constant.\nGross inflation is $I \\equiv 1 + \\pi$.\nThe distribution of the logarithm of gross inflation is given as $\\ln I \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_I, \\sigma_I^2)$, with parameters $\\mu_I = 0.02$ and $\\sigma_I = 0.04$.\nThis implies that $I$ follows a log-normal distribution.\nThe ex post real simple return on the Treasury bill is defined as:\n$$R_f^{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1 + r_f^{N}}{I} - 1 = \\frac{1.03}{I} - 1$$\nTo find the expected value and standard deviation of $R_f^{\\text{real}}$, we need the first two moments of the random variable $1/I$.\nLet $X = \\ln I$. We are given $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_I, \\sigma_I^2)$.\nThe variable of interest is $1/I = e^{-\\ln I} = e^{-X}$.\nSince $X$ is normally distributed, $-X$ is also normally distributed: $-X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-\\mu_I, \\sigma_I^2)$.\nTherefore, $1/I$ is a log-normally distributed random variable.\n\nThe $k$-th moment of a log-normal variable $Y = e^W$, where $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_W, \\sigma_W^2)$, is given by $\\mathbb{E}[Y^k] = e^{k\\mu_W + \\frac{1}{2}k^2\\sigma_W^2}$.\nFor our variable $1/I$, the underlying normal variable is $W = -X$, with $\\mu_W = -\\mu_I = -0.02$ and $\\sigma_W = \\sigma_I = 0.04$.\n\nThe expected value of $1/I$ is the first moment ($k=1$):\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{I}\\right] = e^{1 \\cdot (-\\mu_I) + \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2\\sigma_I^2} = e^{-\\mu_I + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_I^2}$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{I}\\right] = e^{-0.02 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2} = e^{-0.02 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.0016)} = e^{-0.02 + 0.0008} = e^{-0.0192}$$\n$$e^{-0.0192} \\approx 0.9809904$$\nNow, we can find the expected value of the real return:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1.03}{I} - 1\\right] = 1.03 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{I}\\right] - 1$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] = 1.03 \\cdot e^{-0.0192} - 1 \\approx 1.03 \\cdot (0.9809904) - 1$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] \\approx 1.0104199 - 1 = 0.0104199 \\approx 0.0104$$\n\nNext, we calculate the standard deviation, $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}})$. First, we find the variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(R_f^{\\text{real}})$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1.03}{I} - 1\\right) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1.03}{I}\\right) = (1.03)^2 \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)$$\nThe variance of a log-normal variable $Y$ can be calculated as $\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[Y^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2$.\nWe need the second moment of $1/I$ ($k=2$):\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)^2\\right] = e^{2 \\cdot (-\\mu_I) + \\frac{1}{2}(2)^2\\sigma_I^2} = e^{-2\\mu_I + 2\\sigma_I^2}$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)^2\\right] = e^{-2(0.02) + 2(0.04)^2} = e^{-0.04 + 2(0.0016)} = e^{-0.04 + 0.0032} = e^{-0.0368}$$\n$$e^{-0.0368} \\approx 0.9638703$$\nWe already found $(\\mathbb{E}[1/I])^2 = (e^{-0.0192})^2 = e^{-0.0384} \\approx (0.9809904)^2 \\approx 0.9623422$.\nSo, the variance of $1/I$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)^2\\right] - \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{I}\\right]\\right)^2 = e^{-0.0368} - e^{-0.0384}$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right) \\approx 0.9638703 - 0.9623319 = 0.0015384$$\nNow, substitute this into the variance expression for $R_f^{\\text{real}}$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) = (1.03)^2 \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right) \\approx 1.0609 \\cdot (0.0015384) \\approx 0.0016321$$\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(R_f^{\\text{real}})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0016321} \\approx 0.040399$$\nRounding to four decimal places, we get $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) \\approx 0.0404$.\n\nThe implication for the real CAL: In a standard mean-standard deviation diagram where one axis is expected return $\\mathbb{E}[R]$ and the other is standard deviation $\\operatorname{sd}(R)$, a risk-free asset is a point on the vertical axis (the $y$-axis), as its standard deviation is zero. The CAL is the line starting from this point and tangent to the efficient frontier of risky assets.\nIn this problem, the nominal Treasury bill is risk-free only in nominal terms. When its return is converted to real terms, it is subject to inflation risk. As we calculated, the standard deviation of its real return is $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) \\approx 0.0404$, which is non-zero.\nThus, in a real-term mean-standard deviation diagram, the Treasury bill is no longer a risk-free asset. It is a risky asset represented by the point $(\\sigma, \\mu) = (\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}), \\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}]) \\approx (0.0404, 0.0104)$.\nThis point is not on the $y$-axis. The \"real CAL,\" formed by combining this asset with a risky market portfolio, is a curve (a hyperbola, unless correlation is perfect) connecting two points in the risky $(\\sigma>0)$ plane. It does not have a $y$-intercept in the traditional sense of a risk-free rate. The foundation of the CAL has shifted from a risk-free point to a risky point.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. $\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] \\approx r_f^{N} - \\mathbb{E}[\\pi] \\approx 0.0090$, $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) = 0$. The real CAL still intersects the $y$-axis sharply at approximately $0.90\\%$.**\nThe calculation for the expected return uses the first-order Fisher approximation, which is less precise than the exact formula. More critically, it incorrectly states that the standard deviation of the real return is zero. Because inflation is uncertain, the real return on a nominal asset is uncertain. The implication for the CAL is also incorrect because the asset is not risk-free in real terms.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] = (1 + r_f^{N})\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\dfrac{1}{I}\\right] - 1 \\approx 0.0104$ and $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) = (1 + r_f^{N})\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\dfrac{1}{I}\\right)} \\approx 0.0405$. Thus, the real “risk-free” point has positive horizontal dispersion; the $y$-intercept of the real CAL is not a sharp point on the $y$-axis but becomes a diffuse band centered near $1.04\\%$ with nonzero horizontal spread.**\nThe formula for the expected value is correct, and the numerical value $\\approx 0.0104$ matches our calculation. The formula for the standard deviation is also correct. Our calculation yielded $\\approx 0.0404$, which is extremely close to the provided value of $0.0405$; the minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's construction. The qualitative description of the implication is accurate: the so-called \"risk-free\" asset now has positive standard deviation (\"horizontal dispersion\"), and therefore is not a point on the $y$-axis. The description of this change as becoming a \"diffuse band\" is a non-technical but conceptually correct way to express that the certain risk-free anchor point is gone.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] = \\dfrac{1 + r_f^{N}}{1 + \\mathbb{E}[\\pi]} - 1 \\approx 0.0088$ and $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) \\approx 0.0400$. Inflation risk diversifies away in large portfolios, so the real CAL’s $y$-intercept is unaffected.**\nThe formula for the expected value is incorrect; it is an erroneous application of expectations, as $\\mathbb{E}[1/I] \\neq 1/\\mathbb{E}[I]$. The standard deviation value $0.0400$ is a common but less precise approximation ($\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) \\approx \\sigma_I$). The statement that inflation risk diversifies away is fundamentally incorrect. Inflation is a source of systematic risk, as it affects the real value of all nominal contracts in an economy. It cannot be eliminated through portfolio diversification.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mathbb{E}[R_f^{\\text{real}}] = r_f^{N} = 0.03$ while $\\operatorname{sd}(R_f^{\\text{real}}) > 0$ due to inflation. The real CAL’s $y$-intercept remains at $3\\%$, but the CAL rotates to have a smaller slope as risky-asset volatility rises.**\nThis option incorrectly claims the expected real return equals the nominal risk-free rate, ignoring the effect of inflation entirely. While it correctly states that the standard deviation is greater than zero, the conclusion that the $y$-intercept remains at $3\\%$ is contradictory. If the standard deviation is positive, the point cannot be on the $y$-axis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Standard financial models often assume that asset returns are independent from one day to the next, but in reality, return patterns can exhibit persistence.

The normalized tangency portfolio weights are then:\n$$ w^\\star = \\frac{w_{\\text{unscaled}}}{k} = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_e}{\\mathbf{1}^\\top (\\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_e)} = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1} (\\mu - r_f \\mathbf{1})}{\\mathbf{1}^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (\\mu - r_f \\mathbf{1})} $$\nComputationally, it is more numerically stable to solve the linear system `$\\Sigma w_{\\text{unscaled}} = \\mu_e$` for `$w_{\\text{unscaled}}$` rather than computing the inverse of `$\\Sigma}` directly.\n\nOnce the tangency portfolio weights `$w^\\star$` are determined, we can calculate its expected return `$\\mu_p^\\star = \\mu^\\top w^\\star$` and standard deviation `$\\sigma_p^\\star = \\sqrt{(w^\\star)^\\top \\Sigma w^\\star}`.\n\nThe slope of the Capital Allocation Line, `$S$`, is the Sharpe ratio of this tangency portfolio:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\mu_p^\\star - r_f}{\\sigma_p^\\star} = \\frac{\\mu^\\top w^\\star - r_f}{\\sqrt{(w^\\star)^\\top \\Sigma w^\\star}} $$\n\nFinally, the expected return on the CAL for a given target standard deviation `$\\bar{\\sigma} \\ge 0$` is given by the linear relationship:\n$$ E_{\\text{CAL}}(\\bar{\\sigma}) = r_f + S \\cdot \\bar{\\sigma} $$\nThis formula describes the expected return of a complete portfolio formed by allocating a certain fraction of capital to the tangency portfolio and the remainder to the risk-free asset. For `$\\bar{\\sigma} = 0.0$`, the portfolio is `$100\\%$` in the risk-free asset, and `$E_{\\text{CAL}}(0.0) = r_f$`.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Initialize a random number generator with the given seed `$s$`.\n2.  Generate a `$50 \\times 50$` matrix `$A$` of standard normal random variates from `$\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$`.\n3.  Compute `$M = A A^\\top$`.\n4.  Construct the correlation matrix `$R$` where `$R_{ij} = M_{ij} / \\sqrt{M_{ii} M_{jj}}$`.\n5.  Generate the vector of standard deviations `$\\sigma$` from `$U(0.05, 0.35)$` and the vector of expected returns `$\\mu$` from `$U(0.02, 0.18)$`.\n6.  Construct the covariance matrix `$\\Sigma = D R D$`, where `$D = \\operatorname{diag}(\\sigma)$`.\n7.  Compute the excess return vector `$\\mu_e = \\mu - r_f \\mathbf{1}`.\n8.  Solve the linear system `$\\Sigma w_{\\text{unscaled}} = \\mu_e$` for `$w_{\\text{unscaled}}`.\n9.  Normalize the weights: `$w^\\star = w_{\\text{unscaled}} / (\\mathbf{1}^\\top w_{\\text{unscaled}})$`.\n10. Calculate the CAL slope `$S = (\\mu^\\top w^\\star - r_f) / \\sqrt{(w^\\star)^\\top \\Sigma w^\\star}`.\n11. Calculate `$E_{\\text{CAL}}(\\bar{\\sigma}) = r_f + S \\cdot \\bar{\\sigma}` for `$\\bar{\\sigma} \\in \\{0.0, 0.05, 0.15\\}`.\n12.
