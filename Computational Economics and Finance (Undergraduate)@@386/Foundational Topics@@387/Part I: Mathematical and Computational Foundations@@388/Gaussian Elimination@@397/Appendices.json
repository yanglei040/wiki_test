An analyst attempts to recover $(q_1, q_2)$ by solving the $2\\times 2$ linear system for $(q_1, q_2)$ using Gaussian elimination.

Rounding to $3$ significant figures gives $0.998$.\nThe system becomes:\n$$\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1.00 & 1.00 & 2.00 \\\\\n0 & 0.999 & 0.998\n\\end{array} \\right]\n$$\nWe perform back substitution for the solution $(\\hat{q}_1, \\hat{q}_2)$.\nFrom the second row: $0.999 \\hat{q}_2 = 0.998$.\n$\\hat{q}_2 = \\frac{0.998}{0.999} \\approx 0.99899...$.

Rounding to $3$ significant figures gives $1.00$.\n$1.00 \\hat{q}_1 = 1.00$, so $\\hat{q}_1 = 1.00$.\nThe solution with partial pivoting is $(\\hat{q}_1, \\hat{q}_2) = (1.00, 0.999)$.\n\nThe new model-implied value is $\\hat{v} = \\hat{q}_1 = 1.00$.\nThe arbitrage profit is now $\\hat{\\pi} = v - \\hat{v} = 1.00 - 1.00 = 0$.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe spurious arbitrage is a direct consequence of numerical instability in the Gaussian elimination algorithm without pivoting. The matrix $A$ has elements of vastly different magnitudes.\n\nWhen no pivoting is used, the small element $a_{11} = 0.00123$ is chosen as the pivot. This results in a very large multiplier, $m_{21} = 813$. During the elimination step $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - m_{21} R_1$, the original information in row $2$ is effectively destroyed by subtraction of a large number. The term $m_{21} \\times a_{12} = 813$ swamps the original value of $a_{22}=1.00$. This leads to catastrophic cancellation in the subsequent back-substitution step ($1.00 - 0.999 = 0.001$), where two nearly equal numbers are subtracted, resulting in a loss of significant figures from $3$ to $1$. The final result $\\tilde{q}_1 = 0.813$ is grossly inaccurate compared to the true value of $q_1 = 1$.\n\nPartial pivoting corrects this instability. By swapping rows, it ensures that the pivot element is the largest-magnitude element available in the column. In this case, $1.00$ becomes the pivot. This guarantees that the multiplier $m_{21} = 0.00123$ is small (specifically, $|m_{ij}| \\le 1$). When performing the elimination step, we subtract a small quantity, which preserves the significant digits of the original matrix entries. The resulting calculation is numerically stable, yielding $\\hat{q}_1 = 1.00$, which is accurate to the working precision of $3$ significant figures. This accurate state price leads to a model value $\\hat{v}$ that matches the observed market value $v$, correctly indicating the absence of arbitrage.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.187}\n$$"}]}
