The valuation is based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) model for a perpetuity with constant growth.\n\nFirst, we establish the general formula for the enterprise value ($EV$) of a firm with free cash flows to the firm ($FCFF$) growing at a constant rate $g$ and discounted at a rate $r$. The value at time $t=0$ is the present value of the perpetuity:\n$$EV = \\frac{FCFF_1}{r - g}$$\nThe problem states that all cash flow streams grow at the revenue growth rate $g = 0.03$ and should be discounted at the unlevered cost of capital $r_u = 0.08$.

This involves two steps as per the problem description:\na) Calculate the present value of the \"pre-lease\" $FCFF$.

The lease payments, $L_t = s \\times R_t$, are added back to the reported $EBIT$ to get a pre-lease $EBIT$:\n$$EBIT_t^{\\text{after}} = EBIT_t^{\\text{before}} + L_t = m R_t + s R_t = (m+s)R_t$$\nThe corresponding NOPAT is:\n$$NOPAT_t^{\\text{after}} = EBIT_t^{\\text{after}} \\times (1 - \\tau) = (m+s)R_t (1 - \\tau)$$\nThe pre-lease $FCFF$ is calculated using this adjusted NOPAT, while reinvestment remains the same:\n$$FCFF_t^{\\text{pre-lease}} = NOPAT_t^{\\text{after}} - \\Delta NWC_t = (m+s)R_t(1 - \\tau) - w R_t \\frac{g}{1+g}$$\nThe present value of this pre-lease $FCFF$ stream is:\n$$PV(FCFF^{\\text{pre-lease}}) = \\frac{FCFF_1^{\\text{pre-lease}}}{r_u - g} = \\frac{R_1 \\left( (m+s)(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} \\right)}{r_u - g}$$\n\nNext, we compute the value of the lease liability, $V_L$. The problem specifies this as the present value of the infinite stream of after-tax lease payments, discounted at $r_u$.\nThe after-tax lease payment at time $t$ is $L_t(1 - \\tau) = s R_t (1 - \\tau)$. This stream also grows at rate $g$.\n$$V_L = \\frac{L_1(1-\\tau)}{r_u - g} = \\frac{s R_1 (1 - \\tau)}{r_u - g}$$\nThe enterprise value in the \"after\" case is:\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = PV(FCFF^{\\text{pre-lease}}) - V_L$$\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_1 \\left( (m+s)(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} \\right)}{r_u - g} - \\frac{s R_1 (1 - \\tau)}{r_u - g}$$\nCombining the terms in the numerator:\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_1}{r_u - g} \\left[ (m+s)(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} - s(1 - \\tau) \\right]$$\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_1}{r_u - g} \\left[ m(1 - \\tau) + s(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} - s(1 - \\tau) \\right]$$\nThe term $s(1-\\tau)$ cancels out:\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_1 \\left( m(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} \\right)}{r_u - g}$$\n\n**3. The Difference ($\\Delta EV$)**\n\nBy comparing the derived expressions for $EV_{\\text{before}}$ and $EV_{\\text{after}}$, we find they are identical:\n$$EV_{\\text{before}} = EV_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_1 \\left( m(1 - \\tau) - w \\frac{g}{1+g} \\right)}{r_u - g}$$\nThis equivalence arises because the problem defines a valuation framework where the accounting change is modeled consistently. The \"before\" valuation implicitly includes the net effect of leasing in its $FCFF$. The \"after\" valuation explicitly separates the operating and financing components of the lease, but under the specified assumptions (particularly, discounting the after-tax lease payments at $r_u$), the net result is identical.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the two enterprise values is zero.\n$$\\Delta EV = EV_{\\text{after}} - EV_{\\text{before}} = 0$$\n\nLet us insert the given numerical values to confirm.\n$R_1 = 5,000$, $m=0.08$, $\\tau=0.25$, $w=0.05$, $g=0.03$, $r_u=0.08$.\n$$FCFF_1^{\\text{before}} = 5000 \\left( 0.08(1-0.25) - 0.05 \\frac{0.03}{1+0.03} \\right) = 5000 \\left( 0.06 - \\frac{0.0015}{1.03} \\right) = 300 - \\frac{7.5}{1.03}$$\n$$EV_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{300 - \\frac{7.5}{1.03}}{0.08 - 0.03} = \\frac{300 - \\frac{7.5}{1.03}}{0.05} = 6000 - \\frac{150}{1.03}$$\nFor the after case:\n$s=0.06$.\n$$PV(FCFF^{\\text{pre-lease}}) = \\frac{5000 \\left( (0.08+0.06)(0.75) - \\frac{0.0015}{1.03} \\right)}{0.05} = \\frac{5000 \\left( 0.105 - \\frac{0.0015}{1.03} \\right)}{0.05} = 10500 - \\frac{150}{1.03}$$\n$$V_L = \\frac{0.06 \\times 5000 \\times (1-0.25)}{0.05} = \\frac{300 \\times 0.75}{0.05} = \\frac{225}{0.05} = 4500$$\n$$EV_{\\text{after}} = (10500 - \\frac{150}{1.03}) - 4500 = 6000 - \\frac{150}{1.03}$$\nThe numerical results confirm $EV_{\\text{before}} = EV_{\\text{after}}$.\nThe difference is precisely zero. The question concerns a fundamental principle of value invariance to consistent accounting representations, not a complex calculation. The numerical result is $0$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$"}]}
