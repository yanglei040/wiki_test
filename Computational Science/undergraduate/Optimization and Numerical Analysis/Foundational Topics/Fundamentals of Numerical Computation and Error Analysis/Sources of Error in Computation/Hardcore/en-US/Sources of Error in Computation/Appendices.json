            "introduction": "Understanding the sources of error often begins with the data itself. This first practice explores the concept of **propagated error**, demonstrating how uncertainties in initial measurements can amplify through calculations. Using the familiar formula for the volume of a sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, you will see firsthand how a small error in measuring a radius leads to a predictable, and often larger, error in the calculated volume . This principle is fundamental in experimental physics, engineering, and any field where results depend on measured quantities.",

            "problem": "A materials science lab is synthesizing spherical nanoparticles for use in advanced catalytic converters. The catalytic efficiency of these particles is known to be highly dependent on their volume. The volume, $V$, of each particle is calculated based on its radius, $r$, using the standard formula for a sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nThe radius of a single nanoparticle is measured using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Due to instrumental limitations and quantum effects at this scale, the measurement of the radius is subject to a relative error of $0.15\\%$. Assuming this error is small, determine the propagated relative error in the calculated volume of the nanoparticle.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal value.",
            "solution": "The particle volume depends on the radius via $V(r) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$. For small errors, the first-order (linear) propagation of relative error uses differentials. Differentiate:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dr} = 4\\pi r^{2},\n$$\nso\n$$\ndV = 4\\pi r^{2}\\,dr.\n$$\nDivide both sides by $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V} = \\frac{4\\pi r^{2}\\,dr}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}} = 3\\,\\frac{dr}{r}.\n$$\nThus, the propagated relative error satisfies\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\Delta V}{V}\\right| \\approx 3\\,\\left|\\frac{\\Delta r}{r}\\right|.\n$$\nThe given relative error in $r$ is $0.0015$ (since $0.15\\% = 0.0015$), hence the relative error in $V$ is\n$$\n3 \\times 0.0015 = 0.0045.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Many essential mathematical functions are implemented in computers using infinite series approximations. Because a computer can only perform a finite number of operations, we must \"truncate\" the series, which introduces **truncation error**. This exercise challenges you to determine the number of terms needed from a Maclaurin series to approximate a logarithm to a specific level of accuracy . By doing so, you will gain practical insight into managing the critical trade-off between computational effort and the precision of your results.",

            "problem": "A programmer is tasked with implementing a high-precision natural logarithm function, `log(y)`, for a specialized computational library. To handle inputs `y` that are very close to 1, the function uses the Maclaurin series expansion for $f(x) = \\ln(1+x)$, where $x = y-1$. The Maclaurin series is given by:\n$$ \\ln(1+x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \\frac{x^n}{n} = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\dots $$\nFor a specific benchmark test, the value of $\\ln(1.01)$ must be calculated. The requirement is that the absolute value of the truncation error—the difference between the true value of $\\ln(1.01)$ and the partial sum from the series—must be strictly less than $10^{-8}$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of terms of the series that must be summed to guarantee that the approximation meets this error tolerance? Your answer should be a single integer.",

            "introduction": "Not all errors are as straightforward as measurement uncertainty or series truncation. One of the most subtle yet critical pitfalls in numerical computing is **subtractive cancellation**, a catastrophic loss of precision that occurs when subtracting two nearly equal numbers. This practice uses the classic quadratic formula to reveal this phenomenon in action . You will analyze two algebraically identical formulas and discover why one is numerically stable while the other can produce disastrously inaccurate results under certain conditions, underscoring the vital distinction between mathematical equivalence and numerical robustness.",
