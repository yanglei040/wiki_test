            "introduction": "This practice introduces a fundamental type of optimization problem: unconstrained facility location. The task is to find the ideal position for a central hub to serve multiple locations, a common challenge in logistics and urban planning. By choosing to minimize the sum of squared distances, we use an objective function that is not only practical but also leads to an elegant and intuitive solution through standard calculus techniques, revealing a deep connection between optimization and statistics.

            "problem": "A new logistics company, \"QuikHaul,\" is establishing a central distribution hub to serve its four primary retail partners. For planning purposes, the locations of the retail stores are mapped onto a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. The company's operations research team has determined that the optimal location for the hub is the one that minimizes the sum of the squared Euclidean distances to each of the four stores. This criterion is chosen to minimize a cost function that is quadratically dependent on delivery distance.\n\nThe coordinates of the four retail stores are given as:\nStore A: $(1, 8)$\nStore B: $(5, 2)$\nStore C: $(-3, 4)$\nStore D: $(9, 0)$\n\nLet the coordinates of the new hub be $(x, y)$.
