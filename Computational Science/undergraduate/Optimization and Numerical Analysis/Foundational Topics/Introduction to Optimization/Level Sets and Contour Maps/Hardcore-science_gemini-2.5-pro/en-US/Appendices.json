This first exercise  asks you to identify the shape of level sets for a simple quadratic function, which often represents physical quantities like potential energy or electric potential.

This algorithm approximates the zero-level set of a function $f(x,y)$ (the curve defined by $f(x,y)=0$) as a series of straight line segments on a square grid.\n\nConsider a 2D grid where vertices are located at all points $(i, j)$ for integers $i$ and $j$. A grid cell is a unit square with its four vertices at $(i,j)$, $(i+1,j)$, $(i,j+1)$, and $(i+1,j+1)$ for some integers $i,j$.\n\nThe SBCA operates on a single grid cell as follows:\n1.  The sign (positive or negative) of a function $f(x,y)$ is determined at each of the four vertices of the cell. It is given that the function is never zero at any grid vertex.\n2.  An edge of the square is considered \"crossed\" if the signs of the function at its two endpoints are different.\n3.  A single straight line segment is drawn to approximate the zero-level set within the cell. This segment connects the midpoints of the crossed edges.\n4.  If the number of crossed edges is not exactly two, no line segment is drawn in the cell.
