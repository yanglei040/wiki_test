            "introduction": "While the second derivative test is powerful, we must be cautious when dealing with functions that are defined piecewise. These functions are common in modeling real-world phenomena with different behaviors under different conditions. At the \"seams\" where the function's definition changes, we must look closer, as the function might not be convex even if each individual piece is. This practice  challenges you to analyze a piecewise function and highlights why checking the function's behavior at the boundary points is crucial for determining overall convexity.",

It is a known fact that the sum of two convex functions is always convex.
