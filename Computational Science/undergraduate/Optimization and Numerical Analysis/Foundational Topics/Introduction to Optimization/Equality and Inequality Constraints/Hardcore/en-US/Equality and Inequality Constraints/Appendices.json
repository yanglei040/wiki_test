            "introduction": "We begin our exploration with a classic problem in linear programming. This exercise allows us to visualize how a set of inequality constraints carves out a \"feasible region\" of possible solutions. By examining the vertices of this region, we can develop an intuitive understanding of why optimal solutions for linear objectives are often found at these extreme points, a fundamental concept in constrained optimization.

            "problem": "A small artisanal company manufactures two types of specialized electronic components: Type A and Type B. The production of these components is subject to several daily constraints related to resources and labor. Let $x$ be the number of Type A units and $y$ be the number of Type B units produced daily.\n\nThe profit for each Type A component sold is $100, and for each Type B component is $200.\n\nThe production is constrained by the following factors:\n1.  **Assembly Time:** Each component, whether Type A or Type B, requires one hour of skilled labor for assembly. The company has a total of 40 hours of skilled labor available per day.\n2.  **Raw Material:** A specific rare material is used exclusively for Type A components. The daily supply of this material is only sufficient to produce a maximum of 30 units of Type A.\n3.  **Non-negativity:** The number of components produced cannot be negative.\n\nAssuming the company can sell all the components it produces, what is the maximum possible daily profit? Express your answer in dollars.",
            "solution": "Let $x$ and $y$ denote the daily production quantities of Type A and Type B, respectively. The profit function to maximize is the total profit\n$$P(x,y)=100x+200y.$$\nThe constraints are as follows. Assembly time provides\n$$x+y\\leq 40,$$\nsince each unit, regardless of type, requires one hour and only $40$ hours are available. The raw material constraint for Type A gives\n$$x\\leq 30.$$\nNon-negativity requires\n$$x\\geq 0,\\quad y\\geq 0.$$\nThis is a linear programming problem: maximizing a linear function over a convex polygonal feasible region. By the fundamental property of linear programs, an optimal solution (if it exists) occurs at an extreme point (vertex) of the feasible region.\n\nDetermine the candidate vertices by intersecting the boundary lines with non-negativity:\n1) Intersect $x=0$ with $x+y=40$: solving $0+y=40$ gives $(x,y)=(0,40)$.\n2) Intersect $x=30$ with $x+y=40$: solving $30+y=40$ gives $(x,y)=(30,10)$.\n3) Intersect with axes under constraints: $(0,0)$ is feasible; $(30,0)$ is feasible since $30\\leq 30$ and $30+0=30\\leq 40$.\n\nEvaluate the objective at these vertices:\n$$P(0,0)=100\\cdot 0+200\\cdot 0=0,$$\n$$P(0,40)=100\\cdot 0+200\\cdot 40=8000,$$\n$$P(30,0)=100\\cdot 30+200\\cdot 0=3000,$$\n$$P(30,10)=100\\cdot 30+200\\cdot 10=3000+2000=5000.$$\nThe maximum value is $8000$, attained at $(x,y)=(0,40)$, which also aligns with the marginal profit per assembly hour: Type A yields $100$ per hour while Type B yields $200$ per hour, so allocating all $40$ hours to Type B maximizes profit subject to $x\\leq 30$.",

This practice introduces the powerful method of Lagrange multipliers, a cornerstone for solving constrained optimization problems where the solution must lie on a specific surface or curve. By finding the points on a sphere where a function is maximized, we can concretely visualize the core principle: at an extremum, the gradient of the objective function is parallel to the gradient of the constraint function.
