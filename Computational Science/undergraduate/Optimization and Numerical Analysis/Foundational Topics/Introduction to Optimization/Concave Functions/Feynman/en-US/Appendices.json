            "problem": "A function $f(x)$ is defined over the real numbers by the cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + x - 1$. A function is said to be concave on an interval if its graph is curved downwards. Mathematically, for a twice-differentiable function, this corresponds to the region where its second derivative is less than or equal to zero. Determine the largest continuous interval on the real line for which the function $f(x)$ is concave. Express your answer using standard interval notation.",

A function is concave on intervals where its second derivative satisfies $f''(x)\\le 0$.\n\nFirst compute the first derivative using the power rule:\n$$\nf'(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+x-1\\right)=3x^{2}-12x+1.\n$$\nThen compute the second derivative:\n$$\nf''(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(3x^{2}-12x+1\\right)=6x-12.\n$$\nConcavity corresponds to the inequality\n$$\nf''(x)\\le 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 6x-12\\le 0.\n$$\nSolve this linear inequality:\n$$\n6x\\le 12 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad x\\le 2.\n$$\nTherefore, $f$ is concave on the interval $(-\\infty,2]$.

            "introduction": "One of the most powerful implications of concavity lies in the field of optimization. For a concave function, any local maximum is guaranteed to also be the global maximum, which dramatically simplifies the search for an optimal solution. This problem asks you to find the maximum value of a quadratic utility function, illustrating how the inherent property of concavity ensures that the function has a single, easily identifiable peak .",

            "problem": "A research team is modeling the perceived utility, $U(x)$, that a user experiences from a particular software setting, $x$. The utility function is known to be concave over its entire domain. The specific model derived from experimental data is given by the equation:\n$$U(x) = 20 + 12x - 3x^2$$\nwhere the setting $x$ can be represented by any real number. Determine the maximum possible utility that can be achieved according to this model.",

First factor the quadratic and linear terms:\n$$U(x) = -3\\left(x^{2} - 4x\\right) + 20.$$\nUse the identity $x^{2} - 4x = (x - 2)^{2} - 4$ to obtain\n$$U(x) = -3\\left[(x - 2)^{2} - 4\\right] + 20 = -3(x - 2)^{2} + 12 + 20 = -3(x - 2)^{2} + 32.$$\nSince $(x - 2)^{2} \\geq 0$ for all real $x$, the term $-3(x - 2)^{2} \\leq 0$, with equality when $x = 2$. Therefore, the maximum value of $U(x)$ is achieved at $x = 2$ and equals\n$$U_{\\max} = 32.$$\n\nFor confirmation via calculus, compute the first derivative:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dx} = 12 - 6x.$$\nSet $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$ to find the critical point:\n$$12 - 6x = 0 \\implies x = 2.$$\nThe second derivative is\n$$\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} = -6 < 0,$$\nwhich confirms the critical point is a maximum, yielding $U(2) = 32$ as found above.",
