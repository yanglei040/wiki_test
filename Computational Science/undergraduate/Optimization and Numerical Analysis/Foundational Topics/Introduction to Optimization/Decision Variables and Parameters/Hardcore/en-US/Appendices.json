            "problem": "A restaurateur is creating a mathematical optimization model to set the menu prices for a new farm-to-table bistro. The primary goal is to maximize the total daily profit. To build this model, various pieces of business information must be correctly identified and categorized.\n\nFor the purpose of constructing a daily price optimization model, you are asked to classify a list of items. The categories are defined as follows:\n- A **Decision Variable** is a quantity that the decision-maker (the restaurateur) has direct control over and can choose the value of. The optimization model seeks to find the best values for these variables.\n- A **Parameter** is a value that is considered fixed or given from the perspective of the model. These are inputs to the model that the decision-maker cannot change in the short term.\n- An item is classified as **Neither** if it is an outcome of the model (such as the final objective function value) or information that is not directly used as a variable or parameter in the model's mathematical structure.\n\nConsider the following items:\n1.  The selling price for a specific dish on the menu.\n2.  The wholesale cost per kilogram of a key ingredient used in a dish.\n3.  The total daily profit of the bistro.\n4.  The number of tables available in the restaurant's dining room.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly classifies all four items?\n\nA.

For the upcoming distribution cycle, the following information has been collected:\n\nThere are $N$ camps, indexed from $i=1$ to $N$.\n- The population of camp $i$ is a known value, denoted by $p_i$.\n- The total amount of emergency food supply available for distribution is $S$ kilograms.\n- The GAF decides on the quantity of food to allocate to each camp $i$. This quantity is denoted by $x_i$ kilograms. The allocation must be non-negative.\n- The cost of transporting one kilogram of food to camp $i$ is a fixed rate, $c_i$. The total budget available for transportation for this distribution cycle is $B$.\n- The GAF aims to maximize the total \"satisfaction score\" across all camps. The satisfaction score for camp $i$ is a function of the allocation it receives and its population, given by the expression $\\ln(1 + \\frac{x_i}{p_i})$.\n\nIn the context of formulating this scenario as an optimization problem, we must distinguish between quantities that the GAF can control (decision variables) and quantities that are fixed inputs to the problem (parameters).\n\nWhich of the following represents the set of **decision variables** for this optimization model?\n\nA.

            "problem": "A fund manager at a \"Global Resilience Fund\" is tasked with creating a portfolio from a universe of $n$ different assets. The goal is to maximize the expected return while managing downside risk using a chance-constrained optimization approach.\n\nThe model is formulated as follows:\nLet $\\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n]^T$ represent the vector of investment fractions (weights) for each asset. The asset returns are modeled as a random vector with a known mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a positive definite covariance matrix $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. The portfolio's return, $R_p = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{R}$, is a random variable, where $\\mathbf{R}$ is the vector of random asset returns.\n\nThe manager's optimization problem is to maximize the expected portfolio return, $E[R_p] = \\mathbf{w}^T \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, subject to the following constraints:\n1.  Full investment: The weights must sum to one, i.e., $\\mathbf{1}^T \\mathbf{w} = 1$.\n2.  No short selling: All weights must be non-negative, i.e., $w_i \\ge 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n3.  Risk management: The probability of the portfolio's return $R_p$ falling below a specified minimum target return, $R_{target}$, must be no more than a small risk tolerance probability, $\\delta$. This is the chance constraint: $P(R_p < R_{target}) \\le \\delta$.\n\nTo make this problem computationally tractable, it is assumed that the asset returns follow a multivariate normal distribution. Under this assumption, the chance constraint is equivalent to the deterministic, non-linear constraint:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}^T \\boldsymbol{\\mu} - \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\delta) \\sqrt{\\mathbf{w}^T \\Sigma \\mathbf{w}} \\ge R_{target}\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function (also known as the quantile function) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn the context of this optimization model, which of the following lists correctly and completely separates the **decision variables** (quantities to be determined by the optimization process) from the **parameters** (fixed inputs that define the problem instance)?\n\nA.
