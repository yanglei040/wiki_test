By analyzing the potential energy of a bead on a wire, we can apply the classic calculus technique of comparing function values at critical points and interval endpoints to distinguish between local stability and the true global energy minimum. This exercise  reinforces the essential Extreme Value Theorem for finding global optima on a closed domain.",

            "problem": "A small bead is threaded onto a horizontal wire and is free to slide along it. The bead's potential energy, $U$, as a function of its position, $x$, is modeled by a quartic polynomial. In this model, the position $x$ is measured in meters (m) and the potential energy $U$ is measured in Joules (J). The specific potential energy function is given by:\n\n$$U(x) = x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3 - \\frac{11}{2}x^2 + 15x + 10$$\n\nThe bead's motion is physically constrained to the segment of the wire defined by the closed interval $[-2, 3]$, meaning its position $x$ must satisfy $-2 \\le x \\le 3$.\n\nDetermine the absolute minimum potential energy that the bead can have within its allowed range of motion. Express your final answer in Joules (J), rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "To find the absolute minimum value of the continuous potential energy function $U(x)$ on the closed interval $[-2, 3]$, we must evaluate the function at its critical points within the interval and at the endpoints of the interval. The absolute minimum will be the smallest of these values. This is guaranteed by the Extreme Value Theorem.\n\nFirst, we find the critical points of $U(x)$ by taking its derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero.\nThe potential energy function is:\n$$U(x) = x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3 - \\frac{11}{2}x^2 + 15x + 10$$\n\nThe derivative, $U'(x)$, is:\n$$U'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3 - \\frac{11}{2}x^2 + 15x + 10 \\right)$$\n$$U'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x^2 - 11x + 15$$\n\nTo find the critical points, we solve the equation $U'(x) = 0$:\n$$4x^3 - 8x^2 - 11x + 15 = 0$$\n\nWe can search for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. We test simple integer values. Let's test $x=1$:\n$U'(1) = 4(1)^3 - 8(1)^2 - 11(1) + 15 = 4 - 8 - 11 + 15 = -4 - 11 + 15 = 0$.\nSo, $(x-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial $4x^3 - 8x^2 - 11x + 15$. We can use polynomial division to find the other factors.\nDividing $4x^3 - 8x^2 - 11x + 15$ by $(x-1)$:\n$$ (4x^3 - 8x^2 - 11x + 15) \\div (x-1) = 4x^2 - 4x - 15 $$\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic factor $4x^2 - 4x - 15 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(4)(-15)}}{2(4)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 240}}{8}$$\n$$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{256}}{8}$$\n$$x = \\frac{4 \\pm 16}{8}$$\nThis gives two more roots:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{4 + 16}{8} = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{4 - 16}{8} = \\frac{-12}{8} = -1.5$$\nThe critical points are $x = -1.5$, $x = 1$, and $x = 2.5$. All three of these critical points lie within the specified interval $[-2, 3]$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the potential energy function $U(x)$ at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval, $x=-2$ and $x=3$.\n\n1.

            "problem": "In the analysis of complex networks, community detection algorithms aim to partition the network's nodes into communities (or clusters) such that nodes within a community are densely connected, while connections between different communities are sparse. One popular metric for evaluating the quality of a partition is *modularity*, denoted by $Q$. For a given partition of a network into a set of communities, the modularity is defined as:\n\n$$Q = \\sum_{c} \\left[ \\frac{l_c}{m} - \\left(\\frac{d_c}{2m}\\right)^2 \\right]$$\n\nwhere the sum is over all communities $c$ in the partition. In this formula:\n- $m$ is the total number of edges in the network.\n- $l_c$ is the number of edges with both endpoints within community $c$.\n- $d_c$ is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in community $c$. (The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.)\n\nGreedy algorithms for modularity maximization, while computationally efficient, are known to sometimes get trapped in locally optimal partitions that are not globally optimal.\n\nConsider a simple, undirected network with 7 nodes, labeled 1 through 7. The edges of this network are:\n(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (1,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nA greedy agglomerative community detection algorithm was run on this network. Due to the sequence of local merge decisions, the algorithm terminated with the partition $P_A = \\{\\{1,2,3\\}, \\{4,5,6,7\\}\\}$. However, this partition is not the global optimum. The true globally optimal partition that maximizes the modularity is $P_B = \\{\\{1,2,3,7\\}, \\{4,5,6\\}\\}$.\n\nYour task is to quantify the sub-optimality of the algorithm's result.
