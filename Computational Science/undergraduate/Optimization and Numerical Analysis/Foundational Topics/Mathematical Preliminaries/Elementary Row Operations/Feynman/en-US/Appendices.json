            "introduction": "Elementary row operations are powerful because they reveal the underlying structure and properties of a linear system without altering its solution set. This exercise demonstrates how these operations can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the conditions under which a system has no solution. By performing a single row operation on an augmented matrix, you will see how an inconsistency, which corresponds to a geometric impossibility like parallel lines, is exposed algebraically .",
