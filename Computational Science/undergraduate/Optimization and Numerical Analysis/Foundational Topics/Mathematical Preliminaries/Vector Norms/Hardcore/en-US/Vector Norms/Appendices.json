            "solution": "Let the vector be $\\mathbf{v} = (x, y, z)$. The problem provides three conditions on its norms and two constraints on its components.\n\nFirst, we translate the norm conditions into equations using their definitions:\n1. The 1-norm condition is $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_1 = |x| + |y| + |z| = 6$.\n2. The 2-norm condition is $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{14}$. Squaring both sides gives $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 14$.\n3. The infinity-norm condition is $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_\\infty = \\max\\{|x|, |y|, |z|\\} = 3$.\n\nThe problem statement also specifies that the components must be positive, i.e., $x > 0$, $y > 0$, and $z > 0$. This allows us to remove the absolute value signs from the equations:\n1. $x + y + z = 6$\n2. $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 14$\n3. $\\max\\{x, y, z\\} = 3$\n\nFurthermore, the components are in non-decreasing order: $x \\le y \\le z$.\nCombining this ordering with the third condition, $\\max\\{x, y, z\\} = 3$, we can definitively say that the largest component, $z$, must be equal to 3.\nSo, we have $z = 3$.\n\nNow we can substitute $z=3$ into the first two equations to solve for $x$ and $y$:\nFrom the first equation:\n$x + y + 3 = 6$\n$x + y = 3$\n\nFrom the second equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 + 3^2 = 14$\n$x^2 + y^2 + 9 = 14$\n$x^2 + y^2 = 5$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two variables, $x$ and $y$:\n(i) $x + y = 3$\n(ii) $x^2 + y^2 = 5$\n\nFrom equation (i), we can express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = 3 - x$.\nSubstitute this expression for $y$ into equation (ii):\n$x^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 5$\n\nNow, expand the equation and solve for $x$:\n$x^2 + (9 - 6x + x^2) = 5$\n$2x^2 - 6x + 9 = 5$\n$2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$\nDivide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n$x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that can be factored:\n$(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$\n\nThe possible solutions for $x$ are $x=1$ or $x=2$.\n\nWe now find the corresponding values for $y$ using the relation $y = 3 - x$:\nCase 1: If $x = 1$, then $y = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nCase 2: If $x = 2$, then $y = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n\nFinally, we apply the ordering constraint $x \\le y$.\nIn Case 1, we have $(x, y) = (1, 2)$. This satisfies $x \\le y$.\nIn Case 2, we have $(x, y) = (2, 1)$. This violates $x \\le y$.\n\nTherefore, we must choose Case 1, which gives $x=1$ and $y=2$.\nThe components of the vector are $x=1$, $y=2$, and $z=3$.\nThe vector is $\\mathbf{v} = (1, 2, 3)$.\n\nLet's verify this solution with the original conditions:\n1. $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_1 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.
