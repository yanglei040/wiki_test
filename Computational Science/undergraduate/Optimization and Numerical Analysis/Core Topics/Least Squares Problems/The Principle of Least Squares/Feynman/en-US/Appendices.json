            "introduction": "The principle of least squares is a powerful tool for finding the best-fit model for a set of data. We will begin with the simplest possible case: finding a single constant value that best represents a series of measurements. This exercise  demonstrates that the least squares estimate in this scenario is a familiar statistical quantity, the arithmetic mean, providing a strong intuitive foundation for the method.",

            "problem": "An experiment is conducted to determine a constant physical parameter. Due to random experimental errors, multiple measurements yield slightly different values. The data collected consists of three measurement pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ represents an independent variable (like time) and $y_i$ is the measured value of the parameter. The observed data points are $(1, 3)$, $(2, 5)$, and $(3, 4)$.\n\nAssuming the true value of the parameter is a constant, we want to find the best estimate for this constant. This can be achieved by fitting the data to a horizontal line of the form $y = c$.\n\nUsing the principle of least squares, determine the value of the constant $c$ that provides the best fit to the given data points. Express your answer as an exact number.",
            "solution": "We model the measurements by a constant $c$ so that each observed $y_{i}$ is approximated by $c$. By the least squares principle, we choose $c$ to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n$$\nS(c)=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(y_{i}-c\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nDifferentiate with respect to $c$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dc}=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}2\\left(c-y_{i}\\right)=2\\left(3c-\\sum_{i=1}^{3}y_{i}\\right)=0.\n$$\nThis yields the normal equation\n$$\n3c=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}y_{i}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad c=\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}y_{i}.\n$$\nSubstituting the data $y_{1}=3$, $y_{2}=5$, $y_{3}=4$ gives\n$$\nc=\\frac{1}{3}(3+5+4)=\\frac{12}{3}=4.\n$$\nTo verify it is a minimum, note\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}S}{dc^{2}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}2=6>0,\n$$\nso $c=4$ minimizes $S(c)$ and is the least squares estimate (the sample mean of the $y_{i}$ values).",

This next practice  challenges you to apply the principle of least squares to derive the general formula for the slope of such a best-fit line. Understanding this derivation is key to seeing how calculus is used to find optimal model parameters.",

We wish to find the \"best-fit\" line that passes through the origin for this dataset.\n\nAccording to the principle of least squares, the best fit is the one that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances between the observed data points and the model line.
