            "introduction": "Applying the second-order sufficient condition is a fundamental skill in optimization. This exercise provides a comprehensive workout by asking you to analyze a function representing a hypothetical topographical map, which has multiple critical points. By finding and classifying each one, you will practice identifying a local minimum (a basin), a local maximum (a peak), and saddle points (passes), solidifying your ability to apply the Hessian test across different scenarios.

            "problem": "The topography of a small, experimental terrain for a rover is modeled by the height function $h(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3x - 12y + 20$, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial coordinates and $h$ is the height relative to a reference plane. The critical points of this function correspond to peaks, basins, and passes on the terrain. It is known that this function has exactly four critical points: one local minimum (a basin), one local maximum (a peak), and two saddle points (passes).\n\nWhich of the following pairs of coordinates represents the locations of the two saddle points?\n\nA. $(1, 2)$ and $(-1, -2)$\n\nB. $(1, -2)$ and $(-1, 2)$\n\nC. $(1, 2)$ and $(1, -2)$\n\nD. $(-1, -2)$ and $(1, -2)$\n\nE. $(-1, 2)$ and $(-1, -2)$",

This problem presents a situation where the Hessian matrix at a critical point provides no conclusive information, a scenario that can arise in functions with particular structures. By analyzing a simplified model for the potential energy of a particle trap, you will learn how to proceed when the standard test is inconclusive, reinforcing the importance of applying the fundamental definition of local extrema to determine the point's nature.
