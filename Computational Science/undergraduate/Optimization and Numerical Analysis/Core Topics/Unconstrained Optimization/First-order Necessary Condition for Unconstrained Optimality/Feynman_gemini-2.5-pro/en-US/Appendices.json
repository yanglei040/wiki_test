            "introduction": "We begin with a function where the variables are \"separable,\" meaning the function is a sum of terms each involving only one variable. This structure simplifies finding stationary points, as the system of partial derivative equations becomes uncoupled, allowing us to solve for each variable independently. This exercise, framed in a hypothetical cost-minimization scenario, demonstrates the most straightforward application of the first-order necessary condition .",

The goal is to find settings for these parameters that correspond to a stationary point of the cost function, which is a necessary condition for achieving minimum operational cost. The cost function is given by:\n\n$$C(x, y, z) = e^x - 2x + (y-1)^4 + \\frac{1}{2}z^2 - 3z$$\n\nDetermine the coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of the unique stationary point for this cost function.

The potential energy function presented is structured such that the conditions for each coordinate can be satisfied at several distinct values.
