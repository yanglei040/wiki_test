This first practice exercise places you in the role of an engineer designing the path for a self-driving car's lane change. By translating physical requirements—initial and final positions and velocities—into mathematical constraints, you will construct the cubic polynomial that defines a smooth, safe trajectory. This problem provides a direct, hands-on application of building a Hermite polynomial from the ground up .",

            "problem": "A path planning algorithm for a self-driving car is designed to execute a lane change maneuver. The car's lateral displacement from the centerline of its original lane is described by a function $y(t)$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the maneuver began. The entire maneuver takes a total time $T$ to complete.\n\nThe design specifications for the maneuver are as follows:\n1.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is at the centerline of its original lane.\n2.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is traveling parallel to the lane lines, meaning its initial lateral velocity is zero.\n3.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is at the centerline of the adjacent lane, which is a lateral distance $W$ away.\n4.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is again traveling parallel to the lane lines, so its final lateral velocity is also zero.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, the algorithm models the path $y(t)$ using the unique cubic polynomial that satisfies these four conditions. This is a specific instance of Hermite interpolation.\n\nDetermine the cubic polynomial $y(t)$ that describes the car's lateral position. Express your answer as a function of $t$, $T$, and $W$.",
            "solution": "We model the lateral displacement by a cubic polynomial $y(t)=a t^{3}+b t^{2}+c t+d$. The boundary conditions are:\n- Initial position: $y(0)=0$, which implies $d=0$.\n- Initial velocity: $y'(0)=0$, where $y'(t)=3 a t^{2}+2 b t+c$, so $c=0$.\nThus $y(t)=a t^{3}+b t^{2}$.\n\nThe remaining conditions are:\n- Final position: $y(T)=W$, giving $a T^{3}+b T^{2}=W$.\n- Final velocity: $y'(T)=0$, giving $3 a T^{2}+2 b T=0$.\n\nFrom $3 a T^{2}+2 b T=0$, we obtain $b=-(3/2) a T$. Substituting into $a T^{3}+b T^{2}=W$ gives\n$$\na T^{3}-\\frac{3}{2} a T^{3}=-\\frac{1}{2} a T^{3}=W \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a=-\\frac{2 W}{T^{3}}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nb=-\\frac{3}{2} a T=-\\frac{3}{2}\\left(-\\frac{2 W}{T^{3}}\\right)T=\\frac{3 W}{T^{2}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\ny(t)=a t^{3}+b t^{2}=-\\frac{2 W}{T^{3}} t^{3}+\\frac{3 W}{T^{2}} t^{2}=W\\left(3\\left(\\frac{t}{T}\\right)^{2}-2\\left(\\frac{t}{T}\\right)^{3}\\right).\n$$\nThis unique cubic satisfies $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=0$, $y(T)=W$, and $y'(T)=0$.",

This exercise explores the elegant relationship between the symmetry of the given data and the symmetry of the resulting Hermite polynomial. By analyzing a case with symmetric function values and anti-symmetric derivative values, you will discover how these initial conditions predetermine the geometric properties of the polynomial.

            "problem": "In the field of computational modeling, it is common to construct a polynomial that fits a set of measured data points and their derivatives. Consider a scenario where a physical quantity, represented by a function $f(x)$, is measured.
