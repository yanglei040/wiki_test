Therefore there is a root in $(0,2)$ for $-\\frac{1}{2}c4$. At $c=4$, we get $(2-x)^{2}=4$, giving $x=0$ or $x=4$; $x=0$ lies in $(-1,2)$ and is a stationary point at the knot.

Hence the union is $c-14$ or $c-\\frac{1}{2}$. The excluded collinear case $c=-2$ is not in this union. Therefore the correct option is A.\n\nFinally, since $S''$ at the stationary points is nonzero in the above ranges (left: $S_{0}''(x)=m(x+1)$ with $m3$ or $m-6$ and $x+10$; right: $S_{1}''(x)=\\frac{m}{2}(2-x)$ with $m0$ and $0x2$), these stationary points are indeed local extrema.",
