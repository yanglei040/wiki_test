By finding the unique linear polynomial for two points and then the unique quadratic for three, you'll see firsthand how the degree of the interpolant necessarily increases to accommodate new data, reinforcing the core relationship between the number of points and the required polynomial degree .",

            "problem": "In a data analysis task, we start with two data points, $A = (1, 5)$ and $B = (3, 11)$. A unique linear polynomial, denoted as $p_1(x)$, is constructed such that it passes through both points $A$ and $B$.\n\nSubsequently, a third data point, $C = (4, 15)$, is introduced. It is observed that this point does not lie on the line defined by $p_1(x)$. To accommodate this new information, a unique quadratic polynomial, denoted as $p_2(x)$, is constructed that passes through all three points: $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nYour task is to determine the resulting quadratic polynomial $p_2(x)$ and to quantify the difference in the y-intercepts of the two polynomials. Specifically, you must:\n1.  Find the analytical expression for the quadratic polynomial $p_2(x)$ in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n2.  Calculate the numerical value of the difference $p_2(0) - p_1(0)$.\n\nYour final answer should present these two results in order.",
            "solution": "We first construct the unique linear polynomial $p_{1}(x)$ passing through $A=(1,5)$ and $B=(3,11)$. The slope is computed using the two-point formula:\n$$\nm=\\frac{11-5}{3-1}=\\frac{6}{2}=3.\n$$\nThus $p_{1}(x)=3x+b$. Using point $A$ to solve for $b$:\n$$\n5=3\\cdot 1+b \\implies b=2,\n$$\nso\n$$\np_{1}(x)=3x+2,\n$$\nand the $y$-intercept is $p_{1}(0)=2$.\n\nNext, we construct the quadratic $p_{2}(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$ passing through $A,B,C$, which imposes:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na+b+c&=5 \\quad &(x=1),\\\\\n9a+3b+c&=11 \\quad &(x=3),\\\\\n16a+4b+c&=15 \\quad &(x=4).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSubtract the first equation from the second and the second from the third to eliminate $c$:\n$$\n8a+2b=6 \\implies 4a+b=3,\n$$\n$$\n7a+b=4.\n$$\nSubtract these to solve for $a$:\n$$\n(7a+b)-(4a+b)=4-3 \\implies 3a=1 \\implies a=\\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nSubstitute into $4a+b=3$:\n$$\n4\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}+b=3 \\implies \\frac{4}{3}+b=3 \\implies b=\\frac{5}{3}.\n$$\nUse $a+b+c=5$ to find $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{5}{3}+c=5 \\implies 2+c=5 \\implies c=3.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\np_{2}(x)=\\frac{1}{3}x^{2}+\\frac{5}{3}x+3,\n$$\nand its $y$-intercept is $p_{2}(0)=3$.
