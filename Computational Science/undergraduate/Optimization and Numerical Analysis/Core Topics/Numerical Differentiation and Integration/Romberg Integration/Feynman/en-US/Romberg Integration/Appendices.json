Moreover, for $n=3$ one has $f^{(5)}$ constant, hence $f^{(5)}(b)-f^{(5)}(a)=0$, so the $h^{6}$ term vanishes identically. Therefore, for degree-$5$ polynomials the expansion is exact and reduces to\n$$\nI=T(h)+c_{2}h^{2}+c_{4}h^{4},\n$$\nwith $c_{2}=\\frac{B_{2}}{2!}\\left(f'(b)-f'(a)\\right)$ and $c_{4}=\\frac{B_{4}}{4!}\\left(f^{(3)}(b)-f^{(3)}(a)\\right)$.\n\nWrite the same formula for step $2h$:\n$$\nI=T(2h)+c_{2}(2h)^{2}+c_{4}(2h)^{4}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nT(h)-T(2h)=\\left[I-c_{2}h^{2}-c_{4}h^{4}\\right]-\\left[I-c_{2}(2h)^{2}-c_{4}(2h)^{4}\\right]\n=3c_{2}h^{2}+15c_{4}h^{4}.\n$$\nThe first Romberg extrapolation (column $k=1$) is\n$$\nT_{m,1}=T(h)+\\frac{T(h)-T(2h)}{4-1}\n=I-c_{2}h^{2}-c_{4}h^{4}+\\left(c_{2}h^{2}+5c_{4}h^{4}\\right)\n=I+4c_{4}h^{4},\n$$\nso the $h^{2}$ term is eliminated and the remaining error is $O(h^{4})$.\n\nApply the same to $2h$ for the second extrapolation.
