            "problem": "In a computational experiment, a function $f(x)$ is evaluated at three equally spaced points in the vicinity of $x=5.0$. The recorded data pairs $(x, f(x))$ are as follows: $(4.8, 4.192)$, $(5.0, 0.0)$, and $(5.2, -3.792)$.\n\nUsing these discrete data points, calculate the numerical estimate for the second derivative of the function, $f''(x)$, at the point $x=5.0$.

            "solution": "We have three equally spaced points near $x_{0}=5.0$ with spacing $h=0.2$ since $5.0-4.8=0.2$ and $5.2-5.0=0.2$. For equally spaced data, the second derivative at the central point can be approximated by the centered finite-difference formula derived from Taylor expansions about $x_{0}$:\n$$\nf''(x_{0}) \\approx \\frac{f(x_{0}+h)-2f(x_{0})+f(x_{0}-h)}{h^{2}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the given values $f(5.2)=-3.792$, $f(5.0)=0.0$, and $f(4.8)=4.192$, with $h=0.2$:\n$$\nf''(5.0) \\approx \\frac{-3.792 - 2\\cdot 0.0 + 4.192}{(0.2)^{2}} = \\frac{0.400}{0.040}.\n$$\nCompute the quotient:\n$$\n\\frac{0.400}{0.040} = 10.\n$$\nThus, the numerical estimate of $f''(5.0)$ from the given data is exactly $10$.",

The second derivative of this function at the point $x=2$, denoted $f''(2)$, is estimated using the second-order central difference formula with a step size of $h=1$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to find the value of $f(2)$ given information about a numerical approximation of its second derivative at that point. The formula to be used is the second-order central difference approximation for the second derivative.\n\nThe general form of the second-order central difference formula for the second derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ with a step size $h$ is:\n$$\nf''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The point at which the derivative is being approximated is $x=2$.\n- The step size is $h=1$.\n- The value of the central difference approximation for $f''(2)$ is 5.\n- The function values at the neighboring points are $f(1)=4$ and $f(3)=10$.\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula. Here, $x=2$ and $h=1$, so the neighboring points are $x-h = 2-1 = 1$ and $x+h = 2+1 = 3$. The formula becomes:\n$$\nf''(2) \\approx \\frac{f(2+1) - 2f(2) + f(2-1)}{1^2} = \\frac{f(3) - 2f(2) + f(1)}{1}\n$$\n\nWe are told that the value of this approximation is exactly 5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n$$\n5 = f(3) - 2f(2) + f(1)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given function values, $f(1)=4$ and $f(3)=10$, into this equation:\n$$\n5 = 10 - 2f(2) + 4\n$$\n\nNext, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n$$\n5 = 14 - 2f(2)\n$$\n\nOur goal is to solve for $f(2)$. We can rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $f(2)$:\n$$\n2f(2) = 14 - 5\n$$\n$$\n2f(2) = 9\n$$\n\nFinally, we divide by 2 to find the value of $f(2)$:\n$$\nf(2) = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\n$$\n\nThus, the value of $f(2)$ is 4.5.",
