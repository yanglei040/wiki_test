This practice grounds the trapezoidal rule in a tangible physical context: calculating the work done to compress a gas . By breaking down a continuous process into discrete steps, you will see firsthand how an integral, representing a physical quantity, can be approximated by summing the areas of simple geometric shapes.",

            "problem": "In a materials science experiment, a piston is used to compress a gas in a cylinder. The process is carried out slowly, so it can be considered quasi-static and isothermal. The force $F$ required to hold the piston at a position $x$ (measured from the closed end of the cylinder) is found to vary according to the law $F(x) = \\frac{k}{x}$, where $k$ is a constant related to the temperature and the amount of gas.\n\nTo move the piston and compress the gas, work must be done. The exact work $W$ done by an external agent to move the piston from an initial position $x_i$ to a final position $x_f$ is given by the integral $W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$.\n\nSuppose the piston is moved from $x_i = 1$ m to $x_f = 3$ m, and the constant $k$ is equal to 1 N·m. You are tasked with finding an approximate value for the work done. The approximation method consists of the following steps:\n1. Divide the total displacement interval $[x_i, x_f]$ into two subintervals of equal length.\n2. For each subinterval, approximate the area under the force-displacement curve by the area of a trapezoid formed by the x-axis, the vertical lines at the subinterval's endpoints, and the straight line segment connecting the force values at these endpoints.\n3. Sum the areas of these two trapezoids to get the total approximate work.\n\nUsing this method, calculate the approximate work done to move the piston. Express your answer in Joules as a simplified fraction.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an approximation of the work done, $W$, by moving a piston against a force $F(x) = \\frac{k}{x}$ from $x_i = 1$ m to $x_f = 3$ m. We are given $k = 1$ N·m. The work is given by the integral:\n$$W = \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{1}{x} dx$$\n\nThe problem describes a numerical approximation method which is equivalent to the composite trapezoidal rule with two segments. Let the interval be $[a, b] = [1, 3]$ and the number of segments be $n=2$. The function to integrate is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the width, $h$, of each subinterval:\n$$h = \\frac{b - a}{n} = \\frac{3 - 1}{2} = 1$$\n\nThe two subintervals are $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 3]$. The evaluation points (the endpoints of the subintervals) are $x_0 = 1$, $x_1 = 2$, and $x_2 = 3$.\n\nThe approximation method described is to sum the areas of two trapezoids.\nThe area of the first trapezoid, over the interval $[x_0, x_1]$, is:\n$$A_1 = \\frac{h}{2} (f(x_0) + f(x_1))$$\nThe area of the second trapezoid, over the interval $[x_1, x_2]$, is:\n$$A_2 = \\frac{h}{2} (f(x_1) + f(x_2))$$\n\nThe total approximate work $W_{approx}$ is the sum of these two areas:\n$$W_{approx} = A_1 + A_2 = \\frac{h}{2}(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + \\frac{h}{2}(f(x_1) + f(x_2))$$\nThis can be simplified to the standard composite trapezoidal rule formula:\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{h}{2} (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2))$$\n\nNow we evaluate the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ at the points $x_0, x_1, x_2$:\n$$f(x_0) = f(1) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n$$f(x_1) = f(2) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$f(x_2) = f(3) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for $W_{approx}$. We also substitute $h=1$.\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$$\n\nWe simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$$\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$$\n\nTo add the terms inside the parentheses, we find a common denominator:\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$$\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we perform the multiplication:\n$$W_{approx} = \\frac{7}{6}$$\n\nThe problem states that $k$ is in N·m and $x$ is in m, so the work $W$ is in Joules. The problem asks for the answer in Joules, expressed as a simplified fraction. Our result is $7/6$.",

This exercise explores one such case, prompting you to think beyond mechanical calculation and investigate the underlying principles at play .

            "problem": "In numerical analysis, the trapezoidal rule is a method for approximating the definite integral of a function. The single-interval trapezoidal rule approximates the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\,dx$ by the area of a trapezoid with vertices at $(a, 0)$, $(b, 0)$, $(a, f(a))$, and $(b, f(b))$.\n\nConsider the definite integral of the function $f(x) = x^3$ over the interval $[-1, 1]$. If you were to apply the single-interval trapezoidal rule to approximate this integral, you would find that the approximated value is exactly equal to the true value of the integral.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for this exact result?\n\nA. The single-interval trapezoidal rule is exact in this case because the function $f(x)=x^3$ is an odd function and the integration interval $[-1, 1]$ is symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nB. The single-interval trapezoidal rule is exact for any polynomial of degree 3.\n\nC. The approximation is exact because the second derivative of the function, $f''(x)$, is zero at the midpoint of the interval, $x=0$.\n\nD. The error of the trapezoidal rule is proportional to the first derivative of the function, and the first derivative $f'(x)$ is zero at the midpoint of the interval.\n\nE. This is an accidental result; the trapezoidal rule is generally not exact for non-linear functions and there is no underlying principle at play here.",
            "solution": "The single-interval trapezoidal rule on $[a,b]$ is\n$$\nT = \\frac{b-a}{2}\\big(f(a)+f(b)\\big).\n$$\nFor $f(x)=x^{3}$ on $[-1,1]$, the exact integral is\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} x^{3}\\,dx = \\left[\\frac{x^{4}}{4}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}=0.\n$$\nEquivalently, since $x^{3}$ is odd and the interval is symmetric, $\\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\\,dx=0$.\n\nThe trapezoidal approximation is\n$$\nT = \\frac{1-(-1)}{2}\\big(f(-1)+f(1)\\big) = 1\\big((-1)^{3}+1^{3}\\big) = -1+1=0.\n$$\nThus the approximation equals the true value. The fundamental reason is the odd symmetry on a symmetric interval:\n- For any odd function $f$ with $f(-x)=-f(x)$,\n$$\n\\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\\,dx=0,\n$$\nand the trapezoidal rule uses only the endpoints, where $f(-a)+f(a)=0$, giving\n$$\nT=\\frac{2a}{2}\\big(f(-a)+f(a)\\big)=0.\n$$\nTherefore the equality is guaranteed by symmetry, not by the general degree-exactness of the trapezoidal rule.\n\nTo rule out the other options:\n- B is false because the trapezoidal rule is generally exact only for polynomials of degree at most $1$ on arbitrary intervals, not degree $3$.\n- C is not the fundamental reason: although $f''(0)=0$ with $f''(x)=6x$, the trapezoidal error for a single interval is\n$$\nE_{T} = -\\frac{(b-a)^{3}}{12}\\,f''(\\xi)\n$$\nfor some $\\xi\\in(a,b)$; this $\\xi$ is not fixed at the midpoint, so $f''(0)=0$ does not imply $E_{T}=0$.\n- D is false because the error depends on the second derivative, not the first.\n- E is false because there is a clear underlying symmetry principle.\n\nHence, the correct reason is the odd function on a symmetric interval.",
