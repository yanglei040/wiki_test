These formulas rely on a small, positive step size, typically denoted by $h$. The most common first-order formulas are:\n\n- The **Forward Difference** formula: $D_+(f, x, h) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$\n- The **Backward Difference** formula: $D_-(f, x, h) = \\frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}$\n- The **Central Difference** formula: $D_0(f, x, h) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}$\n\nConsider a scenario where the forward difference formula is evaluated using a negative step size. Let this negative step size be $h_{\\text{neg}}$, such that $h_{\\text{neg}}  0$.
