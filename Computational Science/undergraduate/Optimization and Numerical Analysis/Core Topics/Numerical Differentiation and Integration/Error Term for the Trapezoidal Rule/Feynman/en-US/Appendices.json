            "introduction": "The standard error formula provides an upper bound, a \"worst-case scenario\" for the error. However, the actual error can sometimes be much smaller, or even zero, due to special properties of the function or the interval. This problem presents a fascinating case where the trapezoidal rule gives an exact result, yet the standard error bound formula predicts a non-zero error, creating an apparent paradox. By resolving it, you will gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of error cancellation and the important distinction between the global error bound and the sum of local errors .",

            "problem": "Consider the definite integral $I = \\int_{-a}^{a} x^3 \\, dx$, where $a$ is a positive real constant. We wish to analyze the performance of the composite trapezoidal rule for this integral.\n\nFirst, by direct computation, show that the two-interval composite trapezoidal rule ($n=2$) yields the exact value for $I$.\n\nSecond, calculate the theoretical error bound for this approximation using the standard formula for the composite trapezoidal rule:\n$$|E_T| \\leq \\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} \\max_{x \\in [a,b]} |f''(x)|$$\nwhere $[a,b]$ is the interval of integration, $n$ is the number of subintervals, and $f(x)$ is the integrand.\n\nYou will find that the actual error is zero, but the theoretical error bound is a non-zero function of $a$. Which of the following statements provides the correct and most specific physical and mathematical reasoning to reconcile this apparent paradox?\n\nA. The trapezoidal rule is known to be exact for any odd function when integrated over an interval that is symmetric about the origin, and $f(x)=x^3$ is an odd function.\n\nB. The value of $\\xi$ in the more fundamental error formula, $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)h^2}{12}f''(\\xi)$, happens to be exactly $\\xi=0$ for this particular function and interval configuration. Since $f''(0)=0$, the error is zero.\n\nC. The standard error bound formula is always a worst-case upper limit. The actual error can be anywhere between zero and this bound, and for this problem, it just happens to be zero by coincidence.\n\nD. The composite error is the sum of errors from each subinterval. The derivation of the simplified global error bound formula implicitly assumes that the second derivative does not change sign in a way that allows for systematic cancellation. For the symmetric subintervals $[-a, 0]$ and $[0, a]$, the error contribution from the first interval is exactly canceled by the error from the second, due to the odd symmetry of the second derivative, $f''(x)=6x$.\n\nE. The error bound formula provided is only valid for functions whose second derivative is non-negative over the interval of integration, a condition which $f(x)=x^3$ violates on $[-a, a]$.",
            "solution": "First, compute the exact value of the integral. An antiderivative of $f(x)=x^{3}$ is $\\frac{x^{4}}{4}$, so\n$$\nI=\\int_{-a}^{a} x^{3}\\,dx=\\left.\\frac{x^{4}}{4}\\right|_{-a}^{a}=\\frac{a^{4}}{4}-\\frac{(-a)^{4}}{4}=0.\n$$\n\nNext, apply the two-interval composite trapezoidal rule on $[-a,a]$. The step size is\n$$\nh=\\frac{a-(-a)}{2}=a,\n$$\nand the nodes are $x_{0}=-a$, $x_{1}=0$, $x_{2}=a$. The composite trapezoidal approximation is\n$$\nT_{2}=\\frac{h}{2}\\big(f(x_{0})+2f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})\\big)=\\frac{a}{2}\\big(f(-a)+2f(0)+f(a)\\big).\n$$\nWith $f(x)=x^{3}$, this gives\n$$\nT_{2}=\\frac{a}{2}\\big((-a)^{3}+2\\cdot 0^{3}+a^{3}\\big)=\\frac{a}{2}\\big(-a^{3}+a^{3}\\big)=0,\n$$\nwhich equals the exact integral $I=0$. Hence, the two-interval composite trapezoidal rule yields the exact value.\n\nNow, compute the theoretical error bound. The standard bound is\n$$\n|E_{T}|\\leq \\frac{(b-a)^{3}}{12 n^{2}}\\max_{x\\in[a,b]}|f''(x)|.\n$$\nHere $[a,b]$ refers to the full interval of integration, so the endpoints are $-a$ and $a$. Thus $b-a=2a$, $n=2$, and $f''(x)=6x$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\max_{x\\in[-a,a]}|f''(x)|=\\max_{x\\in[-a,a]}|6x|=6a,\n$$\nand\n$$\n|E_{T}|\\leq \\frac{(2a)^{3}}{12\\cdot 2^{2}}\\cdot 6a=\\frac{8a^{3}}{48}\\cdot 6a=\\frac{a^{3}}{6}\\cdot 6a=a^{4}.\n$$\nThus the bound is $a^{4}$, while the actual error is zero.\n\nTo reconcile this, we observe the precise mechanism of cancellation across the two symmetric subintervals. The composite error is a sum of local errors. For $f(x)=x^{3}$, the second derivative $f''(x)=6x$ is an odd function. Due to the symmetry of the subintervals $[-a,0]$ and $[0,a]$ around the origin, the local error from the first subinterval is the negative of the local error from the second subinterval. \n\nThe error for the interval $[-a, 0]$ is positive (function is concave down, trapezoid is an underestimate of a negative area, so $T$ is more negative than $I$, $I-T > 0$). The error for the interval $[0, a]$ is negative (function is concave up, trapezoid is an overestimate, $I-T  0$).\nA more rigorous calculation shows the local error on an interval $[p, q]$ is $E(p,q) = -\\frac{(q-p)^3}{12}f''(\\xi_1)$ for some $\\xi_1 \\in (p,q)$. Summing the errors:\n$E_{total} = E([-a,0]) + E([0,a])$.\nThe error on $[-a,0]$ is $-\\frac{a^3}{12} f''(\\xi_1)$ with $\\xi_1 \\in (-a,0)$.\nThe error on $[0,a]$ is $-\\frac{a^3}{12} f''(\\xi_2)$ with $\\xi_2 \\in (0,a)$.\n$E_{total} = -\\frac{a^3}{12}(f''(\\xi_1)+f''(\\xi_2))$.\nDue to the symmetry, $f''(-x)=-f''(x)$, the errors cancel exactly.\nFor this specific problem, we can calculate the local errors without using the mean value theorem.\nError on $[-a,0]$: $\\int_{-a}^0 x^3 dx - \\frac{a}{2}((-a)^3+0^3) = -\\frac{a^4}{4} - \\frac{a}{2}(-a^3) = -\\frac{a^4}{4} + \\frac{a^4}{2} = \\frac{a^4}{4}$.\nError on $[0,a]$: $\\int_{0}^a x^3 dx - \\frac{a}{2}(0^3+a^3) = \\frac{a^4}{4} - \\frac{a^4}{2} = -\\frac{a^4}{4}$.\nThe sum is $\\frac{a^4}{4} - \\frac{a^4}{4} = 0$.\n\nThis exact cancellation is the reason for the zero error. The global error bound formula uses $\\max|f''(x)|$ and does not account for such cancellations. Option D provides the most specific and accurate explanation for this phenomenon.",
