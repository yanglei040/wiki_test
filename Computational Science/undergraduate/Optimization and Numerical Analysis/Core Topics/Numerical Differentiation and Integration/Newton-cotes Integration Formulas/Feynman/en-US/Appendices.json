            "introduction": "While Newton-Cotes formulas are powerful, their accuracy depends on the properties of the function being integrated. This practice explores the limitations of Simpson's 1/3 rule by applying it to a function that is not \"smooth\"—one with a sharp corner. By comparing the numerical approximation with the exact value for this special case , you will gain a deeper understanding of why the differentiability assumptions underlying these methods are so important.",

            "problem": "A common task in numerical analysis is to approximate a definite integral when an analytical solution is difficult or impossible to find. One of the most fundamental methods for this is Simpson's 1/3 rule.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = |x - c|$, where $c$ is a constant. We are interested in the definite integral of this function over the interval $[a, b]$, where $a < c < b$.\n\nYour task is to analyze the performance of Simpson's 1/3 rule for this type of function.\nSpecifically, let the function be $f(x) = |x - 1|$ and the interval of integration be $[0, 2]$.\n\nFirst, calculate the exact value of the integral, which we will call $I_{exact} = \\int_{0}^{2} |x - 1| \\, dx$.\nNext, calculate the approximate value of the integral, $I_{S}$, using a single application of Simpson's 1/3 rule over the entire interval $[0, 2]$ (which corresponds to using $n=2$ subintervals).\n\nFinally, compute the absolute error, $E = |I_{exact} - I_{S}|$. Report this absolute error as your final answer. Round your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "We evaluate the exact integral by splitting at the point where the absolute value changes sign. Since $f(x)=|x-1|$, on $[0,1]$ we have $|x-1|=1-x$, and on $[1,2]$ we have $|x-1|=x-1$.

A key part of this simulation involves calculating the value of a definite integral, $I = \\int_1^2 \\exp(-x) dx$.

Determine the minimum integer number of subintervals, $n$, that must be used to guarantee this level of accuracy.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of subintervals, $n$, required to approximate the integral $I = \\int_1^2 \\exp(-x) dx$ using the composite trapezoidal rule with an absolute error no greater than $\\epsilon = 10^{-4}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the components needed for the error bound formula, $|E_T| \\leq \\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} M$.\nThe function to be integrated is $f(x) = \\exp(-x)$.\nThe interval of integration is $[a, b] = [1, 2]$. So, $a=1$ and $b=2$.\n\nNext, we need to find $M$, the maximum value of $|f''(x)|$ on the interval $[1, 2]$. We start by calculating the first and second derivatives of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\exp(-x)) = -\\exp(-x)$\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-\\exp(-x)) = \\exp(-x)$\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum value of $|f''(x)| = |\\exp(-x)|$ on the interval $[1, 2]$. Since $\\exp(-x)$ is always positive for any real $x$, we have $|f''(x)| = \\exp(-x)$.\nThe function $g(x) = \\exp(-x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for all $x$. Therefore, its maximum value on a closed interval $[1, 2]$ will occur at the leftmost point, $x=1$.\nSo, $M = \\max_{x \\in [1,2]} |\\exp(-x)| = \\exp(-1) = \\frac{1}{e}$.\n\nNow we can use the error bound inequality.

We can rearrange the inequality to isolate $n^2$:\n$$n^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{12e \\cdot 10^{-4}}$$\n$$n^2 \\geq \\frac{10^4}{12e}$$\n\nTo find the minimum value of $n$, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$n \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{10^4}{12e}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10^4}}{\\sqrt{12e}} = \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{12e}}$$\n$$n \\geq \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 3e}} = \\frac{100}{2\\sqrt{3e}} = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{3e}}$$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use the approximation for $e \\approx 2.71828$:\n$$n \\geq \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{3 \\times 2.71828}} \\approx \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{8.15484}} \\approx \\frac{50}{2.85567}$$\n$$n \\geq 17.509...$$\n\nSince the number of subintervals, $n$, must be an integer, we must choose the smallest integer that satisfies this condition.
