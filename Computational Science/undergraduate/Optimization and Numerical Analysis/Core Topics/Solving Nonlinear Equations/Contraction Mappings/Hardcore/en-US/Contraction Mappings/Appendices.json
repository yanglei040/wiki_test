            "introduction": "At first glance, rearranging an equation into the form $x = g(x)$ seems like a straightforward path to finding a solution through iteration. However, as this first exercise demonstrates, not all iterative schemes are created equal. This practice serves as a crucial cautionary tale, investigating a simple linear iteration that unexpectedly diverges from its fixed point. By analyzing why this failure occurs, you will gain insight into the fundamental principle that governs the stability of fixed-point iterations and discover why the magnitude of the function's derivative near the fixed point is so important .",

            "problem": "An engineering student is attempting to find the root of the equation $2x - 2 = 0$. Instead of solving it directly, they decide to test an iterative numerical method. They rearrange the equation to the form $x = g(x)$ and propose the following iterative scheme:\n$$x_{n+1} = 3x_n - 2$$\nThe student correctly identifies that the exact root, $x=1$, is a fixed point of the function $g(x) = 3x - 2$. However, when they test the iteration with any starting guess $x_0$ other than $1$ (for example, $x_0 = 1.1$ or $x_0 = 0.9$), they observe that the sequence of iterates $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$ moves rapidly away from the fixed point $x=1$ instead of converging to it.\n\nAccording to the principles of the Contraction Mapping Theorem, which of the following statements provides the correct mathematical reason for why this iterative method fails to converge to the fixed point $x=1$ for starting points in its vicinity?\n\nA. The function $g(x) = 3x - 2$ does not have a fixed point.\n\nB. The function $g(x) = 3x - 2$ is not a contraction mapping on any interval containing the fixed point $x=1$.\n\nC. The iteration fails because the domain of the function, the set of real numbers, is not a complete metric space.\n\nD. The iteration fails because the function $g(x) = 3x-2$ is not continuous at the fixed point $x=1$.\n\nE. Any iterative method of the form $x_{n+1}=g(x_n)$ is inherently unstable for linear functions $g(x)$.",
            "solution": "We are given the fixed-point iteration $x_{n+1}=g(x_{n})$ with $g(x)=3x-2$. The fixed point is $x^{\\ast}=1$ since $g(1)=3\\cdot 1-2=1$.\n\nAccording to the Contraction Mapping Theorem, convergence from any initial point in a domain $D$ is guaranteed if:\n1) $(D,|\\cdot|)$ is a complete metric space,\n2) $g(D)\\subset D$, and\n3) $g$ is a contraction on $D$, i.e., there exists $L$ with $0\\leq L1$ such that for all $x,y\\in D$,\n$$\n|g(x)-g(y)|\\leq L|x-y|.\n$$\nFor differentiable $g$ on an interval $D$, a sufficient condition for contraction is\n$$\n\\sup_{x\\in D}|g'(x)|\\leq L1.\n$$\n\nCompute the derivative:\n$$\ng'(x)=3\\quad \\text{for all }x\\in \\mathbb{R}.\n$$\nHence, on any interval $D$ containing $x^{\\ast}=1$, we have\n$$\n\\sup_{x\\in D}|g'(x)|=3,\n$$\nso any Lipschitz constant $L$ must satisfy $L\\geq 3$, which violates $L1$. Therefore, $g$ is not a contraction on any interval containing the fixed point. Consequently, the hypotheses of the Contraction Mapping Theorem fail, so convergence is not ensured.\n\nThe divergence observed can also be seen from the error recursion. Define $e_{n}=x_{n}-1$. Then\n$$\ne_{n+1}=x_{n+1}-1=g(x_{n})-1=3x_{n}-2-1=3(x_{n}-1)=3e_{n},\n$$\nso $|e_{n+1}|=3|e_{n}|$ and $e_{n}=3^{n}e_{0}$, which grows for any $e_{0}\\neq 0$, making $x^{\\ast}=1$ a repelling fixed point.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because $g$ does have a fixed point at $x=1$.\n- B is true because $|g'(x)|=31$ everywhere, so $g$ is not a contraction on any interval containing $1$.\n- C is false because $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric is complete.\n- D is false because $g$ is linear and hence continuous everywhere.\n- E is false because linear $g(x)=ax+b$ with $|a|1$ are contractions and yield convergence.\n\nThus, the correct reason is that $g$ is not a contraction mapping on any interval containing the fixed point.",

            "introduction": "Having seen how an iterative process can fail, we now turn our attention to the conditions that guarantee success. The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem provides a rigorous framework for ensuring that an iteration $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ will converge to a unique solution within a given interval. This practice asks you to apply the two core conditions of this theorem—invariance and contraction—to a specific function. Working through this problem will solidify your understanding of how to formally verify the reliability of a numerical method before you even begin iterating .",

The function for this algorithm is given by $g(x) = \\sqrt{x + 6}$. The engineer has reason to believe that the solution lies within the closed interval $I = [0, 3]$ and wants to verify if the conditions for the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem) are met on this interval. These conditions ensure that the iteration will converge to a unique fixed point within $I$, regardless of the starting point $x_0 \\in I$.\n\nThe two conditions to be checked are:\n1.  **Invariance**: The function $g(x)$ maps the interval $I$ into itself.

            "introduction": "Knowing that an iterative method will converge is a powerful assurance, but for practical applications, we often need to know *how fast* it will converge. The contraction constant, $L$, is more than just a number less than one; it directly dictates the rate of convergence. This final practice bridges theory and application, challenging you to use the error bounds derived from the Contraction Mapping Theorem to estimate the number of iterations required to reach a specific level of accuracy.
