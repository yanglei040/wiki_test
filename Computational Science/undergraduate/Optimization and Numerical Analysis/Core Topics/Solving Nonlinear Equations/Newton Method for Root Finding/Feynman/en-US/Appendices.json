            "problem": "In a simplified economic model, the net utility $N(x)$ gained from producing a quantity $x$ of a certain commodity is given by the function $N(x) = A \\ln(x+c) - Bx$, where $A$, $B$, and $c$ are positive constants. An economist is interested in finding a break-even point, which is a non-zero production level $x > 0$ where the net utility is zero.\n\nFor a specific market, the parameters are found to be $A = 50$ and $B = 10$, with the offset constant $c=1$. This leads to the equation for the break-even point: $50 \\ln(x+1) - 10x = 0$. To find the non-zero root of this equation, Newton's method is employed with an initial guess of $x_0 = 12$.\n\nCalculate the first two approximations, $x_1$ and $x_2$, generated by this process.
