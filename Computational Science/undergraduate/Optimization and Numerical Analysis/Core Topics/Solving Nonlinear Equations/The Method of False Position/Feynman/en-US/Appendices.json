            "problem": "In numerical analysis, the method of false position, or regula falsi, is a root-finding algorithm that uses a sequence of root-bracketing intervals $[a_k, b_k]$ and linear interpolation to approximate a root of a function $f(x)$.\n\nConsider a function $f(x)$ that is twice differentiable over the entire real line. It is known that the function has a single root $r$ and that its second derivative is strictly positive, i.e., $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$. We wish to find the root $r$ using the regula falsi method.\n\nThe algorithm starts with an initial interval $[a_0, b_0]$ that brackets the root, meaning $f(a_0)$ and $f(b_0)$ have opposite signs. For this specific case, we are given that $f(a_0)  0$ and $f(b_0)  0$.\n\nFor each iteration $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, a new approximation $c_k$ is computed as the x-intercept of the secant line connecting the points $(a_k, f(a_k))$ and $(b_k, f(b_k))$. The formula for $c_k$ is:\n$$c_k = a_k - f(a_k) \\frac{b_k - a_k}{f(b_k) - f(a_k)}$$\nThe next interval $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}]$ is chosen to maintain the bracketing of the root:\n- If $f(c_k)  0$, the new interval is $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}] = [c_k, b_k]$.\n- If $f(c_k)  0$, the new interval is $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}] = [a_k, c_k]$.\n- If $f(c_k) = 0$, the root is found and the algorithm stops.\n\nAn endpoint of the interval is considered 'stagnant' if it remains unchanged for all iterations of the algorithm. That is, the endpoint $a$ is stagnant if $a_{k+1}=a_k$ for all $k \\ge 0$, and the endpoint $b$ is stagnant if $b_{k+1}=b_k$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Assuming the root is not found in any finite number of steps, which of the following statements is true about the endpoints of the interval?\n\nA. The left endpoint, $a$, is the stagnant endpoint.\n\nB. The right endpoint, $b$, is the stagnant endpoint.\n\nC. Which endpoint is stagnant depends on the specific function $f(x)$, not just its convexity.\n\nD. Both endpoints are updated at each iteration, so neither is stagnant.",
            "solution": "We are given a twice differentiable function with $f''(x)0$ for all $x$, hence $f$ is strictly convex on $\\mathbb{R}$. The initial bracket satisfies $f(a_{0})0f(b_{0})$, so there is a unique root $r\\in(a_{0},b_{0})$. At iteration $k$, the regula falsi computes the secant $s_{k}(x)$ through $(a_{k},f(a_{k}))$ and $(b_{k},f(b_{k}))$, and defines the approximate root $c_{k}$ by the x-intercept of this secant:\n$$\nc_{k}=a_{k}-f(a_{k})\\frac{b_{k}-a_{k}}{f(b_{k})-f(a_{k})},\n$$\nequivalently $s_{k}(c_{k})=0$.\n\nFor a strictly convex function, the secant lies strictly above the graph on the open interval, i.e., for all $x\\in(a_{k},b_{k})$,\n$$\nf(x)s_{k}(x).\n$$\nSince $c_{k}\\in(a_{k},b_{k})$ (because $f(a_{k})0f(b_{k})$ implies the secant crosses the x-axis within the interval), we have\n$$\nf(c_{k})s_{k}(c_{k})=0.\n$$\nTherefore $f(c_{k})0$ at every iteration.

Because the strict inequality $f(c_{k})0$ holds at each step, the root is not obtained in finitely many steps under the stated assumptions, which is consistent with the premise.\n\nThus, the stagnant endpoint is $b$, the right endpoint.",
