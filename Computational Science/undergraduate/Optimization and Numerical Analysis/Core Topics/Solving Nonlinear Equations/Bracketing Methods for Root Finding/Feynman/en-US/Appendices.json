            "introduction": "The bisection method is a robust tool for finding roots, and its power lies in its simplicity and reliability, which are guaranteed by the Intermediate Value Theorem for continuous functions. To master it, we must first be able to execute the algorithm step-by-step. This practice problem  provides a tangible scenario—finding the break-even production level for a company—allowing you to walk through the first few iterations of the bisection method and see how it systematically narrows the search interval for a root.",

            "problem": "A small manufacturing company wants to determine its break-even production level. The profit, $P$, from producing and selling $x$ thousand units of a product is modeled by the function $P(x) = -1.5x^2 + 140x - 1000$. A root of this function corresponds to a break-even point where profit is zero. The company analysts use the bisection method to find this break-even point. They start with an initial interval $[a_0, b_0] = [5, 10]$. After performing three iterations of the bisection method, they obtain a new, smaller interval $[a_3, b_3]$ that contains the root. What are the values of $a_3$ and $b_3$?\n\nRepresent your answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a_3 & b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
            "solution": "We are given the profit function $P(x) = -1.5x^{2} + 140x - 1000$, a continuous polynomial. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ have opposite signs, then there exists a root in $(a,b)$. The bisection method proceeds by repeatedly halving the interval and selecting the subinterval where the sign change persists. We start with $[a_{0},b_{0}] = [5,10]$.\n\nFirst, compute the signs at the endpoints:\n$$\nP(5) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 25 + 140\\cdot 5 - 1000 = -\\frac{75}{2} - 300 = -\\frac{675}{2} < 0,\n$$\n$$\nP(10) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 100 + 140\\cdot 10 - 1000 = -150 + 400 = 250 > 0.\n$$\nThus a root lies in $[5,10]$.\n\nIteration 1: midpoint $m_{1} = \\frac{a_{0}+b_{0}}{2} = \\frac{5+10}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\nEvaluate\n$$\nP\\!\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot \\frac{225}{4} + 140\\cdot \\frac{15}{2} - 1000 = -\\frac{675}{8} + 1050 - 1000 = -\\frac{275}{8} < 0.\n$$\nSince $P(a_{0})<0$ and $P(m_{1})<0$ while $P(b_{0})>0$, the sign change is in $[m_{1},b_{0}]$. Hence $[a_{1},b_{1}] = \\left[\\frac{15}{2}, 10\\right]$.\n\nIteration 2: midpoint $m_{2} = \\frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}+10}{2} = \\frac{35}{4}$.\nEvaluate\n$$\nP\\!\\left(\\frac{35}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1225}{16} + 140\\cdot \\frac{35}{4} - 1000 = -\\frac{3675}{32} + 1225 - 1000 = \\frac{3525}{32} > 0.\n$$\nSince $P(a_{1})<0$ and $P(m_{2})>0$, the sign change is in $[a_{1},m_{2}]$. Hence $[a_{2},b_{2}] = \\left[\\frac{15}{2}, \\frac{35}{4}\\right]$.\n\nIteration 3: midpoint $m_{3} = \\frac{a_{2}+b_{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}+\\frac{35}{4}}{2} = \\frac{65}{8}$.\nEvaluate\n$$\nP\\!\\left(\\frac{65}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4225}{64} + 140\\cdot \\frac{65}{8} - 1000 = -\\frac{12675}{128} + \\frac{2275}{2} - 1000 = \\frac{4925}{128} > 0.\n$$\nSince $P(a_{2})<0$ and $P(m_{3})>0$, the sign change is in $[a_{2},m_{3}]$.

Unlike other methods that can have erratic behavior, we can determine in advance the exact number of iterations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. This exercise  shifts our focus from simply applying the method to analyzing its performance, a crucial skill for any engineer or scientist needing to guarantee a result within a specific tolerance.",

It is known from physical constraints that the root of interest lies within the interval $[a, b]$, where the length of the interval, $L = b - a$, is exactly $128$. The engineer decides to use the bisection method to approximate the root. For the control system to function correctly, the final approximation of the root must have an absolute error of no more than $\\epsilon = 0.1$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of iterations, $n$, required for the bisection method to guarantee that the approximated root meets this error tolerance?",

Therefore, we set $n+1 = 11$, which gives $n=10$ as the minimum number of iterations.",

The regula falsi, or method of false position, often converges faster by using a more 'intelligent' guess based on the a linear interpolation between the function's values at the endpoints.
