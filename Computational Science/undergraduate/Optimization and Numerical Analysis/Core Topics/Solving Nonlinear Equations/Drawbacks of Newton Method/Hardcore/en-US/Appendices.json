This exercise demonstrates a classic failure mode where the iterates fall into a periodic cycle instead of converging to the root. By analyzing the sequence of iterates, you will see firsthand how the method can oscillate between two values indefinitely, a crucial concept to understand when diagnosing convergence issues .",

            "problem": "Newton's method is a popular iterative algorithm for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. For a function $f(x)$ and an initial guess $x_0$, the sequence of iterates is generated by the formula $x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$, where $f'(x)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$. While powerful, the method does not always converge to a root and can sometimes fall into periodic cycles.\n\nConsider the task of finding a root for the polynomial function $f(x) = \\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - 2\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 2$.\n\nAn analyst begins the iterative process with the initial guess $x_0 = \\frac{1}{2}$.

The iteration is given by\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}.\n$$\nFirst compute the derivative. Let $y = x - \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $f(x) = y^{3} - 2y + 2$, and since $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1$, we have\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(y^{3} - 2y + 2\\right) = 3y^{2} - 2 = 3\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} - 2.\n$$\nUsing the substitution $y_{n} = x_{n} - \\frac{1}{2}$, the Newton update becomes\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{y_{n}^{3} - 2y_{n} + 2}{3y_{n}^{2} - 2},\n$$\nso\n$$\ny_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\left(x_{n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{y_{n}^{3} - 2y_{n} + 2}{3y_{n}^{2} - 2} = y_{n} - \\frac{y_{n}^{3} - 2y_{n} + 2}{3y_{n}^{2} - 2}.\n$$\nWith the initial condition $x_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $y_{0} = 0$.

Translating back to $x_{n}$ via $x_{n} = y_{n} + \\frac{1}{2}$ gives $x_{n} = \\frac{1}{2}$ for even $n$ and $x_{n} = \\frac{3}{2}$ for odd $n$. Since $101$ is odd, we obtain\n$$\nx_{101} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n$$",
