This exercise provides a classic scenario, asking you to verify if the iteration $x_{k+1} = \\cos(x_k)$ is guaranteed to converge on a given interval.

            "problem": "A numerical analyst is tasked with finding the root of the equation $f(x) = x - \\cos(x) = 0$. They decide to use a fixed-point iteration method by rearranging the equation into the form $x = g(x)$. The chosen iteration scheme is defined as $x_{k+1} = \\cos(x_k)$, with an initial guess $x_0$ chosen from the interval $[0, 1]$. All calculations involving trigonometric functions assume the angles are measured in radians.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly analyzes whether this iterative scheme is guaranteed to converge to the unique fixed point within the interval $[0, 1]$ for any arbitrary choice of $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$?\n\nA. Convergence is guaranteed because the function $g(x) = \\cos(x)$ maps the interval $[0, 1]$ to itself, and the magnitude of its derivative is strictly less than 1 for all points within this interval.\n\nB. Convergence is not guaranteed because the function $g(x) = \\cos(x)$ does not map the interval $[0, 1]$ to itself; for some values of $x$ in the interval, $g(x)$ falls outside of $[0, 1]$.\n\nC.

To guarantee convergence to a unique fixed point for any $x_{0}\\in[0,1]$, we verify the conditions of the Banach fixed-point theorem: (i) $g$ maps $[0,1]$ into itself, and (ii) $g$ is a contraction on $[0,1]$.\n\nFirst, we show $g([0,1])\\subseteq[0,1]$. Since $g'(x)=-\\sin(x)\\leq 0$ on $[0,1]$, $g$ is nonincreasing on $[0,1]$.

Thus, $g$ maps the interval to itself.\n\nSecond, we show $g$ is a contraction on $[0,1]$.

Therefore, $g$ is a contraction on $[0,1]$.\n\nBy the Banach fixed-point theorem on the complete metric space $([0,1],|\\cdot|)$, there exists a unique fixed point $x^{\\ast}\\in[0,1]$ such that $x^{\\ast}=\\cos(x^{\\ast})$, and for any $x_{0}\\in[0,1]$, the sequence defined by $x_{k+1}=\\cos(x_{k})$ converges to $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that convergence is guaranteed because $g$ maps $[0,1]$ into itself and satisfies $|g'(x)|1$ on $[0,1]$. This corresponds to option A. The alternatives are incorrect: B is false since $g([0,1])\\subseteq[0,1]$; C is false because $\\sup_{[0,1]}|g'|=\\sin(1)1$; D is false because the contraction property ensures convergence for all $x_{0}\\in[0,1]$; E is false because continuity alone does not guarantee convergence without a contraction condition.",
