This practice connects the abstract concept of roots to a tangible physical application: finding the equilibrium positions of a particle . By applying foundational tools like the Rational Root Theorem and polynomial deflation, you will develop a systematic approach to identifying integer or rational roots, which is often the most efficient first step in solving polynomial equations.",

            "problem": "In a one-dimensional physical system, the force acting on a particle as a function of its position $x$ (in dimensionless units) is described by the polynomial function $F(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 6$. The particle is considered to be in an equilibrium state when the net force acting on it is zero. Determine all the equilibrium positions of the particle. Present your final answer as a row matrix, with the positions listed in ascending order.",
            "solution": "An equilibrium position in one dimension occurs where the net force vanishes, so we solve $F(x)=0$ with\n$$\nF(x)=-x^{3}+2x^{2}+5x-6=0.\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ to simplify the leading coefficient gives\n$$\nx^{3}-2x^{2}-5x+6=0.\n$$\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are $\\pm 1,\\pm 2,\\pm 3,\\pm 6$. Evaluating at $x=1$ yields $1-2-5+6=0$, so $x=1$ is a root and $(x-1)$ is a factor. Dividing,\n$$\nx^{3}-2x^{2}-5x+6=(x-1)\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right).\n$$\nFactoring the quadratic,\n$$\nx^{2}-x-6=(x-3)(x+2).\n$$\nThus the solutions to $F(x)=0$ are $x=-2$, $x=1$, and $x=3$. Listed in ascending order, the equilibrium positions are $-2$, $1$, and $3$.",
