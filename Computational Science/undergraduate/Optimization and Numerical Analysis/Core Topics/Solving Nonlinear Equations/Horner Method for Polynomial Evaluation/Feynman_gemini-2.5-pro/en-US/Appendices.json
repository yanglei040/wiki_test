A computationally efficient method for evaluating this polynomial at a specific point $x=c$ involves generating a sequence of intermediate values, often referred to as Horner's method. This sequence, denoted by $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_n$, is constructed using the following recurrence relation:\n- $y_0 = a_n$\n- $y_k = y_{k-1} \\cdot c + a_{n-k}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe final term of this sequence, $y_n$, is the value of the polynomial at $c$, i.e., $y_n = P(c)$.\n\nFor the polynomial $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1$, determine the complete sequence of values $(y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that are generated by this method when evaluating $P(x)$ at the point $x=2$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond just computing a value, it is important in numerical analysis to understand how sensitive our result is to small changes in the input. This practice explores the stability of polynomial evaluation by asking how a small perturbation in a single coefficient, $a_k$, affects the final output. Using basic calculus, you will derive a simple but powerful expression for this sensitivity, offering deep insight into how the choice of evaluation point $x_0$ can amplify or diminish the impact of coefficient errors .",
