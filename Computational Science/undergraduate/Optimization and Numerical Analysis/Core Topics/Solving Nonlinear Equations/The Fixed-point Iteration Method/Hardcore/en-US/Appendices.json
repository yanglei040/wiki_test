This first exercise provides a direct comparison between two different iterative schemes for the same root, demonstrating how to quantitatively evaluate their performance. By analyzing the derivative of the iteration function, a key concept dictating the speed of convergence, you will see precisely why one scheme is superior to another for finding the solution .",
