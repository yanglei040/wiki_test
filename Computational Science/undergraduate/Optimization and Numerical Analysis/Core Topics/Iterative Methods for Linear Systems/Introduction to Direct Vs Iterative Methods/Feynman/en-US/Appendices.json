The third equation is not a scalar multiple of the first, so it is independent. Thus $\\operatorname{rank}(A)=2$ and $\\operatorname{rank}([A|\\mathbf{b}])=2<3$, implying there are infinitely many solutions. Performing Gaussian elimination confirms this and yields one free variable.

            "introduction": "For large systems, particularly those that are sparse (containing many zeros), direct methods face a unique challenge. This exercise investigates the \"fill-in\" phenomenon, where the process of Gaussian elimination can turn zero entries into non-zero ones, dramatically increasing memory requirements and computational cost. By analyzing a carefully constructed sparse matrix, you will discover that this fill-in is not random but depends critically on the matrix's structure, a key reason why iterative methods are often favored for large-scale applications .",

            "problem": "In the field of numerical linear algebra, solving systems of linear equations $Ax=b$ is a fundamental task. When the matrix $A$ is large and sparse (contains many zero entries), direct methods like Gaussian elimination can be computationally expensive due to a phenomenon called \"fill-in,\" where initially zero entries become non-zero during the procedure. Understanding the pattern of fill-in is crucial for choosing efficient solution strategies.\n\nConsider a $5 \\times 5$ matrix $A$ with entries denoted by $A_{ij}$. The matrix is sparse, and its non-zero entries are located *only* on the main diagonal (where $i=j$) and in the first column (where $j=1$). All other entries of the matrix are zero. You may assume that all these specified non-zero entries are indeed numerically different from zero.\n\nThe first step of Gaussian elimination (without pivoting) is performed on this matrix to introduce zeros into the first column below the main diagonal. This is accomplished by applying the row operations $R_i \\leftarrow R_i - m_{i1} R_1$ for each row $i$ from 2 to 5. Here, $R_i$ represents the $i$-th row of the matrix, and the multiplier $m_{i1}$ is calculated as the ratio $A_{i1}/A_{11}$.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the complete set of coordinate pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to entries that were initially zero but become non-zero during this first step of elimination?\n\nA. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $i > 1, j > 1$.\n\nB. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $i > 1, j > 1,$ and $i \\neq j$.\n\nC. The set containing the coordinate pairs $(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)$.\n\nD. The empty set; no fill-in occurs.\n\nE. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $j=2, 3, 4, 5$ and $i \\neq j$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the \"fill-in\" entries after the first step of Gaussian elimination on a specific sparse matrix. Fill-in occurs at a position $(i,j)$ if the entry $A_{ij}$ is initially zero but becomes non-zero after the operation.\n\nFirst, let's establish the structure of the $5 \\times 5$ matrix $A$. The non-zero entries are specified to be only on the main diagonal ($A_{ii}$ for $i=1, \\dots, 5$) and in the first column ($A_{i1}$ for $i=1, \\dots, 5$). Note that the entry $A_{11}$ is included in both descriptions. We can represent the structure of the matrix, using 'x' for a non-zero entry and '0' for a zero entry:\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\text{x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\text{x} & \\text{x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\text{x} & 0 & \\text{x} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\text{x} & 0 & 0 & \\text{x} & 0 \\\\\n\\text{x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\text{x}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first step of Gaussian elimination involves row operations to zero out the elements of the first column below the diagonal. The operation for each row $i$ from 2 to 5 is given by $R_i \\leftarrow R_i - m_{i1} R_1$, where $m_{i1} = A_{i1}/A_{11}$. Let the matrix after this step be $A'$. The new entry $A'_{ij}$ is calculated from the old entries as:\n\n$$\nA'_{ij} = A_{ij} - m_{i1} A_{1j} = A_{ij} - \\left(\\frac{A_{i1}}{A_{11}}\\right) A_{1j}\n$$\n\nThis update is performed for $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and for all columns $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The first row remains unchanged, so $A'_{1j} = A_{1j}$.\n\nWe are looking for fill-in, which means we are interested in positions $(i,j)$ where $A_{ij}=0$ but $A'_{ij} \\neq 0$. The operations are applied to rows $i=2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nLet's analyze the update formula for these rows: $A'_{ij} = A_{ij} - (A_{i1}/A_{11}) A_{1j}$.\nFor fill-in to occur at $(i,j)$, we must have $A_{ij}=0$ and the update term $(A_{i1}/A_{11}) A_{1j}$ must be non-zero. A non-zero update term requires $A_{i1} \\neq 0$, $A_{11} \\neq 0$, and $A_{1j} \\neq 0$.\n\nFrom the problem description, we know $A_{11}$ is non-zero. For $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, the elements $A_{i1}$ are in the first column and thus are also non-zero. So the multipliers $m_{i1}$ are all non-zero.\n\nThe critical part is the term $A_{1j}$, the element from the pivot row (the first row). Let's examine the first row of matrix $A$:\n$R_1 = (A_{11}, A_{12}, A_{13}, A_{14}, A_{15})$.\nAccording to the matrix structure, the only non-zero element in the first row is $A_{11}$ (as it's on the main diagonal). All other elements $A_{12}, A_{13}, A_{14}, A_{15}$ are zero.\n\nNow, we can analyze the new entries $A'_{ij}$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$ for each column $j$:\n\nCase 1: $j=1$\n$A'_{i1} = A_{i1} - (A_{i1}/A_{11}) A_{11} = A_{i1} - A_{i1} = 0$.\nThe initial entries $A_{i1}$ for $i>1$ were non-zero, and they become zero. This is the goal of elimination, not fill-in. So, no fill-in occurs in the first column.\n\nCase 2: $j \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$\nFor any of these columns, the element in the first row is $A_{1j}=0$.\nThe update formula becomes:\n$A'_{ij} = A_{ij} - (A_{i1}/A_{11}) A_{1j} = A_{ij} - (A_{i1}/A_{11}) \\cdot 0 = A_{ij} - 0 = A_{ij}$.\n\nThis result shows that for all rows $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and all columns $j \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, the matrix entries do not change: $A'_{ij} = A_{ij}$.\n\nSince the entries in this entire submatrix do not change, any entry that was initially zero will remain zero. Specifically, for an entry $(i, j)$ to experience fill-in, it must have been zero initially ($A_{ij}=0$). Our analysis shows that if $A_{ij}=0$ (and $j>1$), then $A'_{ij}$ will also be $0$.\n\nTherefore, no zero entries become non-zero during the first step of Gaussian elimination. The set of coordinates experiencing fill-in is the empty set.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $i > 1, j > 1$. Incorrect.\nB. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $i > 1, j > 1,$ and $i \\neq j$. This would be a large fill-in, but it's incorrect.\nC. The set containing the coordinate pairs $(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)$. These entries become zero, they don't fill-in. Incorrect.\nD. The empty set; no fill-in occurs. Correct.\nE. The set of all $(i,j)$ such that $j=2, 3, 4, 5$ and $i \\neq j$. Incorrect.",
