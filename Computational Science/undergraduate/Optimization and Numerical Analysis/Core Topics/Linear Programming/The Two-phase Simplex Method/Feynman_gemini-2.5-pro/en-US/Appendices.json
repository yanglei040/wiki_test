The initial step in the two-phase simplex method is to construct an auxiliary problem, which requires a clear understanding of how to convert inequalities into a system of equations. This exercise  provides practice in architecting this initial setup, focusing on how to determine the total number of variables (original, slack, surplus, and artificial) and the fundamental size of the basis matrix needed to get started.",

            "problem": "A management scientist has formulated a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimize a production schedule. The original model consists of 5 decision variables and 3 functional constraints. The constraints are of the following types: one constraint is a 'less than or equal to' ($\\le$) inequality, and the other two are 'greater than or equal to' ($\\ge$) inequalities. To solve this problem, the two-phase simplex method will be employed.\n\nFor the setup of the Phase I problem, determine two values:\n1. The total number of variables (this includes the original decision variables plus all necessary slack, surplus, and artificial variables) that will be present in the initial Phase I simplex tableau.\n2. The order $m$ of the square basis matrix ($m \\times m$) for this Phase I problem.\n\nProvide your answer as two integers, with the total number of variables first, followed by the order of the basis matrix.",
            "solution": "We are given an LP with 5 decision variables and 3 functional constraints: one of type $\\le$ and two of type $\\ge$. To set up Phase I for the two-phase simplex method, we convert all constraints to equalities by introducing slack or surplus variables, and introduce artificial variables only when necessary to form an initial basic feasible solution.\n\nPrinciples for variable introduction:\n- For a constraint of type $\\le$, we add a slack variable with coefficient $+1$ to convert it to equality. This slack variable can serve as an initial basic variable, and no artificial variable is needed.\n- For a constraint of type $\\ge$, we subtract a surplus variable with coefficient $-1$ to convert it to equality. Because the resulting column does not provide a basic variable, we must also add an artificial variable to form the initial basis.\n\nApplying these rules:\n- For the single $\\le$ constraint: add $1$ slack variable; no artificial variable is required.\n- For each of the two $\\ge$ constraints: add $1$ surplus variable and $1$ artificial variable per constraint, totaling $2$ surplus and $2$ artificial variables.\n\nCounting all variables in the Phase I tableau:\n- Original decision variables: $5$.\n- Slack variables: $1$.\n- Surplus variables: $2$.\n- Artificial variables: $2$.\nTherefore, the total number of variables in Phase I is $5 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 10$.\n\nThe order $m$ of the square basis matrix equals the number of basic variables required for the initial basis, which matches the number of functional constraints after conversion to equalities. There are $3$ constraints, thus $m = 3$. Concretely, the initial basic variables can be chosen as the $1$ slack variable from the $\\le$ constraint and the $2$ artificial variables from the $\\ge$ constraints, totaling $3$ basics.\n\nHence, the requested values are the total number of variables $10$ and the basis order $m=3$.",

After several iterations, Phase I has concluded, and the final simplex tableau is presented below. The objective row for Phase I shows that the minimum value of $W$ is 0, with reduced costs of 0 for all decision and slack/surplus variables currently in the basis, and non-negative reduced costs for all non-basic variables.
