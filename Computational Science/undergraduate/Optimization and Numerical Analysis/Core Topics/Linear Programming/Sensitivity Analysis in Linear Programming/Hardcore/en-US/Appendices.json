            "introduction": "This first exercise explores a fundamental question in business strategy: what is the breakeven point for an unprofitable activity? By calculating the required profit increase (via cost reduction) for a product to become part of the optimal production plan, you will gain a hands-on understanding of the concept of reduced cost . This analysis is crucial for making informed decisions about product development and process improvement.",

            "problem": "ElecPro Inc., a small electronics company, manufactures three products for hobbyists: the 'Alpha' kit, the 'Beta' kit, and the 'Gamma' package. The production of these items is constrained by two key resources: a weekly supply of 500 Microcontroller Units (MCUs) and 750 available Technician Work-Hours per week.\n\nThe resource requirements and per-unit profit for each product are as follows:\n- The Alpha kit requires 2 MCUs and 5 Technician Work-Hours, and its sale generates a profit of $65.\n- The Beta kit requires 5 MCUs and 3 Technician Work-Hours, and its sale generates a profit of $80.\n- The Gamma package requires 4 MCUs and 6 Technician Work-Hours, and its sale currently generates a profit of $70.\n\nThe company aims to formulate a weekly production plan that maximizes its total profit. An initial analysis reveals that the Gamma package is not included in the optimal production plan. The profit for the Gamma package is determined by its selling price minus its production cost. To make the Gamma package a viable product, the company is investigating potential improvements to its manufacturing process to lower the production cost.\n\nAssuming the selling prices and resource requirements for all products remain constant, what is the minimum required reduction in the per-unit production cost for the Gamma package that would make it a candidate for inclusion in the optimal production plan? Express your answer in dollars, and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let decision variables be $x_{A}$, $x_{B}$, $x_{G}$ for Alpha, Beta, Gamma. The weekly profit-maximization LP is\n$$\n\\max Z = 65 x_{A} + 80 x_{B} + 70 x_{G}\n$$\nsubject to resource constraints\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 x_{A} + 5 x_{B} + 4 x_{G} &\\leq 500 &&\\text{(MCUs)}\\\\\n5 x_{A} + 3 x_{B} + 6 x_{G} &\\leq 750 &&\\text{(Technician hours)}\\\\\nx_{A}, x_{B}, x_{G} &\\ge 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIt is given that at the current profits, Gamma is not in the optimal plan. Therefore, the optimal basis uses Alpha and Beta with both resources fully utilized. Solve for the intersection of the two binding constraints with $x_{G}=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 x_{A} + 5 x_{B} &= 500,\\\\\n5 x_{A} + 3 x_{B} &= 750.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSolving,\n$$\nx_{B}=\\frac{1000}{19},\\qquad x_{A}=\\frac{2250}{19},\n$$\nwhich indeed exhausts both resources:\n$$\n2\\cdot \\frac{2250}{19} + 5\\cdot \\frac{1000}{19}=\\frac{9500}{19}=500,\\quad\n5\\cdot \\frac{2250}{19} + 3\\cdot \\frac{1000}{19}=\\frac{14250}{19}=750.\n$$\nLet $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ be the dual prices (shadow prices) for MCUs and Technician hours, respectively. From complementary slackness, since Alpha and Beta are positive in the optimal solution, their dual inequalities bind:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 y_{1} + 5 y_{2} &= 65,\\\\\n5 y_{1} + 3 y_{2} &= 80.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSolving,\n$$\ny_{1}=\\frac{205}{19},\\qquad y_{2}=\\frac{165}{19}.\n$$\nFor Gamma with resource vector $a_{G}=(4,6)^{T}$ and current profit $c_{G}=70$, its reduced cost is\n$$\nr_{G}=c_{G} - a_{G}^{T} y = 70 - \\left(4 y_{1} + 6 y_{2}\\right)\n= 70 - \\left(4\\cdot \\frac{205}{19} + 6\\cdot \\frac{165}{19}\\right)\n= 70 - \\frac{1810}{19}\n= -\\frac{480}{19}.\n$$\nSince $r_{G}<0$, Gamma is excluded. To make Gamma a candidate for inclusion, we need $r_{G}=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nc_{G}^{\\text{new}} = a_{G}^{T} y = \\frac{1810}{19}.\n$$\nThe required increase in Gamma’s unit profit equals\n$$\n\\Delta c_{G} = c_{G}^{\\text{new}} - c_{G} = \\frac{1810}{19} - 70 = \\frac{480}{19}.\n$$\nBecause profit equals selling price minus production cost and the selling price is fixed, increasing profit by $\\Delta c_{G}$ is achieved by reducing the unit production cost by the same amount. Therefore, the minimum required reduction in Gamma’s per-unit production cost is $\\frac{480}{19}$ dollars, which rounded to four significant figures is $25.26$.",
