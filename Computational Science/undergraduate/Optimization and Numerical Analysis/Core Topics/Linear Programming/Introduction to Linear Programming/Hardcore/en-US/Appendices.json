One meter of Silk Blend requires 1 unit of vat capacity-time, and one meter of Classic Wool requires 2 units.

The profit from one batch of Type A is $400, and the profit from one batch of Type B is $500.\n\nThe production of these agents is constrained by the availability of three critical resources: bioreactor capacity, purification resin, and specialized labor hours.

            "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of batches of Type A agent produced per week, and let $y$ be the number of batches of Type B agent produced per week. The goal is to maximize the total profit, $P$.\n\nThe objective function for the profit is given by:\n$$P = 400x + 500y$$\n\nThe production is subject to the following constraints based on the available resources:\n1.  Bioreactor Capacity: $20x + 30y \\le 600$, which simplifies to $2x + 3y \\le 60$.\n2.  Purification Resin: $50x + 50y \\le 1000$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 20$.\n3.  Specialized Labor: $8x + 5y \\le 100$.\n\nAdditionally, the number of batches produced cannot be negative, so we have the non-negativity constraints:\n$x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem. The maximum value of the objective function will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region defined by these inequalities. We find these vertices by determining the intersection points of the boundary lines of the constraints.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n-   The origin: $(0, 0)$.\n-   Intersections with the axes:\n    -   For the x-axis ($y=0$):\n        -   From $x+y \\le 20$, we get $x \\le 20$.\n        -   From $8x+5y \\le 100$, we get $8x \\le 100 \\implies x \\le 12.5$.\n        -   From $2x+3y \\le 60$, we get $2x \\le 60 \\implies x \\le 30$.\n        The most restrictive constraint gives $x=12.5$. So, one vertex is $(12.5, 0)$.\n    -   For the y-axis ($x=0$):\n        -   From $x+y \\le 20$, we get $y \\le 20$.\n        -   From $8x+5y \\le 100$, we get $5y \\le 100 \\implies y \\le 20$.\n        -   From $2x+3y \\le 60$, we get $3y \\le 60 \\implies y \\le 20$.\n        The most restrictive constraint gives $y=20$. So, another vertex is $(0, 20)$.\n\n-   Intersections of the constraint boundary lines:\n    -   Intersection of $x+y=20$ and $8x+5y=100$:\n        From $x+y=20$, we have $x = 20-y$. Substitute this into the second equation:\n        $8(20-y) + 5y = 100$\n        $160 - 8y + 5y = 100$\n        $-3y = -60 \\implies y = 20$.\n        If $y=20$, then $x=20-20=0$. This gives the point $(0, 20)$, which we have already found.\n\n    -   Intersection of $x+y=20$ and $2x+3y=60$:\n        From $x+y=20$, we have $x = 20-y$. Substitute this into the second equation:\n        $2(20-y) + 3y = 60$\n        $40 - 2y + 3y = 60$\n        $y = 20$.\n        If $y=20$, then $x=20-20=0$. This also gives the point $(0, 20)$.\n\n    -   Intersection of $8x+5y=100$ and $2x+3y=60$:\n        Multiply the second equation by 4: $8x + 12y = 240$.\n        Subtract the first equation ($8x+5y=100$) from this new equation:\n        $(8x + 12y) - (8x + 5y) = 240 - 100$\n        $7y = 140 \\implies y = 20$.\n        Substitute $y=20$ into $8x+5y=100$:\n        $8x + 5(20) = 100 \\implies 8x + 100 = 100 \\implies 8x = 0 \\implies x=0$.\n        This again gives the point $(0, 20)$.\n\nWait, something is not right. Let's re-check the intersection logic. Let's solve the system:\nSystem 1:\n$x+y=20$ (Resin)\n$8x+5y=100$ (Labor)\nFrom first, $y = 20-x$. Sub into second: $8x+5(20-x)=100 \\implies 8x+100-5x=100 \\implies 3x=0 \\implies x=0$. Then $y=20$. Point is $(0,20)$.\nCheck this in the bioreactor constraint: $2(0) + 3(20) = 60 \\le 60$. This is valid.\n\nLet's re-check the axis intercepts.\n$x=12.5, y=0$.\n$x+y = 12.5 \\le 20$ (Ok).\n$2x+3y = 2(12.5) = 25 \\le 60$ (Ok).\nSo, $(12.5, 0)$ is a vertex.\n\n$x=0, y=20$.\n$x+y = 20 \\le 20$ (Ok).\n$8x+5y = 5(20)=100 \\le 100$ (Ok).\n$2x+3y = 3(20)=60 \\le 60$ (Ok).\nSo, $(0,20)$ is a vertex.\n\nLet's re-check the other intersections.\nIntersection of $2x+3y=60$ (Bioreactor) and $8x+5y=100$ (Labor):\nFrom $2x+3y=60 \\implies x = 30 - 1.5y$. Sub into labor eq:\n$8(30-1.5y)+5y = 100 \\implies 240 - 12y + 5y = 100 \\implies -7y = -140 \\implies y = 20$.\n$x = 30-1.5(20) = 0$. Again gives point $(0,20)$.\n\nIntersection of $2x+3y=60$ (Bioreactor) and $x+y=20$ (Resin):\nFrom $x+y=20 \\implies x=20-y$. Sub into bioreactor eq:\n$2(20-y)+3y = 60 \\implies 40 - 2y + 3y = 60 \\implies y=20$.\n$x = 20-20=0$. Again gives point $(0,20)$.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the constraint boundaries for resin ($x+y \\le 20$), labor ($8x+5y \\le 100$), and bioreactor capacity ($2x+3y \\le 60$) all intersect at the single point $(0, 20)$ on the y-axis. The purification resin constraint $x+y \\le 20$ is redundant, as any point satisfying both $8x+5y \\le 100$ and $2x+3y \\le 60$ with $x,y \\ge 0$ will also satisfy $x+y \\le 20$. For example, adding the two constraints gives $10x+8y \\le 160$, which does not directly show this. However, by plotting the lines, it becomes clear. The feasible region is defined by the labor and bioreactor constraints.\nLet's find the intersection of $8x+5y=100$ and the x-axis ($y=0$), which is $x=12.5$. So a vertex is $(12.5, 0)$.\nLet's find the intersection of $2x+3y=60$ and the y-axis ($x=0$), which is $y=20$. So a vertex is $(0, 20)$.\n\nLet's re-find the intersection of $8x+5y=100$ and $2x+3y=60$. It was $(0,20)$, my calculation was correct.\nThis means the feasible region is not what I first thought. Let's analyze the slopes.\n$y = -2/3 x + 20$ (Bioreactor, slope -0.67)\n$y = -x + 20$ (Resin, slope -1)\n$y = -8/5 x + 20$ (Labor, slope -1.6)\nAll three lines intersect at $(0,20)$.\nOn the x-axis, the intercepts are: Bioreactor $x=30$, Resin $x=20$, Labor $x=12.5$.\nThe feasible region is bounded by the x-axis, the y-axis, the labor line ($8x+5y=100$) from $(12.5, 0)$ up to some point, and then one of the other lines.\nLet's find the intersection of $8x+5y=100$ and $x+y=20$.\n$y=20-x \\implies 8x+5(20-x)=100 \\implies 3x=0 \\implies x=0, y=20$. This is the y-intercept.\nLet's find the intersection of $8x+5y=100$ and $2x+3y=60$.\n$y = (100-8x)/5$.\n$2x + 3(100-8x)/5 = 60 \\implies 10x + 300 - 24x = 300 \\implies -14x=0 \\implies x=0, y=20$. This is also the y-intercept.\n\nOkay, let's step back. The vertices are:\n1.  Origin: $(0, 0)$.\n2.  x-intercept: The tightest constraint is $8x \\le 100$, so $(12.5, 0)$.\n3.  y-intercept: All constraints allow $y \\le 20$, so $(0, 20)$.\n\nMy intersection calculations are yielding only axis intercepts. This happens when the constraints are structured in a specific way. Let me re-check the problem setup.\nAh, my assumption about the `resin` constraint being redundant was incorrect. A constraint is redundant if its removal does not change the feasible region. In this case, removing any one constraint would enlarge the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are the origin, the x-intercept, the y-intercept, and any intersections of the boundary lines that are \"on the inside.\"\n\nLet's test my three vertices found so far:\nA: $(0, 0)$\nB: $(12.5, 0)$ (from Labor constraint on x-axis)\nC: $(0, 20)$ (from all three constraints on y-axis)\n\nThe feasible region is the polygon connecting these vertices. Since all boundary lines meet at $(0,20)$, and the x-intercepts are $12.5$ (Labor), $20$ (Resin), and $30$ (Bioreactor), the innermost boundary is formed by the line segment from $(12.5, 0)$ to $(0, 20)$, which is the line $8x+5y=100$.\nSo the feasible region is simply the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(12.5,0)$ and $(0,20)$. The other two constraints, $x+y \\le 20$ and $2x+3y \\le 60$, are redundant. Let's check this.\nFor any point $(x,y)$ in this triangle, it is a convex combination of the vertices: $(x,y) = \\alpha(0,0) + \\beta(12.5,0) + \\gamma(0,20)$ where $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma=1$.\nWe only need to check the vertices.\nVertex $(0,0)$: $0 \\le 20$, $0 \\le 60$. OK.\nVertex $(12.5,0)$: $12.5+0 \\le 20$, $2(12.5)+0 \\le 60$. OK.\nVertex $(0,20)$: $0+20 \\le 20$, $0+3(20) \\le 60$. OK.\nSince the feasible region defined by $8x+5y \\le 100, x\\ge 0, y \\ge 0$ is convex, and all its vertices satisfy the other two constraints, the entire region satisfies them. Thus, the constraints $x+y\\le 20$ and $2x+3y \\le 60$ are indeed redundant.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n-   A: $(0, 0)$\n-   B: $(12.5, 0)$\n-   C: $(0, 20)$\n\nNow, evaluate the profit function $P = 400x + 500y$ at each vertex:\n-   At A $(0, 0)$: $P = 400(0) + 500(0) = 0$.\n-   At B $(12.5, 0)$: $P = 400(12.5) + 500(0) = 5000$.\n-   At C $(0, 20)$: $P = 400(0) + 500(20) = 10000$.\n\nComparing the values, the maximum profit is $10000.\n\nThe question asks to round the answer to three significant figures.\nThe maximum profit is $10000.\nIn scientific notation, this is $1.00 \\times 10^4$. The three significant figures are 1, 0, and 0.\nSo the answer is $10000$.",
