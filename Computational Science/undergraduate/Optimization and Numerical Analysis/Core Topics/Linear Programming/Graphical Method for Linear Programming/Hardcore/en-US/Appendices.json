            "problem": "A biotech company is developing two new types of diagnostic kits, Kit A and Kit B. The production of these kits is subject to constraints on manufacturing resources. Let $x_1$ be the number of batches of Kit A and $x_2$ be the number of batches of Kit B produced per week. The production is constrained by the availability of a specific reagent, processing time in a centrifuge, and a minimum production contract. The constraints are as follows:\n\n1.  **Reagent Constraint:** The manufacturing process requires a proprietary reagent. The supply is limited such that $2x_1 + 5x_2 \\le 50$.\n2.  **Centrifuge Constraint:** The total available centrifuge time limits production according to the inequality $4x_1 + 3x_2 \\le 60$.\n3.  **Contractual Obligation:** The company must produce at least 5 batches in total to meet a contractual obligation, so $x_1 + x_2 \\ge 5$.\n\nThe company also assumes that the number of batches produced cannot be negative, i.e., $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$.\n\nA \"clinical utility score\", denoted by $Z$, is assigned to the weekly production based on the combination of kits produced. This score is given by the linear objective function $Z = 3x_1 + 4x_2$.\n\nUsing the graphical method for linear programming, determine the absolute minimum and absolute maximum possible values for the clinical utility score $Z$ given the feasible region defined by the constraints. Present your answer as a single row matrix containing two values: the minimum score and the maximum score, in that order.",
            "solution": "We are asked to minimize and maximize the linear objective function $Z = 3x_{1} + 4x_{2}$ over the feasible region defined by the linear constraints:\n$$2x_{1} + 5x_{2} \\le 50,$$\n$$4x_{1} + 3x_{2} \\le 60,$$\n$$x_{1} + x_{2} \\ge 5,$$\n$$x_{1} \\ge 0,\\quad x_{2} \\ge 0.$$\nBy the fundamental theorem of linear programming, any absolute minimum or maximum of a linear objective over a convex polyhedral feasible region occurs at a vertex (corner point) of the feasible region.\n\nWe determine all candidate vertices by intersecting the boundary lines pairwise and with the coordinate axes, retaining only those that satisfy all inequalities.\n\n1) Intersections with the axes:\n- With $x_{1} = 0$:\nFrom $2x_{1} + 5x_{2} \\le 50$ we get $5x_{2} \\le 50$, hence $x_{2} \\le 10$.\nFrom $4x_{1} + 3x_{2} \\le 60$ we get $3x_{2} \\le 60$, hence $x_{2} \\le 20$.\nFrom $x_{1} + x_{2} \\ge 5$ with $x_{1}=0$ we need $x_{2} \\ge 5$.\nThus feasible points on $x_{1}=0$ include $(0,5)$ and $(0,10)$.

            "problem": "A manufacturing plant is tasked with producing two types of specialized electronic components, Component X and Component Y. Let $x$ and $y$ represent the number of units produced per day for each component, respectively. The total profit is given by the objective function $Z = 10x + 7y$. The production is governed by two primary resource constraints related to machine time and material availability:\n\n$C_1: 4x + 2y \\le 16$\n$C_2: x + 2y \\le 10$\n\nAs is standard, the production quantities must be non-negative, i.e., $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\nRecently, a new market demand has led management to consider a \"balanced production\" policy. This policy imposes an additional constraint, $C_3: y \\ge kx$, where $k$ is a positive constant that represents the minimum required ratio of Component Y to Component X.\n\nAnalyze the impact of this new policy on the optimal production plan. Consider the following statements about the solution to this new Linear Programming (LP) problem.\n\nI. For any value of the ratio constant $k$ in the range $0  k \\le 2$, the optimal production plan $(x, y)$ and the maximum profit $Z$ remain entirely unchanged from the original problem (without constraint $C_3$).\n\nII.

There exists a positive value of the ratio constant $k$ for which the combination of all constraints makes the production plan impossible, meaning the problem becomes infeasible.\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?\n\nA.

            "solution": "We first solve the original LP without the balanced production constraint. The constraints are\n$$\n4x + 2y \\leq 16,\\quad x + 2y \\leq 10,\\quad x \\geq 0,\\quad y \\geq 0,\n$$\nwith objective $Z = 10x + 7y$. The extreme points of the feasible region are found from intersections of the constraint boundaries:\n- On axes: $(4,0)$ from $4x + 2y = 16$ with $y=0$, and $(0,5)$ from $x + 2y = 10$ with $x=0$.\n- Intersection of $4x + 2y = 16$ and $x + 2y = 10$: From the first equation, we get $2y=16-4x$, so $y = 8 - 2x$. Substitute into the second:\n$$\nx + 2(8 - 2x) = 10 \\implies x + 16 - 4x = 10 \\implies -3x = -6 \\implies x = 2,\n$$\nand then $y = 8 - 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$. Thus the intersection is $(2,4)$.\nEvaluate the objective:\n$$\nZ(4,0) = 40,\\quad Z(0,5) = 35,\\quad Z(2,4) = 10\\cdot 2 + 7\\cdot 4 = 48.\n$$\nHence, the original optimal solution is $(x,y) = (2,4)$ with $Z_{\\max} = 48$.\n\nNow impose the new constraint $C_{3}: y \\geq kx$ with $k  0$, and analyze each statement.\n\nFor statement I: At the original optimum $(2,4)$, the ratio is $y/x = 2$, so $y \\geq kx$ holds if and only if $k \\leq 2$. For any $k$ with $0  k \\leq 2$, the point $(2,4)$ remains feasible. Since adding a constraint reduces the feasible set but does not create a point with objective value exceeding the maximum over the original (larger) set, $(2,4)$ remains optimal and $Z_{\\max}$ remains $48$. Therefore statement I is true.\n\nFor statement II: Consider $k  2$, in which case $(2,4)$ violates $y \\geq kx$ and is not feasible. Along the boundary $y = kx$, impose the two resource constraints:\n- From $4x + 2y \\leq 16$ with $y = kx$, we get $4x+2kx \\le 16 \\implies x(4 + 2k) \\leq 16$, i.e., $x \\leq \\dfrac{16}{4+2k} = \\dfrac{8}{2 + k}$.\n- From $x + 2y \\leq 10$ with $y = kx$, we get $x(1 + 2k) \\leq 10$, i.e., $x \\leq \\dfrac{10}{1 + 2k}$.\nAlong $y = kx$, the objective is $Z = 10x + 7kx = x(10 + 7k)$, which increases with $x$ for $k  0$. Therefore, the optimal point on $y = kx$ takes $x$ at the minimum of these upper bounds. Compare the bounds for $k  2$:\n$$\n\\frac{8}{2 + k} > \\frac{10}{1 + 2k} \\iff 8(1 + 2k) > 10(2 + k) \\iff 8 + 16k > 20 + 10k \\iff 6k > 12 \\iff k > 2.\n$$\nThus, for $k  2$, the tighter bound is from $x + 2y \\leq 10$, not from $4x + 2y \\leq 16$. Hence, for $k  2$, the maximizing point on $y = kx$ is at the intersection with $x + 2y = 10$, not with $4x+2y=16$. Therefore statement II is false.\n\nFor completeness, the intersection with $x + 2y = 10$ has\n$$\nx = \\frac{10}{1 + 2k},\\quad y = \\frac{10k}{1 + 2k},\n$$\nwhich for $k \\geq 2$ also satisfies $4x + 2y \\leq 16$ because\n$$\n4x + 2y = 4\\left(\\frac{10}{1+2k}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{10k}{1+2k}\\right) = \\frac{40+20k}{1+2k} = \\frac{20(2+k)}{1+2k} \\leq 16 \\iff 20(2+k) \\leq 16(1+2k) \\iff 40+20k \\leq 16+32k \\iff 24 \\leq 12k \\iff k \\ge 2.\n$$\n\nFor statement III: Check feasibility for all $k  0$. The point $(0,0)$ satisfies $x \\geq 0$, $y \\geq 0$, $4x + 2y \\leq 16$, $x + 2y \\leq 10$, and $y \\geq kx$ because $0 \\geq k \\cdot 0$ holds. Therefore, the feasible set is never empty for any $k  0$, and the problem never becomes infeasible due to $C_{3}$. Hence statement III is false.\n\nCombining the above, only statement I is true.",
