            "problem": "A food production company makes two types of baked goods: 'Standard' and 'Deluxe'. The production is constrained by the availability of two special ingredients (A and B) and total oven time. The company wants to maximize profit. The optimization problem is modeled as a Linear Program (LP).\n\nThe primal LP is formulated as follows:\nMaximize $Z = 3x_1 + 5x_2$\nSubject to:\n1. $x_1 \\le 4$             (Ingredient A constraint, in kg)\n2. $2x_2 \\le 12$            (Ingredient B constraint, in kg)\n3. $3x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 18$    (Oven time constraint, in hours)\n4. $x_1, x_2 \\ge 0$\n\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the quantities (in hundreds of units) of 'Standard' and 'Deluxe' goods produced, respectively.\n\nThe corresponding dual LP is:\nMinimize $W = 4y_1 + 12y_2 + 18y_3$\nSubject to:\n1. $y_1 + 3y_3 \\ge 3$\n2. $2y_2 + 2y_3 \\ge 5$\n3. $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\ge 0$\n\nwhere $y_1$, $y_2$, and $y_3$ are the shadow prices associated with Ingredient A, Ingredient B, and oven time, respectively.\n\nAn analyst has proposed a potential optimal solution pair: a primal solution vector $x' = (2, 6)$ and a dual solution vector $y'=(0, 2, 1/2)$. According to the theory of complementary slackness, for a pair of feasible primal and dual solutions to be optimal, specific conditions must hold. Your task is to check these conditions for the given pair $(x', y')$.\n\nWhich one of the following complementary slackness conditions is NOT satisfied by the proposed solution pair?\n\nA. The condition associated with the primal variable $x_1$.\n\nB. The condition associated with the primal variable $x_2$.\n\nC. The condition associated with the first primal inequality constraint (Ingredient A).\n\nD. The condition associated with the second primal inequality constraint (Ingredient B).\n\nE. The condition associated with the third primal inequality constraint (Oven time).",
            "solution": "To determine which complementary slackness condition is not satisfied, we must systematically check all five conditions for the given primal solution $x'=(x_1', x_2') = (2, 6)$ and dual solution $y'=(y_1', y_2', y_3') = (0, 2, 1/2)$.\n\nThe complementary slackness conditions can be stated in two parts:\n1.  For each primal decision variable $x_j$, the product of the variable and the slack of the corresponding dual constraint must be zero. That is, $x_j' \\times (\\text{dual constraint } j \\text{ LHS} - \\text{dual constraint } j \\text{ RHS}) = 0$. A common way to check this is: if $x_j' > 0$, then the $j$-th dual constraint must be tight (i.e., hold with equality).\n2.  For each primal constraint $i$, the product of its slack and the corresponding dual variable $y_i$ must be zero. That is, $y_i' \\times (\\text{primal constraint } i \\text{ RHS} - \\text{primal constraint } i \\text{ LHS}) = 0$. A common way to check this is: if the $i$-th primal constraint is not tight (i.e., has positive slack), then the $i$-th dual variable $y_i'$ must be zero.\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\n**A. The condition associated with the primal variable $x_1$.**\nThe primal variable is $x_1' = 2$. Since $x_1' > 0$, the corresponding first dual constraint, $y_1 + 3y_3 \\ge 3$, must be tight. Let's substitute the values from $y'$:\n$y_1' + 3y_3' = 0 + 3 \\times (1/2) = 3/2$.\nThe condition requires this to be equal to 3. Since $3/2 \\neq 3$, this complementary slackness condition is **not satisfied**.\n\n**B. The condition associated with the primal variable $x_2$.**\nThe primal variable is $x_2' = 6$. Since $x_2' > 0$, the corresponding second dual constraint, $2y_2 + 2y_3 \\ge 5$, must be tight. Let's substitute the values from $y'$:\n$2y_2' + 2y_3' = 2 \\times (2) + 2 \\times (1/2) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\nThe condition requires this to be equal to 5. Since $5 = 5$, this complementary slackness condition is satisfied.\n\n**C. The condition associated with the first primal inequality constraint (Ingredient A).**\nThe first primal constraint is $x_1 \\le 4$. Let's calculate its slack using $x_1' = 2$:\nSlack = $4 - x_1' = 4 - 2 = 2$.\nSince the slack is non-zero ($2 > 0$), the constraint is not tight. Therefore, the corresponding dual variable, $y_1'$, must be zero.\nThe proposed dual solution gives $y_1' = 0$. Since this is true, this complementary slackness condition is satisfied.\n\n**D. The condition associated with the second primal inequality constraint (Ingredient B).**\nThe second primal constraint is $2x_2 \\le 12$. Let's calculate its slack using $x_2' = 6$:\nSlack = $12 - 2x_2' = 12 - 2(6) = 12 - 12 = 0$.\nSince the slack is zero, the constraint is tight. The complementary slackness condition is always satisfied when the primal constraint is tight, regardless of the value of the corresponding dual variable. This condition is satisfied.\n\n**E. The condition associated with the third primal inequality constraint (Oven time).**\nThe third primal constraint is $3x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 18$. Let's calculate its slack using $x'=(2, 6)$:\nSlack = $18 - (3x_1' + 2x_2') = 18 - (3(2) + 2(6)) = 18 - (6 + 12) = 18 - 18 = 0$.\nSince the slack is zero, the constraint is tight. As with the previous case, the condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nBased on the step-by-step verification, only the condition associated with the primal variable $x_1$ is violated.",

            "problem": "A specialized manufacturer produces three types of advanced electronic components: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The production of these components is constrained by the daily availability of two limited resources: specialized labor and precision machine time.\n\nThe production requirements per unit of each component are as follows:\n- **Alpha ($x_1$)**: 2 hours of labor, 3 hours of machine time.\n- **Beta ($x_2$)**: 4 hours of labor, 2 hours of machine time.\n- **Gamma ($x_3$)**: 3 hours of labor, 4 hours of machine time.\n\nThe total daily availability is 80 hours for labor and 60 hours for machine time.

Substituting into $2 y_{1} + 3 y_{2} = 50$ gives $2 y_{1} + 30 = 50$, so $2 y_{1} = 20$ and therefore $y_{1} = 10$.
