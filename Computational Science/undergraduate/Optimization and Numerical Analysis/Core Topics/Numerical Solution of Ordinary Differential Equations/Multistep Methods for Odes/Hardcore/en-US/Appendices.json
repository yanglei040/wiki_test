The behavior of the numerical solution for a given step size $h$ depends on the value of the product $z = h\\lambda$. The set of all complex numbers $z$ for which the numerical solution remains bounded is called the region of absolute stability.\n\nFor this problem, we will define a method as **stable** if all roots $r_i$ of its associated characteristic polynomial satisfy the strict inequality $|r_i|  1$.\n\nConsider the second-order Adams-Bashforth (AB2) method.

            "solution": "The goal of this problem is to determine the stability of the second-order Adams-Bashforth (AB2) method for a specific Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and step size.\n\nStep 1: Identify the parameters from the problem statement.\nThe given ODE is $y'(t) = -2y(t)$. This is an instance of the standard test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. By comparing the two, we can identify the parameter $\\lambda = -2$.\nThe step size is given as $h = 0.5$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of $z = h\\lambda$.\nThe stability of the method depends on the value of $z = h\\lambda$, which we must calculate.\n$$z = h \\lambda = (0.5)(-2) = -1$$\n\nStep 3: Locate the calculated value of $z$ relative to the region of absolute stability.\nThe problem provides information about the region of absolute stability for the AB2 method. It states that the boundary of this region intersects the real axis at $z = -1$ and $z = 0$.\nOur calculated value is $z = -1$. This means the point lies on the boundary of the region of absolute stability. It is not strictly inside the region.\n\nStep 4: Apply the given definition of stability.\nThe problem explicitly defines a method as stable if all roots $r_i$ of its characteristic polynomial satisfy the strict inequality $|r_i|  1$.\nIf a point $z$ is on the boundary of the stability region, it means that at least one of the roots of the characteristic polynomial has a magnitude equal to 1 (i.e., $|r_j| = 1$ for some root $r_j$). If the point $z$ were strictly inside the region, all roots would satisfy $|r_i|  1$. If it were outside, at least one root would satisfy $|r_j|1$.\nSince our point $z = -1$ is on the boundary, at least one root has a magnitude of 1. This violates the condition for stability, which requires all roots to have magnitudes strictly less than 1.\n\nStep 5: Conclude and select the correct option.\nBecause the condition $|r_i|  1$ is not met for all roots, the method is, by the given definition, unstable for this combination of $\\lambda$ and $h$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The method is stable for this step size. This is incorrect. The point $z=-1$ is on the boundary, not strictly inside the stability region.\nB. The method is unstable for this step size. This is correct, as the strict condition for stability is violated.\nC. The stability cannot be determined because $\\lambda$ is real, but the stability region is in the complex plane. This is incorrect. The real axis is a subset of the complex plane, so information about the real-axis intersection is directly applicable.\nD. The stability is guaranteed since the physical system being modeled is inherently stable (as indicated by $\\lambda  0$). This is incorrect. Numerical stability is a property of the method and the step size, not just the underlying physical system. An inappropriate choice of $h$ can make the numerical solution unstable even if the true solution is stable.\n\nTherefore, the method is unstable.",
