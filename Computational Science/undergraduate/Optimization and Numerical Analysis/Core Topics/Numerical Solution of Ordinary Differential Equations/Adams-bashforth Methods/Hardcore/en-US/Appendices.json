            "solution": "The goal is to find the approximate value of $y(0.2)$ using the two-step Adams-Bashforth method.\n\nThe general formula for the two-step Adams-Bashforth method is given by:\n$$ w_{i+1} = w_i + \\frac{h}{2} [3 f(t_i, w_i) - f(t_{i-1}, w_{i-1})] $$\nwhere $w_i$ is the approximation of $y(t_i)$, $h$ is the step size, and $f(t, y) = y'(t)$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we identify the following:\nThe differential equation is $y'(t) = t + \\cos(y(t))$, so our function is $f(t, y) = t + \\cos(y)$.\nThe initial points are given as $y(0) = 0$ and $y(0.1) = 0.005$. These correspond to our first two approximations, which we can denote as $w_0$ and $w_1$.\nLet $t_0 = 0$, then $w_0 = y(0) = 0$.\nLet $t_1 = 0.1$, then $w_1 = y(0.1) = 0.005$.\n\nThe step size $h$ is the difference between consecutive time points, so $h = t_1 - t_0 = 0.1 - 0 = 0.1$.\nWe are asked to find the approximation for $y(0.2)$. This corresponds to the next step, $t_2 = t_1 + h = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2$. The value we want to compute is $w_2$, which approximates $y(t_2)$.\n\nTo find $w_2$, we set $i=1$ in the Adams-Bashforth formula:\n$$ w_2 = w_1 + \\frac{h}{2} [3 f(t_1, w_1) - f(t_0, w_0)] $$\nFirst, we need to evaluate the function $f$ at the points $(t_0, w_0)$ and $(t_1, w_1)$.\n\nFor $(t_0, w_0) = (0, 0)$:\n$$ f(t_0, w_0) = f(0, 0) = 0 + \\cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 $$\n\nFor $(t_1, w_1) = (0.1, 0.005)$:\n$$ f(t_1, w_1) = f(0.1, 0.005) = 0.1 + \\cos(0.005) $$\n\nNow we substitute these values along with $w_1=0.005$ and $h=0.1$ into the formula for $w_2$:\n$$ w_2 = 0.005 + \\frac{0.1}{2} [3 (0.1 + \\cos(0.005)) - 1] $$\n$$ w_2 = 0.005 + 0.05 [0.3 + 3\\cos(0.005) - 1] $$\n$$ w_2 = 0.005 + 0.05 [3\\cos(0.005) - 0.7] $$\n\nTo obtain a numerical value, we use a calculator for $\\cos(0.005)$ (with the argument in radians):\n$$ \\cos(0.005) \\approx 0.9999875006... $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $w_2$:\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.005 + 0.05 [3(0.9999875006) - 0.7] $$\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.005 + 0.05 [2.9999625018 - 0.7] $$\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.005 + 0.05 [2.2999625018] $$\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.005 + 0.11499812509 $$\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.11999812509 $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\nThe first significant figure is 1, the second is 1, the third is 9, and the fourth is 9. The fifth significant figure is 9, which is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up the fourth digit. Rounding 9 up results in 10, which carries over.\nSo, $0.1199$ becomes $0.1200$.\n$$ w_2 \\approx 0.1200 $$\nTherefore, the approximate value of $y(0.2)$ is $0.1200$.",
