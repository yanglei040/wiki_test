This selection is based on maintaining a target level of accuracy.\n\nConsider the initial value problem defined by the differential equation:\n$$\ny'(t) = y(t)^2 - t\n$$\nwith the initial condition $y(0) = 1$.\n\nWe will use a second-order Taylor method to approximate the solution. The initial step size, $h_1$, must be determined by a control strategy that operates as follows:\nFirst, an estimate for the magnitude of the local truncation error is established. For a second-order method, the local truncation error for a step of size $h$ is dominated by a term proportional to $h^3$ and the third derivative of the solution, $y'''(t)$. The error estimate, denoted $\\text{Est}$, is defined as $\\text{Est} = \\frac{h^3}{6} |y'''(t_n)|$, where $(t_n, y_n)$ is the state at the beginning of the step.\n\nNext, this error estimate is set equal to a prescribed tolerance, $\\text{TOL}$. The resulting equation is then solved to find an \"ideal\" step size that would, according to the estimate, produce an error exactly equal to the tolerance.\n\nFinally, to ensure stability and account for approximations made in the error estimation, this ideal step size is scaled by a safety factor, $\\rho$, to produce the final recommended step size for the next step.\n\nGiven a tolerance of $\\text{TOL} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ and a safety factor of $\\rho = 0.8$, calculate the recommended initial step size, $h_1$, for this problem.
