This equation commonly models processes like radioactive decay or the discharge of a capacitor. A two-step numerical scheme known as the leapfrog method is used to approximate the solution. The method is defined by the recurrence relation $y_{n+1} = y_{n-1} + 2h f(t_n, y_n)$, where $y_n$ is the approximation of $y(t_n)$ at time $t_n = n h$, and $h$ is the constant step size.\n\nFor this method applied to the given test equation, the general numerical solution is a linear combination of solutions of the form $y_n = c \\cdot g^n$, where $g$ is a characteristic constant called an amplification factor.
