            "introduction": "The classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is a workhorse of numerical analysis, prized for its balance of accuracy and simplicity. To master it, we must first understand its internal mechanics—the calculation of four intermediate slopes, or \"stages\" ($k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$). This exercise guides you through a single step of this process, revealing how these stages are computed and subsequently averaged to produce a highly accurate estimate of the solution's local behavior.
