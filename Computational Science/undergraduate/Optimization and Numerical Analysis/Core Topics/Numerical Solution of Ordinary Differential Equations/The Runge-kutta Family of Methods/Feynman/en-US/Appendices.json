            "introduction": "To truly understand how Runge-Kutta methods achieve their remarkable accuracy, we must first look under the hood. The classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, a cornerstone of numerical analysis, works by calculating four distinct estimates of the slope across a single step. This exercise  invites you to compute these four stages—$k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, and $k_4$—by hand, providing a concrete feel for how the method samples the derivative to produce a highly accurate, weighted-average slope for advancing the solution.",

This practice  strips things back to basics by comparing the simplest numerical integrator, the Forward Euler method (an RK1 method), against the Improved Euler method (an RK2 method).
