            "problem": "A simplified model is used to describe the concentration, $C(t)$, of an unstable chemical species in a solution over time, $t$. The rate of change of the concentration is governed by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k C\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive rate constant. For this particular species, the rate constant is $k=1.6$, and the initial concentration at time $t=0$ is measured to be $C(0)=5.0$. All quantities are dimensionless.\n\nTo predict the concentration at a future time, a first-order numerical approximation scheme is employed. In this scheme, the concentration at the next time step, $C_{n+1}$, is estimated from the concentration at the current time step, $C_n$, using the relation:\n$$\nC_{n+1} = C_n + h \\cdot \\frac{dC}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_n}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the time step.\n\nTwo approximations for the concentration at $t=1.0$ are to be computed and compared.\n- The first approximation, denoted $C_{A}$, is calculated using a single time step of size $h=1.0$.\n- The second approximation, denoted $C_{B}$, is calculated using two equal time steps to reach $t=1.0$ (i.e., using a step size of $h=0.5$).\n\nCalculate the absolute difference $|C_{A} - C_{B}|$.

            "problem": "An initial value problem (IVP) is described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $y'(t) = -10y(t)$, with the initial condition $y(0) = 1$. This system is to be solved numerically using Euler's method to generate a sequence of approximations $y_n$ for the solution $y(t_n)$ at times $t_n = nh$, where $h > 0$ is a constant step size.\n\nThe numerical solution is considered to be non-oscillatory in sign if the sign of $y_n$ does not alternate for increasing $n$. Given that $y_0 = 1$ is positive, this condition requires that all subsequent approximations $y_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ must be non-negative.\n\nDetermine the supremum of the set of all positive step sizes $h$ for which the sequence of Euler approximations $\\{y_n\\}$ is non-oscillatory in sign. Express your answer as a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the supremum of the set of positive step sizes $h$ that ensure the Euler method approximation for the given initial value problem does not oscillate in sign.\n\nFirst, let's write down the iterative formula for Euler's method. The general form of Euler's method for an ODE of the form $y'(t) = f(t, y)$ is:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)$$\nIn our case, the ODE is $y'(t) = -10y(t)$, so the function is $f(t, y) = -10y$. Substituting this into the Euler formula gives:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h(-10y_n)$$\n\nNext, we can factor out $y_n$ to establish a recurrence relation for the sequence $\\{y_n\\}$:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n (1 - 10h)$$\nThis equation shows that each term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor of $(1 - 10h)$. This is the formula for a geometric progression. We can write an explicit formula for $y_n$ in terms of the initial value $y_0$:\n$$y_n = y_0 (1 - 10h)^n$$\n\nThe problem provides the initial condition $y(0) = 1$, which means $y_0 = 1$. Substituting this into our explicit formula, we get:\n$$y_n = (1 - 10h)^n$$\n\nThe problem defines a non-oscillatory sequence as one where all terms $y_n$ are non-negative, since $y_0$ is positive. For $y_n = (1-10h)^n$ to be non-negative for all $n \\ge 1$, the base of the power, $(1-10h)$, must be non-negative.\nIf $(1-10h)$ were negative, say $(1-10h) = -c$ where $c>0$, then the sequence would be $y_1 = -c$, $y_2 = (-c)^2 = c^2$, $y_3 = (-c)^3 = -c^3$, and so on. The signs of the terms would alternate $(-, +, -, \\dots)$, which is the oscillatory behavior we need to avoid.\nTherefore, the condition for a non-oscillatory sequence is:\n$$1 - 10h \\ge 0$$\n\nNow, we solve this inequality for the step size $h$:\n$$1 \\ge 10h$$\n$$\\frac{1}{10} \\ge h$$\nSo, $h \\le 0.1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the step size $h$ must be positive, so we have $h > 0$. Combining these conditions, the set of all positive step sizes $h$ for which the sequence $\\{y_n\\}$ is non-oscillatory is given by the interval $(0, 0.1]$.\n\nFinally, the question asks for the supremum of this set. The supremum is the least upper bound of the set. For the interval $(0, 0.1]$, the supremum is the largest value in the set, which is $0.1$.",
