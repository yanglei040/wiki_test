This practice explores the fundamental relationship between an ODE's solution and the step sizes chosen by the solver. By comparing a function with exponential growth against one with high-frequency oscillations , you will build an intuition for how the solution's derivatives, which measure its 'activity,' directly influence the step-size selection needed to maintain a constant error tolerance.",

            "solution": "An adaptive method of order $p$ selects step size $h(t)$ to keep the local truncation error (LTE) approximately at a target tolerance, say $\\varepsilon$.

This exercise  offers a concrete look at the inner workings of a step-size controller when tackling a stiff ODE with an explicit method.

            "problem": "An engineer is using a numerical routine to simulate a process governed by a first-order stiff Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). The routine employs an adaptive step size strategy. The integration is performed using Heun's method (also known as the improved Euler method or a second-order Runge-Kutta method), which advances the solution from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ using the following steps:\n1.  $k_1 = f(t_n, y_n)$\n2.  $k_2 = f(t_n + h, y_n + h k_1)$\n3.  $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(k_1 + k_2)$\n\nTo control the step size, the local error at each step is estimated by comparing the result of Heun's method, $y_{n+1}$, with the result from the simpler forward Euler method, $\\hat{y}_{n+1} = y_n + h k_1$. The local error estimate is defined as $\\text{err}_{n+1} = |y_{n+1} - \\hat{y}_{n+1}|$.\n\nThe step size is then adjusted using the standard proportional-integral controller formula, simplified for this analysis to its proportional part:\n$$h_{n+1} = h_n \\left( \\frac{\\text{TOL}}{\\text{err}_{n+1}} \\right)^{1/2}$$\nwhere $h_n$ is the current step size, $h_{n+1}$ is the proposed next step size, and $\\text{TOL}$ is the desired error tolerance.

            "problem": "Two ordinary differential equation (ODE) initial value problems are integrated over $t\\in[0,10]$ with the same explicit embedded Runge–Kutta method of order $p=5$, using standard local error control with relative tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol}=10^{-6}$, absolute tolerance $\\mathrm{atol}=10^{-12}$, a safety factor $S\\in(0,1)$, and initial step $h(0)=10^{-3}$.

Repeating the run with $\\mathrm{rtol}$ multiplied by $10$ or divided by $10$ leaves this plateau essentially unchanged.\n- Run $\\mathrm{R2}$: $h(t)$ increases by orders of magnitude during the early part of the interval and eventually reaches $h(t)\\approx 5\\times 10^{-1}$ with mild fluctuations. When $\\mathrm{rtol}$ is tightened by a factor of $10$, the asymptotic $h(t)$ decreases systematically; when $\\mathrm{rtol}$ is relaxed by a factor of $10$, the asymptotic $h(t)$ increases systematically.\n\nUsing only the information in the step-size history $h(t)$ as a diagnostic, which of the following statements are valid for comparing solver performance on the stiff versus non-stiff system? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Run $\\mathrm{R1}$ corresponds to the stiff system $S$; the observed $h(t)$ plateau and its insensitivity to changes in $\\mathrm{rtol}$ indicate that the step size is limited primarily by linear stability, i.e., by a constraint of the form $\\lvert h\\,\\lambda\\rvert\\lesssim \\gamma$ for some method-dependent constant $\\gamma$, rather than by accuracy.\n\nB. Run $\\mathrm{R2}$ corresponds to the stiff system $S$; the growing $h(t)$ shows that the explicit method can take very large steps across the fast transient because stiffness permits skipping over rapidly decaying modes.\n\nC. For the non-stiff system $N$, under an adaptive embedded method of order $p$ with local error control, the asymptotic accepted step size scales as $h\\propto \\mathrm{rtol}^{1/(p+1)}$ when the solution varies on an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ scale, which explains the sensitivity of $\\mathrm{R2}$ to changes in $\\mathrm{rtol}$.\n\nD. If both runs were repeated with an implicit $A$-stable (absolutely stable for the entire left half-plane) method of comparable order and the same tolerances, the stiff case would still exhibit a small-$h$ plateau for the same stability reason, so the presence of a plateau in $h(t)$ would not help diagnose stiffness.\n\nE.

            "solution": "To diagnose the solver's behavior, we must first identify the characteristics of each system.\n- System $S$, $y^{\\prime}(t)=-10^{4}\\,y(t)$, is **stiff**. Its time scale $\\tau = 1/\\lambda = 10^{-4}$ is extremely short compared to the integration interval. For an explicit method, the step size $h$ is severely constrained by the stability requirement $|h\\lambda| \\leq \\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is a constant specific to the RK method (typically $\\gamma \\approx 5$ for an order 5 method). This implies $h \\lesssim 5/10^4 = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. This small, constant step size limit is independent of the accuracy tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol}$. This behavior—a low, constant step-size plateau insensitive to tolerance—perfectly matches Run $\\mathrm{R1}$.\n- System $N$, $y^{\\prime}(t)=-y(t)$, is **non-stiff**. Its time scale $\\tau = 1$ is of the same order as the integration interval. The stability limit is mild ($h \\lesssim 5$), so the step size is governed by the accuracy requirement. The adaptive algorithm adjusts $h$ to keep the local error below the tolerance, leading to a theoretical scaling of $h \\propto \\mathrm{rtol}^{1/(p+1)}$. Since the solution $y(t)=e^{-t}$ decays, accuracy becomes easier to achieve, and the solver can increase $h$ over time. This behavior—a growing step size that is sensitive to $\\mathrm{rtol}$—perfectly matches Run $\\mathrm{R2}$.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- **A is correct.** Run $\\mathrm{R1}$ corresponds to the stiff system S, and its behavior is characteristic of a stability-limited integration.\n- **B is incorrect.** Run $\\mathrm{R2}$ corresponds to the non-stiff system N. Furthermore, explicit methods are hobbled by stiffness; they cannot take large steps on stiff problems.\n- **C is correct.** The sensitivity of Run R2's step size to the tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol}$ is explained by the fundamental scaling law for accuracy-limited adaptive methods.\n- **D is incorrect.** An A-stable implicit method has no stability restriction for this problem. When applied to the stiff system S, its step size would be limited only by accuracy and would grow very large after the initial transient, eliminating the plateau.\n- **E is incorrect.** Frequent step rejections can have multiple causes. The constant step-size plateau that is insensitive to $\\mathrm{rtol}$ is the key diagnostic signature of stiffness for an explicit solver.",
