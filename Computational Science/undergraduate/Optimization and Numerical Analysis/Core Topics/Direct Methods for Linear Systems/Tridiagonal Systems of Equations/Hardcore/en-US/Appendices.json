This exercise demystifies the forward elimination phase of the Thomas algorithm, which is a specialized form of Gaussian elimination tailored for tridiagonal systems. By symbolically tracking how the coefficients are modified, you will see precisely how the algorithm transforms the original system into a simpler, upper-triangular form, giving you a deeper appreciation for its structure and efficiency .",

The Thomas algorithm, a specialized form of Gaussian elimination, solves this system by first performing a forward elimination pass to transform the system into an upper triangular form, followed by a backward substitution pass.\n\nThe forward elimination phase proceeds by modifying the coefficients. For each row $i$ from $2$ to $4$, the elements $a_i$ are eliminated by updating the diagonal element $b_i$ and the right-hand side element $d_i$ using the values from the row above ($i-1$). Let the modified coefficients be denoted by a prime (e.g., $b_i'$ and $d_i'$).\n\nPerform the first two steps of the forward elimination process (for rows $i=2$ and $i=3$). Determine the resulting expressions for the modified main diagonal element of the third row, $b_3'$, and the modified right-hand side element of the third row, $d_3'$. Express these two quantities fully in terms of the original coefficients $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$.\n\nPresent your final answer as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix containing the expressions for $b_3'$ and $d_3'$ in that order.",
