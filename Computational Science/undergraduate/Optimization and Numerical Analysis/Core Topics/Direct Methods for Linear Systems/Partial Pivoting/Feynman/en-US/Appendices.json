            "introduction": "The journey into Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting begins with a single, crucial first step. Before any elimination occurs, we must ensure our pivot element is the best possible choice to maintain numerical stability. This initial exercise  focuses on mastering this fundamental operation: identifying the element with the largest absolute value in the first column and performing the necessary row swap to bring it into the pivot position.",

            "problem": "In numerical linear algebra, strategies are employed to improve the stability of algorithms like Gaussian elimination. Consider the system of linear equations represented by the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where the coefficient matrix $A$ is given by:\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3.1 & -1.5 & 4.2 \\\\\n-2.5 & 8.9 & -0.7 \\\\\n-7.8 & 3.4 & 1.1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo start solving this system using Gaussian elimination with a partial pivoting strategy, a specific row interchange must be performed first to ensure the pivot element has the largest possible magnitude. Which of the following describes the first operation required by this strategy?\n\nA. Interchange Row 1 and Row 2.\n\nB. Interchange Row 1 and Row 3.\n\nC. Interchange Row 2 and Row 3.\n\nD. No row interchange is required in the first step.\n\nE. The strategy cannot be applied as the matrix is singular.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the first step of Gaussian elimination with a partial pivoting strategy for the given $3 \\times 3$ matrix $A$.\n\nThe matrix is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3.1 & -1.5 & 4.2 \\\\\n-2.5 & 8.9 & -0.7 \\\\\n-7.8 & 3.4 & 1.1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe partial pivoting strategy for the first column (step $k=1$) involves identifying the row that contains the element with the largest absolute value in the first column. This element will be the pivot for the first stage of elimination.\n\nLet's denote the elements of the matrix as $a_{ij}$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index. We need to examine the elements in the first column: $a_{11}$, $a_{21}$, and $a_{31}$.\n\nThe elements are:\n$a_{11} = 3.1$\n$a_{21} = -2.5$\n$a_{31} = -7.8$\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute value of each of these elements:\n$|a_{11}| = |3.1| = 3.1$\n$|a_{21}| = |-2.5| = 2.5$\n$|a_{31}| = |-7.8| = 7.8$\n\nWe now find the maximum of these absolute values:\n$\\max(|a_{11}|, |a_{21}|, |a_{31}|) = \\max(3.1, 2.5, 7.8) = 7.8$.\n\nThis maximum absolute value corresponds to the element $a_{31}$, which is in the third row.\n\nAccording to the partial pivoting procedure, the row containing the pivot element (the element with the largest absolute value in the current column) must be swapped with the current pivot row. For the first step, the current pivot row is Row 1. Since the largest magnitude element is in Row 3, we must interchange Row 1 and Row 3.\n\nAfter the interchange, the matrix will look like this:\n$$\nA' = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-7.8 & 3.4 & 1.1 \\\\\n-2.5 & 8.9 & -0.7 \\\\\n3.1 & -1.5 & 4.2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe new pivot element is $a'_{11} = -7.8$, which has a larger magnitude than the other original elements in the first column.\n\nTherefore, the first operation required is to interchange Row 1 and Row 3. This corresponds to option B. Option E is incorrect as the pivoting strategy can be applied regardless of singularity (though a singular matrix will lead to a zero pivot at some stage), and the operation is well-defined.",
