This exercise provides a concrete look at how a perturbation propagates through the calculations. By solving a nearly diagonal system, you can precisely identify how the solution deviates from its original, unperturbed state, revealing the structure of the error term. ",

            "problem": "Consider a system of three linear equations with three unknowns, written in matrix form as $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$. Here, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$ is the vector of unknowns and $\\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)^T$ is a constant vector.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is a perturbation of a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of $A$ are $A_{11} = d_1$, $A_{22} = d_2$, and $A_{33} = d_3$, where $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are non-zero constants. A single off-diagonal element is non-zero: the element in the first row and second column is $A_{12} = \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small constant. All other off-diagonal elements of $A$ are zero.\n\nFind an exact expression for the component $x_1$ of the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$. Express your answer in terms of the symbolic parameters $d_1, d_2, b_1, b_2$, and $\\epsilon$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the first component, $x_1$, of the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ for the linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n\nFirst, let's explicitly write down the matrix $A$ based on the problem description. The matrix $A$ is a 3x3 matrix. Its diagonal entries are $A_{11}=d_1$, $A_{22}=d_2$, and $A_{33}=d_3$. The only non-zero off-diagonal entry is $A_{12}=\\epsilon$. All other off-diagonal entries are zero. Thus, the matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} d_1  \\epsilon  0 \\\\ 0  d_2  0 \\\\ 0  0  d_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system of linear equations $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ can be written out component-wise as:\n1.  $A_{11}x_1 + A_{12}x_2 + A_{13}x_3 = b_1 \\implies d_1 x_1 + \\epsilon x_2 + 0 \\cdot x_3 = b_1$\n2.  $A_{21}x_1 + A_{22}x_2 + A_{23}x_3 = b_2 \\implies 0 \\cdot x_1 + d_2 x_2 + 0 \\cdot x_3 = b_2$\n3.  $A_{31}x_1 + A_{32}x_2 + A_{33}x_3 = b_3 \\implies 0 \\cdot x_1 + 0 \\cdot x_2 + d_3 x_3 = b_3$\n\nThis simplifies to the following system of equations:\n$$\nd_1 x_1 + \\epsilon x_2 = b_1\n$$\n$$\nd_2 x_2 = b_2\n$$\n$$\nd_3 x_3 = b_3\n$$\nWe are asked to find an expression for $x_1$. To do this, we can solve this system. The matrix $A$ is upper triangular, which simplifies the process. We can solve for the variables starting from the last one, although in this case the equations for $x_2$ and $x_3$ are independent.\n\nFrom the second equation, since $d_2$ is non-zero, we can solve for $x_2$:\n$$\nx_2 = \\frac{b_2}{d_2}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $x_2$ into the first equation:\n$$\nd_1 x_1 + \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{b_2}{d_2} \\right) = b_1\n$$\nOur goal is to isolate $x_1$. We rearrange the equation to solve for the term containing $x_1$:\n$$\nd_1 x_1 = b_1 - \\frac{\\epsilon b_2}{d_2}\n$$\nFinally, since $d_1$ is non-zero, we can divide by $d_1$ to find the expression for $x_1$:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{1}{d_1} \\left( b_1 - \\frac{\\epsilon b_2}{d_2} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the $1/d_1$ term gives the final answer:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{b_1}{d_1} - \\frac{\\epsilon b_2}{d_1 d_2}\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the first component of the solution vector for the perturbed system. Notice that the solution consists of the original, unperturbed solution component ($b_1/d_1$) and a correction term that is proportional to the perturbation $\\epsilon$. The parameters $d_3$ and $b_3$ do not affect the value of $x_1$.",

            "introduction": "While the previous exercise showed a specific effect, we need a general tool to quantify a system's sensitivity before we even solve it. This leads us to the condition number, a far more reliable indicator of numerical stability than the determinant. This problem challenges the common misconception that a determinant far from zero implies a well-behaved matrix, forcing a deeper understanding of what truly makes a system ill-conditioned. ",

            "problem": "In numerical linear algebra, the condition number of a matrix is a crucial concept that quantifies the sensitivity of the solution of a linear system $Ax=b$ to perturbations in the input data $A$ or $b$. A matrix with a high condition number is called \"ill-conditioned,\" while one with a low condition number is \"well-conditioned.\" One might intuitively think that a matrix with a determinant close to zero is ill-conditioned, but this is not always true. Conversely, a matrix can be extremely ill-conditioned even if its determinant is exactly 1.\n\nTo explore this, consider the family of $2 \\times 2$ matrices $A_N$ defined for any real number $N > 1$ as:\n$$\nA_N = \\begin{pmatrix} N  N-1 \\\\ N+1  N \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition number of a matrix $A$ with respect to a given matrix norm can be calculated as $\\kappa(A) = \\|A\\| \\|A^{-1}\\|$. For this problem, we will use the matrix infinity-norm, denoted by $\\|A\\|_{\\infty}$, which is defined as the maximum of the absolute row sums of the matrix. That is, for an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$, $\\|A\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}|$.\n\nDespite the fact that the determinant of $A_N$ is equal to 1 for all $N1$, the matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $N$ grows.
