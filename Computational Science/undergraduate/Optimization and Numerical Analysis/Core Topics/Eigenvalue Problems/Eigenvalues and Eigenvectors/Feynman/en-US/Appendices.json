            "introduction": "Diagonalization is one of the most powerful tools in linear algebra, allowing us to simplify complex matrix operations by changing our basis to one composed of eigenvectors. This practice  provides a complete, step-by-step diagonalization of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, decomposing it into the form $A = PDP^{-1}$. Mastering this procedure is essential as it forms the basis for solving systems of differential equations, calculating large powers of matrices, and understanding the long-term behavior of linear dynamical systems.",
