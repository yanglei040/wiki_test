The method iteratively updates a simplex, a geometric figure consisting of $n+1$ vertices in an $n$-dimensional space, to explore the function's landscape.\n\nConsider the application of this method to find the minimum of a one-dimensional function $f(x)$, where $n=1$. In this case, the simplex is simply a set of $n+1=2$ distinct points.

It operates on a simplex, which is a geometric figure in $n$ dimensions consisting of $n+1$ vertices. For a function in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the simplex is a triangle. The algorithm iteratively modifies the simplex to move it towards a minimum.\n\nThis problem concerns one iteration of the Nelder-Mead algorithm for minimizing the function $f(x, y) = 10x^2 + y^2$. The initial simplex has vertices $v_1 = (0.1, 0.1)$, $v_2 = (-0.1, 0.2)$, and $v_3 = (2.0, 0.3)$.\n\nThe algorithm uses the standard parameters: reflection factor $\\alpha=1$, expansion factor $\\gamma=2$, contraction factor $\\rho=0.5$, and shrink factor $\\sigma=0.5$.\n\nOne iteration of the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Order**: Order the $n+1=3$ vertices $x_1, x_2, x_3$ such that their function values are sorted: $f(x_1) \\le f(x_2) \\le f(x_3)$. Here, $x_1$ is the best vertex and $x_3$ is the worst.\n2.  **Centroid**: Calculate the centroid $x_o$ of all vertices except the worst one, $x_o = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)$.\n3.  **Reflection**: Compute the reflected point $x_r = x_o + \\alpha(x_o - x_3)$. Evaluate $f(x_r)$.\n4.  **Decision Logic**:\n    a. If $f(x_1) \\le f(x_r) < f(x_2)$, the simplex is modified by replacing the worst point $x_3$ with $x_r$. This is a **Reflection** step. The iteration terminates.\n    b. If $f(x_r) < f(x_1)$, the algorithm has found a promising direction. It attempts an **Expansion**:\n        i.  Compute the expansion point $x_e = x_o + \\gamma(x_r - x_o)$.\n        ii. If $f(x_e) < f(x_r)$, replace $x_3$ with $x_e$. The iteration terminates.\n        iii.
