            "introduction": "The Nelder-Mead algorithm is a classic direct search method that navigates the search space using a geometric shape called a simplex. Instead of using derivatives, it evaluates the function at the simplex's vertices and iteratively modifies the simplex by reflecting, expanding, or contracting it away from the worst-performing vertex. This exercise focuses on the core \"reflection\" step, providing a concrete calculation that demonstrates how the algorithm explores new regions in its search for a minimum .",

            "problem": "The Nelder-Mead algorithm is a popular derivative-free optimization method used to find the minimum of a function in a multi-dimensional space. The algorithm operates on a simplex, which is a geometric figure consisting of $n+1$ vertices in an $n$-dimensional space (e.g., a triangle in 2D).\n\nConsider the minimization of a cost function $f(x, y)$ of two variables using the Nelder-Mead algorithm. At a certain iteration, the simplex is defined by three vertices: $v_A = (1, 2)$, $v_B = (5, 4)$, and $v_C = (3, 6)$. The corresponding values of the cost function at these vertices are $f(v_A) = 10$, $f(v_B) = 25$, and $f(v_C) = 15$.\n\nThe first step in a Nelder-Mead iteration is to identify the best (lowest function value), next-worst, and worst (highest function value) vertices. Then, a new test point is generated by \"reflecting\" the worst vertex through the centroid of the remaining vertices.\n\nThe centroid, $v_c$, is calculated as the average of the positions of all vertices except for the worst one. The reflection point, $v_r$, is then computed using the formula $v_r = v_c + \\alpha(v_c - v_{w})$, where $v_{w}$ is the worst vertex and $\\alpha$ is the reflection coefficient. For this problem, use the standard reflection coefficient $\\alpha = 1$.\n\nCalculate the coordinates of the reflection point, $v_r$. Express your answer as a row matrix containing the two coordinates.",
            "solution": "We are minimizing a function of two variables using the Nelder-Mead algorithm.

By definition, the best vertex has the lowest function value, the worst has the highest, and the next-worst is the remaining one. Therefore, the best is $v_{A}$, the next-worst is $v_{C}$, and the worst is $v_{B}$ since $25$ is the largest value.\n\nThe centroid $v_{c}$ is computed as the average of the vertices excluding the worst. With the two remaining vertices $v_{A}$ and $v_{C}$, the centroid is\n$$\nv_{c}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(v_{A}+v_{C}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((1,2)+(3,6)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(4,8)=(2,4).\n$$\n\nThe reflection point is defined by\n$$\nv_{r}=v_{c}+\\alpha\\left(v_{c}-v_{w}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $v_{w}$ is the worst vertex and $\\alpha$ is the reflection coefficient.
