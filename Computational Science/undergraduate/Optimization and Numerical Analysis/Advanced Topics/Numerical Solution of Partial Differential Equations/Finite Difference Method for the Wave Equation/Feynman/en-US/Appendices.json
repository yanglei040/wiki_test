The constant $c$ is the wave propagation speed. We are interested in the behavior of a membrane stretched over a specific frame within the unit square.\n\nThe frame defines a boundary, $\\partial\\Omega$, where the membrane is fixed, implying a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition: $u(x,y,t) = 0$ for all points $(x,y)$ on the frame. The frame consists of the outer perimeter of the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ and an inner, L-shaped boundary defined by the union of two line segments: $\\{ (x, 0.5) \\mid 0.5 \\le x \\le 1 \\}$ and $\\{ (0.5, y) \\mid 0.5 \\le y \\le 1 \\}$. This effectively removes the top-right quarter of the square from the vibrating region.\n\nTo solve this problem numerically, a uniform grid is laid over the $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ square with spatial grid spacing $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = h$ and a time step $\\Delta t$. We denote the numerical approximation of the displacement at a grid point as $u_{i,j}^k \\approx u(ih, jh, k\\Delta t)$. The standard explicit finite difference scheme for the wave equation is given by the five-point stencil:\n$$u_{i,j}^{k+1} = 2(1 - 2\\lambda^2)u_{i,j}^k - u_{i,j}^{k-1} + \\lambda^2 (u_{i+1,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k + u_{i,j+1}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k)$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{h}$ is the Courant number.\n\nAssume the grid spacing is set to $h = 1/N$ for a large, even integer $N$. Consider the interior grid point $P$ located at coordinates $(0.5-h, 0.5)$. Let the grid indices for this point be $(I, J)$, where $I = N/2 - 1$ and $J=N/2$.\n\nDerive the specific update equation for the displacement at this point, $u_{I,J}^{k+1}$. Your answer should be an expression for $u_{I,J}^{k+1}$ in terms of $\\lambda$ and the values of $u$ at relevant grid points at time steps $k$ and $k-1$.",

According to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, the displacement at any boundary point is zero for all time.\n    Therefore, $u_{I+1,J}^k = 0$.\n\n2.  **West Neighbor:** The point with indices $(I-1, J)$.\n    Its coordinates are $(x_{I-1}, y_J) = ((I-1)h, Jh) = ((N/2-2)h, (N/2)h) = (0.5-2h, 0.5)$.\n    Since $0 < 0.5-2h < 0.5$, this point is an interior point of the membrane. The value $u_{I-1,J}^k$ is an unknown to be solved for in the simulation.\n\n3.  **North Neighbor:** The point with indices $(I, J+1)$.\n    Its coordinates are $(x_I, y_{J+1}) = (Ih, (J+1)h) = ((N/2-1)h, (N/2+1)h) = (0.5-h, 0.5+h)$.\n    Since $0 < 0.5-h < 0.5$ and $0.5 < 0.5+h < 1$, this point is an interior point.

The value $u_{I,J-1}^k$ is an unknown.\n\nNow we substitute these findings into the general stencil for $(i,j)=(I,J)$:\n$$u_{I,J}^{k+1} = 2(1 - 2\\lambda^2)u_{I,J}^k - u_{I,J}^{k-1} + \\lambda^2 (u_{I+1,J}^k + u_{I-1,J}^k + u_{I,J+1}^k + u_{I,J-1}^k)$$\n\nSubstitute $u_{I+1,J}^k = 0$:\n$$u_{I,J}^{k+1} = 2(1 - 2\\lambda^2)u_{I,J}^k - u_{I,J}^{k-1} + \\lambda^2 (0 + u_{I-1,J}^k + u_{I,J+1}^k + u_{I,J-1}^k)$$\n\nSimplifying the expression gives the specific update equation for the point $P$:\n$$u_{I,J}^{k+1} = 2(1 - 2\\lambda^2)u_{I,J}^k - u_{I,J}^{k-1} + \\lambda^2 (u_{I-1,J}^k + u_{I,J+1}^k + u_{I,J-1}^k)$$\nThis is the required expression.",
