The heat dissipation along a thin, one-dimensional silicon interconnect can be modeled by the 1D heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $t$ is time, $x$ is the position along the interconnect, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of silicon.\n\nTo solve this equation numerically, the engineer uses a Forward-Time, Centered-Space (FTCS) explicit scheme.
