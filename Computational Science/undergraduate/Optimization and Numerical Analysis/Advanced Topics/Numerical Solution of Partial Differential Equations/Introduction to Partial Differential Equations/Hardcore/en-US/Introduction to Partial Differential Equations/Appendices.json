This exercise demonstrates how to solve a PDE by integrating with respect to one variable at a time, revealing a key feature of PDEs: the appearance of arbitrary functions instead of constants in the general solution . This practice builds a fundamental understanding of what a \"solution\" to a PDE looks like.",

We can write the equation as:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = 2x + y$$\nTo solve this equation, we can integrate it step-by-step. First, we integrate with respect to $y$, treating $x$ as a constant.\n$$\\int \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) dy = \\int (2x + y) dy$$\nThe integration on the left side undoes the partial differentiation with respect to $y$, yielding $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x \\int dy + \\int y dy$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2xy + \\frac{1}{2}y^2 + h(x)$$\nWhen integrating with respect to $y$, the \"constant\" of integration is not necessarily a constant, but can be any function that depends only on $x$, since its partial derivative with respect to $y$ would be zero.

An engineer is developing a simplified model for a guitar string to generate sound. The string is modeled one-dimensionally, with its transverse displacement given by $u(x, t)$, where $x$ is the position along the string and $t$ is time. The string has a length $L=1.00 \\text{ m}$, is under a tension $T=400 \\text{ N}$, and has a linear mass density $\\mu=4.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg/m}$. The speed of wave propagation on the string is given by $c=\\sqrt{T/\\mu}$.\n\nThe simulation discretizes the string into $N=4$ equal segments, creating points indexed by $i=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. The position of the $i$-th point is $x_i = i \\cdot \\Delta x$, where $\\Delta x = L/N$. The simulation proceeds in discrete time steps of size $\\Delta t = 1.25 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}$. The displacement of point $i$ at time step $j$ (time $t_j = j \\cdot \\Delta t$) is denoted by $u_i^j$. The string is fixed at both ends, meaning $u_0^j = 0$ and $u_4^j = 0$ for all time steps $j$.\n\nThe string is initially plucked and released from rest.

Let $s = c \\Delta t / \\Delta x$. Because the string is released from rest, the displacements at the first time step ($j=1$) are calculated using the initial displacements ($j=0$) as follows:\n$$ u_i^1 = \\frac{s^2}{2}(u_{i+1}^{0} + u_{i-1}^{0}) + (1 - s^2)u_i^0 $$\nFor all subsequent time steps ($j \\ge 1$), the future displacement $u_i^{j+1}$ is computed from the current ($j$) and past ($j-1$) states:\n$$ u_i^{j+1} = s^2(u_{i+1}^{j} + u_{i-1}^{j}) + 2(1 - s^2)u_i^j - u_i^{j-1} $$\nThese rules apply to the interior points of the string ($i=1, 2, 3$).\n\nCalculate the displacement of the midpoint of the string at time $t = 2\\Delta t$.
