This exercise explores the one-dimensional advection equation, a fundamental model for transport phenomena. By analyzing a Forward-Time, Backward-Space (FTBS) scheme for a flow moving from right to left, you will discover the critical importance of 'upwinding'—discretizing the spatial derivative using information from the direction the flow is coming from—and see firsthand how violating this principle leads to unconditional instability .",

A sufficient condition for stability, which for this scheme is also necessary, is that the update for $\\rho_{i,j}^{n+1}$ is a convex combination of the values at the previous time step.

This holds since $u_x^- \\le 0$ and $\\kappa \\ge 0$.\n-   Similarly, coefficients of $\\rho_{i,j-1}^n$ and $\\rho_{i,j+1}^n$ are non-negative.\n\nThe only remaining constraint comes from requiring the coefficient of $\\rho_{i,j}^n$ to be non-negative:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{|u_x|\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{|u_y|\\Delta t}{\\Delta y} - 2\\kappa\\Delta t \\left(\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right) \\ge 0 $$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\Delta t \\left(\\frac{|u_x|}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{|u_y|}{\\Delta y} + 2\\kappa \\left(\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right)\\right) \\le 1 $$\nThis gives the stability limit for the time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$. If the denominator is zero (i.e., $u_x=u_y=0$ and $\\kappa=0$), the scheme is unconditionally stable, and $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ is infinite.
