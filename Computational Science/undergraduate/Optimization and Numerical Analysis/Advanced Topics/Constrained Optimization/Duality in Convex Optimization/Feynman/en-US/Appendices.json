            "introduction": "Once we can formulate a dual problem, the next step is to use its properties to find a solution. This practice focuses on applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to pinpoint the primal-dual optimal solution, also known as the saddle point of the Lagrangian . Working through this example provides a concrete understanding of how conditions like stationarity and complementary slackness forge a direct link between the primal and dual variables at optimality.",

            "problem": "In a simplified machine learning scenario, the cost associated with a model parameter, $x$, is described by the quadratic function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. To prevent underfitting and ensure the model has a minimum level of complexity, a domain expert imposes a constraint that the parameter $x$ must be at least 2. This leads to a constrained optimization problem.\n\nThe Lagrangian function for this problem is defined as $L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) + \\lambda g(x)$, where $g(x) \\le 0$ represents the inequality constraint and $\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nYour task is to find the saddle point $(x^*, \\lambda^*)$ of the Lagrangian. This point corresponds to the optimal parameter value $x^*$ that minimizes the cost function subject to the constraint, and the associated optimal Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^*$.\n\nReport the saddle point as an ordered pair $(x^*, \\lambda^*)$.",
            "solution": "We are given the convex quadratic objective $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ and the inequality constraint $x \\geq 2$. To express this in the standard form $g(x) \\leq 0$, define $g(x) = 2 - x$, so the constraint is $g(x) \\leq 0$. The Lagrangian is\n$$\nL(x, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + \\lambda(2 - x),\n$$\nwith dual feasibility $\\lambda \\geq 0$.\n\nFor a convex problem with affine constraint, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimality and for characterizing a saddle point. The KKT conditions are:\n- Primal feasibility: $g(x^{*}) \\leq 0$, i.e., $x^{*} \\geq 2$.\n- Dual feasibility: $\\lambda^{*} \\geq 0$.\n- Stationarity: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}(x^{*}, \\lambda^{*}) = 0$.\n- Complementary slackness: $\\lambda^{*} g(x^{*}) = 0$.\n\nCompute the stationarity condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = x - \\lambda \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^{*} - \\lambda^{*} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^{*} = \\lambda^{*}.\n$$\nApply complementary slackness:\n$$\n\\lambda^{*}(2 - x^{*}) = 0.\n$$\nConsider the cases:\n- If $\\lambda^{*} = 0$, then from stationarity $x^{*} = 0$, which violates primal feasibility $x^{*} \\geq 2$; reject this case.\n- Therefore $2 - x^{*} = 0 \\Rightarrow x^{*} = 2$. Then by stationarity $\\lambda^{*} = x^{*} = 2$, which satisfies $\\lambda^{*} \\geq 0$ and $x^{*} \\geq 2$.\n\nThus, the unique KKT point is $(x^{*}, \\lambda^{*}) = (2, 2)$. Because the problem is convex with an affine constraint, this KKT point is the saddle point of the Lagrangian. Equivalently, verifying the saddle property: $L(x, 2)$ is minimized at $x = 2$, and $L(2, \\lambda) = 2$ for all $\\lambda \\geq 0$, with the dual maximizer at $\\lambda^{*} = 2$.",
