            "problem": "A specialty coffee company operates three plantations in South America and distributes its raw beans to four roasting facilities in Europe. The supply capacities of the plantations and the demand requirements of the roasting facilities are fixed for the upcoming season.\n\nThe plantations are located in Colombia (S1), Brazil (S2), and Peru (S3), with the following weekly supply capacities in tons:\n- S1: 300 tons\n- S2: 400 tons\n- S3: 500 tons\n\nThe roasting facilities are located in Hamburg (D1), Trieste (D2), Le Havre (D3), and Valencia (D4), with the following weekly demand requirements in tons:\n- D1: 250 tons\n- D2: 350 tons\n- D3: 400 tons\n- D4: 200 tons\n\nThe cost of transporting one ton of coffee beans from each plantation to each roasting facility is given in Euros. The costs are as follows:\n- From S1 (Colombia): 8 to D1, 10 to D2, 14 to D3, and 12 to D4.\n- From S2 (Brazil): 9 to D1, 7 to D2, and 11 to D4. Due to insurmountable logistical complications, direct shipment from S2 to D3 is impossible, and this route is considered forbidden, having an infinitely large cost denoted by $M$.\n- From S3 (Peru): 13 to D1, 12 to D2, 6 to D3, and 10 to D4.\n\nTo initiate the logistics plan, the company decides to determine an initial basic feasible solution using the Least Cost Method (also known as the Matrix Minima Method). Calculate the total transportation cost for this initial shipping plan.\n\nExpress your final answer in Euros.",

At each step, select the available cell with the smallest finite cost and allocate $x_{ij}=\\min(\\text{supply at } S_i, \\text{ demand at } D_j)$, then update the remaining supply and demand. The forbidden route $(S_2,D_3)$ with cost $M$ is never chosen.\n\nStep 1: The least cost is $c_{33}=6$ at $(S_3,D_3)$.

            "problem": "The organizing committee for a university's open day needs to assign student volunteers to various operational tasks. There are five volunteers available: Alex, Ben, Chloe, David, and Emily. There are four distinct tasks to be filled: Campus Tour Guide, Information Desk, Workshop Assistant, and Welcome Booth. Each task must be assigned to exactly one volunteer, and no volunteer can be assigned to more than one task.\n\nBased on a survey, each volunteer has provided a preference score, representing their level of interest in each task. A higher score indicates a stronger preference. The scores are compiled in the table below.\n\n| Volunteer | Campus Tour Guide | Information Desk | Workshop Assistant | Welcome Booth |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Alex | 8 | 5 | 7 | 9 |\n| Ben | 6 | 9 | 5 | 8 |\n| Chloe | 7 | 8 | 6 | 7 |\n| David | 5 | 7 | 8 | 6 |\n| Emily | 9 | 6 | 7 | 4 |\n\nSince there are more volunteers than tasks, one volunteer will not be assigned a task. The committee's goal is to create an assignment that maximizes the sum of the preference scores of the four assigned volunteers.\n\nDetermine the maximum possible total preference score the committee can achieve.",
            "solution": "We model this as a maximum-weight assignment problem on a bipartite graph with volunteers on one side and tasks on the other, where the weight of assigning a volunteer to a task is the given preference score. We must select an injective assignment from the set of volunteers to the set of four tasks so as to maximize the total weight.\n\nAn absolute upper bound on the maximum total score is obtained by summing, for each task, the highest score any volunteer has for that task. For the four tasks Campus Tour Guide, Information Desk, Workshop Assistant, and Welcome Booth, the respective maximal scores across volunteers are:\n- Campus Tour Guide: $\\max\\{8,6,7,5,9\\}=9$ (Emily),\n- Information Desk: $\\max\\{5,9,8,7,6\\}=9$ (Ben),\n- Workshop Assistant: $\\max\\{7,5,6,8,7\\}=8$ (David),\n- Welcome Booth: $\\max\\{9,8,7,6,4\\}=9$ (Alex).\n\nTherefore, the sum of these per-task maxima is $9+9+8+9=35$, which is an upper bound on the achievable total.\n\nWe now verify feasibility by checking whether these maxima can be realized simultaneously without conflicts in volunteers or tasks. Assign:\n- Emily to Campus Tour Guide with score $9$,\n- Ben to Information Desk with score $9$,\n- David to Workshop Assistant with score $8$,\n- Alex to Welcome Booth with score $9$.\n\nThese assignments use four distinct volunteers (Alex, Ben, David, Emily) and all four distinct tasks, so this is a feasible assignment. Its total score equals the upper bound $35$, hence it is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible total preference score is $35$.",

            "problem": "A consultancy firm needs to schedule its four auditors, denoted $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$, to visit four corporate branches, $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4$, over a period of four consecutive months.\n\nThe schedule must satisfy two main constraints:\n1. In any given month, each branch must be visited by exactly one auditor, and each auditor must be assigned to a different branch.\n2. Over the full four-month period, each auditor must visit each of the four branches exactly once.\n\nThe cost of travel for an auditor moving from branch $B_i$ to branch $B_j$ between any two consecutive months is given by the cost matrix $C$, where $C_{ij}$ is the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column. The travel cost from a branch to itself is considered infinite.\n\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\infty & 10 & 25 & 22 \\\\\n12 & \\infty & 15 & 18 \\\\\n20 & 13 & \\infty & 16 \\\\\n21 & 17 & 19 & \\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe scheduling is performed sequentially. For the first month, the assignment is fixed: Auditor $A_i$ is assigned to Branch $B_i$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. For each of the subsequent months, month 2 and month 3, the assignment is chosen to minimize the total travel cost for the transition from the previous month, while adhering to all scheduling constraints. The assignment for the final month (month 4) is then uniquely determined by the remaining unvisited branches for each auditor.\n\nCalculate the total travel cost for the entire four-month schedule.

            "solution": "Let the month-1 assignment be fixed as $P_1(i)=i$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, where $P_1(i)$ is the branch for auditor $A_i$. For month 2, we must choose a derangement $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ minimizing $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} C_{i, \\sigma(i)}$, since staying at the same branch has infinite cost and violates the overall constraint that each auditor visits each branch exactly once.\n\nEnumerating all 9 derangements and their costs:\n- $(1\\,2)(3\\,4)$: $C_{12}+C_{21}+C_{34}+C_{43}=10+12+16+19=57$.\n- $(1\\,3)(2\\,4)$: $C_{13}+C_{31}+C_{24}+C_{42}=25+20+18+17=80$.\n- $(1\\,4)(2\\,3)$: $C_{14}+C_{41}+C_{23}+C_{32}=22+21+15+13=71$.\n- $(1\\,2\\,3\\,4)$: $C_{12}+C_{23}+C_{34}+C_{41}=10+15+16+21=62$.\n- $(1\\,2\\,4\\,3)$: $C_{12}+C_{24}+C_{43}+C_{31}=10+18+19+20=67$.\n- $(1\\,3\\,2\\,4)$: $C_{13}+C_{32}+C_{24}+C_{41}=25+13+18+21=77$.\n- $(1\\,3\\,4\\,2)$: $C_{13}+C_{34}+C_{42}+C_{21}=25+16+17+12=70$.\n- $(1\\,4\\,2\\,3)$: $C_{14}+C_{42}+C_{23}+C_{31}=22+17+15+20=74$.\n- $(1\\,4\\,3\\,2)$: $C_{14}+C_{43}+C_{32}+C_{21}=22+19+13+12=66$.\n\nThe minimum is $57$, attained by $\\sigma_2=(1\\,2)(3\\,4)$.

The current branches are: $A_1$ at $B_2$, $A_2$ at $B_1$, $A_3$ at $B_4$, $A_4$ at $B_3$. The allowed destinations and corresponding travel costs are:\n- $A_1$ (at $B_2$): allowed $\\{B_3, B_4\\}$ with costs $C_{23}=15$, $C_{24}=18$.\n- $A_2$ (at $B_1$): allowed $\\{B_3, B_4\\}$ with costs $C_{13}=25$, $C_{14}=22$.\n- $A_3$ (at $B_4$): allowed $\\{B_1, B_2\\}$ with costs $C_{41}=21$, $C_{42}=17$.\n- $A_4$ (at $B_3$): allowed $\\{B_1, B_2\\}$ with costs $C_{31}=20$, $C_{32}=13$.\n\nThis splits into two independent $2\\times 2$ assignment problems:\n- For branches $\\{B_3, B_4\\}$: choose between ($A_1 \\to B_3, A_2 \\to B_4$) with cost $15+22=37$ and ($A_1 \\to B_4, A_2 \\to B_3$) with cost $18+25=43$. The minimum is $37$, so $A_1 \\to B_3$, $A_2 \\to B_4$.\n- For branches $\\{B_1, B_2\\}$: choose between ($A_3 \\to B_1, A_4 \\to B_2$) with cost $21+13=34$ and ($A_3 \\to B_2, A_4 \\to B_1$) with cost $17+20=37$. The minimum is $34$, so $A_3 \\to B_1$, $A_4 \\to B_2$.\n\nThus the month-3 assignment $P_3$ is $1 \\mapsto 3$, $2 \\mapsto 4$, $3 \\mapsto 1$, $4 \\mapsto 2$. The month-2 to month-3 cost is $C_{23}+C_{14}+C_{41}+C_{32}=15+22+21+13=71$.\n\nFor month 4, each auditor takes the unique remaining unvisited branch. The moves are:\n- $A_1$: remaining branch is $B_4$, so move $B_3 \\to B_4$ costing $C_{34}=16$.\n- $A_2$: remaining branch is $B_3$, so move $B_4 \\to B_3$ costing $C_{43}=19$.\n- $A_3$: remaining branch is $B_2$, so move $B_1 \\to B_2$ costing $C_{12}=10$.\n- $A_4$: remaining branch is $B_1$, so move $B_2 \\to B_1$ costing $C_{21}=12$.\n\nHence the month-3 to month-4 cost is $16+19+10+12=57$.\n\nTherefore, the total travel cost over the four-month schedule is\n$$\n57+71+57=185.\n$$",
