For a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$, the basic Simpson's rule approximation, which we will call the coarse approximation $S_1$, is given by:\n$$S_1 = \\frac{b-a}{6} \\left[ f(a) + 4f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + f(b) \\right]$$\nThis calculation requires evaluating the function at three points: the endpoints $a$ and $b$, and the midpoint $c = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\nThe core of an adaptive strategy involves a refinement step.
