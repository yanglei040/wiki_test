Many practical constraints, such as a device needing to be within the range of a sensor, can be described by a Euclidean norm inequality. This exercise provides foundational practice in translating such an intuitive geometric constraint into the standard algebraic form of an SOCP, a crucial first step for formulating real-world problems for powerful optimization solvers.
