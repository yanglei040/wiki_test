            "introduction": "Every journey in integer programming using cutting planes begins with a crucial first step: solving the linear programming (LP) relaxation. This involves temporarily ignoring the integer constraints to find the optimal solution in the continuous space, which provides a theoretical upper bound for our true integer solution. This practice  will guide you through setting up and solving the LP relaxation for a practical resource allocation problem, giving us the fractional starting point that the cutting-plane method aims to refine.",

            "problem": "A computer science student is working on a project to train two different types of machine learning models for a competition: a Classifier model and a Generator model. The student aims to maximize a total 'performance score' based on the models they successfully train.\n\nThe student's resources are limited by Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) time and available data storage.\n- Each Classifier model trained gives a performance score of 8 points.\n- Each Generator model trained gives a performance score of 5 points.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n1.  **GPU Time**: Training a Classifier model requires 2 hours of GPU time, while a Generator model requires 1 hour. The student has a total of 16 hours of GPU time available.\n2.  **Data Storage**: Training a Classifier model consumes 3 terabytes (TB) of data, while a Generator model consumes 5 TB. The student has a total of 40 TB of data available.\n\nThe number of models of each type must, in reality, be an integer. However, to establish a theoretical upper limit for the project's performance, the student first analyzes a relaxed scenario where fractional models can be trained (e.g., by running a training process to partial completion).\n\nUnder this assumption of potentially fractional models, what is the maximum possible total performance score the student can achieve?

The candidate vertices are the axis intercepts and the intersection of the two constraint lines. The axis intercepts are:\n- With $G=0$: from $2C \\le 16$ we have $C \\le 8$, and from $3C \\le 40$ we have $C \\le \\frac{40}{3}$.
