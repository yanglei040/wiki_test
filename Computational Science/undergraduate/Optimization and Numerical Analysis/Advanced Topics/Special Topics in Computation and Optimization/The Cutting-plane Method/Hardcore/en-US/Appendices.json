            "introduction": "The cutting-plane method begins not with cutting, but with finding something to cut. This initial exercise establishes the essential first step: relaxing the integer constraints and solving the resulting Linear Program (LP) to find a fractional optimal solution. Mastering this step is key, as this 'relaxed optimum' provides the upper bound for the true integer solution and is the very point our future cuts will target .",

            "problem": "A computer science student is working on a project to train two different types of machine learning models for a competition: a Classifier model and a Generator model. The student aims to maximize a total 'performance score' based on the models they successfully train.\n\nThe student's resources are limited by Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) time and available data storage.\n- Each Classifier model trained gives a performance score of 8 points.\n- Each Generator model trained gives a performance score of 5 points.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n1.  **GPU Time**: Training a Classifier model requires 2 hours of GPU time, while a Generator model requires 1 hour. The student has a total of 16 hours of GPU time available.\n2.  **Data Storage**: Training a Classifier model consumes 3 terabytes (TB) of data, while a Generator model consumes 5 TB. The student has a total of 40 TB of data available.\n\nThe number of models of each type must, in reality, be an integer. However, to establish a theoretical upper limit for the project's performance, the student first analyzes a relaxed scenario where fractional models can be trained (e.g., by running a training process to partial completion).\n\nUnder this assumption of potentially fractional models, what is the maximum possible total performance score the student can achieve?

The candidate vertices are the axis intercepts and the intersection of the two constraint lines. The axis intercepts are:\n- With $G=0$: from $2C \\le 16$ we have $C \\le 8$, and from $3C \\le 40$ we have $C \\le \\frac{40}{3}$.
