For many functions, especially in economics and engineering, ensuring convexity is crucial because it guarantees that a local-minimum is also a global-minimum. This practice provides a direct link between the convexity of a multivariable quadratic function and the mathematical property of its Hessian matrix being positive semidefinite, a cornerstone of SDP .",

            "problem": "The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem in graph theory seeks to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint sets, say $S_1$ and $S_2$, such that the sum of the weights of the edges connecting a vertex in $S_1$ to a vertex in $S_2$ is maximized. While this problem is computationally difficult for general graphs, approximation methods exist.\n\nOne approach involves formulating the problem algebraically. For a graph with vertices $V = \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$ and weighted edges $(i,j)$ with weight $w_{ij}$, we can assign a variable $y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ to each vertex $i$. A partition is then defined by which vertices are assigned $+1$ and which are assigned $-1$.

Instead of using discrete scalar variables $y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, we associate each vertex $i$ with a continuous vector variable $v_i$ in a higher-dimensional space. The only constraint on an individual vector is that it must be a unit vector, i.e., $v_i \\cdot v_i = 1$. The product of scalars $y_i y_j$ is replaced by the dot product of vectors $v_i \\cdot v_j$.
