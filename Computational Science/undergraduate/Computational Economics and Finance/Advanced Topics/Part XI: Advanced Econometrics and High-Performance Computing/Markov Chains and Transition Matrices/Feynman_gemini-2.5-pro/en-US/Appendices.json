            "solution": "The problem is to determine the expected number of years until a firm, currently at credit rating $\\text{A}$, defaults. This is a classic problem of calculating the expected time to absorption in a discrete-time, time-homogeneous Markov chain.\n\nLet the state space of the Markov chain be $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6, s_7, s_8\\}$, where $s_1 = \\text{AAA}$, $s_2 = \\text{AA}$, $s_3 = \\text{A}$, $s_4 = \\text{BBB}$, $s_5 = \\text{BB}$, $s_6 = \\text{B}$, $s_7 = \\text{CCC}$, and $s_8 = \\text{D}$ (default).

The expected time from state $s_i$ is one year plus the expected future time from the state $s_j$ reached after that year, averaged over all possible next states $s_j$. This is formulated as:\n$$ \\mu_i = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{8} P_{ij} \\mu_j $$\nwhere $P_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$ in one step.\n\nFrom the provided transition matrix $P$:\nFor any non-default, non-CCC rating (i.e., for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 6\\}$), the firm either remains in state $s_i$ with probability $0.5$ or is downgraded to state $s_{i+1}$ with probability $0.5$. The transition probabilities are $P_{ii} = 0.5$, $P_{i,i+1} = 0.5$, and $P_{ij} = 0$ for all other $j$.

The two periods are intended to reflect $1980$–$2000$ and $2001$–$2021$, but for this assignment you must use only the provided test cases, which are synthetic yet financially plausible return sequences expressed as decimal returns. A three-state Markov chain is used with states $\\{\\text{Loss}, \\text{Flat}, \\text{Gain}\\}$ defined by classifying each return $r_t$ according to a symmetric band threshold $\\tau > 0$ as follows: $\\text{Loss}$ if $r_t  -\\tau$, $\\text{Flat}$ if $|r_t| \\le \\tau$, and $\\text{Gain}$ if $r_t > \\tau$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a statistical test to determine if the transition dynamics of an equity market, modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain, have changed between two periods.

The core of this model is the transition probability matrix $P^{(m)} = [p_{ij}^{(m)}]$, where $p_{ij}^{(m)}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $S_i$ to state $S_j$ in period $m$. The first step is to estimate these matrices. For each period $m$, we construct a $3 \\times 3$ transition count matrix $N^{(m)} = [n_{ij}^{(m)}]$, where $n_{ij}^{(m)}$ is the observed number of transitions from state $S_i$ to $S_j$. The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for the transition probability $p_{ij}^{(m)}$ is given by the ratio of observed transition counts:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{ij}^{(m)} = \\frac{n_{ij}^{(m)}}{N_i^{(m)}}\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad\nN_i^{(m)} = \\sum_{j=0}^{2} n_{ij}^{(m)}\n$$\nThis estimation is performed for each origin state $S_i$ where the total number of outgoing transitions $N_i^{(m)}$ is greater than zero.\n\nThe primary objective is to test the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the transition matrices for the two periods are identical, against the alternative hypothesis $H_A$ that they are not:\n$$\nH_0: P^{(1)} = P^{(2)} \\qquad \\text{vs.} \\qquad H_A: P^{(1)} \\neq P^{(2)}\n$$\nThis is a test for the homogeneity of two Markov chains. As transitions from a given state $S_i$ follow a multinomial distribution, the problem simplifies to testing the homogeneity of multinomial distributions for each row $i$ of the transition matrices. The standard procedure for this is the Anderson-Goodman test, which is based on the likelihood-ratio principle.\n\nThe test statistic is calculated row by row for each origin state $S_i$. A row $i$ is included in the test only if it has been observed as an origin state in both periods, i.e., $N_i^{(1)} > 0$ and $N_i^{(2)} > 0$. For each such valid row $i$, we compute a likelihood-ratio test statistic $G_i^2$. The total test statistic $G^2$ is the sum of these individual statistics:\n$$\nG^2 = \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } N_i^{(1)}>0, N_i^{(2)}>0} G_i^2\n$$\nThe statistic $G_i^2$ for row $i$ compares the likelihood of the data under the alternative hypothesis (separate probabilities $\\hat{p}_{ij}^{(1)}$ and $\\hat{p}_{ij}^{(2)}$) with the likelihood under the null hypothesis (a common, pooled probability $\\hat{p}_{ij}^{\\text{pool}}$). The pooled probability estimate is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{ij}^{\\text{pool}} = \\frac{n_{ij}^{(1)} + n_{ij}^{(2)}}{N_i^{(1)} + N_i^{(2)}} = \\frac{n_{ij}^{\\text{pool}}}{N_i^{\\text{pool}}}\n$$\nThe likelihood-ratio statistic for row $i$ is given by:\n$$\nG_i^2 = 2 \\sum_{m=1}^{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{2} n_{ij}^{(m)} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p}_{ij}^{(m)}}{\\hat{p}_{ij}^{\\text{pool}}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere terms with $n_{ij}^{(m)} = 0$ are treated as zero. For computational stability, this can be expressed using sums of $n \\log n$ terms:\n$$\nG_i^2 = 2 \\left( \\sum_{m,j} n_{ij}^{(m)}\\log n_{ij}^{(m)} - \\sum_{m} N_i^{(m)}\\log N_i^{(m)} - \\sum_{j} n_{ij}^{\\text{pool}}\\log n_{ij}^{\\text{pool}} + N_i^{\\text{pool}}\\log N_i^{\\text{pool}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere each sum is over terms with non-zero counts.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, the total statistic $G^2$ follows a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distribution. The degrees of freedom ($df$) for the test is the sum of the degrees of freedom from each valid row. For each included row $i$, we are comparing two multinomial distributions with $K=3$ categories, which contributes $K-1=2$ degrees of freedom. Thus, the total degrees of freedom is $df = 2 \\times (\\text{number of valid rows})$. If no rows are valid for comparison, $df=0$, the test is undefined, and we conclude there is no significant evidence of change.\n\nFinally, a decision is made by comparing the calculated p-value with the given significance level $\\alpha_k$. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, assuming $H_0$ is true:\n$$\np\\text{-value} = P(\\chi^2_{df} \\ge G^2)\n$$\nThe null hypothesis is rejected if and only if the p-value is strictly less than $\\alpha_k$. Rejection implies a statistically significant change in market dynamics. The program returns `True` if the change is significant and `False` otherwise.",
