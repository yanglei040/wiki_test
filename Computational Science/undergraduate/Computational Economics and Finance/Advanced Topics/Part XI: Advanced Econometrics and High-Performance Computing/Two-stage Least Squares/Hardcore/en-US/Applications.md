## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles of Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) extend far beyond the abstract statistical framework in which they are often introduced. Having established the mechanics of 2SLS in the previous chapter, we now turn to its application. This chapter explores how the core logic of [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324) (IV) is deployed across a diverse range of fields to untangle correlation from causation. The power of 2SLS is not merely in its statistical properties but in its ability to harness sources of quasi-random variation—often termed "natural experiments"—to identify causal effects in complex, non-experimental settings. We will journey through applications in economics, finance, public policy, and even biology, demonstrating the remarkable versatility of this econometric tool. The goal is not to re-teach the method, but to build an intuitive understanding of its utility by examining how researchers creatively find and apply valid instruments to answer fundamental questions.

### Core Applications in Economics and Finance

The genesis of [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324) is deeply rooted in economics, where an inability to run controlled experiments is the norm. From estimating fundamental market parameters to assessing the impact of corporate policies, 2SLS is an indispensable part of the empirical economist's toolkit.

#### Identifying Supply and Demand

A classic problem in econometrics is the identification of supply and demand curves. When we observe market data on prices ($P$) and quantities ($Q$), we are observing a series of equilibrium points, each resulting from the intersection of a supply and a demand curve. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression of quantity on price (or vice-versa) fails to estimate either curve, as any unobserved factor that shifts the demand curve (e.g., a change in consumer tastes) will affect both equilibrium price and quantity, inducing [endogeneity](@entry_id:142125). The same is true for unobserved factors that shift the supply curve (e.g., a change in input costs).

To identify the demand curve, we need an instrument that exogenously shifts the supply curve but does not directly affect demand. For instance, in the context of the air travel market, a pilot strike at a major airline serves as a powerful supply-side shock. The strike reduces the supply of flights, causing industry-wide prices to rise, but it does not directly alter consumers' underlying desire to travel. By using the strike event as an instrument for ticket prices, researchers can isolate the variation in price that is due to this supply shock and use it to trace out the slope of the demand curve, thereby estimating the price elasticity of demand. A crucial diagnostic in this process is the first-stage $F$-statistic, which tests the relevance of the instrument; a strong instrument, such as a major strike, will have a high F-statistic, giving us confidence in the resulting 2SLS estimates.

Conversely, to identify the supply curve, one needs an instrument that exogenously shifts the demand curve. Consider the market for electricity. Daily demand is highly sensitive to weather, while the supply curve is primarily determined by the generating capacity and fuel costs of power plants. An unexpected heatwave acts as a powerful demand-shifter; it increases consumers' desire for electricity to power air conditioning, but it does not directly alter the cost structure of [power generation](@entry_id:146388). Therefore, an unexpected temperature shock can serve as a valid instrument for electricity quantity (or price) to identify the parameters of the inverse supply function. By simulating such a market system, one can demonstrate how 2SLS successfully recovers the true structural parameters, whereas OLS, contaminated by the simultaneous determination of price and quantity, produces biased estimates.

#### Causal Inference in Finance

Financial markets are characterized by a web of interconnected variables, making causal inference particularly challenging. 2SLS provides a means to dissect these relationships by leveraging institutional details, policy changes, and technological quirks as sources of exogenous variation.

In corporate finance, a central question is whether good corporate citizenship, often measured by an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score, causally improves firm value or lowers its cost of capital. A simple correlation is uninformative, as well-managed, profitable firms may simply have the resources to invest in ESG initiatives. To establish causality, one could instrument a firm's ESG score with the political affiliation of the state where it is headquartered. The logic is that state-level political culture and local regulations may exogenously influence a firm's ESG practices, but are less likely to have a direct, independent effect on its access to global capital markets, other than through the firm's own characteristics and actions. This strategy allows researchers to isolate the causal impact of ESG scores on the cost of capital. Similarly, to study whether managerial short-termism causally reduces long-term investment like RD, one might use features of the CEO's compensation contract, such as the fraction of stock options vesting in the near future. Because these vesting schedules are often determined years in the past, they can serve as a predetermined instrument that influences a manager's current focus without being a direct consequence of the firm's present RD opportunities.

In [asset pricing](@entry_id:144427), 2SLS is used to test foundational theories. For example, the "value premium"—the empirical finding that firms with high book-to-market ratios have historically earned higher stock returns—is a cornerstone of [asset pricing](@entry_id:144427). To test whether this relationship is causal, one needs an instrument that affects book-to-market ratios without directly influencing returns. A change in accounting standards that arbitrarily re-values certain assets on a firm's balance sheet can provide such an instrument. Such a regulatory change exogenously alters the book value of equity, and thus the book-to-market ratio, for reasons unrelated to the firm's underlying economic prospects, allowing for a 2SLS estimate of the causal effect of the value factor on returns. Another application is estimating the liquidity premium in bond yields. Market-wide liquidity is endogenous to yields. However, unexpected open market operations by a central bank, like the Federal Reserve, can serve as an exogenous shock to overall market liquidity. Using these [monetary policy](@entry_id:143839) surprises as an instrument allows for the identification of the causal premium that investors demand for holding less liquid bonds.

The field of [market microstructure](@entry_id:136709) also benefits from clever [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324). To assess the causal impact of [high-frequency trading](@entry_id:137013) (HFT) on market volatility, researchers face the issue that HFT activity ramps up during volatile periods, making correlation uninformative. A powerful instrument is the physical distance, measured in milliseconds of light travel, between a trading firm's servers and the exchange's matching engine. This proximity is a crucial determinant of a firm's ability to engage in HFT, but it is unlikely to have any direct effect on market-wide volatility other than through the HFT activity it enables. This allows for a credible 2SLS estimate of the causal effect. In such studies, particularly when multiple instruments are available (e.g., proximity to different exchanges), the Sargan test of [overidentifying restrictions](@entry_id:147186) can be used to test the crucial assumption that all instruments are indeed exogenous.

### Interdisciplinary Connections: 2SLS in the Social and Natural Sciences

The logic of [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324) is universal, and its application has spread to nearly every empirical discipline. The search for credible natural experiments is a unifying theme in modern quantitative science.

#### Program Evaluation and Policy Analysis

Evaluating the effectiveness of social programs and government policies is complicated by self-selection: individuals who choose to participate in a program are often systematically different from those who do not. 2SLS is a primary method for overcoming this bias.

In education economics, a perennial question is whether reducing class size improves student performance. Comparing schools with small and large classes is misleading, as smaller classes may be found in wealthier districts with other unobserved advantages. A famous identification strategy uses quasi-random fluctuations in cohort size, such as a "baby boom echo," as an instrument for class size. A larger-than-usual cohort of students entering kindergarten in a given year forces schools to increase class sizes or hire more teachers for reasons unrelated to the underlying abilities of that student cohort. This demographic variation provides an exogenous shock to class size, enabling a 2SLS estimate of its causal effect on test scores.

In the economics of crime, researchers study the effect of incarceration length on recidivism. Comparing offenders who receive long and short sentences is biased because judges may assign longer sentences to individuals they perceive as higher-risk. A brilliant solution is to use the quasi-random assignment of cases to judges as an instrument. If judges vary in their average leniency, but are otherwise randomly assigned cases, then the identity of the judge assigned to a case is an exogenous shock to the expected sentence length. This "judge leniency" instrument allows for a 2SLS estimate of the causal effect of sentence length on subsequent criminal behavior.

In [environmental economics](@entry_id:192101), 2SLS is crucial for evaluating policies like Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). Suppose a program offers payments to landowners to not deforest their land, but eligibility is restricted to parcels with a "Conservation Priority Score" above a certain cutoff, $c$. Because enrollment is voluntary, simply comparing enrolled and non-enrolled parcels is biased. This scenario is a prime example of a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (FRD) design, which can be estimated using 2SLS. The instrument is an [indicator variable](@entry_id:204387) for being eligible ($S_i \ge c$). This instrument discontinuously increases the probability of treatment at the cutoff but is assumed to have no other direct effect on deforestation, an assumption justified if the score was not manipulable by landowners and no other policies changed at the same threshold. This 2SLS strategy identifies the causal effect of the PES program for the subpopulation of landowners at the margin of eligibility who are induced to enroll by the program.

#### Technology, Society, and Politics

The diffusion of new technologies and the impacts of political events are often studied using 2SLS, with instruments drawn from historical accidents or staggered rollouts.

For example, to study the causal effect of social media usage on mental well-being, one can exploit the unique historical rollout of Facebook. The platform was initially launched at Harvard and then gradually expanded to other college campuses over several years. This staggered rollout provides a valid instrument: the timing of Facebook's arrival at a particular campus is an exogenous determinant of student social media usage but is unlikely to be correlated with other concurrent trends in student mental health. This design allows researchers to estimate the causal impact of this transformative technology.

In a similar vein, to analyze the effect of internet penetration on political polarization, one could use the historical layout of telephone lines from the early 20th century as an instrument. The cost of rolling out modern broadband internet was lower in areas that already had dense legacy infrastructure. This historical layout is plausibly uncorrelated with modern political attitudes, except through its influence on the spread of the internet. This provides an exogenous source of variation in internet access to identify its causal effect on political outcomes.

In political economy, researchers might ask if corporate lobbying causally results in lower effective tax rates. The [endogeneity](@entry_id:142125) is obvious. A potential instrument comes from the political process itself. The unexpected retirement or death of a key congressional committee chair who is favorable to a particular industry represents an exogenous shock to the effectiveness of that industry's lobbying efforts. This political shock can be used as an instrument for lobbying expenditures to identify their causal effect on firm-specific tax benefits.

#### Mendelian Randomization: Causal Inference in Biology and Medicine

Perhaps the most impactful interdisciplinary application of 2SLS is Mendelian Randomization (MR). In MR, the random assortment of genetic variants (like Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs) from parents to offspring during meiosis is used as a natural experiment to instrument for modifiable exposures (e.g., biomarkers) and test their causal effect on a disease outcome.

The logic is a direct translation of the IV principles. Consider testing whether a specific transcription factor's expression level ($X$) causally affects a target gene's expression ($Y$). The relationship may be confounded by unobserved cellular factors ($U$). If a genetic variant ($Z$) is known to influence the expression of the transcription factor ($X$) but has no other pathway to affect the target gene ($Y$) (i.e., no [horizontal pleiotropy](@entry_id:269508)), then $Z$ is a valid instrument. The allele dosage of the SNP can be used in a 2SLS framework to estimate the causal effect $\beta$ of $X$ on $Y$, free from the influence of the confounder $U$.

MR designs can become highly sophisticated to address complex biological realities. Consider testing the "fetal origins" hypothesis: does higher maternal glucose during pregnancy ($X$) causally increase her offspring's adult risk of Type 2 Diabetes ($Y$)? A simple MR using the mother's glucose-associated genes ($Z_m$) as an instrument for her glucose level ($X$) is flawed. The mother passes half of her genes to the offspring, so the instrument $Z_m$ is also correlated with the offspring's own genetic risk ($Z_o$), which directly affects their adult [diabetes](@entry_id:153042) status. This violates the [exclusion restriction](@entry_id:142409). A brilliant solution that uses data from mother-father-offspring trios is to use the mother's *non-transmitted alleles* as the instrument. These alleles are part of the mother's genome and are thus correlated with her glucose level ($X$), satisfying the relevance condition. However, because they are by definition not passed to the offspring, they cannot directly affect the offspring's phenotype, satisfying the [exclusion restriction](@entry_id:142409). This elegant design, implemented with 2SLS while controlling for the offspring's genotype, can isolate the true intrauterine causal effect and demonstrates the profound depth of the [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324) approach.

### Conclusion

As this chapter has demonstrated, the Two-Stage Least Squares estimator is far more than a statistical curiosity. It is a unifying framework for causal inference that empowers researchers across the quantitative sciences. From identifying the elasticity of demand for electricity to estimating the causal effect of a gene on a disease, the underlying logic remains the same: find a source of variation that is "as good as random" and use it to isolate a specific causal pathway. The intellectual challenge—and the art of modern empirical work—lies in the creative and rigorous identification of these [instrumental variables](@entry_id:142324) in the complex, uncontrolled systems that define our world.
