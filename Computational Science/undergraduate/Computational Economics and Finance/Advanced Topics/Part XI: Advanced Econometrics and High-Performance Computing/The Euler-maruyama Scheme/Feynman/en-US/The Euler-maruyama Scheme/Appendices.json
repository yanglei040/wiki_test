            "problem": "Consider the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a model often used in finance and physics to describe mean-reverting systems. The evolution of this process is governed by the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):\n$$dX_t = -\\lambda X_t dt + \\sigma dW_t$$\nwhere $X_t$ is the value of the process at time $t$, $\\lambda > 0$ is the rate of mean reversion, $\\sigma$ is the volatility parameter, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion).\n\nTo approximate the solution numerically, one common method is the Euler-Maruyama scheme. For a general SDE of the form $dX_t = a(X_t, t)dt + b(X_t, t)dW_t$, one step of the Euler-Maruyama approximation from time $t_i$ to $t_{i+1} = t_i + \\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\\hat{X}_{t_{i+1}} = \\hat{X}_{t_i} + a(\\hat{X}_{t_i}, t_i)\\Delta t + b(\\hat{X}_{t_i}, t_i)\\Delta W_i$$\nwhere $\\Delta W_i = W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i}$ is an increment of the Wiener process.

The SDE is therefore:\n$$dX_t = -X_t dt + dW_t$$\nComparing this to the general form $dX_t = a(X_t, t)dt + b(X_t, t)dW_t$, we can identify the drift coefficient $a(X_t, t) = -X_t$ and the diffusion coefficient $b(X_t, t) = 1$.

Multiplying by $\\Delta t^\\star$, we get:\n$$\n2 C_2 (\\Delta t^\\star)^2 = C_1 T K^{-1} (\\Delta t^\\star)^{-1}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\n2 (B^\\star)^2 = V^\\star\n$$\nAt the optimum, the variance contribution is twice the squared bias contribution. They are not equal.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If the variance scales like $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})$ and the weak discretization error scales like $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$, then under the fixed budget $K$ the minimal achievable MSE scales like $\\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$.\nThe premise of this statement is consistent with the problem setup, where \"weak discretization error\" scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ corresponds to the weak order $p=1$, and thus a squared bias of $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$. Let us compute the minimal MSE, $E^\\star = E(\\Delta t^\\star)$:\n$$\nE^\\star = V^\\star + (B^\\star)^2\n$$\nUsing the relation $V^\\star = 2(B^\\star)^2$, we have $E^\\star = 3(B^\\star)^2 = 3 C_2 (\\Delta t^\\star)^2$.\nSince we found that $\\Delta t^\\star \\propto K^{-1/3}$, the minimal MSE scales as:\n$$\nE^\\star \\propto (\\Delta t^\\star)^2 \\propto (K^{-1/3})^2 = K^{-2/3}\n$$\nThe minimal achievable MSE scales as $\\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. In estimating $\\mathbb{E}[f(X_T)]$ for smooth $f$, the strong convergence order of EM determines the discretization bias in the MSE; the weak order is irrelevant for this purpose.\nThe discretization bias in the MSE for the quantity $\\mathbb{E}[f(X_T)]$ is precisely the difference $\\mathbb{E}[f(\\hat{X}_T)] - \\mathbb{E}[f(X_T)]$, where $\\hat{X}_T$ is the numerical approximation at time $T$. The rate at which this difference converges to zero as $\\Delta t \\to 0$ is the definition of the weak order of convergence. The strong convergence order, on the other hand, concerns the pathwise error, characterized by quantities like $\\mathbb{E}[|X_T - \\hat{X}_T|]$. While strong convergence can provide an upper bound for the weak error, the weak convergence order gives the sharp rate for the bias of interest. For the Euler-Maruyama scheme, the weak order ($p=1$) is typically higher than the strong order ($\\gamma=0.5$), making it the more relevant and accurate measure for the bias in this context. The statement is fundamentally contrary to these definitions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
