            "problem": "A marketing analytics firm is using linear programming to determine the optimal allocation of a client's advertising budget. The goal is to maximize customer reach. The decision variables are $x_1$, the number of ad units purchased on social media, and $x_2$, the number of ad units purchased on search engines. The problem has been formulated as a standard maximization problem, and the initial simplex tableau is given below.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The constraints, while ultimately found to be contradictory (i.e., the feasible region is empty), are presented in a way that makes the question about the Phase I outcome meaningful. The purpose of Phase I is precisely to detect such infeasibility. The requirement to express the answer in grams is dimensionally consistent, as the artificial variable inherits the units of the constraint to which it is added.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem as a linear program. The decision variables are $x_1$ and $x_2$. The constraints are derived from the nutritional requirements.\n\nThe protein constraint is:\n$$5x_1 + 2x_2 \\geq 20$$\nThe sodium constraint is:\n$$4x_1 + 3x_2 \\leq 5$$\nThe non-negativity constraints are:\n$$x_1 \\geq 0, \\quad x_2 \\geq 0$$\n\nTo apply the simplex method, we must convert these inequalities into standard form (equations) by introducing slack and surplus variables.\nA surplus variable $s_1 \\geq 0$ is subtracted from the '$\\geq$' constraint:\n$$5x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 20$$\nA slack variable $s_2 \\geq 0$ is added to the '$\\leq$' constraint:\n$$4x_1 + 3x_2 + s_2 = 5$$\n\nThe resulting system is:\n$$5x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 20$$\n$$4x_1 + 3x_2 + s_2 = 5$$\n$$x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2 \\geq 0$$\n\nAn initial basic feasible solution is not immediately available. For the first equation, if we set the non-basic variables $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$, we get $-s_1=20$, or $s_1=-20$, which violates the non-negativity of $s_1$. Therefore, following a standard procedure for '$\\geq$' constraints, we introduce an artificial variable $a_1 \\geq 0$ into the first equation. The slack variable $s_2$ from the second equation can serve as a basic variable.\n\nThe system for the Phase I problem is:\n$$5x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 + a_1 = 20$$\n$$4x_1 + 3x_2 + s_2 = 5$$\n$$x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2, a_1 \\geq 0$$\n\nThe Phase I objective is to minimize the sum of artificial variables. Here, we have only one, so we minimize $w = a_1$. If the minimum value of $w$ is greater than zero, the original problem is infeasible.\n\nWe express the objective function $w$ in terms of the non-basic variables. From the first constraint:\n$$a_1 = 20 - 5x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1$$\nSo, the objective is to minimize $w = 20 - 5x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1$. This is equivalent to setting up the objective row in the simplex tableau. The initial basic variables are $a_1$ and $s_2$. The non-basic variables are $x_1$, $x_2$, and $s_1$.\n\nThe initial simplex tableau for the Phase I minimization problem is constructed as follows. The objective row ($z_j-c_j$) contains the coefficients of the objective function $w$ expressed in terms of non-basic variables. The objective is $w + 5x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 20$.\nCurrent basic solution: $x_1=0, x_2=0, s_1=0$, gives $a_1=20, s_2=5$. The initial objective value is $w=20$.\n\n**Initial Tableau:**\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & a_1 & s_2 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\na_1 & 0 & 5 & 2 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 20 \\\\\ns_2 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{obj} & 1 & 5 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$\nFor a minimization problem, we select the variable with the most positive coefficient in the objective row ($z_j - c_j$) to enter the basis. This is $x_1$, with a coefficient of $5$.\n\nTo determine the leaving variable, we perform the minimum ratio test:\nFor the $a_1$ row: $\\frac{20}{5} = 4$.\nFor the $s_2$ row: $\\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n\nThe minimum ratio is $1.25$, corresponding to the $s_2$ row. Thus, $s_2$ leaves the basis, and $x_1$ enters. The pivot element is $4$. We perform a pivot operation.\n\nFirst, divide the pivot row (row $s_2$) by the pivot element ($4$):\n$$R_{2, \\text{new}} = R_{2} / 4 \\implies [1, \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{4} | \\frac{5}{4}]$$\nThis is the new row for the basic variable $x_1$.\n\nNext, we update the other rows to have a zero in the pivot column.\nUpdate the $a_1$ row: $R_{1, \\text{new}} = R_1 - 5 \\times R_{2, \\text{new}}$\n$$R_{1, \\text{new}} = [5, 2, -1, 1, 0 | 20] - 5 \\times [1, \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{4} | \\frac{5}{4}]$$\n$$R_{1, \\text{new}} = [0, 2 - \\frac{15}{4}, -1, 1, -\\frac{5}{4} | 20 - \\frac{25}{4}] = [0, -\\frac{7}{4}, -1, 1, -\\frac{5}{4} | \\frac{55}{4}]$$\n\nUpdate the objective row: $R_{\\text{obj, new}} = R_{\\text{obj}} - 5 \\times R_{2, \\text{new}}$\n$$R_{\\text{obj, new}} = [5, 2, -1, 0, 0 | 20] - 5 \\times [1, \\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{4} | \\frac{5}{4}]$$\n$$R_{\\text{obj, new}} = [0, 2 - \\frac{15}{4}, -1, 0, -\\frac{5}{4} | 20 - \\frac{25}{4}] = [0, -\\frac{7}{4}, -1, 0, -\\frac{5}{4} | \\frac{55}{4}]$$\n\n**Tableau after one iteration:**\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & a_1 & s_2 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\na_1 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{7}{4} & -1 & 1 & -\\frac{5}{4} & \\frac{55}{4} \\\\\nx_1 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{3}{4} & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{5}{4} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{obj} & 1 & 0 & -\\frac{7}{4} & -1 & 0 & -\\frac{5}{4} & \\frac{55}{4}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe current basic solution is $a_1 = \\frac{55}{4}$, $x_1 = \\frac{5}{4}$. The objective value is $w = \\frac{55}{4}$.\nWe examine the objective row coefficients ($z_j-c_j$): $[0, -\\frac{7}{4}, -1, 0, -\\frac{5}{4}]$. All coefficients are less than or equal to zero. This satisfies the optimality condition for a minimization problem.\nTherefore, the simplex algorithm terminates.\n\nThe optimal (minimum) value of the Phase I objective function is $w^* = a_1 = \\frac{55}{4}$.\nSince $w^* > 0$, we conclude that the original problem has no feasible solution. The question, however, asks for the optimal value of the Phase I objective, which we have found.\n\nThe value is $\\frac{55}{4} = 13.75$. The artificial variable $a_1$ was added to the protein constraint, which is measured in grams. Thus, the value $a_1$ has units of grams. The minimum value of $a_1$ represents the minimum unavoidable deficit in meeting the protein requirement, given the other constraints. The maximum protein achievable under the sodium limit is $5(\\frac{5}{4}) + 2(0) = \\frac{25}{4}$ grams, which is $\\frac{55}{4}$ grams short of the required $20$ grams. This confirms the result.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the new optimal value of a linear programming (LP) objective function after a change in the right-hand side (RHS) of one of the constraints. This is a standard problem in sensitivity analysis.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information. The primal LP problem is:\nMaximize $z = c^T x$\nsubject to $Ax \\leq b$ and $x \\geq 0$,\nwhere $c = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$, $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $b = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe initial optimal solution is given as $x^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$, with an optimal objective value of $z^{\\star} = 32$.

This corresponds to a change in the RHS vector $b$. The original RHS vector is $b = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix}$. The new RHS vector is $b_{new} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix}$. The change in the RHS vector is $\\Delta b = b_{new} - b = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 7 \\\\ 11 - 11 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe fundamental principle of sensitivity analysis for RHS changes states that for a change $\\Delta b$ in the RHS vector, the new optimal objective value $z_{new}^{\\star}$ is given by $z_{new}^{\\star} = z^{\\star} + (y^{\\star})^T \\Delta b$, provided that the change $\\Delta b$ is small enough for the current basis to remain optimal.\n\nThe condition for the basis to remain optimal is that the new basic solution, $x_{B, new}$, must remain feasible (i.e., non-negative). The new basic solution is calculated as:\n$$x_{B, new} = B^{-1} b_{new}$$\nWe must verify that $x_{B, new} \\geq 0$. Let us perform this calculation.\n$$x_{B, new} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1, \\text{new}} \\\\ x_{2, \\text{new}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$= \\begin{pmatrix} (-1)(8) + (1)(11) \\\\ (2)(8) + (-1)(11) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 + 11 \\\\ 16 - 11 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSince $x_{1, \\text{new}} = 3 \\geq 0$ and $x_{2, \\text{new}} = 5 \\geq 0$, the new basic solution is feasible.
