This practice solidifies your understanding of these necessary conditions for optimality and demonstrates how a potential solution can fail if even one condition is not met .",

            "introduction": "Moving beyond verification, this next practice builds intuition about the meaning behind the KKT conditions. The problem presents a simple scenario where an unconstrained optimal choice is forbidden by a safety regulation, forcing the solution to lie on the boundary of the feasible region. This exercise beautifully illustrates the concept of an *active constraint* and provides insight into the economic interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier, $\\mu$, as the \"shadow price\" or cost imposed by the constraint .",

The cost associated with deviation from this target is modeled by the function $f(x) = (x-a)^2$. However, due to safety regulations, the parameter $x$ is constrained by the inequality $x \\le 1$.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the optimal operational parameter $x$ that minimizes the cost function subject to the safety regulation.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard convex optimization problem from microeconomic theory, specifically cost minimization. It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is valid and we proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum of the objective function $f(x, y) = w_{x} x + w_{y} y$ subject to a set of constraints. To apply the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, we first state the problem in the canonical form for a minimization problem, which is $\\min f(\\mathbf{z})$ subject to $g_i(\\mathbf{z}) \\le 0$ and $h_j(\\mathbf{z}) = 0$. In this case, we only have inequality constraints.\n\nThe objective function is $f(x, y) = w_{x} x + w_{y} y$.\nThe constraints are:\n$1$. $x \\ge 0$, which we rewrite as $g_1(x, y) = -x \\le 0$.\n$2$. $y \\ge 0$, which we rewrite as $g_2(x, y) = -y \\le 0$.\n$3$. $xy \\ge 1$, which we rewrite as $g_3(x, y) = 1 - xy \\le 0$.\n\nThe prices $w_x$ and $w_y$ are strictly positive, i.e., $w_x > 0$ and $w_y > 0$. The objective function $f(x,y)$ is linear and thus convex. The feasible set defined by the constraints is also a convex set. Therefore, the KKT conditions are both necessary and sufficient for a global minimum.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is formulated by associating a Lagrange multiplier (or KKT multiplier) $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ with each inequality constraint $g_i(x,y) \\le 0$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = f(x, y) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_i g_i(x, y)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = w_{x} x + w_{y} y - \\lambda_1 x - \\lambda_2 y + \\lambda_3 (1 - xy)\n$$\n\nThe KKT conditions are comprised of stationarity, primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness.\n\n$1$. **Stationarity**: The partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the decision variables must be zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = w_x - \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_3 y = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = w_y - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 x = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n$2$. **Primal Feasibility**: The original problem constraints must be satisfied.\n$$\n-x \\le 0 \\implies x \\ge 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\n$$\n-y \\le 0 \\implies y \\ge 0 \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\n1 - xy \\le 0 \\implies xy \\ge 1 \\quad (5)\n$$\n\n$3$. **Dual Feasibility**: The Lagrange multipliers for inequality constraints must be non-negative.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\ge 0 \\quad (6)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 \\ge 0 \\quad (7)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_3 \\ge 0 \\quad (8)\n$$\n\n$4$. **Complementary Slackness**: The product of each Lagrange multiplier and its corresponding constraint function must be zero.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 (-x) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 x = 0 \\quad (9)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 (-y) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_2 y = 0 \\quad (10)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_3 (1 - xy) = 0 \\quad (11)\n$$\n\nWe now solve this system. From the primal feasibility condition $(5)$, $xy \\ge 1$. Since $x$ and $y$ must also be non-negative from $(3)$ and $(4)$, it is impossible for either $x$ or $y$ to be zero. Thus, we must have $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\n\nFrom $x > 0$ and the complementary slackness condition $(9)$, $\\lambda_1 x = 0$, we conclude that $\\lambda_1 = 0$.\nSimilarly, from $y > 0$ and the complementary slackness condition $(10)$, $\\lambda_2 y = 0$, we conclude that $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$ into the stationarity equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ simplifies them to:\n$$\nw_x - \\lambda_3 y = 0 \\implies w_x = \\lambda_3 y \\quad (1')\n$$\n$$\nw_y - \\lambda_3 x = 0 \\implies w_y = \\lambda_3 x \\quad (2')\n$$\n\nSince $w_x > 0$, $w_y > 0$, $x > 0$, and $y > 0$, equations $(1')$ and $(2')$ imply that $\\lambda_3$ must be strictly positive, i.e., $\\lambda_3 > 0$.\n\nNow, we use the complementary slackness condition $(11)$, $\\lambda_3 (1 - xy) = 0$. Since we have established that $\\lambda_3 > 0$, it must be that $1 - xy = 0$, which means the production constraint is binding:\n$$\nxy = 1 \\quad (12)\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of three equations with three unknowns ($x$, $y$, $\\lambda_3$):\na) $w_x = \\lambda_3 y$\nb) $w_y = \\lambda_3 x$\nc) $xy = 1$\n\nFrom (a) and (b), we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $\\lambda_3$:\n$$\ny = \\frac{w_x}{\\lambda_3}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{w_y}{\\lambda_3}\n$$\nSubstitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into equation (c):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{w_y}{\\lambda_3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{w_x}{\\lambda_3}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{w_x w_y}{\\lambda_3^2} = 1 \\implies \\lambda_3^2 = w_x w_y\n$$\nSince $\\lambda_3 > 0$, we take the positive root:\n$$\n\\lambda_3 = \\sqrt{w_x w_y}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this value of $\\lambda_3$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{w_y}{\\sqrt{w_x w_y}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w_y^2}{w_x w_y}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w_y}{w_x}}\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{w_x}{\\sqrt{w_x w_y}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w_x^2}{w_x w_y}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w_x}{w_y}}\n$$\nThe point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the KKT conditions for this problem is therefore uniquely determined by the input prices $w_x$ and $w_y$. All KKT conditions are satisfied by this point, and due to the convexity of the problem, this point is the global cost-minimum.",
