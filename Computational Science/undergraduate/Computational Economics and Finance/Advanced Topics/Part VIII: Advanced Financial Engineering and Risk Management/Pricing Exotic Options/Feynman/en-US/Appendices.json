            "introduction": "The standard binomial model provides a powerful framework for pricing options, but real-world assets often require us to adapt these tools for features like discrete dividends. This modification is especially critical for American-style options, as the stock price drop on an ex-dividend date can create a strong incentive for early exercise. This practice () challenges you to implement a modified binomial tree that correctly accounts for these dividend payments, a crucial skill for accurate valuation.",

            "problem": "You must write a complete, runnable program that prices an American call option on an underlying asset paying a known stream of discrete cash dividends using a modified binomial tree that accounts for the stock price drop on ex-dividend dates. The model is specified in purely mathematical terms and must be implemented exactly as stated.\n\nThe foundational base is the no-arbitrage principle under the risk-neutral measure and the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein (CRR) binomial model for the underlying’s pre-dividend dynamics. Time is discretized into $N$ equal steps of length $\\Delta t = T/N$. Let the continuously compounded risk-free rate be $r$, volatility be $\\sigma$, and initial price be $S_0$. Define the multiplicative up and down factors and the risk-neutral probability as:\n- $u = e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$,\n- $d = 1/u$,\n- $p = \\dfrac{e^{r \\Delta t} - d}{u - d}$.\n\nConstruct a recombining stock price grid for the pre-dividend process:\n- $S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) = S_0 \\, u^i \\, d^{j-i}$ for time index $j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N\\}$ and node index $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,j\\}$.\n\nIncorporate each discrete dividend as an exogenous cash amount $D_j$ paid at specific grid-aligned ex-dividend times $t_j = j \\Delta t$. If a dividend of amount $D$ occurs at time $\\tau$, it will be aligned to the grid via $j = \\operatorname{round}(\\tau/\\Delta t)$, and it contributes to $D_j$ provided $0 \\le \\tau \\le T$. Multiple dividends at the same time index must be summed. On any ex-dividend time index $j$, the tradable ex-dividend stock price at that node is\n- $S_{\\text{eff}}(j,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) - D_j, 0 \\}$,\nand otherwise $S_{\\text{eff}}(j,i) = S_{\\text{base}}(j,i)$. This models the price drop at the ex-dividend instant and enforces non-negativity of the stock price.\n\nLet $V(j,i)$ denote the American call option value at time index $j$ and node $i$. Set the terminal payoff at maturity as\n- $V(N,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{eff}}(N,i) - K, 0 \\}$,\nwhere $K$ is the strike. For backward induction, for each $j = N-1, N-2, \\dots, 0$ and $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,j\\}$, compute the continuation value using the one-step risk-neutral valuation with discount factor $e^{-r \\Delta t}$:\n- $C(j,i) = e^{-r \\Delta t} \\left( p \\, V(j+1,i+1) + (1-p) \\, V(j+1,i) \\right)$.\nCompute the immediate exercise value at time $j$ using the ex-dividend-adjusted stock:\n- $E(j,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{eff}}(j,i) - K, 0 \\}$.\nThen enforce early exercise by\n- $V(j,i) = \\max\\{ E(j,i), \\, C(j,i) \\}$.\n\nThe required output is the time-$0$ price $V(0,0)$.\n\nYour program must implement the above and compute the price for each parameter set in the following test suite. All dividend times are given in years and are guaranteed to align exactly with the binomial grid as described. Any dividend time strictly greater than $T$ must be ignored. For each case, output a float rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite (each item is a tuple $(S_0, K, r, \\sigma, T, N, \\text{dividends})$, where dividends is a list of $(\\tau, D)$):\n\n- Case A (general, multiple dividends): $(\\$100, \\$100, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 200, [ (0.5, \\$1.0), (0.75, \\$1.0) ])$.\n- Case B (no dividends): $(\\$100, \\$100, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 200, [\\,])$.\n- Case C (dividend after maturity, should be ignored): $(\\$100, \\$100, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 200, [ (1.5, \\$2.0) ])$.\n- Case D (large dividend causing post-drop floor at zero): $(\\$50, \\$40, 0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 100, [ (0.25, \\$60.0) ])$.\n- Case E (dividend at maturity): $(\\$120, \\$100, 0.03, 0.15, 1.0, 200, [ (1.0, \\$5.0) ])$.\n- Case F (single-step boundary): $(\\$100, \\$90, 0.1, 0.3, 0.25, 1, [ (0.25, \\$2.0) ])$.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_6]$), where each $x_k$ is the price for the corresponding case, rounded to six decimals, with no extra whitespace.",
            "solution": "The problem proposed is subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following mathematical definitions and parameters for modeling an American call option on a stock with discrete dividends:\n-   Time to maturity $T$, number of time steps $N$, time step size $\\Delta t = T/N$.\n-   Initial stock price $S_0$, strike price $K$.\n-   Continuously compounded risk-free rate $r$, volatility $\\sigma$.\n-   Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model parameters: up-factor $u = e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$, down-factor $d = 1/u$, and risk-neutral probability $p = \\dfrac{e^{r \\Delta t} - d}{u - d}$.\n-   Base stock price at time index $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$ and node index $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, j\\}$: $S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) = S_0 \\, u^i \\, d^{j-i}$.\n-   Dividend handling: A dividend $(D, \\tau)$ is assigned to time index $j = \\operatorname{round}(\\tau/\\Delta t)$. All dividends at the same index $j$ are summed into a total amount $D_j$.\n-   Effective ex-dividend stock price: $S_{\\text{eff}}(j,i) = \\max\\{S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) - D_j, 0\\}$.

The framework is derived from the fundamental no-arbitrage principle in a risk-neutral world. The method of subtracting the present value of dividends from the stock price is a standard academic and industry practice. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is formulated as a recursive algorithm (backward induction). For a given set of input parameters, this algorithm produces a single, unique price for the option. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are guaranteed by the structure of the problem.\n-   **Objectivity and Completeness**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical formalisms. All necessary parameters and data for the test cases are provided. The model is self-contained and free from subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is a well-defined and standard problem in financial engineering. I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed via backward induction on a binomial lattice. The core of the algorithm is to determine the option's value at each node of the tree, starting from the terminal nodes at maturity and working backward to the initial node at time $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we pre-process the provided dividend stream. A one-dimensional array, indexed by the time step $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N\\}$, is used to store the total dividend amount $D_j$ paid at each discrete time point. For each dividend of amount $D$ at time $\\tau$, we calculate its corresponding time index $j = \\operatorname{round}(\\tau/\\Delta t)$. If $\\tau \\le T$ (i.e., $j \\le N$), the amount $D$ is added to the total $D_j$.\n\nThe backward induction proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization at Maturity ($j=N$)**: The option value at each terminal node $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N\\}$ is its intrinsic value. The stock price used for this calculation must be the ex-dividend price.\n    -   The base (pre-dividend) stock price is $S_{\\text{base}}(N,i) = S_0 u^i d^{N-i}$.\n    -   The effective (ex-dividend) stock price is $S_{\\text{eff}}(N,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{base}}(N,i) - D_N, 0 \\}$.\n    -   The terminal option value is $V(N,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{eff}}(N,i) - K, 0 \\}$.\n    These values are stored in an array of size $N+1$.\n\n2.  **Backward Recursion ($j = N-1, N-2, \\dots, 0$)**: For each time step $j$ and for each node $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, j\\}$, the option value $V(j,i)$ is determined by the no-arbitrage principle, which dictates that the value must be the greater of its immediate exercise value and its continuation value.\n    -   The **continuation value**, $C(j,i)$, is the discounted expected value of the option in the next time step, calculated under the risk-neutral measure:\n        $$C(j,i) = e^{-r \\Delta t} \\left( p \\cdot V(j+1,i+1) + (1-p) \\cdot V(j+1,i) \\right)$$\n        Here, $V(j+1,i+1)$ and $V(j+1,i)$ are the already computed option values at step $j+1$.\n    -   The **immediate exercise value**, $E(j,i)$, is the payoff received if the option is exercised at this node. This is calculated using the ex-dividend stock price at this node:\n        $$E(j,i) = \\max\\{ S_{\\text{eff}}(j,i) - K, 0 \\} = \\max\\{ \\max\\{S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) - D_j, 0\\} - K, 0 \\}$$\n        where $S_{\\text{base}}(j,i) = S_0 u^i d^{j-i}$.\n    -   The American option value is then the maximum of these two:\n        $$V(j,i) = \\max\\{ C(j,i), E(j,i) \\}$$\n    This process is repeated, working backwards through the tree. A single array of size $N+1$ is sufficient for computation, where at each step $j$, the values for step $j+1$ are overwritten with the new values for step $j$.\n\n3.  **Final Result**: After the loop completes, the array contains a single relevant value, $V(0,0)$, which is the price of the American option at time $t=0$. This is the final result.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for each provided test case to compute the required option prices.",

The option has the terminal payoff at time $T$ given by $\\max(0, S_T - C_0)$, where $S_T$ is the time-$T$ underlying price and $C_0$ is the unknown time-$0$ option price itself. The model assumptions are the standard Black–Scholes assumptions: a frictionless market, no arbitrage, a constant risk-free rate $r$, zero dividends, and the underlying price following Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) under the risk-neutral measure.

            "solution": "The problem posed is to determine the time-$0$ price, denoted $C_0$, of a self-referential European option. This option's payoff at maturity $T$ is given by $\\max(0, S_T - C_0)$, where $S_T$ is the price of the underlying asset at time $T$. The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and situated within the standard Black-Scholes framework. We proceed with its solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of no-arbitrage pricing dictates that the price of any derivative security is the discounted expectation of its future payoff under the risk-neutral probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. For this particular option, we express this as:\n$$ C_0 = e^{-rT} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left[ \\max(0, S_T - C_0) | \\mathcal{F}_0 \\right] $$\nwhere $r$ is the constant risk-free interest rate, $T$ is the time to maturity, and $\\mathcal{F}_0$ represents the information available at time $t=0$.\n\nThe expression on the right-hand side is precisely the definition of the Black-Scholes price for a standard European call option with strike price $K = C_0$. Let us denote the Black-Scholes call price as a function $BS(S_t, K, r, \\sigma, \\tau)$, where $S_t$ is the asset price at time $t$, $K$ is the strike, $r$ is the risk-free rate, $\\sigma$ is the volatility, and $\\tau = T-t$ is the time to maturity. At time $t=0$, we have $\\tau=T$. The pricing relationship for the self-referential option thus becomes a nonlinear equation for $C_0$:\n$$ C_0 = BS(S_0, C_0, r, \\sigma, T) $$\n\nTo solve for $C_0$, we define a function $f(C)$ such that finding the root of $f(C)=0$ yields the option price:\n$$ f(C) = BS(S_0, C, r, \\sigma, T) - C $$\nThe Black-Scholes formula for a European call option is given by:\n$$ BS(S_0, K, r, \\sigma, T) = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2) $$\nwhere $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution,\n$$ N(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{-z^2/2} dz $$\nand the terms $d_1$ and $d_2$ are:\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} $$\nSubstituting $K=C$ into these expressions gives the full form of our function $f(C)$.\n\nBefore designing a numerical algorithm, we must prove that a unique solution $C_0$ exists.\nFirst, we establish bounds for $C_0$. The option's payoff, $\\max(0, S_T - C_0)$, is always non-negative, so its price must be non-negative, $C_0 \\ge 0$. The payoff is also strictly less than $S_T$ (unless $C_0 \\le 0$, which is not possible for a non-trivial option). An option whose payoff is $S_T$ is equivalent to holding the underlying asset (assuming zero dividends), which has a price of $S_0$. By the principle of dominance, $C_0  S_0$. Therefore, any valid solution must lie in the interval $[0, S_0)$.\n\nExistence of a solution is established using the Intermediate Value Theorem. The function $f(C)$ is continuous on the interval $[0, S_0]$ because the Black-Scholes price function is continuous with respect to its strike price $K$. We evaluate $f(C)$ at the boundaries of this interval:\n1.  At $C=0$: The strike price is zero. A call option with a zero strike is an instrument that pays $S_T$ at maturity. Its time-$0$ price is $S_0$. Thus, $BS(S_0, 0, r, \\sigma, T) = S_0$.\n    $f(0) = BS(S_0, 0, r, \\sigma, T) - 0 = S_0$. For a non-trivial case where $S_0  0$, we have $f(0)  0$.\n2.  At $C=S_0$: The strike is equal to the initial stock price.\n    $f(S_0) = BS(S_0, S_0, r, \\sigma, T) - S_0$. A call option price is always strictly less than the underlying asset price, $BS(S_t, K, \\dots)  S_t$, as it only provides a contingent claim on the asset. Therefore, $BS(S_0, S_0, r, \\sigma, T)  S_0$, which implies $f(S_0)  0$.\n\nSince $f(C)$ is continuous and $f(0)  0$ and $f(S_0)  0$, there must exist at least one root $C_0 \\in (0, S_0)$.\n\nUniqueness of the solution is established by showing that $f(C)$ is a strictly monotonic function. We examine its derivative with respect to $C$:\n$$ f'(C) = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( BS(S_0, C, r, \\sigma, T) \\right) - 1 $$\nThe derivative of the Black-Scholes call price with respect to the strike price $K$ is a standard result in financial mathematics:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial BS}{\\partial K} = -e^{-rT} N(d_2) $$\nReplacing $K$ with $C$, we find the derivative of $f(C)$:\n$$ f'(C) = -e^{-rT} N(d_2(C)) - 1 $$\nSince $e^{-rT}  0$ and the CDF $N(d_2)$ has values in $[0, 1]$, the term $-e^{-rT}N(d_2(C))$ is always non-positive. Consequently, $f'(C) \\le -1$, meaning $f'(C)$ is strictly negative for all $C0$. A function with a strictly negative derivative is strictly monotonically decreasing. A strictly monotonic function can intersect the horizontal axis at most once. This, combined with the proof of existence, guarantees that there is a unique solution $C_0$.\n\nThe numerical algorithm to find $C_0$ must handle specific boundary cases for which a closed-form solution exists, thus avoiding numerical instabilities such as division by zero.\nCase 1: $T=0$. The maturity is immediate. The valuation equation becomes $C_0 = \\max(0, S_0 - C_0)$.\nIf $S_0 - C_0 \\le 0$, then $C_0=0$. This is only possible if $S_0=0$.\nIf $S_0 - C_0  0$, then $C_0 = S_0 - C_0$, which yields $2C_0 = S_0$, so $C_0 = S_0/2$. This is consistent for any $S_0  0$. The solution is $C_0 = S_0/2$.\n\nCase 2: $\\sigma=0$ and $T0$. The asset price grows deterministically: $S_T = S_0 e^{rT}$. The valuation equation is:\n$$ C_0 = e^{-rT} \\max(0, S_0 e^{rT} - C_0) = \\max(0, S_0 - e^{-rT} C_0) $$\nAs before, for $S_0  0$ the solution must be positive, so we have $C_0 = S_0 - e^{-rT} C_0$.\nSolving for $C_0$ gives $C_0(1 + e^{-rT}) = S_0$, which results in $C_0 = \\frac{S_0}{1 + e^{-rT}}$.\n\nGeneral Case: $T0$ and $\\sigma0$. We solve the nonlinear equation $f(C)=0$ using the bisection method. This method is robust and guaranteed to converge given our proof of a unique root within a known interval.\nThe bisection algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the search interval (bracket) to $[a, b] = [0, S_0]$. We have shown $f(a)  0$ and $f(b)  0$. A small positive value might be used for $a$ to avoid numerical issues if the implementation of the Black-Scholes formula is not robust at $K=0$, but a proper implementation handles $K=0$ correctly (price is $S_0$).\n2.  Iterate until the interval width $(b-a)$ is smaller than a prescribed tolerance $\\epsilon$:\n    a. Calculate the midpoint $m = a + (b-a)/2$.\n    b. Evaluate $f(m) = BS(S_0, m, r, \\sigma, T) - m$.\n    c. If $f(m)$ has the same sign as $f(a)$ (i.e., $f(m)0$), the root must lie in $[m, b]$. Set $a=m$.\n    d. Otherwise, the root is in $[a, m]$. Set $b=m$.\n3.  The final approximation of the root $C_0$ is the midpoint of the final interval, $(a+b)/2$.\n\nThis procedure provides a complete and robust method for computing the price of the self-referential option under the specified Black-Scholes assumptions. The implementation will follow this logic.",

This practice () presents an American option with an unusual delayed-payment feature, which at first glance seems to require a complex optimal stopping analysis.

            "solution": "The problem is to determine the time-$0$ price, $V_{0}$, of a specific American-style call option. The underlying asset price, $S_{t}$, follows the Black-Scholes-Merton model under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}S_{t} = r S_{t} \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_{t} \\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the constant risk-free rate, $\\sigma$ is the constant volatility, and $\\{W_{t}\\}$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe option has maturity $T$ and strike $K$. If exercised at a stopping time $\\tau \\in [0,T]$, the holder receives one share of the stock (worth $S_{\\tau}$ at that time) and simultaneously incurs an obligation to pay the amount $K$ at the fixed future time $T$.\n\nFirst, we establish the value of the payoff received upon exercise at time $\\tau$. The holder receives an asset worth $S_{\\tau}$. The obligation is a payment of $K$ at time $T$. The value of this obligation at time $\\tau$ is its discounted value, which is $K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau))$. Therefore, the net value of the payoff at time $\\tau$ is $S_{\\tau} - K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau))$. As this is an option, the holder will only exercise if this value is positive. Thus, the payoff function at time $\\tau$ is $P_{\\tau} = \\max(S_{\\tau} - K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau)), 0)$.\n\nAccording to the principle of risk-neutral pricing for American options, the price at time $t$ is the Snell envelope of the discounted payoff process. This is the supremum, taken over all admissible stopping times $\\tau \\in [t,T]$, of the risk-neutral expectation of the discounted payoff. For $t=0$, the price $V_{0}$ is:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\sup_{\\tau \\in [0,T]} \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\exp(-r\\tau) \\max(S_{\\tau} - K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau)), 0) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\cdot]$ denotes the expectation under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ conditional on the information at time $0$.\n\nTo solve this optimal stopping problem, we perform an algebraic manipulation of the term inside the expectation. The discount factor $\\exp(-r\\tau)$ can be brought inside the $\\max$ function as it is positive:\n$$\n\\exp(-r\\tau) \\max(S_{\\tau} - K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau)), 0) = \\max(\\exp(-r\\tau)S_{\\tau} - \\exp(-r\\tau)K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau)), 0)\n$$\nSimplifying the second term in the parenthesis gives:\n$$\n\\exp(-r\\tau)K \\exp(-r(T-\\tau)) = K \\exp(-r\\tau - rT + r\\tau) = K \\exp(-rT)\n$$\nThus, the pricing formula becomes:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\sup_{\\tau \\in [0,T]} \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\max(\\exp(-r\\tau)S_{\\tau} - K \\exp(-rT), 0) \\right]\n$$\nLet us define a new process $H_{t} = \\exp(-rt)S_{t}$. This process represents the stock price expressed in units of the money-market account $B_{t} = \\exp(rt)$. Using Itô's lemma, we find the dynamics of $H_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H_{t} = \\mathrm{d}(\\exp(-rt)S_{t}) = -r\\exp(-rt)S_{t}\\mathrm{d}t + \\exp(-rt)\\mathrm{d}S_{t} = \\exp(-rt)(-rS_{t}\\mathrm{d}t + (rS_{t}\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_{t}\\mathrm{d}W_{t})) = \\sigma H_{t}\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nSince $H_{t}$ has zero drift under $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale.\nLet us also define a constant $K' = K \\exp(-rT)$. The pricing formula for $V_{0}$ can now be written in terms of $H_{t}$ and $K'$:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\sup_{\\tau \\in [0,T]} \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\max(H_{\\tau} - K', 0) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem is reduced to finding the optimal stopping time for the process $Y_{t} = \\max(H_{t} - K', 0)$. The function $f(x) = \\max(x-K', 0)$ is a convex function. Since $H_{t}$ is a martingale, by Jensen's inequality for conditional expectations, the process $Y_{t} = f(H_{t})$ is a submartingale. For any $ts \\le T$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[Y_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\max(H_{s} - K', 0) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] \\ge \\max(\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[H_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] - K', 0) = \\max(H_{t} - K', 0) = Y_{t}\n$$\nTaking unconditional expectations, we find that for any two stopping times $\\tau_1 \\le \\tau_2$ in $[0,T]$, $\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[Y_{\\tau_1}] \\le \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[Y_{\\tau_2}]$. This implies that the expectation is maximized by choosing the latest possible time for $\\tau$. Therefore, the optimal stopping time is $\\tau^{*} = T$.\n\nSubstituting $\\tau = T$ into the expression for $V_{0}$, the supremum is attained and we have:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\max(H_{T} - K', 0) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting back the definitions of $H_{T}$ and $K'$:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\max(\\exp(-rT)S_{T} - K \\exp(-rT), 0) \\right]\n$$\nWe can factor out the non-random term $\\exp(-rT)$:\n$$\nV_{0} = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ \\exp(-rT) \\max(S_{T} - K, 0) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is, by definition, the time-$0$ price of a standard European call option on the stock $S$ with strike $K$ and maturity $T$. The closed-form solution for this price is given by the Black-Scholes formula:\n$$\nV_{0} = S_{0} N(d_{1}) - K \\exp(-rT) N(d_{2})\n$$\nwhere $N(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and the parameters $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ are given by:\n$$\nd_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(S_{0}/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\n$$\nd_{2} = d_{1} - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} = \\frac{\\ln(S_{0}/K) + (r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the price of the delayed-payment American call option.
