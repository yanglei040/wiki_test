It is scientifically sound, mathematically consistent, and all parameters are provided. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe task is to compute the numerical accuracy of an approximation to the HJM no-arbitrage drift. The volatility of the instantaneous forward rate $f(t,T)$ is given by the deterministic function:\n$$ \\sigma(t,T) = a \\exp(-b(T-t)) $$\nwhere $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ are constants.\n\nFirst, we derive the analytical expression for the exact HJM no-arbitrage drift, $\\alpha(t_0, T)$, under the risk-neutral measure. For a fixed evaluation time $t_0$, the drift is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha(t_0,T) = \\sigma(t_0,T) \\int_{t_0}^{T} \\sigma(t_0,u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\nThe integral term is evaluated by direct integration of the function $\\sigma(t_0, u) = a \\exp(-b(u-t_0))$ with respect to the maturity variable $u$:\n$$ \\int_{t_0}^{T} a e^{-b(u-t_0)} \\, \\mathrm{d}u = a \\left[ -\\frac{1}{b} e^{-b(u-t_0)} \\right]_{u=t_0}^{u=T} = -\\frac{a}{b} \\left( e^{-b(T-t_0)} - e^{0} \\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\left( 1 - e^{-b(T-t_0)} \\right) $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\alpha(t_0,T)$, we obtain the closed-form solution:\n$$ \\alpha(t_0,T) = \\left( a e^{-b(T-t_0)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{a}{b} (1 - e^{-b(T-t_0)}) \\right) = \\frac{a^2}{b} e^{-b(T-t_0)} \\left(1 - e^{-b(T-t_0)}\\right) $$\nThis exact formula is essential for calculating the error of the numerical approximation.\n\nSecond, we analyze the approximate drift, $\\alpha_N(t_0,T)$, which is based on a left-endpoint Riemann sum, $S_N(t_0,T)$:\n$$ \\alpha_N(t_0,T) = \\sigma(t_0,T) S_N(t_0,T), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad S_N(t_0,T) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\sigma(t_0, t_0 + k\\Delta) \\Delta, \\quad \\Delta = \\frac{T - t_0}{N} $$\nTo achieve computational efficiency, we reformulate the sum by recognizing it as a finite geometric series:\n$$ S_N(t_0,T) = a\\Delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{-bk\\Delta} = a\\Delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (e^{-b\\Delta})^k $$\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)$, with $r = e^{-b\\Delta}$ and $n=N$:\n$$ S_N(t_0,T) = a\\Delta \\frac{1 - (e^{-b\\Delta})^N}{1 - e^{-b\\Delta}} = a\\Delta \\frac{1 - e^{-bN\\Delta}}{1 - e^{-b\\Delta}} $$\nSince $N\\Delta = T-t_0$, the expression for the sum becomes:\n$$ S_N(t_0,T) = a \\frac{T-t_0}{N} \\frac{1 - e^{-b(T-t_0)}}{1 - e^{-b(T-t_0)/N}} $$\nThis formula holds for $T > t_0$. For the trivial case $T=t_0$, we have $\\Delta=0$, the integral is $0$, and thus $\\alpha(t_0,t_0)=0$ and $\\alpha_N(t_0,t_0)=0$, resulting in an error of $0$. For numerical implementation, to prevent loss of precision when $\\Delta$ is small, the expression $1 - e^{-x}$ should be computed as $- \\mathtt{expm1}(-x)$, where $\\mathtt{expm1}$ is a standard library function for computing $e^x - 1$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. A uniform maturity grid $\\{T_j\\}_{j=0}^M$ is defined by $T_j = t_0 + j \\frac{H}{M}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, M$.\n$2$.

A vector of approximate drift values, $\\alpha_N(t_0, T_j)$, is computed for the grid using the geometric series formula for $S_N(t_0,T_j)$.\n    b.

The maximum absolute error, $E_N = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le M} |\\alpha(t_0, T_j) - \\alpha_N(t_0, T_j)|$, is found.\n$4$.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of the HJM No-Arbitrage Condition\n\nThe absence of arbitrage requires that the price of any tradable asset, when discounted by the money market account, is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$, the discounted price is $Z(t,T) = B(t)^{-1}P(t,T)$.\n\nThe dynamics of the bond price $P(t,T) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_t^T f(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\right)$ are found using Itô's lemma. The differential is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P(t,T)}{P(t,T)} = \\left( r(t) - \\int_t^T \\alpha(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\right)^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}t - \\left(\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\right) \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThe dynamics of the discounted price $Z(t,T)$ are then given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z(t,T) = Z(t,T) \\left[ \\left( - \\int_t^T \\alpha(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\right)^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}t - \\left(\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\right) \\mathrm{d}W_t \\right]\n$$\nFor $Z(t,T)$ to be a local martingale, its drift must be zero. This must hold for all $T$:\n$$\n\\int_t^T \\alpha(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u \\right)^2\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $T$ yields the HJM no-arbitrage drift condition:\n$$\n\\alpha(t,T) = \\sigma(t,T) \\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nThis condition links the drift and volatility of the forward rates. We now use this to analyze the given volatility structure $\\sigma(t,T) = k\\,(T-t)^{-p}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. If $p \\ge 1$, the no-arbitrage drift $\\alpha(t,T)$ that must link $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ is infinite for each fixed $(t,T)$ with $t<T$, so the forward-rate stochastic differential equation is ill-defined.**\n\nTo compute $\\alpha(t,T)$, we must first evaluate the integral term:\n$$\n\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\int_t^T k\\,(u-t)^{-p}\\,\\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nLet $v = u-t$, so $\\mathrm{d}v = \\mathrm{d}u$. The limits of integration become $0$ and $T-t$.\n$$\n\\int_0^{T-t} k\\,v^{-p}\\,\\mathrm{d}v\n$$\nThis is a standard p-integral. It converges if and only if the power of $v$ is greater than $-1$, i.e., $-p > -1$, which implies $p < 1$.\n- If $p=1$, the integral is $k\\int_0^{T-t} v^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{d}v = k[\\ln v]_0^{T-t}$, which diverges due to the singularity at $v=0$.\n- If $p>1$, the integral is $k\\left[\\frac{v^{1-p}}{1-p}\\right]_0^{T-t}$. Since $1-p < 0$, the evaluation at the lower bound $v=0$ yields infinity.\n\nTherefore, for any $p \\ge 1$, the integral $\\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ is infinite for any $t<T$. Since $\\sigma(t,T) = k(T-t)^{-p}$ is finite and non-zero for $t<T$, the drift term $\\alpha(t,T) = \\sigma(t,T) \\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ is also infinite. An SDE with an infinite drift coefficient is ill-defined.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $0 \\le p < 1$ and $\\sigma$ is deterministic as specified, then for each fixed maturity $T$ the discounted bond price $B(t)^{-1}P(t,T)$ is a true martingale on $[0,T]$.**\n\nFor $0 \\le p < 1$, the drift condition is well-defined. The discounted bond price $Z(t,T)$ is a local martingale. To be a true martingale, a sufficient condition is Novikov's condition. The SDE for $Z(t,T)$ is $\\mathrm{d}Z_t = -Z_t \\Sigma_P(t,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, where $\\Sigma_P(t,T) = \\int_t^T \\sigma(t,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$. The solution is the stochastic exponential $Z(t,T) = Z(0,T)\\mathcal{E}(-\\int \\Sigma_P(s,T) \\mathrm{d}W_s)_t$. Since $\\Sigma_P(s,T)$ is deterministic, Novikov's condition simplifies to requiring that the total variance of the driving stochastic integral be finite. That is, we must check if $\\int_0^T \\Sigma_P(s,T)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s < \\infty$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\Sigma_P(s,T)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_P(s,T) = \\int_s^T \\sigma(s,u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u = k \\int_s^T (u-s)^{-p}\\,\\mathrm{d}u = k \\left[\\frac{(u-s)^{1-p}}{1-p}\\right]_s^T = \\frac{k}{1-p}(T-s)^{1-p}\n$$\nNow we compute the integral of its square:\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\Sigma_P(s,T)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^T \\left(\\frac{k}{1-p}\\right)^2 (T-s)^{2(1-p)}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\left(\\frac{k}{1-p}\\right)^2 \\int_0^T (T-s)^{2-2p}\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThis integral converges if and only if the exponent $2-2p > -1$, which simplifies to $3 > 2p$, or $p < 3/2$. The problem states $0 \\le p < 1$, which is a stricter condition that lies fully within the convergence region $p < 3/2$. Since the integrated variance is a finite constant, Novikov's condition $E\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\Sigma_P(s,T)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right)\\right] < \\infty$ is trivially satisfied. Thus, the local martingale $Z(t,T)$ is a true martingale.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $0 < p < 1$, then $\\sigma(t,t)$ is finite and the short rate $r(t)=f(t,t)$ satisfies a stochastic differential equation with diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(t,t)$.**\n\nThe statement makes two claims. First, \"$\\sigma(t,t)$ is finite\". Let's evaluate this using the definition $\\sigma(t,T) = k(T-t)^{-p}$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t,t) = \\lim_{T \\to t^+} k(T-t)^{-p}\n$$\nFor any $p > 0$, this limit is infinite. Since the statement considers $0 < p < 1$, the premise that $\\sigma(t,t)$ is finite is false.\nSecond, the statement claims the SDE for $r(t)$ has diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(t,t)$. The definition of the short rate is $r(t) = f(t,t)$. Using the integral representation of the forward rate,\n$$\nr(t) = f(t,t) = f(0,t) + \\int_0^t \\alpha(s,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s\n$$\nThe diffusion part of $\\mathrm{d}r(t)$ would formally be $\\sigma(t,t)\\mathrm{d}W_t$. However, for this to be meaningful, $\\sigma(t,t)$ must be well-defined and finite. As shown, it is not.\nFurthermore, for the short-rate process $r(t)$ to be a well-defined semimartingale, the stochastic integral $\\int_0^t \\sigma(s,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s = \\int_0^t k(t-s)^{-p}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$ must be well-defined. The variance of this integral is $\\int_0^t k^2(t-s)^{-2p}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. This integral converges only if $2p < 1$, i.e., $p < 1/2$.\nFor $1/2 \\le p < 1$, the variance of the stochastic integral is infinite, meaning the process $r(t)$ is not even properly defined in the Itô sense. The statement is incorrect on multiple fundamental levels.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $0 < p < 1$, the map $(t,T)\\mapsto f(t,T)$ need not be jointly continuous at the boundary $T=t$; this lack of regularity can destabilize numerical schemes that evolve the forward curve on a grid including points with $T$ arbitrarily close to $t$.**\n\nWe examine the continuity of the map $T \\mapsto f(t,T)$ at the point $T=t$ for a fixed $t$.\n$$\nf(t,T) = f(0,T) + \\int_0^t \\alpha(s,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s\n$$\nThe initial curve $f(0,T)$ is continuous by assumption. The deterministic integral term can be shown to be continuous in $T$ for $p<1$. The critical term is the stochastic integral $J(T) = \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,T)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$.\nAs analyzed for option C, the process $r(t) = f(t,t)$ requires the stochastic integral $J(t) = \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$ to be well-defined. This holds only if $p < 1/2$. For $p \\in [1/2, 1)$, $f(t,t)$ is not a well-defined random variable in $L^2(\\Omega)$, as its variance is infinite. In this case, there is no possibility for continuity, as the value at $T=t$ does not exist in a standard sense. For $f(t,T)$ to be continuous at $T=t$, we must have $\\lim_{T \\to t^+} f(t,T) = f(t,t)$. Since $f(t,t)$ is ill-defined for $p \\ge 1/2$, continuity fails.\nThe range $0 < p < 1$ includes the interval $[1/2, 1)$, where continuity fails. Therefore, the statement that continuity is not guaranteed (\"need not be jointly continuous\") is correct. This discontinuity at the diagonal $T=t$ is a known pathology of this HJM parameterization and indeed causes severe problems for numerical methods that discretize the $(t,T)$ plane.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**E. If $\\sigma$ fails to be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted in $t$, the HJM no-arbitrage restriction can still be imposed and guarantees absence of arbitrage; lack of adaptedness is harmless for well-posedness.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally false. The entire theory of Itô stochastic calculus, which underpins the HJM framework and risk-neutral pricing, critically relies on the assumption that all integrand processes are adapted to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$. An adapted process $\\sigma(t,T)$ is one where $\\sigma(t,T)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for each $t$. This means its value at time $t$ is known given the history of the Brownian motion up to time $t$.\nIf $\\sigma$ were not adapted, it would be an \"anticipating\" process. The stochastic integral $\\int \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W$ would not be an Itô integral, and it would not be a martingale. Itô's lemma would not apply in its standard form. Consequently, the entire derivation of the HJM no-arbitrage condition collapses. The absence of adaptedness is not \"harmless\"; it is a fatal flaw that renders the model ill-posed in the standard framework of mathematical finance. While there exist theories for anticipating stochastic integrals (e.g., Skorokhod integral), they do not share the martingale properties essential for arbitrage pricing.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A, B, and D are correct, while C and E are incorrect.",
