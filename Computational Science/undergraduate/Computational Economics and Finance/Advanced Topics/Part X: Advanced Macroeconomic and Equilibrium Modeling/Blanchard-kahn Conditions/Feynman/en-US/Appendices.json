            "solution": "The system is described by the linear rational expectations equation $\\mathbb{E}_t \\, y_{t+1} = A \\, y_t$, where $y_t \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ and the matrix $A$ is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The variable $x_t$ is predetermined, meaning its value at time $t$ is known from time $t-1$. The variable $p_t$ is a non-predetermined, or \"jump\", variable, meaning its value at time $t$ can react to new information arriving at time $t$.\n\nFirst, we must verify the Blanchard-Kahn (BK) conditions for the existence of a unique, stable solution path. The BK conditions state that the number of eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ with modulus greater than $1$ must be equal to the number of jump variables in the system. In this case, we have $1$ jump variable, $p_t$. Thus, for a unique saddle path to exist, the matrix $A$ must possess exactly $1$ eigenvalue with a modulus greater than $1$.\n\nWe find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 - \\lambda & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1.2 - \\lambda)(0.4 - \\lambda) - (0.5)(0.3) = 0\n$$\n$$\n0.48 - 1.6\\lambda + \\lambda^2 - 0.15 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 1.6\\lambda + 0.33 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we find the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.6)^2 - 4(1)(0.33)}}{2} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{2.56 - 1.32}}{2} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\nThe unstable (explosive) eigenvalue, $\\lambda_u$:\n$$\n\\lambda_u = \\frac{1.6 + \\sqrt{1.24}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.6 + 1.11355}{2} \\approx 1.35678\n$$\nAnd the stable (non-explosive) eigenvalue, $\\lambda_s$:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.6 - 1.11355}{2} \\approx 0.24323\n$$\nSince $|\\lambda_u| > 1$ and $|\\lambda_s|  1$, there is exactly one unstable eigenvalue. This number matches the number of jump variables ($1$). Therefore, the Blanchard-Kahn conditions are satisfied, and a unique, stable saddle path exists.\n\nNext, we derive this saddle-path relationship. The general solution of the system can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $A$. Let $v_u$ and $v_s$ be the eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda_u$ and $\\lambda_s$, respectively. The solution at any time $t$ is of the form $y_t = c_1 (\\lambda_u)^t v_u + c_2 (\\lambda_s)^t v_s$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants. For the system to avoid explosive behavior as $t \\to \\infty$, the term associated with the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_u$ must be eliminated. This requires setting its coefficient $c_1$ to $0$.\n\nThis constraint forces the solution vector $y_t = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ to lie on the stable manifold, which is the subspace spanned by the stable eigenvector $v_s$. Consequently, for any time $t$, the vector $y_t$ must be collinear with $v_s$. This implies a fixed proportional relationship between its components, $x_t$ and $p_t$.\n\nWe find the stable eigenvector $v_s = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{sx} \\\\ v_{sp} \\end{pmatrix}$ by solving the equation $(A - \\lambda_s I)v_s = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 - \\lambda_s  0.5 \\\\ 0.3  0.4 - \\lambda_s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{sx} \\\\ v_{sp} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the second row of this matrix equation, we obtain the relationship:\n$$\n0.3 v_{sx} + (0.4 - \\lambda_s) v_{sp} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the ratio of the components of the stable eigenvector:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{sp}}{v_{sx}} = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\lambda_s}\n$$\nSince the solution vector $y_t = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ must be parallel to $v_s$, the ratio of its components must be the same:\n$$\n\\frac{p_t}{x_t} = \\frac{v_{sp}}{v_{sx}}\n$$\nThis leads to the saddle-path relationship $p_t = F x_t$, where the coefficient $F$ is given by:\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\lambda_s}\n$$\nWe now substitute the expression for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_s = \\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}$:\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\left(\\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}\\right)} = -\\frac{0.3}{\\frac{2(0.4) - (1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24})}{2}} = -\\frac{0.6}{0.8 - 1.6 + \\sqrt{1.24}}\n$$\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.6}{-0.8 + \\sqrt{1.24}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a linear rational expectations system to determine the multiplicity of bounded equilibria. The governing principle for such systems is the Blanchard-Kahn (BK) condition. This condition establishes the relationship between the number of unstable eigenvalues of the system's transition matrix and the number of non-predetermined (or jump) variables necessary for a unique, stable (bounded) equilibrium path.\n\nThe system is described by the law of motion:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_t\\big[z_{t+1}\\big] \\;=\\; A\\,z_t\n$$\nGiven the absence of exogenous shocks, the rational expectations solution implies a deterministic path:\n$$\nz_{t+1} \\;=\\; A\\,z_t\n$$\nThe solution to this linear difference equation system is given by $z_t = A^t z_0$, where $z_0$ is the initial state vector.\n\nThe endogenous vector is $z_t=\\begin{pmatrix}k_t \\\\ q_t \\\\ p_t\\end{pmatrix}$. The variable $k_t$ is predetermined, while $q_t$ and $p_t$ are non-predetermined. The number of non-predetermined variables is therefore $n_p = 2$.\n\nThe transition matrix $A$ is given as:\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5  0  0 \\\\\n0  0.8  0 \\\\\n0  0  1.2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor the path of the system, $\\{z_t\\}_{t\\ge 0}$, to be bounded, the initial vector $z_0$ must be chosen such that it eliminates any explosive dynamics inherent in the matrix $A$. The dynamics of the system are governed by the eigenvalues of $A$. Since $A$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 0.5, \\quad \\lambda_2 = 0.8, \\quad \\lambda_3 = 1.2\n$$\nAn eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is considered stable if $|\\lambda|  1$, unit-root if $|\\lambda| = 1$, and unstable (or explosive) if $|\\lambda|  1$.\nThe moduli of the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n|\\lambda_1| = 0.5  1 \\quad (\\text{stable})\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_2| = 0.8  1 \\quad (\\text{stable})\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_3| = 1.2  1 \\quad (\\text{unstable})\n$$\nThe number of unstable eigenvalues, denoted by $n_{unstable}$, is $1$.\n\nThe Blanchard-Kahn conditions relate $n_{unstable}$ to $n_p$:\n1.  If $n_{unstable} = n_p$, there exists a unique bounded equilibrium. The $n_{unstable}$ stability conditions uniquely determine the initial values of the $n_p$ non-predetermined variables.\n2.  If $n_{unstable}  n_p$, there are more stability conditions than free variables available to satisfy them. No bounded equilibrium path exists.\n3.  If $n_{unstable}  n_p$, there are fewer stability conditions than non-predetermined variables. This means there are not enough constraints to uniquely determine the initial values of all non-predetermined variables. Consequently, there is a multiplicity of bounded equilibria.\n\nIn this problem, we have $n_{unstable} = 1$ and $n_p = 2$. We are in the third case, $n_{unstable}  n_p$.\n\nTo ensure the path $\\{z_t\\}$ is bounded, the initial vector $z_0$ must have no component in the direction of the eigenvector(s) corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue(s). The eigenvectors of the diagonal matrix $A$ are the standard basis vectors:\n$$\nv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad v_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe unstable eigenvalue is $\\lambda_3 = 1.2$, with corresponding eigenvector $v_3$. For the solution $z_t = A^t z_0$ to remain bounded as $t \\to \\infty$, the initial vector $z_0$ must lie in the subspace spanned by the stable eigenvectors, $v_1$ and $v_2$. This imposes a condition that the component of $z_0$ along $v_3$ must be zero. Writing $z_0 = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3$, boundedness requires $c_3 = 0$.\n\nThe initial vector is $z_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} k_0 \\\\ q_0 \\\\ p_0 \\end{pmatrix}$. In terms of the standard basis, this is $z_0 = k_0 v_1 + q_0 v_2 + p_0 v_3$. Comparing coefficients, the stability condition $c_3=0$ translates to $p_0=0$.\n\nThe problem states that $k_0$ is given, while $(q_0, p_0)$ must be chosen at $t=0$ to ensure a bounded path. We have two variables to choose, $q_0$ and $p_0$. The stability condition imposes one constraint: $p_0=0$. This leaves $q_0$ as a free variable. The set of initial choices for the non-predetermined variables that yields a bounded path is $\\{(q_0, p_0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid p_0=0\\}$. This is a one-dimensional subspace of the plane of non-predetermined variables.\n\nThe multiplicity of equilibria is defined as the dimension of the space of free choices for the non-predetermined variables that satisfy the boundedness condition. In this case, the number of free choices is the total number of non-predetermined variables minus the number of restrictions imposed by stability.\n$$\n\\text{Dimension of multiplicity} = n_p - n_{unstable} = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nThere is one degree of freedom in choosing the initial values of the non-predetermined variables.",
