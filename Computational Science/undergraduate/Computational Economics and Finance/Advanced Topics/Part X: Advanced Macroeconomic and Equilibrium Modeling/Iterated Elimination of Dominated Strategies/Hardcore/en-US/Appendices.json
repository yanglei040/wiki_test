This practice challenges you to apply the logic of IEDS not just once, but repeatedly, to see how the assumption of common rationality forces strategies to unravel towards a unique, and perhaps unexpected, equilibrium . Mastering this process is key to understanding how collective rationality can be modeled computationally.",

            "problem": "Consider a finite normal-form game with $N \\geq 2$ players. Each player $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ simultaneously chooses an action $a_i$ from the continuous interval $[0, 100]$. Let $\\bar{a} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j$ denote the average action. Player $i$’s payoff is given by\n$$\nu_i(a_1,\\dots,a_N) \\;=\\; -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\bar{a}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nAssume common knowledge of rationality. Using iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS), identify the unique action that survives for each player when the elimination process is applied to the continuous strategy space $[0, 100]$. Provide your final answer as a single real number with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of the unique strategy profile that survives the process of iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS) for a given $N$-player game.\n\nLet the initial strategy space for each player $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be $S_i^0 = [0, 100]$. The game is symmetric, so we can denote the strategy space for any player at round $k$ as $S^k$. Initially, $S^0 = [0, 100]$.\n\nThe payoff function for player $i$ is given by $u_i(a_1, \\dots, a_N) = -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}\\right)^2$, where $\\bar{a} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j$. A rational player $i$ chooses an action $a_i$ to maximize this payoff. Maximizing $u_i$ is equivalent to minimizing the term $\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}\\right)^2$, which is achieved by choosing $a_i$ to be as close as possible to the value $\\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}$.\n\nTo find the best response function for player $i$, $BR_i(a_{-i})$, we solve for the action $a_i$ that maximizes $u_i$ given the actions of other players, $a_{-i} = (a_j)_{j \\neq i}$. We can express the payoff function in terms of $a_i$:\n$$u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) = -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3N}\\left(a_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j\\right)\\right)^2 = -\\left(a_i\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j\\right)^2$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $a_i$ with a negative leading coefficient, so it has a unique maximum. The maximum occurs where the derivative with respect to $a_i$ is zero. The best response is $a_i = \\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}$, which we can solve for $a_i$:\n$$a_i = \\frac{2}{3N}\\left(a_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j\\right) \\implies a_i\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j$$\nSolving for $a_i$ yields the best response function:\n$$a_i\\left(\\frac{3N-2}{3N}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j$$\n$$BR_i(a_{-i}) = a_i = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j$$\nSince the problem states $N \\geq 2$, the denominator $3N-2$ is non-zero. The second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial a_i^2} = -2\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right)^2  0$, which confirms this is indeed a maximum.\n\nWe now apply IEDS.\n**Round 1:** In the first round, each player $i$ considers that other players $j$ can choose any action $a_j \\in S^0 = [0, 100]$. We find the set of actions for player $i$ that can be a best response to some belief about the opponents' actions. Due to the nature of the payoff function, the set of non-dominated strategies corresponds to the range of the best response function.\nThe minimum value of $BR_i(a_{-i})$ occurs when all other players choose $a_j = 0$:\n$$a_i^{\\min} = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} 0 = 0$$\nThe maximum value occurs when all other players choose $a_j = 100$:\n$$a_i^{\\max} = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} 100 = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2} \\times 100$$\nLet $C = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2}$. The set of all possible best responses for player $i$ is the interval $[0, C \\times 100]$. Any action $a_i  C \\times 100$ is never a best response. Such an action $a_i$ is strictly dominated by the action $a_i' = C \\times 100$.\nTo see this, for any selection of actions $a_{-i} \\in [0, 100]^{N-1}$, the best response $a_i^* = BR_i(a_{-i})$ lies in $[0, C \\times 100]$. The payoff $u_i$ is strictly decreasing in the distance $|a_i - a_i^*|$. For any $a_i''  C \\times 100$, we have $|a_i'' - a_i^*|  |C \\times 100 - a_i^*|$, so $u_i(a_i'', a_{-i})  u_i(C \\times 100, a_{-i})$. Thus, actions in $(C \\times 100, 100]$ are strictly dominated.\nAfter the first round of elimination, the surviving strategy space for each player is $S^1 = [0, C \\times 100]$.\nFor $N \\geq 2$, it is clear that $0  C  1$. Specifically, $3N-2 > 2N-2$ implies $N > 0$, so $C  1$. Thus, the interval of strategies shrinks.\n\n**Round 2:** All players know that every player will choose an action from $S^1 = [0, C \\times 100]$. We repeat the process. The range of best responses for player $i$ is now calculated based on $a_j \\in S^1$.\nThe minimum best response is again $0$ (when all $a_j=0$).\nThe maximum best response is when all $a_j = C \\times 100$:\n$$a_i^{\\max} = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2} \\times (C \\times 100) = C \\times (C \\times 100) = C^2 \\times 100$$\nThe surviving strategy space after round $2$ is $S^2 = [0, C^2 \\times 100]$.\n\n**Iterative Process:** Let $S^k = [0, M_k]$ be the interval of surviving strategies after $k$ rounds, with $M_0 = 100$. The above logic shows that the upper bound of the interval is reduced by a factor of $C$ in each round.\n$$M_k = C \\cdot M_{k-1} = C^k \\cdot M_0 = C^k \\times 100$$\nSo, the set of strategies surviving $k$ rounds is $S^k = [0, C^k \\times 100]$.\n\n**Limit:** The set of strategies that survive IEDS is the intersection of all these sets as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$S^{\\infty} = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} S^k = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} [0, C^k \\times 100]$$\nSince $0  C  1$ for all $N \\geq 2$, we have $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} C^k = 0$.\nTherefore, the limit of the upper bound is $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} (C^k \\times 100) = 0$.\nThe intersection of the nested intervals $[0, 100]$, $[0, C \\times 100]$, $[0, C^2 \\times 100]$, ... is the singleton set $\\{0\\}$.\nThus, the unique action that survives the iterated elimination of dominated strategies for every player is $0$.",

Report your answer as a single integer (the number of hours). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in game theory, specifically the analysis of a symmetric contest using iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS). All necessary functions and parameters are defined, and there are no logical contradictions or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe game involves $2$ players, students $i$ and $j$, who choose a level of study hours $h$ from the discrete strategy set $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The game is symmetric. We analyze the payoffs for an arbitrary player $i$.\n\nThe utility function for player $i$ is given by $U_{i}(h_{i}, h_{j}) = V \\cdot P_{i}(h_{i}, h_{j}) - c(h_{i})$, where $h_i$ is player $i$'s choice and $h_j$ is player $j$'s choice.\nThe parameters are given as $\\kappa=1$, $V=14$, $\\alpha=1$, $\\beta=1$, and $\\delta=4$.\n\nThe probability of player $i$ winning is $P_{i}(h_{i},h_{j}) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(h_{j}-h_{i})}$.\nThe cost function is $c(h) = h + h^{2} + 4 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{h=3\\}}$.\nLet us first compute the cost $c(h)$ for each possible strategy $h \\in S$:\n$c(0) = 0 + 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$c(1) = 1 + 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 = 2$\n$c(2) = 2 + 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 = 6$\n$c(3) = 3 + 3^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 = 16$\n\nPlayer $i$'s utility is thus $U_{i}(h_{i},h_{j}) = 14 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(h_{j}-h_{i})} - c(h_{i})$. We can construct the payoff matrix for player $i$. The entry in row $h_i$ and column $h_j$ is $U_i(h_i, h_j)$.\n\nWe now apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. A strategy $h_i'$ is strictly dominated by $h_i''$ if $U_i(h_i'', h_j)  U_i(h_i', h_j)$ for all $h_j \\in S$.\n\n**Round 1 of Elimination**\nLet us compare strategy $h_i=3$ with strategy $h_i=2$. We must check if $U_i(2, h_j)  U_i(3, h_j)$ for all $h_j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This inequality is $14 \\cdot P_i(2, h_j) - 6  14 \\cdot P_i(3, h_j) - 16$, which simplifies to $10  14 \\cdot (P_i(3, h_j) - P_i(2, h_j))$, or $P_i(3, h_j) - P_i(2, h_j)  \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$.\nThe function $P_i(h_i, h_j)$ is increasing in $h_i$, so the difference is always positive. We check this for all $h_j$:\n- For $h_j=3$: $P_i(3,3) - P_i(2,3) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{1+e} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{5}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=2$: $P_i(3,2) - P_i(2,2) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{5}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=1$: $P_i(3,1) - P_i(2,1) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-2}} - \\frac{1}{1+e^{-1}} \\approx 0.150  \\frac{5}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=0$: $P_i(3,0) - P_i(2,0) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-3}} - \\frac{1}{1+e^{-2}} \\approx 0.072  \\frac{5}{7}$.\nSince the inequality holds for all possible strategies of the opponent, the strategy $h_i=3$ is strictly dominated by $h_i=2$. By symmetry, we eliminate $h=3$ for both players. The reduced strategy space is $S' = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\n**Round 2 of Elimination**\nWe now consider the game on the reduced strategy space $S'$. Let us compare strategy $h_i=0$ with $h_i=1$. We check if $U_i(1, h_j)  U_i(0, h_j)$ for all $h_j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This inequality is $14 \\cdot P_i(1, h_j) - 2  14 \\cdot P_i(0, h_j) - 0$, which simplifies to $P_i(1, h_j) - P_i(0, h_j)  \\frac{2}{14} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.143$.\n- For $h_j=2$: $P_i(1,2) - P_i(0,2) = \\frac{1}{1+e} - \\frac{1}{1+e^2} \\approx 0.150  \\frac{1}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=1$: $P_i(1,1) - P_i(0,1) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{1+e} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{1}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=0$: $P_i(1,0) - P_i(0,0) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{1}{7}$.\nThe inequality holds for all $h_j \\in S'$. Thus, strategy $h_i=0$ is strictly dominated by $h_i=1$. We eliminate $h=0$ for both players. The new strategy space is $S'' = \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\n**Round 3 of Elimination**\nFinally, we consider the game on the strategy space $S''$. We compare $h_i=2$ with $h_i=1$. We check if $U_i(1, h_j)  U_i(2, h_j)$ for $h_j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. This inequality is $14 \\cdot P_i(1, h_j) - 2  14 \\cdot P_i(2, h_j) - 6$, which simplifies to $4  14 \\cdot (P_i(2, h_j) - P_i(1, h_j))$, or $P_i(2, h_j) - P_i(1, h_j)  \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.286$.\n- For $h_j=2$: $P_i(2,2) - P_i(1,2) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{1+e} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{2}{7}$.\n- For $h_j=1$: $P_i(2,1) - P_i(1,1) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{e-1}{2(1+e)} \\approx 0.231  \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe inequality holds for all $h_j \\in S''$. Thus, strategy $h_i=2$ is strictly dominated by $h_i=1$. We eliminate $h=2$ for both players.\n\nThe process of iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies results in a single surviving strategy for each player. This unique strategy is $h=1$.",

A fully rational player will not choose a strictly dominated strategy, so Player $R$ effectively chooses from its surviving set $S_{R}^{(2)} = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n\nWe calculate the expected payoff for Player $R$ for each of these surviving strategies.\n- The expected payoff for $R$ choosing $r_1$ is:\n$$ E[U_R(r_1, \\sigma_C)] = \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_1, c_2) + \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_1, c_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 2 + 2 = 4 $$\n- The expected payoff for $R$ choosing $r_2$ is:\n$$ E[U_R(r_2, \\sigma_C)] = \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_2, c_2) + \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_2, c_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(5) + \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 $$\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, $E[U_R(r_1, \\sigma_C)] = 4$ is greater than $E[U_R(r_2, \\sigma_C)] = 3.5$.\nTherefore, the unique best response for the rational Player $R$ is to choose strategy $r_1$. The problem asks for the row index, which is $1$.",
