The \"Guess the 2/3 Average\" game challenges you to think not just about your best choice, but about what other rational players will choose, knowing that they are doing the same.

            "problem": "Consider a finite normal-form game with $N \\geq 2$ players. Each player $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ simultaneously chooses an action $a_i$ from the continuous interval $[0, 100]$. Let $\\bar{a} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j$ denote the average action. Player $i$’s payoff is given by\n$$\nu_i(a_1,\\dots,a_N) \\;=\\; -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\bar{a}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nAssume common knowledge of rationality. Using iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS), identify the unique action that survives for each player when the elimination process is applied to the continuous strategy space $[0, 100]$. Provide your final answer as a single real number with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of the unique strategy profile that survives the process of iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS) for a given $N$-player game.\n\nLet the initial strategy space for each player $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be $S_i^0 = [0, 100]$. The game is symmetric, so we can denote the strategy space for any player at round $k$ as $S^k$. Initially, $S^0 = [0, 100]$.\n\nThe payoff function for player $i$ is given by $u_i(a_1, \\dots, a_N) = -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}\\right)^2$, where $\\bar{a} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j$. A rational player $i$ chooses an action $a_i$ to maximize this payoff. Maximizing $u_i$ is equivalent to minimizing the term $\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}\\right)^2$, which is achieved by choosing $a_i$ to be as close as possible to the value $\\frac{2}{3}\\bar{a}$.\n\nTo find the best response function for player $i$, $BR_i(a_{-i})$, we solve for the action $a_i$ that maximizes $u_i$ given the actions of other players, $a_{-i} = (a_j)_{j \\neq i}$. We can express the payoff function in terms of $a_i$:\n$$u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) = -\\left(a_i - \\frac{2}{3N}\\left(a_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j\\right)\\right)^2 = -\\left(a_i\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j\\right)^2$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $a_i$ with a negative leading coefficient, so it has a unique maximum. The maximum occurs where the argument of the square is zero:\n$$a_i\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j = 0$$\nSolving for $a_i$ yields the best response function:\n$$a_i\\left(\\frac{3N-2}{3N}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3N}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j$$\n$$BR_i(a_{-i}) = a_i = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} a_j$$\nSince the problem states $N \\geq 2$, the denominator $3N-2$ is non-zero. The second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial a_i^2} = -2\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3N}\\right)^2 < 0$, which confirms this is indeed a maximum.\n\nWe now apply IEDS.\n**Round 1:** In the first round, each player $i$ considers that other players $j$ can choose any action $a_j \\in S^0 = [0, 100]$. We find the set of actions for player $i$ that can be a best response to some belief about the opponents' actions. Due to the nature of the payoff function, the set of non-dominated strategies corresponds to the range of the best response function.\nThe minimum value of $BR_i(a_{-i})$ occurs when all other players choose $a_j = 0$:\n$$a_i^{\\min} = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} 0 = 0$$\nThe maximum value occurs when all other players choose $a_j = 100$:\n$$a_i^{\\max} = \\frac{2}{3N-2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} 100 = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2} \\times 100$$\nLet $C = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2}$. The set of all possible best responses for player $i$ is the interval $[0, C \\times 100]$. Any action $a_i > C \\times 100$ is never a best response. Such an action $a_i$ is strictly dominated by the action $a_i' = C \\times 100$.\nTo see this, for any selection of actions $a_{-i} \\in [0, 100]^{N-1}$, the best response $a_i^* = BR_i(a_{-i})$ lies in $[0, C \\times 100]$. The payoff $u_i$ is strictly decreasing in the distance $|a_i - a_i^*|$. For any $a_i'' > C \\times 100$, we have $|a_i'' - a_i^*| > |C \\times 100 - a_i^*|$, so $u_i(a_i'', a_{-i}) < u_i(C \\times 100, a_{-i})$. Thus, actions in $(C \\times 100, 100]$ are strictly dominated.\nAfter the first round of elimination, the surviving strategy space for each player is $S^1 = [0, C \\times 100]$.\nFor $N \\geq 2$, it is clear that $0 < C < 1$. Specifically, $3N-2 > 2N-2$ implies $N > 0$, so $C < 1$. Thus, the interval of strategies shrinks.\n\n**Round 2:** All players know that every player will choose an action from $S^1 = [0, C \\times 100]$. We repeat the process. The range of best responses for player $i$ is now calculated based on $a_j \\in S^1$.\nThe minimum best response is again $0$ (when all $a_j=0$).\nThe maximum best response is when all $a_j = C \\times 100$:\n$$a_i^{\\max} = \\frac{2(N-1)}{3N-2} \\times (C \\times 100) = C \\times (C \\times 100) = C^2 \\times 100$$\nThe surviving strategy space after round $2$ is $S^2 = [0, C^2 \\times 100]$.\n\n**Iterative Process:** Let $S^k = [0, M_k]$ be the interval of surviving strategies after $k$ rounds, with $M_0 = 100$. The above logic shows that the upper bound of the interval is reduced by a factor of $C$ in each round.\n$$M_k = C \\cdot M_{k-1} = C^k \\cdot M_0 = C^k \\times 100$$\nSo, the set of strategies surviving $k$ rounds is $S^k = [0, C^k \\times 100]$.\n\n**Limit:** The set of strategies that survive IEDS is the intersection of all these sets as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$S^{\\infty} = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} S^k = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} [0, C^k \\times 100]$$\nSince $0 < C < 1$ for all $N \\geq 2$, we have $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} C^k = 0$.\nTherefore, the limit of the upper bound is $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} (C^k \\times 100) = 0$.\nThe intersection of the nested intervals $[0, 100]$, $[0, C \\times 100]$, $[0, C^2 \\times 100]$, ... is the singleton set $\\{0\\}$.\nThus, the unique action that survives the iterated elimination of dominated strategies for every player is $0$.",

Thus, $r_3$ is eliminated. No other strategy for $R$ is strictly dominated.\n\nNext, we identify strictly dominated strategies for Player $C$ over the initial strategy set $S_{R}^{(0)}$.\n- We compare the payoffs of $c_2$ and $c_4$ for player $C$ for each of $R$'s strategies in $S_{R}^{(0)}$:\n  - For $r_1$: $U_C(r_1, c_2) = 3 > 1 = U_C(r_1, c_4)$.\n  - For $r_2$: $U_C(r_2, c_2) = 2 > 1 = U_C(r_2, c_4)$.\n  - For $r_3$: $U_C(r_3, c_2) = 4 > 0 = U_C(r_3, c_4)$.\nSince $U_C(r_i, c_2) > U_C(r_i, c_4)$ for all $r_i \\in S_{R}^{(0)}$, the strategy $c_2$ strictly dominates $c_4$.

No strategies are eliminated for Player $R$.\n\nNext, for Player $C$, we compare $c_1, c_2, c_3$ over the surviving strategies $S_{R}^{(1)} = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n- We compare the payoffs of $c_1$ and $c_2$ for player $C$:\n  - For $r_1$: $U_C(r_1, c_2) = 3 > 1 = U_C(r_1, c_1)$.\n  - For $r_2$: $U_C(r_2, c_2) = 2 > 0 = U_C(r_2, c_1)$.\nSince $U_C(r_i, c_2) > U_C(r_i, c_1)$ for all $r_i \\in S_{R}^{(1)}$, the strategy $c_2$ strictly dominates $c_1$. Thus, $c_1$ is eliminated.\n- We compare $c_2$ and $c_3$. $U_C(r_1, c_2)=3 > U_C(r_1, c_3)=2$ but $U_C(r_2, c_2)=2 < U_C(r_2, c_3)=3$. No dominance.\n\nAt the end of Round $2$, the surviving strategies are $S_{R}^{(2)} = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$ and $S_{C}^{(2)} = \\{c_2, c_3\\}$. The problem specifies that the procedure stops after exactly $k=2$ rounds.\n\n**Player R's Best Response**\n\nAccording to the problem, Player $C$ plays a mixed strategy that assigns equal probability to each of its surviving pure strategies, which are $c_2$ and $c_3$. Let this mixed strategy be $\\sigma_C$.\n$$ \\sigma_C = \\frac{1}{2}c_2 + \\frac{1}{2}c_3 $$\nPlayer $R$, being fully rational, anticipates this and chooses a pure strategy from its set of available strategies to maximize its expected payoff. A fully rational player will not choose a strictly dominated strategy, so Player $R$ effectively chooses from its surviving set $S_{R}^{(2)} = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\n\nWe calculate the expected payoff for Player $R$ for each of these surviving strategies.\n- The expected payoff for $R$ choosing $r_1$ is:\n$$ E[U_R(r_1, \\sigma_C)] = \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_1, c_2) + \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_1, c_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 2 + 2 = 4 $$\n- The expected payoff for $R$ choosing $r_2$ is:\n$$ E[U_R(r_2, \\sigma_C)] = \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_2, c_2) + \\frac{1}{2} U_R(r_2, c_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(5) + \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 $$\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, $E[U_R(r_1, \\sigma_C)] = 4$ is greater than $E[U_R(r_2, \\sigma_C)] = 3.5$.\nTherefore, the unique best response for the rational Player $R$ is to choose strategy $r_1$.

This would result in a payoff of $4$ for Player $1$. Therefore, at node $3$, Player $1$'s choice is between:\n    -   `Take`: Payoff for Player $1$ is $5$.\n    -   `Pass`: Leads to Player $2$ choosing `Take` at node $4$, yielding a payoff of $4$ for Player $1$.\n    A rational Player $1$ compares these outcomes.

This would result in a payoff of $2$ for Player $1$. At node $1$, Player $1$'s choice is between:\n    -   `Take`: Payoff for Player $1$ is $3$.\n    -   `Pass`: Leads to Player $2$ choosing `Take` at node $2$, yielding a payoff of $2$ for Player $1$.\n    A rational Player $1$ compares these outcomes. Since $3 > 2$, Player $1$ will choose `Take`. The action `Pass` is strictly dominated by `Take` for Player $1$ at node $1$.\n\nTherefore, the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, derived by backward induction, is for Player $1$ to choose `Take` at the very first node. The predicted outcome is $(3, 1)$. This result hinges on the assumption of common knowledge of rationality. The empirical puzzle is that human players often `Pass` at the initial nodes, hoping to achieve higher payoffs later in the game. This implies a breakdown in the assumptions of the standard model.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Under common knowledge of rationality, at the last subgame the mover’s `Pass` is strictly dominated by `Take`, so iterated elimination of strictly dominated continuations collapses each preceding subgame to the action `Take`. Therefore, at node $1$, Player $1$ should choose `Take`. Humans frequently begin with `Pass` because they do not share common knowledge of rationality and often exhibit bounded depth of strategic reasoning.**\nThis statement is a precise and correct summary of the situation. The backward induction logic is accurately described as an iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies (or continuations). The derivation is correct: `Take` is the optimal action at every node, unraveling the game to the first move. The reason provided for the empirical divergence—a failure of common knowledge of rationality or bounded depth of reasoning—is the standard explanation in behavioral economics. If Player $1$ suspects Player $2$ might not be fully rational or might not believe Player $1$ is fully rational, playing `Pass` becomes a viable strategy to seek higher payoffs.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The backward-induction prediction depends critically on risk neutrality; if players are risk averse, then `Pass` strictly dominates `Take` at every node, overturning the IEDS conclusion and matching experimental observations.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. In a game of perfect information, backward induction compares certain outcomes at each step. For example, at node $4$, Player $2$ compares a certain payoff of $6$ with a certain payoff of $5$. For any monotonically increasing utility function $u(\\cdot)$, which is a minimal requirement for representing preferences, $u(6) > u(5)$. Risk aversion, which concerns preferences over lotteries (uncertain outcomes), does not alter the preference between two certain outcomes. The same logic applies at every preceding node. The claim that `Pass` strictly dominates `Take` is false; in the theoretical model, the opposite is true at every node. Risk aversion alone does not overturn the backward induction result in this deterministic setting.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Iterated elimination of dominated strategies cannot be applied to dynamic games, so backward induction is not justified here; the observed human tendency to play `Pass` early is therefore consistent with the only valid theoretical prediction.**\nThis statement is false. Backward induction is not only applicable but is the canonical method for solving finite dynamic games with perfect information. It is equivalent to applying IEDS to the extensive form of the game (or, more precisely, to the strategic-form representation where strategies are complete plans of action). The claim that backward induction is not justified is a severe misunderstanding of game theory fundamentals. Consequently, the conclusion drawn is baseless. The valid theoretical prediction is `Take` at node $1$, which is inconsistent with the human tendency to `Pass`.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In computational models of bounded rationality such as level-$k$ reasoning and Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), players either best respond to a limited number $k$ of iterated steps or make noisy best responses. These frameworks can generate early `Pass` with nontrivial probability, while under common knowledge of rationality the benchmark theoretical prediction remains `Take` at node $1$ via backward induction.**\nThis statement is correct. It accurately describes two major frameworks for modeling bounded rationality.\n-   **Level-k models** formalize limited depth of reasoning. A player of level-$k$ best-responds to a belief that their opponent is of level-$(k-1)$. This can break the long chain of backward induction, making an early `Pass` a rational choice for a low-level player.\n-   **Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)** models players as making probabilistic rather than deterministic choices, with a higher probability of selecting better actions. The possibility of \"error\" at later nodes means that a `Pass` at an early node no longer leads to a certain, poor outcome but to a lottery, whose expected value might be attractive.\nBoth models are prominent tools used to explain the experimental data from the Centipede Game, and they do so by relaxing the stringent assumption of common knowledge of rationality. The statement correctly contrasts this with the benchmark prediction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
