A crucial skill in modern finance is the ability to construct portfolios that isolate these factors. This first exercise  provides hands-on practice in this by asking you to build a 'pure factor' portfolio—one designed to have a unit exposure to a single target factor and zero exposure to all others, all while minimizing portfolio variance. By solving this constrained quadratic optimization problem, you will learn the fundamental technique for creating the building blocks of factor-based investment strategies.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a constrained quadratic optimization task, which is a fundamental problem in computational finance, specifically in the context of portfolio construction under the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). The objective is to find a portfolio weight vector $w$ that minimizes risk, quantified as portfolio variance, while satisfying a set of linear constraints that define the portfolio's exposure to systematic risk factors and its net investment.\n\nThe problem can be formally stated as follows. Find the vector of portfolio weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that solves:\n$$\n\\min_{w} f(w) = \\frac{1}{2} w^{\\top} \\Sigma w\n$$\nsubject to the linear equality constraints:\n$$\nB^{\\top} w = e_j\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}^{\\top} w = 0\n$$\nHere, $w$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of asset weights, $\\Sigma$ is the $N \\times N$ symmetric positive-definite covariance matrix of asset returns, $B$ is the $N \\times K$ matrix of factor loadings, $\\mathbf{1}$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of ones, and $e_j$ is the $K \\times 1$ standard basis vector with a $1$ at the $j$-th position and zeros elsewhere. The factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is included for mathematical convenience and does not alter the location of the minimum.\n\nThe constraints can be consolidated into a single matrix equation $C w = d$, where $C$ is a $(K+1) \\times N$ matrix and $d$ is a $(K+1) \\times 1$ vector:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B^{\\top} \\\\ \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad d = \\begin{bmatrix} e_j \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem is thus a standard equality-constrained quadratic program. Since the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is positive-definite, the objective function $f(w)$ is strictly convex. This property, combined with the linear nature of the constraints, guarantees the existence of a unique global minimum, provided the constraint system is feasible and the rows of $C$ are linearly independent.\n\nTo find the analytical solution, we employ the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(w, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2} w^{\\top} \\Sigma w + \\lambda^{\\top} (d - Cw)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a $(K+1) \\times 1$ vector of Lagrange multipliers. The first-order necessary conditions for optimality require the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $w$ and $\\lambda$ to be zero.\n\nThe gradient with respect to $w$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla_w \\mathcal{L} = \\Sigma w - C^{\\top} \\lambda = 0\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma$ is positive-definite, it is invertible. We can therefore express $w$ in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$\nw = \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top} \\lambda\n$$\nThe gradient with respect to $\\lambda$ simply recovers the linear constraints:\n$$\n\\nabla_\\lambda \\mathcal{L} = d - Cw = 0 \\implies Cw = d\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $w$ into the constraint equation yields:\n$$\nC (\\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top} \\lambda) = d\n$$\nThis can be written as a linear system for the Lagrange multipliers $\\lambda$:\n$$\n(C \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top}) \\lambda = d\n$$\nThe matrix $M = C \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top}$ is a $(K+1) \\times (K+1)$ matrix. Given that $\\Sigma^{-1}$ is positive-definite and we assume the constraint matrix $C$ has full row rank (i.e., its rows are linearly independent), the matrix $M$ is also positive-definite and therefore invertible. We can solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = (C \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top})^{-1} d\n$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $\\lambda$ back into the equation for $w$ provides the closed-form solution for the optimal portfolio weights:\n$$\nw = \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top} (C \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top})^{-1} d\n$$\nA special case arises when $N = K+1$, as in Test Case B. Here, the constraint matrix $C$ is square. If it is invertible, the system $Cw=d$ has a unique solution $w=C^{-1}d$. This single feasible point is, by definition, the minimum. The general formula correctly degenerates to this case, as $w = \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top} (C^{\\top})^{-1} \\Sigma C^{-1} d = C^{-1}d$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, construct the matrices $B$, $\\Sigma$, and the parameters $N$, $K$, $j$.\n$2$. Construct the composite constraint matrix $C$ and the target vector $d$. Note that the problem specifies $j$ is $1$-indexed, which must be converted to $0$-indexed for array manipulation.\n$3$. Compute the inverse of the covariance matrix, $\\Sigma^{-1}$.\n$4$. Form the matrix $M = C \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top}$.\n$5$. Solve the linear system $M \\lambda = d$ for the vector $\\lambda$. Using a linear solver is numerically superior to explicit inversion of $M$.\n$6$. Calculate the optimal weight vector $w = \\Sigma^{-1} C^{\\top} \\lambda$.\n$7$. Using the computed $w$, calculate the three required diagnostic quantities:\n    - The maximum absolute factor exposure deviation: $\\epsilon_{\\text{fac}} = \\max_{k} |(B^{\\top} w)_k - (e_j)_k|$.\n    - The absolute net investment: $\\epsilon_{\\text{net}} = |\\mathbf{1}^{\\top} w|$.\n    - The minimum portfolio variance: $v = w^{\\top} \\Sigma w$.\n\nThe numerical results for $\\epsilon_{\\text{fac}}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{net}}$ should be close to machine precision, confirming the accuracy of the implementation in satisfying the constraints.",

For Test Case B, the expected returns are given as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = r_f \\mathbf{1} + \\mathbf{B}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$. This directly implies that $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} - r_f \\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{B}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} = \\mathbf{0}$. Consequently, the objective function is $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\top \\mathbf{w} = 0$ for any $\\mathbf{w}$, and the maximum alpha is trivially $0$, provided the set of feasible portfolios is not empty.\n\n2.  **Construct LP Inputs:** The matrices and vectors for the `linprog` function are constructed.\n    - `c`: The coefficient vector for the objective function to be minimized, $\\mathbf{c} = -\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n    - `A_eq`: The equality constraint matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{eq}$, formed by vertically stacking a row of ones and the transpose of the factor loading matrix, $\\mathbf{B}^\\top$.\n    - `b_eq`: The equality constraint vector $\\mathbf{b}_{eq}$, which is a vector with $1$ as its first element followed by $m$ zeros.\n    - `bounds`: A sequence of tuples `(l_i, u_i)` for each weight $w_i$, representing the box constraints.\n\n3.  **Solve the LP:** The `scipy.optimize.linprog` function is called with these inputs. The function returns an optimization result object.\n\n4.  **Extract Solution:** The optimal value found by the solver, `res.fun`, corresponds to the minimum of $-\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\top \\mathbf{w}$. Therefore, the maximum portfolio alpha is $\\alpha_p^{\\star} = -(\\text{res.fun})$.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and will be applied to each test case specified in the problem statement. The final program implements these steps, calculates the maximum alpha for each case, and formats the output according to the specified requirements.",

However, real-world financial data rarely conforms to the clean assumptions of normal distributions, often exhibiting 'fat tails' that can severely distort standard estimation methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). This final exercise  delves into this critical practical challenge by having you compare the performance of OLS against a robust regression technique in estimating these loadings from simulated data with fat-tailed errors. This practice will solidify your understanding of why robust econometrics is indispensable for the successful application of any asset pricing model.",

Let $z_{i,t}$ be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard Student’s $t$ variates with degrees of freedom $\\nu$, with the usual variance $\\nu/(\\nu-2)$ for $\\nu>2$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial econometrics, specifically Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and presents a well-posed, objective, and complete computational task. All parameters, distributions, and procedures are defined with sufficient precision for a unique and reproducible solution.\n\nThe task is to compare the performance of two estimators for the factor loadings in an APT model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and a robust M-estimator using the Huber loss function. The comparison is to be performed via a simulation study under different parameterizations of the model, particularly concerning the tail thickness of the idiosyncratic error distribution.\n\nThe model for asset returns is given by\n$$\nR_{i,t} \\;=\\; a_i \\;+\\; \\sum_{k=1}^{K} b_{i k}\\, f_{k,t} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$\nwhere $a_i$ is the intercept, $b_{ik}$ are the factor loadings, $f_{k,t}$ are systematic factors, and $\\varepsilon_{i,t}$ is the idiosyncratic error. The parameters for the data generating process are specified as: $a_i = 0$, $b_{i k} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and $f_{k,t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n\nA critical feature of the model is the distribution of the idiosyncratic errors, $\\varepsilon_{i,t}$. These are specified to be fat-tailed, following a scaled Student's $t$-distribution. Specifically, $\\varepsilon_{i,t} = \\sigma_{\\varepsilon} e_{i,t}$, where $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon} = 0.5$ and $e_{i,t}$ is a transformation of a standard Student's $t$-variate $z_{i,t}$ with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom, $e_{i,t} = \\sqrt{(\\nu-2)/\\nu} \\, z_{i,t}$. This transformation ensures that $\\mathrm{Var}(e_{i,t}) = 1$ for $\\nu > 2$, and thus $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{i,t}) = \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2$. The degrees of freedom parameter $\\nu$ controls the tail thickness of the error distribution; smaller values of $\\nu$ correspond to heavier tails and a higher probability of observing extreme values (outliers).\n\nFor each asset $i$, the vector of parameters $\\theta_i = (a_i, b_{i1},\\dots,b_{iK})^T$ is estimated using $T$ time-series observations. The regression model for asset $i$ is $R_i = X \\theta_i + \\varepsilon_i$, where $R_i$ is the $T \\times 1$ vector of returns, $X$ is the $T \\times (K+1)$ design matrix with columns $(1, f_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, f_{K,\\cdot})$, and $\\varepsilon_i$ is the $T \\times 1$ vector of errors.\n\nThe two estimators are:\n1.  **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: This estimator minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} (R_{i,t} - X_t \\theta_i)^2$. The solution is given in closed form by $\\widehat{\\theta}_{i,\\text{OLS}} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T R_i$. While OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator under the Gauss-Markov assumptions (which hold here, as the errors are independent and homoscedastic), its efficiency deteriorates significantly when the error distribution is not normal but fat-tailed, due to its sensitivity to large residuals.\n\n2.  **Huber Robust Estimator**: This M-estimator minimizes the sum of Huber losses, $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\rho_{\\kappa}(R_{i,t} - X_t \\theta_i)$. The Huber loss function, $\\rho_{\\kappa}(u)$, is quadratic for small arguments ($|u| \\le \\kappa$) and linear for large arguments ($|u| > \\kappa$). This hybrid nature allows the estimator to behave like OLS for observations with small residuals but reduces the influence of observations with large residuals (outliers), providing robustness. The threshold is set to $\\kappa = c\\,\\sigma_{\\varepsilon} = 1.345 \\times 0.5 = 0.6725$. The minimization of this convex objective function does not have a closed-form solution and requires numerical optimization. A quasi-Newton method such as BFGS is a suitable algorithm for this task.\n\nThe performance of the estimators is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the factor loading estimates, $\\widehat{b}_{ik}$, defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N K} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\left(\\widehat{b}_{i k} - b_{i k}\\right)^2}\n$$\nFor each test case, we compute a boolean indicator $I_j = \\mathbf{1}\\{\\mathrm{RMSE}_{\\text{robust}} < \\mathrm{RMSE}_{\\text{OLS}}\\}$. We expect the robust estimator to outperform OLS (i.e., yield a smaller RMSE) when the error distribution has heavy tails (small $\\nu$), while OLS may have a slight advantage when the errors are nearly normal (large $\\nu$).\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the specified simulation protocol. For each test case, all random elements are generated based on a fixed seed. Then, for each of the $N$ assets, both OLS and Huber estimates of the factor loadings are computed. The Huber estimation is performed using the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` library. After collecting the estimates for all assets, the respective RMSEs are calculated and compared to determine the boolean indicator.",
