By calculating a specific deviation, you will see firsthand how to verify if a proposed set of probabilities, denoted by $Q$, is consistent with the no-arbitrage condition $E_Q[S_1/B_1] = S_0/B_0$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the theory of risk-neutral valuation, a cornerstone of financial mathematics. All terms are clearly defined, and all necessary numerical values are provided. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It reduces to a direct calculation based on the given formula and does not contain any scientific or logical fallacies.\n\nThe task is to compute the quantity $\\delta$. The definition is provided as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} q_i \\frac{S_1(\\omega_i)}{B_1} - \\frac{S_0}{B_0}\n$$\nThis expression can be analyzed as the difference between the present value of the risky asset's expected future payoff under the proposed measure $Q$, and its observed present value, with both values normalized by the price of the risk-free bond at the corresponding time. In an arbitrage-free market, for a valid risk-neutral measure, this deviation must be zero. Let us proceed with the calculation.\n\nFirst, expand the summation:\n$$\n\\delta = \\left( q_1 \\frac{S_1(\\omega_1)}{B_1} + q_2 \\frac{S_1(\\omega_2)}{B_1} + q_3 \\frac{S_1(\\omega_3)}{B_1} \\right) - \\frac{S_0}{B_0}\n$$\nThe term $B_1$ in the denominator is common to all terms in the summation. It can be factored out:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{B_1} \\left( q_1 S_1(\\omega_1) + q_2 S_1(\\omega_2) + q_3 S_1(\\omega_3) \\right) - \\frac{S_0}{B_0}\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is the expected payoff of the asset at time $1$ under the probability measure $Q$, denoted $E_Q[S_1]$.\n$$\nE_Q[S_1] = q_1 S_1(\\omega_1) + q_2 S_1(\\omega_2) + q_3 S_1(\\omega_3)\n$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values: $q_1=0.3$, $q_2=0.4$, $q_3=0.3$ and $S_1(\\omega_1)=120$, $S_1(\\omega_2)=100$, $S_1(\\omega_3)=80$.\n$$\nE_Q[S_1] = (0.3)(120) + (0.4)(100) + (0.3)(80)\n$$\n$$\nE_Q[S_1] = 36 + 40 + 24 = 100\n$$\nNow, substitute this result and the remaining given values $B_1 = 1.05$, $S_0 = 100$, and $B_0 = 1$ back into the formula for $\\delta$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{1.05} (100) - \\frac{100}{1}\n$$\nTo compute the exact value, it is best to work with fractions. The number $1.05$ is equivalent to $\\frac{105}{100}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{21}{20}$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{100}{\\frac{21}{20}} - 100\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = 100 \\times \\frac{20}{21} - 100\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{2000}{21} - 100\n$$\nTo subtract, we find a common denominator, which is $21$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{2000}{21} - \\frac{100 \\times 21}{21} = \\frac{2000}{21} - \\frac{2100}{21}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{2000 - 2100}{21} = -\\frac{100}{21}\n$$\nThe computed value of $\\delta$ is non-zero. This demonstrates that the analyst's proposed probability vector $Q$ is not a valid risk-neutral measure for the given asset prices, assuming the market is arbitrage-free. The analyst's claim is therefore inconsistent with the data. The calculation, however, is complete and correct based on the provided formula.",

A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe fundamental principle of arbitrage-free pricing dictates that the price of a derivative security is the present value of its expected future payoff, where the expectation is taken under the risk-neutral probability measure, denoted $Q$.\n\nLet $P_t$ be the price of the success token at time $t$. We are given $P_0 = 0.41$.\nLet $T$ be the time to the campaign's deadline, expressed in years. Given the time to deadline is $45$ days and a year has $365$ days, we have:\n$$T = \\frac{45}{365}$$\nThe annual continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is given as $r = 0.03$.\n\nThe payoff of the token at the deadline, $V_T$, is a random variable dependent on the campaign's outcome.

The payoff structure is:\n$$\nV_T = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if event } S \\text{ occurs} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if event } F \\text{ occurs}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe are tasked with finding the risk-neutral probability of success. Let this probability be denoted by $q$. Thus, under the risk-neutral measure $Q$:\n$$q = Q(S)$$\n$$1-q = Q(F)$$\nThe expected payoff at time $T$ under the risk-neutral measure, $E_Q[V_T]$, is calculated as:\n$$E_Q[V_T] = (1 \\times q) + (0 \\times (1-q)) = q$$\nThe no-arbitrage price of the token at time $t=0$ is the discounted expected payoff:\n$$P_0 = \\exp(-rT) E_Q[V_T]$$\nSubstituting the expression for the expected payoff, we get:\n$$P_0 = q \\cdot \\exp(-rT)$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $q$:\n$$q = P_0 \\cdot \\exp(rT)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$P_0 = 0.41$$\n$$r = 0.03$$\n$$T = \\frac{45}{365}$$\nThis yields:\n$$q = 0.41 \\cdot \\exp\\left(0.03 \\cdot \\frac{45}{365}\\right)$$\nThe exponent is first calculated:\n$$rT = 0.03 \\times \\frac{45}{365} = \\frac{1.35}{365} \\approx 0.00369863$$\nThen we compute the value of $q$:\n$$q = 0.41 \\cdot \\exp(0.00369863...) \\approx 0.41 \\cdot 1.0037054... \\approx 0.4115192...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

We apply Itô's lemma to find the dynamics of $X_t$. For a function $f(S_t) = \\ln(S_t)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S_t} = \\frac{1}{S_t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S_t^2} = -\\frac{1}{S_t^2}$.
