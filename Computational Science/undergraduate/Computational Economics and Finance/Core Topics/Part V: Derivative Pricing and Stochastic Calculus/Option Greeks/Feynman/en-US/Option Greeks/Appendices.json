            "problem": "You are to write a complete and runnable program that, under the Black–Scholes–Merton model with continuously compounded risk-free rate and no dividends, evaluates the analytical sensitivities (Greeks) of a European call option and compares them to symmetric finite-difference approximations as the bump size $h$ approaches zero. Work in the following definitions and conventions.\n\nConsider a European call option with underlying asset price $S>0$, strike price $K>0$, risk-free rate $r\\in\\mathbb{R}$ expressed as a decimal per annum, volatility $\\sigma>0$ expressed as a decimal per annum, and time to maturity $T>0$ in years. Under the Black–Scholes–Merton model, the option price $C(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)$ is well-defined, and the Greeks of interest (with respect to their natural variables) are:\n- Delta $\\Delta := \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}$,\n- Gamma $\\Gamma := \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2}$,\n- Vega $\\mathcal{V} := \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\sigma}$,\n- Theta $\\Theta := -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial T}$, which corresponds to the standard definition of 'time decay' (the partial derivative with respect to calendar time, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$),\n- Rho $\\rho := \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r}$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Compute the analytical values of $\\Delta$, $\\Gamma$, $\\mathcal{V}$, $\\Theta$, and $\\rho$ for each parameter tuple $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)$ using the Black–Scholes–Merton framework without dividends.\n- For each Greek, and for each bump size $h$ in the set $\\mathcal{H} = \\{10^{-1},10^{-2},10^{-3},10^{-4},10^{-5},10^{-6}\\}$, compute the symmetric finite-difference approximation with respect to its defining variable using the central difference stencil when well-defined. The central differences to be used are:\n  - For $\\Delta$ and $\\Gamma$, perturb $S$ by $\\pm h$,\n  - For $\\mathcal{V}$, perturb $\\sigma$ by $\\pm h$,\n  - For $\\Theta$, perturb $T$ by $\\pm h$,\n  - For $\\rho$, perturb $r$ by $\\pm h$.\n- Enforce domain constraints so that perturbed parameters remain in their domains. Specifically, only use a given $h\\in\\mathcal{H}$ for a Greek if the corresponding plus and minus perturbations keep the argument within its valid domain, namely $S\\pm h>0$, $\\sigma\\pm h>0$, $T\\pm h>0$, and no restriction for $r\\pm h$.\n- For each admissible $h$, compute the absolute relative error between the finite-difference approximation and its analytical Greek. If the analytical value equals $0$ exactly, define the error as the absolute difference. For each Greek, identify the $h\\in\\mathcal{H}$ (among those admitted by the domain constraints) that minimizes this error. If no $h$ is admissible for a particular Greek in a test case, report a non-number for that Greek.\n\nTest suite. Your program must evaluate the above for the following parameter tuples $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)$:\n- Case A (general): $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)=(100,100,0.05,0.2,1)$.\n- Case B (short maturity): $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)=(100,100,0.05,0.2,0.01)$.\n- Case C (deep in-the-money): $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)=(150,100,0.05,0.3,1.5)$.\n- Case D (deep out-of-the-money, low volatility): $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)=(50,100,0.01,0.05,2)$.\n\nAll rates and volatilities must be treated as decimals (for example, $0.05$ rather than $5$), and time $T$ must be in years.\n\nRequired final output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The result for each test case must be a list of five floating-point numbers in the order $[\\Delta,\\Gamma,\\mathcal{V},\\Theta,\\rho]$ representing, for each Greek, the bump size $h\\in\\mathcal{H}$ that minimizes the error under the above criterion (or a non-number if no admissible $h$ exists). The overall output must therefore be a list of four such lists, in the same order as Cases A through D. For example, the printed structure must look like $[[h_{\\Delta}^{(A)},h_{\\Gamma}^{(A)},h_{\\mathcal{V}}^{(A)},h_{\\Theta}^{(A)},h_{\\rho}^{(A)}],[h_{\\Delta}^{(B)},\\dots],[h_{\\Delta}^{(C)},\\dots],[h_{\\Delta}^{(D)},\\dots]]$ with numeric values substituted.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and comparison of analytical and numerical methods for calculating the sensitivities, or \"Greeks,\" of a European call option within the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework. The validity of this problem is affirmed, as it is based on fundamental principles of financial mathematics and numerical analysis. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages. First, we present the analytical formulas for the option price and its associated Greeks. Second, we define the finite-difference schemes used for their numerical approximation. Finally, we detail the algorithm for comparing these methods and identifying the optimal numerical step size $h$ for each case.\n\n**1. The Black-Scholes-Merton Model**\n\nThe price of a European call option, $C$, on a non-dividend-paying underlying asset is given by the BSM formula:\n$$\nC(S, K, r, \\sigma, T) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)\n$$\nwhere the parameters are:\n- $S$: current price of the underlying asset $(S>0)$\n- $K$: strike price of the option $(K>0)$\n- $r$: continuously compounded risk-free interest rate\n- $\\sigma$: volatility of the underlying asset's returns $(\\sigma>0)$\n- $T$: time to maturity in years $(T>0)$\n\nThe functions $N(\\cdot)$, $d_1$, and $d_2$ are defined as:\n- $N(x)$: The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $N(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\phi(z) dz$, where $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-z^2/2}$ is the probability density function (PDF).\n- $d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n- $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T} = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n\n**2. Analytical Formulas for the Greeks**\n\nThe Greeks are the partial derivatives of the option price $C$ with respect to its parameters. The analytical formulas for the Greeks specified in the problem are as follows:\n\n- **Delta ($\\Delta$):** The rate of change of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price $S$.\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} = N(d_1)\n$$\n\n- **Gamma ($\\Gamma$):** The rate of change of Delta with respect to $S$. It is the second partial derivative of $C$ with respect to $S$.\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} = \\frac{\\phi(d_1)}{S\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\n\n- **Vega ($\\mathcal{V}$):** The rate of change of the option price with respect to volatility $\\sigma$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{V} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\sigma} = S\\phi(d_1)\\sqrt{T}\n$$\n\n- **Theta ($\\Theta$):** The rate of change of the option price with respect to the passage of calendar time, conventionally defined as $\\Theta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial T}$.\n$$\n\\Theta = -\\left(\\frac{S\\phi(d_1)\\sigma}{2\\sqrt{T}} + r K e^{-rT} N(d_2)\\right)\n$$\n\n- **Rho ($\\rho$):** The rate of change of the option price with respect to the risk-free rate $r$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = K T e^{-rT} N(d_2)\n$$\n\n**3. Finite-Difference Approximations**\n\nWe employ symmetric finite-difference stencils to approximate the derivatives. For a function $f(x)$ and a small perturbation $h$:\n\n- The first derivative is approximated by the central difference formula:\n$$\nf'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h} \\quad (\\text{Error } O(h^2))\n$$\n\n- The second derivative is approximated by:\n$$\nf''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2} \\quad (\\text{Error } O(h^2))\n$$\n\nApplying these to the option price function $C(\\cdot)$ yields the following approximations for the Greeks:\n\n- **Delta:** $\\Delta_{\\text{FD}}(h) = \\frac{C(S+h, \\dots) - C(S-h, \\dots)}{2h}$\n- **Gamma:** $\\Gamma_{\\text{FD}}(h) = \\frac{C(S+h, \\dots) - 2C(S, \\dots) + C(S-h, \\dots)}{h^2}$\n- **Vega:** $\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{FD}}(h) = \\frac{C(\\dots, \\sigma+h, \\dots) - C(\\dots, \\sigma-h, \\dots)}{2h}$\n- **Theta:** $\\Theta_{\\text{FD}}(h) = -\\frac{C(\\dots, T+h) - C(\\dots, T-h)}{2h}$\n- **Rho:** $\\rho_{\\text{FD}}(h) = \\frac{C(\\dots, r+h, \\dots) - C(\\dots, r-h, \\dots)}{2h}$\n\n**4. Algorithmic Procedure**\n\nThe objective is to find the bump size $h$ from the set $\\mathcal{H} = \\{10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}\\}$ that minimizes the approximation error for each Greek.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(S,K,r,\\sigma,T)$ and for each Greek $G \\in \\{\\Delta, \\Gamma, \\mathcal{V}, \\Theta, \\rho\\}$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute Analytical Value:** Calculate the true value, $G_{\\text{analytical}}$, using the formulas from Section 2.\n2.  **Iterate and Evaluate:** For each $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$:\n    a. **Validate Domain:** Check if the perturbation is valid. For a variable $x \\in \\{S, \\sigma, T\\}$ with domain $x>0$, the condition is $x-h > 0$. If this condition is not met, the current $h$ is inadmissible and is skipped. No domain constraint applies to $r$.\n    b. **Compute Numerical Approximation:** If $h$ is admissible, compute the finite-difference approximation, $G_{\\text{FD}}(h)$, using the formulas from Section 3.\n    c. **Compute Error:** Calculate the error. If $|G_{\\text{analytical}}| > \\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon$ is a small tolerance like $10^{-15}$), use the absolute relative error:\n    $$\n    \\text{Error}(h) = \\left| \\frac{G_{\\text{FD}}(h) - G_{\\text{analytical}}}{G_{\\text{analytical}}} \\right|\n    $$\n    Otherwise, if $G_{\\text{analytical}} \\approx 0$, use the absolute error to avoid division by zero:\n    $$\n    \\text{Error}(h) = |G_{\\text{FD}}(h) - G_{\\text{analytical}}|\n    $$\n    d. **Track Minimum:** Compare $\\text{Error}(h)$ with the minimum error found so far. If it is lower, store $h$ as the current optimal bump size.\n3.  **Report Result:** After iterating through all $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$, the stored optimal $h$ is the result for the Greek $G$. If no $h$ was admissible, the result is a non-number (NaN).\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all five Greeks and for all four test cases provided in the problem statement. The final implementation encapsulates this logic in a Python script.",

All rates and volatilities must be expressed as decimals, not as percentages.\n\nConsider portfolios formed from two European call options on the same underlying with the same strike $K$ but different maturities $T_1$ and $T_2$ with $T_1 \\lt T_2$. Define the portfolio weights as follows: the position in the short-dated call (maturity $T_1$) is fixed at $w_1 = 1$ (one long unit), and the position in the long-dated call (maturity $T_2$) is $w_2$ (a real number, which may be negative).

The Gamma of the portfolio is defined as the second derivative of the portfolio value with respect to $S$.\n\nYour task is to determine, for each test case below, the unique weight $w_2$ such that the portfolio’s Vega is exactly zero at the given $S$ (that is, Vega-neutral for small parallel shifts in the term structure of volatility at the current spot), and then compute the resulting net Gamma and the resulting net Vega at that $S$.

The weight of the long-dated option (maturity $T_2$) is $w_2$.\n\nThe net Gamma, $\\Gamma_P$, and net Vega, $\\mathcal{V}_P$, of the portfolio are linear combinations of the individual option greeks:\n$$ \\Gamma_P = w_1\\Gamma_1 + w_2\\Gamma_2 $$\n$$ \\mathcal{V}_P = w_1\\mathcal{V}_1 + w_2\\mathcal{V}_2 $$\nHere, $(\\Gamma_1, \\mathcal{V}_1)$ are the greeks for the option with maturity $T_1$, and $(\\Gamma_2, \\mathcal{V}_2)$ are the greeks for the option with maturity $T_2$.\n\nThe primary objective is to make the portfolio Vega-neutral, which means setting its net Vega to zero. Given $w_1 = 1$, we impose the condition:\n$$ \\mathcal{V}_P = 1 \\cdot \\mathcal{V}_1 + w_2\\mathcal{V}_2 = 0 $$\nFor any European option with $T  0$, Vega ($\\mathcal{V}$) is strictly positive. Since both $T_1$ and $T_2$ are positive, $\\mathcal{V}_2  0$, and we can uniquely solve for the weight $w_2$:\n$$ w_2 = -\\frac{\\mathcal{V}_1}{\\mathcal{V}_2} $$\nThis weight $w_2$ represents the number of units of the long-dated call option that must be shorted to offset the Vega of one long unit of the short-dated call option.\n\nOnce $w_2$ is determined, we can compute the resulting net Gamma of this Vega-neutral portfolio:\n$$ \\Gamma_P = \\Gamma_1 + w_2\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1 - \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{V}_1}{\\mathcal{V}_2}\\right)\\Gamma_2 $$\nThe net Vega of the portfolio under this construction is, by definition, exactly zero. A numerical computation may yield a value close to zero due to floating-point precision limitations, which is an expected artifact.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. For each set of parameters $(S, K, r, q, \\sigma, T_1, T_2)$ from the test suite, we will first compute the Gamma and Vega for each of the two options. This involves calculating the respective $d_1$ term and then applying the $\\Gamma$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ formulas.\n$2$. Using the computed Vegas, $\\mathcal{V}_1$ and $\\mathcal{V}_2$, we determine the weight $w_2 = -\\mathcal{V}_1 / \\mathcal{V}_2$.\n$3$. We then calculate the portfolio's net Gamma, $\\Gamma_P = \\Gamma_1 + w_2\\Gamma_2$.\n$4$. The resulting net Vega will be calculated as $\\mathcal{V}_P = \\mathcal{V}_1 + w_2\\mathcal{V}_2$ to confirm it is zero.\n$5$. The triplet $(w_2, \\Gamma_P, \\mathcal{V}_P)$ is then stored for each test case.\n$6$. Finally, all results are collected, formatted to the required precision, and printed in the specified single-line format.\nThis procedure will be implemented in a self-contained Python program, utilizing `numpy` for numerical calculations and `scipy.stats.norm` for the standard normal PDF.",

            "introduction": "A key limitation of the basic Black-Scholes-Merton model is its assumption of constant volatility, which contradicts the widely observed \"volatility smile\" in markets. This advanced practice moves beyond textbook examples to confront a real-world modeling challenge. You will quantify the pricing inaccuracies and hedging errors that arise from using a simplified, single at-the-money volatility, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of more sophisticated models for accurate risk management .",

            "problem": "You are given a market with a single underlying asset and European call options. Assume the unique no-arbitrage value of a European option equals its risk-neutral expectation when the underlying follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility parameter equal to the option’s input implied volatility, a continuously compounded risk-free rate, and zero continuous dividend yield. For each option, define its sensitivities (the “Greeks”) as the corresponding partial derivatives of its value with respect to the defined inputs: the delta is the partial derivative with respect to the underlying’s spot price, the gamma is the second partial derivative with respect to the underlying’s spot price, the vega is the partial derivative with respect to the input volatility, the theta is the negative partial derivative with respect to the time to maturity, and the rho is the partial derivative with respect to the risk-free rate. Consider the following common approximation practice: compute all option prices and Greeks using a single at-the-money implied volatility for all strikes, instead of using a strike-dependent implied volatility smile.\n\nThe underlying has current price $S_0 = 100$, the continuously compounded risk-free rate is $r = 0.02$ per year, the continuous dividend yield is zero, and each option has time to maturity $T = 0.5$ years. The strike set is $K \\in \\{70,85,100,115,130\\}$. A parametric implied volatility smile maps each strike $K$ to an implied volatility $\\sigma(K)$ via\n$$\n\\sigma(K) \\;=\\; a \\;+\\; b \\,\\ln\\!\\big(K/S_0\\big) \\;+\\; c \\,\\big(\\ln\\!\\big(K/S_0\\big)\\big)^2.\n$$\nFor each test case, the at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility is $\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}} = \\sigma(S_0)$, and two valuation-and-Greeks approaches are considered:\n- Full-smile approach: for each $K$, use $\\sigma(K)$ specific to that strike.\n- ATM-only approach: for each $K$, use $\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}}$ for all strikes.\n\nDefine the “true” valuation for any option at a given state to be the unique no-arbitrage value under the above geometric Brownian motion with the state’s strike-specific implied volatility according to the smile. For hedging, consider a single-step delta hedge: at time $t=0$ for a given $K$, short one call option and buy $\\Delta$ units of the underlying, where $\\Delta$ is computed at $t=0$ according to one of the two approaches. After the following scenario shock, unwind the position to compute the hedging profit-and-loss.\n\nThe scenario shock is the same for every test case:\n- Underlying price changes to $S_1 = S_0 \\times (1 + u)$ with $u = 0.01$.\n- The implied volatility smile undergoes a parallel shift by $d v = 0.01$, so the new implied volatility at strike $K$ is $\\sigma'(K) = \\sigma(K) + d v$.\n- Time passes by $\\Delta t = 1/252$ years so the maturity becomes $T' = T - \\Delta t$.\n\nFor each test case below, do the following for the fixed strike set $K \\in \\{70,85,100,115,130\\}$:\n1. Compute the root-mean-square pricing error at time $t=0$ when using the ATM-only approach relative to the full-smile approach, namely\n$$\n\\text{RMSE} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} \\big( V_{\\text{ATM}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}}) - V_{\\text{smile}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma(K)) \\big)^2 }.\n$$\n2. Compute the average absolute delta-hedged profit-and-loss over the scenario shock for each hedging approach. For a given strike $K$, define\n$$\n\\text{PnL}_{\\text{method}}(K) \\;=\\; V_{\\text{true}}(S_1,K,T',r,\\sigma'(K)) \\;-\\; V_{\\text{true}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma(K)) \\;-\\; \\Delta_{\\text{method}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\cdot)\\,\\big(S_1 - S_0\\big),\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{true}}(\\cdot)$ is the “true” valuation using the strike’s implied volatility from the smile at the corresponding time, $\\Delta_{\\text{method}}$ is the delta computed at $t=0$ under either the ATM-only approach (use $\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}}$ for all $K$) or the full-smile approach (use $\\sigma(K)$ for each $K$), and the dot $\\cdot$ denotes the implied volatility input appropriate to the method. Let\n$$\n\\overline{A}_{\\text{ATM}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} \\big|\\text{PnL}_{\\text{ATM}}(K)\\big|,\\qquad\n\\overline{A}_{\\text{smile}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} \\big|\\text{PnL}_{\\text{smile}}(K)\\big|.\n$$\nReport the ratio\n$$\nR \\;=\\; \\frac{\\overline{A}_{\\text{ATM}}}{\\overline{A}_{\\text{smile}}}.\n$$\n\nTest suite of smile parameters $(a,b,c)$:\n- Case $1$: $(a,b,c) = (0.2,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$.\n- Case $2$: $(a,b,c) = (0.2,\\,-0.05,\\,0.0)$.\n- Case $3$: $(a,b,c) = (0.2,\\,-0.05,\\,0.15)$.\n\nYour program must compute, for each case in the given order, the pair $[\\text{RMSE}, R]$ as real numbers. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets and ordered by the above cases, where each case’s result is itself a two-element comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, the required output format is\n$[[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],[x_3,y_3]]$,\nwhere $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the required floats for case $i$. No additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-defined quantitative finance problem grounded in the standard Black-Scholes-Merton framework for option pricing and hedging. All parameters, models, and calculation procedures are specified unambiguously.\n\nThe solution requires the evaluation of pricing and hedging performance degradation when a simplified volatility model (constant at-the-money volatility) is used instead of a more realistic, strike-dependent volatility smile. This will be performed for three different smile parameterizations.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests upon the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for a European call option. Under the problem's stated assumptions (geometric Brownian motion, constant risk-free rate, no dividends), the price $V_c$ of a European call option is given by:\n$$ V_c(S, K, T, r, \\sigma) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2) $$\nwhere $S$ is the spot price of the underlying asset, $K$ is the strike price, $T$ is the time to maturity in years, $r$ is the continuously compounded risk-free rate, and $\\sigma$ is the volatility. The function $N(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. The terms $d_1$ and $d_2$ are defined as:\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}} $$\n$$ d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} $$\nThe delta ($\\Delta$) of the call option, which represents the sensitivity of the option price to a change in the underlying's price, is the first partial derivative of $V_c$ with respect to $S$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V_c}{\\partial S} = N(d_1) $$\nThis quantity is central to constructing a delta-neutral hedge.\n\nThe problem defines a parametric volatility smile as a function of the strike price $K$:\n$$ \\sigma(K) \\;=\\; a \\;+\\; b \\,\\ln\\!\\big(K/S_0\\big) \\;+\\; c \\,\\big(\\ln\\!\\big(K/S_0\\big)\\big)^2. $$\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the required calculations for each of the three test cases $(a,b,c)$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Root-Mean-Square Pricing Error (RMSE)**\n\nAt the initial time $t=0$, we have $S_0 = 100$, $r = 0.02$, and $T = 0.5$. For each strike $K \\in \\{70, 85, 100, 115, 130\\}$:\n1.  The \"full-smile\" volatility $\\sigma(K)$ is calculated using the given parameters $(a,b,c)$. The corresponding \"true\" price is $V_{\\text{smile}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma(K)) = V_c(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma(K))$.\n2.  The \"ATM-only\" volatility is constant for all strikes: $\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}} = \\sigma(S_0) = a$. The approximate price is $V_{\\text{ATM}}(S_0,K,T,r,\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}}) = V_c(S_0,K,T,r,a)$.\n3.  The RMSE is then computed across the set of five strikes according to the provided formula:\n    $$ \\text{RMSE} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} \\big( V_{\\text{ATM}}(K) - V_{\\text{smile}}(K) \\big)^2 } $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Hedging Performance Ratio (R)**\n\nThis step analyzes the profit-and-loss (PnL) of a one-step delta hedge under a specified market shock.\nThe initial portfolio at $t=0$ consists of a short position in one call option and a long position of $\\Delta$ shares of the underlying, where $\\Delta$ is computed at $t=0$. The value of this portfolio is $P_0 = \\Delta S_0 - V_0$.\n\nAfter the shock, at time $t_1$, the new market state is:\n-   Underlying Price: $S_1 = S_0 (1+u) = 100 \\times (1+0.01) = 101$.\n-   Time to Maturity: $T' = T - \\Delta t = 0.5 - 1/252$.\n-   New Volatility Smile: $\\sigma'(K) = \\sigma(K) + dv = \\sigma(K) + 0.01$.\n\nThe \"true\" value of the option at $t_1$ is $V_{\\text{true},1}(K) = V_c(S_1, K, T', r, \\sigma'(K))$. The value of the hedging portfolio at $t_1$ is $P_1 = \\Delta S_1 - V_{\\text{true},1}(K)$.\nThe PnL over the period is $P_1 - P_0 = (\\Delta S_1 - V_{\\text{true},1}(K)) - (\\Delta S_0 - V_0) = V_0 - V_{\\text{true},1}(K) + \\Delta(S_1 - S_0)$, which is the negative of the formula provided in the problem. The sign convention does not affect the average absolute PnL. We will use the formula as given:\n$$ \\text{PnL}(K) = V_{\\text{true},1}(K) - V_{0}(K) - \\Delta(K)(S_1 - S_0) $$\nwhere $V_0(K)$ is the \"true\" price at $t=0$, i.e., $V_{\\text{smile}}(K)$.\n\nTwo different hedging strategies are compared:\n1.  **ATM-only Hedge**: $\\Delta_{\\text{method}} = \\Delta_{\\text{ATM}}(K) = N(d_1)$ calculated using $\\sigma_{\\text{ATM}} = a$. The corresponding PnL is $\\text{PnL}_{\\text{ATM}}(K)$.\n2.  **Full-smile Hedge**: $\\Delta_{\\text{method}} = \\Delta_{\\text{smile}}(K) = N(d_1)$ calculated using $\\sigma(K)$. The corresponding PnL is $\\text{PnL}_{\\text{smile}}(K)$.\n\nFor each strategy, the average absolute PnL is computed:\n$$ \\overline{A}_{\\text{ATM}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} |\\text{PnL}_{\\text{ATM}}(K)| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{A}_{\\text{smile}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{K} |\\text{PnL}_{\\text{smile}}(K)| $$\nFinally, the ratio $R$ is determined:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\overline{A}_{\\text{ATM}}}{\\overline{A}_{\\text{smile}}} $$\nThis ratio quantifies the increase in average hedging error resulting from the use of the simplified ATM-only volatility model. A value of $R=1$ implies no difference in performance, while $R1$ indicates the ATM-only model is inferior for hedging. For Case $1$, where the smile is flat ($b=c=0$), we expect $\\sigma(K) = \\sigma_{\\text{ATM}}$, leading to $\\text{RMSE}=0$ and $R=1$.\n\nThe algorithm will be implemented in Python using `numpy` for efficient array operations and `scipy.stats.norm` for the standard normal CDF.",
