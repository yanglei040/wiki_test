It addresses a fundamental concept in time series analysis and econometrics—the impulse response function of an AR($2$) process. This is a standard topic in the field.\n- The problem is **well-posed**. It provides all necessary information (the model, initial conditions, shock specification, and properties of the characteristic roots) to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n- The problem is **objective**. Its language is precise and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- The problem is internally consistent and complete. The assumption of covariance-stationarity implies that the roots $r_1, r_2$ must lie inside the unit circle, i.e., $|r_1|1$ and $|r_2|1$, which ensures the IRF converges to zero. This is a standard and necessary condition for a non-explosive system.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution will now be presented.\n\nThe impulse response function coefficients, denoted by $\\psi_{h}$, are defined as the response of the system variable $y_t$ at time $t=h$ to a unit shock at time $t=0$, with the system being at rest prior to the shock. Formally, $\\psi_{h} \\equiv y_{h}$ given that $y_{t}=0$ for $t0$, $\\epsilon_0=1$, and $\\epsilon_t=0$ for $t \\ne 0$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the AR($2$) equation yields the dynamic path for the IRF coefficients:\n$$\n\\psi_{h} = \\phi_{1} \\psi_{h-1} + \\phi_{2} \\psi_{h-2} \\quad \\text{for } h \\ge 2\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous second-order linear difference equation. The characteristic equation associated with this difference equation is given in the problem statement as:\n$$\nr^{2} - \\phi_{1} r - \\phi_{2} = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the roots of this equation, $r_1$ and $r_2$, are real and distinct. Consequently, the general solution for $\\psi_h$ is of the form:\n$$\n\\psi_{h} = c_{1} r_{1}^{h} + c_{2} r_{2}^{h}\n$$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants to be determined from the initial conditions of the impulse response sequence.\n\nWe must find the first two values of the IRF, $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_1$.\nFor $h=0$:\n$$\n\\psi_{0} = y_{0} = \\phi_{1} y_{-1} + \\phi_{2} y_{-2} + \\epsilon_{0} = \\phi_{1}(0) + \\phi_{2}(0) + 1 = 1\n$$\nFor $h=1$:\n$$\n\\psi_{1} = y_{1} = \\phi_{1} y_{0} + \\phi_{2} y_{-1} + \\epsilon_{1} = \\phi_{1} \\psi_{0} + \\phi_{2}(0) + 0 = \\phi_{1}(1) = \\phi_{1}\n$$\nSo, the initial conditions for the difference equation are $\\psi_0 = 1$ and $\\psi_1 = \\phi_1$.\n\nWe now use these conditions to solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$:\nFor $h=0$: $\\psi_{0} = c_{1} r_{1}^{0} + c_{2} r_{2}^{0} \\implies c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$.\nFor $h=1$: $\\psi_{1} = c_{1} r_{1}^{1} + c_{2} r_{2}^{1} \\implies c_{1} r_{1} + c_{2} r_{2} = \\phi_{1}$.\n\nThis is a system of two linear equations in two variables, $c_1$ and $c_2$. From the first equation, we have $c_2 = 1 - c_1$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$\nc_{1} r_{1} + (1 - c_{1}) r_{2} = \\phi_{1}\n$$\n$$\nc_{1} (r_{1} - r_{2}) = \\phi_{1} - r_{2}\n$$\n$$\nc_{1} = \\frac{\\phi_{1} - r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}\n$$\nAnd for $c_2$:\n$$\nc_{2} = 1 - c_{1} = 1 - \\frac{\\phi_{1} - r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}} = \\frac{(r_{1} - r_{2}) - (\\phi_{1} - r_{2})}{r_{1} - r_{2}} = \\frac{r_{1} - \\phi_{1}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}\n$$\nTo simplify these expressions, we use Vieta's formulas for the roots of the quadratic characteristic equation $r^2 - \\phi_1 r - \\phi_2 = 0$. The sum of the roots is $r_1 + r_2 = \\phi_1$. Substituting $\\phi_1 = r_1 + r_2$ into the expressions for $c_1$ and $c_2$:\n$$\nc_{1} = \\frac{(r_{1} + r_{2}) - r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}} = \\frac{r_{1}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{2} = \\frac{r_{1} - (r_{1} + r_{2})}{r_{1} - r_{2}} = \\frac{-r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}\n$$\nNow, substitute these coefficients back into the general solution for $\\psi_h$:\n$$\n\\psi_{h} = \\left( \\frac{r_{1}}{r_{1} - r_{2}} \\right) r_{1}^{h} + \\left( \\frac{-r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}} \\right) r_{2}^{h}\n$$\nCombining the terms gives the final closed-form expression for the IRF coefficient $\\psi_h$ for any integer horizon $h \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\psi_{h} = \\frac{r_{1}^{h+1} - r_{2}^{h+1}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}\n$$\nThis expression can be recognized as a variant of Binet's formula, which is a specific case for the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nRegarding the qualitative shape of the IRF: The covariance-stationarity of the process requires that the roots of the characteristic polynomial lie inside the unit circle. Since the roots $r_1, r_2$ are real, this means $-1  r_{1,2}  1$. This condition ensures that $\\lim_{h \\to \\infty} \\psi_h = 0$, meaning the effect of a shock is transitory. The shape of the decay depends on the signs of the roots.\n1.  If both roots are positive ($0  r_2  r_1  1$), the IRF coefficients $\\psi_h$ are always positive and decay monotonically to zero. A shock has a persistent but diminishing positive effect.\n2.  If the roots have opposite signs (e.g., $-1  r_2  0  r_1  1$), the term $r_2^h$ alternates in sign. The IRF will thus exhibit oscillations as it decays to zero. The response may initially increase or decrease and can cross the zero axis multiple times.\n3.  If both roots are negative ($-1  r_2  r_1  0$), both $r_1^h$ and $r_2^h$ alternate in sign. The IRF will start at $\\psi_0=1$, become negative at $\\psi_1 = r_1+r_2  0$, become positive at $\\psi_2 = r_1^2 + r_1 r_2 + r_2^2  0$, and so on. This produces a pronounced oscillatory decay to zero.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of linear time series models, specifically autoregressive (AR) processes. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters, initial conditions, and a clear objective. The parameters for the given test cases correspond to stable AR processes, ensuring a meaningful, decaying impulse response. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical computation of the Impulse Response Function (IRF) for a univariate autoregressive model of order $3$, denoted AR($3$). The model is specified by the equation:\n$$\ny_t = \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + \\phi_3 y_{t-3} + \\varepsilon_t\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\varepsilon_t\\}$ is a white-noise process with zero mean, $E[\\varepsilon_t] = 0$, and finite variance.\n\nThe IRF, denoted by the sequence $\\{\\psi_h\\}_{h=0}^\\infty$, describes the evolution of the process $\\{y_t\\}$ in response to a single, one-time shock at time $t=0$, assuming the system was in equilibrium (zero) before the shock. The specified conditions are:\n1.  A unit impulse at time $t=0$: $\\varepsilon_0 = 1$ and $\\varepsilon_t=0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n2.  Zero initial conditions: $y_t = 0$ for all $t  0$. In particular, $y_{-1} = y_{-2} = y_{-3} = 0$.\n\nThe IRF coefficients $\\psi_h$ are simply the values of the process $y_h$ under these specific conditions, i.e., $\\psi_h \\equiv y_h$ for $h \\ge 0$. We can compute these values recursively.\n\nFor horizon $h=0$:\n$$\n\\psi_0 = y_0 = \\phi_1 y_{-1} + \\phi_2 y_{-2} + \\phi_3 y_{-3} + \\varepsilon_0\n$$\nSubstituting the initial conditions and the impulse value:\n$$\n\\psi_0 = \\phi_1(0) + \\phi_2(0) + \\phi_3(0) + 1 = 1\n$$\nThe instantaneous impact of a unit shock on the process is always one.\n\nFor any horizon $h  0$:\n$$\n\\psi_h = y_h = \\phi_1 y_{h-1} + \\phi_2 y_{h-2} + \\phi_3 y_{h-3} + \\varepsilon_h\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_h=0$ for $h  0$ and $y_k=\\psi_k$ for $k \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\psi_h = \\phi_1 \\psi_{h-1} + \\phi_2 \\psi_{h-2} + \\phi_3 \\psi_{h-3}\n$$\nThis is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation for the IRF coefficients for $h \\ge 1$. The initial values for this recurrence are derived from the pre-sample history and the initial impact $\\psi_0$. We can formally define $\\psi_k = 0$ for $k  0$. This allows for a unified computation.\n\nLet's compute the first few terms explicitly:\n-   $\\psi_0 = 1$\n-   $\\psi_1 = \\phi_1 \\psi_0 + \\phi_2 \\psi_{-1} + \\phi_3 \\psi_{-2} = \\phi_1 (1) + \\phi_2(0) + \\phi_3(0) = \\phi_1$\n-   $\\psi_2 = \\phi_1 \\psi_1 + \\phi_2 \\psi_0 + \\phi_3 \\psi_{-1} = \\phi_1(\\phi_1) + \\phi_2(1) + \\phi_3(0) = \\phi_1^2 + \\phi_2$\n-   $\\psi_3 = \\phi_1 \\psi_2 + \\phi_2 \\psi_1 + \\phi_3 \\psi_0 = \\phi_1(\\phi_1^2+\\phi_2) + \\phi_2(\\phi_1) + \\phi_3(1) = \\phi_1^3 + 2\\phi_1\\phi_2 + \\phi_3$\n-   For $h \\ge 3$, the recurrence uses only previously computed positive-indexed $\\psi$ terms: $\\psi_h = \\phi_1 \\psi_{h-1} + \\phi_2 \\psi_{h-2} + \\phi_3 \\psi_{h-3}$.\n\nThe numerical algorithm is a direct implementation of this recursive calculation. For an AR($p$) model (with $p=3$ here), we need to maintain a history of the last $p$ values of the process to compute the next one. We can use an array, say `y_ext`, of size $H+1+p$ to store the full history of the process from time $t=-p$ to $t=H$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\phi} = [\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3]$ and the horizon $H$. The order of the process is $p=3$.\n2.  Initialize a numerical array `y_ext` of size $H+1+p$ with all elements set to zero. This automatically satisfies the zero initial conditions $y_{-1}=y_{-2}=y_{-3}=0$, which correspond to indices $p-1, p-2, \\dots, 0$ of `y_ext`.\n3.  Iterate for time $t$ from $0$ to $H$. The value $y_t$ will be stored at index $t+p$ in `y_ext`.\n4.  In each iteration $t$:\n    a.  Define the shock $\\varepsilon_t$. It is $1$ if $t=0$, and $0$ otherwise.\n    b.  Compute $y_t$ using the AR($3$) formula. This involves a dot product between the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ and the vector of the last $p$ values of the process, $[y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, y_{t-3}]$. These past values are retrieved from the `y_ext` array.\n    c.  Add the shock $\\varepsilon_t$ to the result.\n    d.  Store the computed $y_t$ at index $t+p$ in `y_ext`.\n5.  After the loop completes, the IRF sequence $\\{\\psi_0, \\psi_1, \\dots, \\psi_H\\}$ corresponds to the values $\\{y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_H\\}$, which are stored in `y_ext` from index $p$ to $p+H$.\n6.  The final numerical values are formatted to $6$ decimal places as required.\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases provided in the problem statement.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is rigorously defined, self-contained, and consistent with the principles of linear systems theory as applied in computational econometrics. No inconsistencies or fallacies are detected. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a scalar quantity, $\\Delta$, which represents the difference between the cumulative impulse responses of aggregate inflation ($\\pi_t$) to a demand-side shock and a supply-side shock. The system dynamics are governed by the linear model:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_t = A \\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + B \\mathbf{e}_t\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} p^c_t \\\\ \\pi_t \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe impulse response function, $\\mathrm{IRF}_j(h)$, measures the effect of a unit structural shock of type $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ at time $t=0$ on the state vector $\\mathbf{x}_h$ at horizon $h$. It is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{IRF}_j(h) = A^h \\mathbf{b}_j\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{b}_j$ is the $j$-th column of the matrix $B$. The shock $j=1$ corresponds to the supply-side shock, and $j=2$ corresponds to the demand-side shock.\n\nWe are interested in the response of the second variable, aggregate inflation $\\pi_t$. To extract this component from the vector $\\mathrm{IRF}_j(h)$, we use the standard basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_2' = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The inflation response at horizon $h$ to shock $j$ is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{IRF}_j(h)]_2 = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\mathrm{IRF}_j(h) = \\mathbf{e}_2' A^h \\mathbf{b}_j\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the cumulative inflation responses over horizons $h=0, 1, \\ldots, H$. The cumulative response to the demand-side shock ($j=2$) is:\n$$\nC^{\\text{dem}} = \\sum_{h=0}^{H} [\\mathrm{IRF}_2(h)]_2 = \\sum_{h=0}^{H} \\mathbf{e}_2' A^h \\mathbf{b}_2\n$$\nAnd the cumulative response to the supply-side shock ($j=1$) is:\n$$\nC^{\\text{sup}} = \\sum_{h=0}^{H} [\\mathrm{IRF}_1(h)]_2 = \\sum_{h=0}^{H} \\mathbf{e}_2' A^h \\mathbf{b}_1\n$$\n\nBy the linearity of matrix operations, we can factor out the constant terms from the summation:\n$$\nC^{\\text{dem}} = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left( \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h \\right) \\mathbf{b}_2\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\text{sup}} = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left( \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h \\right) \\mathbf{b}_1\n$$\n\nThe target quantity is $\\Delta = C^{\\text{dem}} - C^{\\text{sup}}$. Substituting the expressions above:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left( \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h \\right) \\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left( \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h \\right) \\mathbf{b}_1\n$$\nFactoring again yields a more compact expression:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left( \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h \\right) (\\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mathbf{b}_1)\n$$\nThis is the fundamental equation for our computation.\n\nThe term $\\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h$ is a finite geometric series of matrices. A direct, iterative summation is computationally valid but inefficient. A more elegant and numerically superior approach is to use the closed-form solution for the geometric sum. Let $S_H = \\sum_{h=0}^{H} A^h = I + A + A^2 + \\dots + A^H$. Then we have $(I - A)S_H = (I - A)(I + A + \\dots + A^H) = I - A^{H+1}$.\nProvided that the matrix $(I - A)$ is invertible, we can write:\n$$\nS_H = (I - A^{H+1}) (I - A)^{-1}\n$$\nThe invertibility of $(I - A)$ is guaranteed if $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$. For the economic systems given, stability requires that all eigenvalues of $A$ lie inside the unit circle, which implies their moduli are strictly less than $1$. An inspection of the provided matrices $A$ confirms this condition holds for all test cases. Therefore, the use of this closed-form expression is justified and correct.\n\nThe final computational formula for $\\Delta$ is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathbf{e}_2' \\left[ (I - A^{H+1}) (I - A)^{-1} \\right] (\\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mathbf{b}_1)\n$$\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. Given the matrices $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$, and the integer horizon $H$.\n$2$. Extract the column vectors $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ from $B$.\n$3$. Compute the difference vector $\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{diff}} = \\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mathbf{b}_1$.\n$4$. Compute the matrix power $A^{H+1}$.\n$5$. Compute the matrix inverse $(I - A)^{-1}$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$6$. Compute the matrix sum $S_H = (I - A^{H+1}) (I - A)^{-1}$.\n$7$. Compute the resulting vector $\\mathbf{v} = S_H \\mathbf{b}_{\\text{diff}}$.\n$8$. The scalar $\\Delta$ is the second element of $\\mathbf{v}$, i.e., $\\Delta = [\\mathbf{v}]_2$.\n\nThis procedure is robust and will be implemented for all specified test cases. The numerical precision will be handled by standard floating-point arithmetic, with the final output formatted to six decimal places as requested.",
