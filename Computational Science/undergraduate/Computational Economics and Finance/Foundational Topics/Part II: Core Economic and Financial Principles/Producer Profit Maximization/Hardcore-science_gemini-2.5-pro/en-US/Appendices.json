The use of an exponential function for a success probability and a quadratic function for cost is common in economic modeling to ensure desirable properties such as diminishing returns and increasing marginal cost. The assumption of risk-neutrality simplifies the utility function to be linear in money. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies an objective function (expected profit) to be maximized with respect to two choice variables ($w$ and $h$), subject to given functional forms and parameter constraints ($\\alpha  0$, $\\gamma  0$). The assumption of an interior solution directs the methodology towards standard differential calculus, ensuring a unique solution can be found.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded optimization problem. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe worker's expected profit, denoted by $\\Pi(w, h)$, is the expected revenue minus the opportunity cost. The expected revenue is the revenue from being matched, $w h$, multiplied by the probability of being matched, $p(w)$, plus the revenue from being unmatched, $0$, multiplied by the probability of being unmatched, $1-p(w)$. The opportunity cost $c(h)$ is incurred regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe expected profit function is therefore:\n$$\n\\Pi(w, h) = p(w) \\cdot (wh) + (1 - p(w)) \\cdot 0 - c(h)\n$$\nSubstituting the given functional forms for $p(w)$ and $c(h)$:\n$$\n\\Pi(w, h) = \\exp(-\\alpha w) w h - \\frac{\\gamma}{2} h^{2}\n$$\nTo maximize this function with respect to $w$ and $h$, we find the first-order partial derivatives and set them to zero. This is the first-order condition for a critical point. The problem's assumption of an interior solution guarantees that such a point corresponds to the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we differentiate with respect to the wage, $w$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} \\left( w h \\exp(-\\alpha w) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2} h^{2} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation on the first term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial w} = h \\cdot \\frac{d}{dw}(w \\exp(-\\alpha w)) = h \\left( 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha w) + w \\cdot (-\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha w)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial w} = h \\exp(-\\alpha w) (1 - \\alpha w)\n$$\nSetting this partial derivative to zero gives the first condition:\n$$\nh \\exp(-\\alpha w) (1 - \\alpha w) = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we differentiate with respect to the hours, $h$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial h} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} \\left( w h \\exp(-\\alpha w) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2} h^{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial h} = w \\exp(-\\alpha w) - \\gamma h\n$$\nSetting this partial derivative to zero gives the second condition:\n$$\nw \\exp(-\\alpha w) - \\gamma h = 0\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $w$ and $h$:\n1. $h \\exp(-\\alpha w) (1 - \\alpha w) = 0$\n2. $w \\exp(-\\alpha w) - \\gamma h = 0$\n\nFrom equation $(1)$, because we are seeking an interior solution where $h^{\\star}  0$, and since the term $\\exp(-\\alpha w)$ is strictly positive for any finite $w$, the equation can only be satisfied if the term $(1 - \\alpha w)$ is equal to zero.\n$$\n1 - \\alpha w = 0\n$$\nSolving for $w$ gives the optimal wage rate, $w^{\\star}$:\n$$\nw^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$ is given, $w^{\\star}$ is positive, which is consistent with an interior solution.\n\nNow, we substitute this optimal wage $w^{\\star}$ into equation $(2)$ to find the optimal hours, $h^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\right) - \\gamma h = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-1) - \\gamma h = 0\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $h$:\n$$\n\\gamma h = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-1) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha e}\n$$\nThis gives the optimal hours, $h^{\\star}$:\n$$\nh^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\gamma e}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$ and $\\gamma  0$ are given, $h^{\\star}$ is also positive, consistent with an interior solution.\n\nThus, the profit-maximizing choices are $(w^{\\star}, h^{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\gamma e}\\right)$.\n\nTo be rigorous, we can verify this is a maximum using the second-order conditions. The Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives is:\n$$ H(w,h) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w^2}  \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w \\partial h} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial h \\partial w}  \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial h^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w^2} = -h\\alpha\\exp(-\\alpha w)(2 - \\alpha w) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial h^2} = -\\gamma $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w \\partial h} = \\exp(-\\alpha w)(1 - \\alpha w) $$\nAt the critical point where $w^{\\star} = 1/\\alpha$ and $h^{\\star} = 1/(\\alpha \\gamma e)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w^2}\\bigg|_{(w^{\\star},h^{\\star})} = -h^{\\star}\\alpha\\exp(-1)(2 - 1) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\gamma e}\\alpha e^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma e^2}  0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial h^2}\\bigg|_{(w^{\\star},h^{\\star})} = -\\gamma  0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w \\partial h}\\bigg|_{(w^{\\star},h^{\\star})} = \\exp(-1)(1 - 1) = 0 $$\nThe determinant of the Hessian at this point is:\n$$ D = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\gamma e^2}\\right)(-\\gamma) - (0)^2 = \\frac{1}{e^2}  0 $$\nSince the determinant $D$ is positive and $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w^2}$ is negative, the critical point is a local maximum, as required.\n\nThe profit-maximizing choices are given by the derived expressions for $w^{\\star}$ and $h^{\\star}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the optimal period $0$ price, $p_0^{\\ast}$, for a monopolist facing potential entry in a subsequent period. The firm's objective is to maximize the expected discounted sum of its profits over two periods, $t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Time periods: $t \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n- Direct demand function: $q_t = A - B p_t$\n- Demand parameters: $A  0$, $B  0$\n- Price range: $p_t \\in [0, A/B]$\n- Marginal cost: $c$, constant, with $0  c  A/B$\n- Fixed cost: $0$\n- Discount factor: $\\beta \\in (0,1)$\n- Competitor entry: Occurs before period $1$ pricing.\n- Probability of entry: $p \\in [0,1]$, independent of the incumbent's actions.\n- Outcome with entry: Bertrand competition in period $1$, $p_1=c$, incumbent's period $1$ profit is $0$.\n- Outcome with no entry: Incumbent is a monopolist in period $1$.\n- Choice variable: Period $0$ price, $p_0$.\n- Objective: Maximize $\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_0 + \\beta \\Pi_1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a standard exercise in dynamic programming and industrial organization.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The model is based on established microeconomic principles, including monopoly pricing, Bertrand competition, and expected profit maximization. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The objective function and choice variable are clearly defined. The parameters and stochastic elements are specified. The use of the term \"independently\" for the entry probability is crucial, as it removes any potential ambiguity about the relationship between the period $0$ price and the likelihood of entry. This ensures the problem is well-posed. The statement \"inverse market demand is linear and given by $p_t$ with corresponding quantity demanded $q_t = A - B p_t$\" is slightly imprecise phrasing, as $q_t(p_t)$ is the direct demand function. However, the mathematical relationship is unambiguous and can be inverted to $p_t(q_t) = \\frac{A}{B} - \\frac{1}{B}q_t$, so this does not constitute a flaw.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, mathematical language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, self-contained, and solvable problem in economic theory. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe incumbent seeks to maximize its total expected discounted profit, $\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi]$, given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi] = \\Pi_0 + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1]\n$$\nwhere $\\Pi_0$ is the profit in period $0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1]$ is the expected profit in period $1$, viewed from the start of period $0$. This is a dynamic problem, which is properly solved using backward induction, starting with period $1$.\n\n**Period 1 Analysis**\nThe profit in period $1$ depends on the stochastic event of competitor entry.\n- If the competitor enters (with probability $p$), the market becomes a Bertrand duopoly. With a homogeneous good and constant identical marginal cost $c$, the unique Nash equilibrium is for both firms to set their price equal to marginal cost. Thus, $p_1 = c$. The incumbent's profit in this state is $\\Pi_1^{\\text{entry}} = (p_1 - c)q_1 = (c - c)q_1 = 0$.\n- If the competitor does not enter (with probability $1-p$), the incumbent remains a monopolist. It will set the period $1$ price, $p_1^M$, to maximize its period $1$ profit, $\\Pi_1^M$. The profit function for the period $1$ monopolist is:\n$$\n\\Pi_1^M(p_1) = (p_1 - c)q_1 = (p_1 - c)(A - B p_1)\n$$\nTo find the optimal monopoly price, we take the first-order condition of $\\Pi_1^M(p_1)$ with respect to $p_1$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi_1^M}{dp_1} = \\frac{d}{dp_1}(A p_1 - B p_1^2 - A c + B c p_1) = A - 2B p_1 + B c = 0\n$$\nSolving for $p_1$:\n$$\n2B p_1 = A + B c \\implies p_1^M = \\frac{A + B c}{2B}\n$$\nThe second-order condition, $\\frac{d^2\\Pi_1^M}{dp_1^2} = -2B$, is negative since $B  0$, confirming this price yields a maximum.\nThe corresponding maximum profit for the monopolist in period $1$ is:\n$$\n\\Pi_1^M = \\left(\\frac{A + B c}{2B} - c\\right)\\left(A - B\\frac{A + B c}{2B}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{A - B c}{2B}\\right)\\left(\\frac{A - B c}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(A - B c)^2}{4B}\n$$\nThe expected profit in period $1$, calculated before the entry event is known, is the weighted average of the profits in the two states:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1] = p \\cdot \\Pi_1^{\\text{entry}} + (1-p) \\cdot \\Pi_1^M = p \\cdot 0 + (1-p) \\frac{(A - B c)^2}{4B} = (1-p) \\frac{(A - B c)^2}{4B}\n$$\n\n**Period 0 Analysis**\nThe incumbent chooses the price in period $0$, $p_0$, to maximize the total expected discounted profit. The objective function is:\n$$\n\\max_{p_0} \\mathbb{E}[\\Pi](p_0) = \\Pi_0(p_0) + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Pi_0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1]$:\n$$\n\\max_{p_0} \\left\\{ (p_0 - c)(A - B p_0) + \\beta (1-p) \\frac{(A - B c)^2}{4B} \\right\\}\n$$\nA critical observation is that the choice of $p_0$ has no influence on the events or profits of period $1$. The problem states that competitor entry occurs \"independently,\" meaning the probability $p$ is an exogenous parameter and not a function of $p_0$. Consequently, the entire second term, $\\beta \\mathbb{E}[\\Pi_1]$, is a constant with respect to the optimization variable $p_0$.\nTherefore, maximizing the total expected discounted profit is equivalent to maximizing the period $0$ profit:\n$$\n\\max_{p_0} \\Pi_0(p_0) = \\max_{p_0} (p_0 - c)(A - B p_0)\n$$\nThis is the standard, single-period monopoly pricing problem. The functional form of the profit function is identical to the one solved for the period $1$ monopolist. The first-order condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi_0}{dp_0} = A - 2B p_0 + B c = 0\n$$\nSolving for the optimal period $0$ price, $p_0^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np_0^{\\ast} = \\frac{A + B c}{2B}\n$$\nThis can also be written as $p_0^{\\ast} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2}$. The parameters $\\beta$ and $p$, while affecting the total value of the firm's expected profit stream, do not influence the optimal pricing decision in period $0$ due to the lack of any channel (such as limit pricing or learning) connecting the period $0$ action to period $1$ outcomes.",

The candidate set for the optimal quantity $q_1^\\star$ is constructed as follows:\n1.  **Boundary and Kink Points**: The point $q_1=0$ (non-negativity constraint), the prestige threshold $q_1 = q_{\\text{bar}}$, and the dilution-to-zero-profit point $q_1 = q_{\\text{crit}}$ are all potential candidates for the optimum.\n2.  **Stationary Points**: We find the stationary points by setting the derivative $\\frac{d\\Pi}{dq_1}$ to zero in each smooth region.\n    -   For $0 \\le q_1  q_{\\text{bar}}$, the objective function simplifies, and the stationary point is the standard static monopoly quantity $q_{S1} = (A_1-c)/(2B_1)$.\n    -   For $q_{\\text{bar}}  q_1  q_{\\text{crit}}$, the derivative leads to a different stationary point, let's call it $q_{S2}$:\n        $$ q_{S2} = \\frac{2B_2(A_1 - c) - \\beta d(A_2 - c + dq_{\\text{bar}})}{4B_1B_2 - \\beta d^2} $$\n        This point is a candidate only if it falls within its region of validity and if the denominator $4B_1B_2 - \\beta d^2$ is not zero. If the denominator is negative, the objective function is locally convex, and the maximum on this segment must lie at its boundaries ($q_{\\text{bar}}$ or $q_{\\text{crit}}$).\n    -   For $q_1  q_{\\text{crit}}$, period-$2$ profit is zero. The objective is again the period-$1$ profit function, with stationary point $q_{S1}$.\n\nThe algorithmic approach is to assemble a set of all such candidate points, ensuring we include all kink points and all relevant stationary points that are feasible ($q_1 \\ge 0$). We then evaluate the total profit function $\\Pi(q_1)$ at each candidate point. The value of $q_1$ that yields the highest profit is the optimal quantity $q_1^\\star$.\n\n**Step 4: Computing Final Results**\n\nOnce the optimal $q_1^\\star$ is determined, the remaining equilibrium values are calculated as follows:\n-   Period-1 price: $p_1^\\star = A_1 - B_1 q_1^\\star$.\n-   Effective period-2 intercept: $A_{2, \\text{eff}}^\\star = A_2 - d \\cdot \\max\\{0, q_1^\\star - q_{\\text{bar}}\\}$.\n-   Period-2 quantity: $q_2^\\star = \\max\\{0, (A_{2, \\text{eff}}^\\star - c) / (2B_2)\\}$.\n-   Period-2 price: If $q_2^\\star  0$, $p_2^\\star = (A_{2, \\text{eff}}^\\star + c) / 2$. If $q_2^\\star = 0$, the market clearing price is the choke price $p_2^\\star = A_{2, \\text{eff}}^\\star$.\n-   Total discounted profit: $\\Pi^\\star = (p_1^\\star - c)q_1^\\star + \\beta (p_2^\\star - c)q_2^\\star$.\n\nThis systematic procedure guarantees finding the unique profit-maximizing outcome for the given problem structure.",
