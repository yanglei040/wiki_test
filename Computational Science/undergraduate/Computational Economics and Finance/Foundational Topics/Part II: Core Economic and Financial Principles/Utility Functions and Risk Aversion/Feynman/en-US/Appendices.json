            "solution": "The problem requires the inference of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, $\\gamma$, from an investor's observed optimal portfolio allocation. We begin by validating the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\n- Investor utility function: $U(W) = \\frac{W^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$ for $\\gamma > 0$, $\\gamma \\neq 1$. This is a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function.\n- Risky asset (SP 500) price dynamics: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S_t}{S_t} = \\mu \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}B_t$.\n- Risk-free asset return rate: constant $r$.\n- Portfolio allocation: A constant fraction $\\omega$ is invested in the risky asset, and $1-\\omega$ in the risk-free asset.\n- Observed and given parameters:\n  - $\\omega = 0.60$\n  - $\\mu = 0.07$ (annualized expected return of the risky asset)\n  - $\\sigma = 0.20$ (annualized volatility of the risky asset)\n  - $r = 0.02$ (annualized risk-free rate)\n  - Investment horizon: $[0,T]$.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded as it is a direct application of Merton's portfolio problem, a classical and fundamental topic in mathematical finance. It is well-posed, as a unique value for $\\gamma$ can be determined from the provided parameters and the established theoretical model. The problem is stated objectively with precise numerical values and functional forms. It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The parameter values provided are realistic for financial markets. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be constructed.\n\nStep 3: Proceed with Solution.\nThe investor's objective is to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth, $E[U(W_T)]$. For an investor with a CRRA utility function operating in a market with a single risky asset following a Geometric Brownian Motion and a constant risk-free rate, the optimal proportion of wealth to allocate to the risky asset, $\\omega^*$, is constant over time. This is a standard result from Merton's portfolio theory.\n\nLet $W_t$ be the investor's wealth at time $t$. The dynamics of the wealth process are determined by the returns on the portfolio components. The change in wealth, $dW_t$, is given by the sum of the returns from the risky and risk-free positions:\n$$ dW_t = (\\omega W_t) \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} + ((1-\\omega)W_t) r dt $$\nSubstituting the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the risky asset, $\\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dB_t$:\n$$ dW_t = \\omega W_t (\\mu dt + \\sigma dB_t) + (1-\\omega)W_t r dt $$\nWe can rearrange this by grouping the deterministic ($dt$) and stochastic ($dB_t$) terms:\n$$ dW_t = [\\omega \\mu + (1-\\omega)r] W_t dt + \\omega \\sigma W_t dB_t $$\nDividing by $W_t$ gives the SDE for the rate of return of the wealth portfolio:\n$$ \\frac{dW_t}{W_t} = [\\omega(\\mu - r) + r] dt + \\omega \\sigma dB_t $$\nThe solution to the optimization problem $\\max_{\\omega} E\\left[\\frac{W_T^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}\\right]$ yields the optimal allocation $\\omega^*$. The coefficient of relative risk aversion for the given utility function is defined as $RRA(W) = - \\frac{W U''(W)}{U'(W)}$. For the specified utility function, $U'(W) = W^{-\\gamma}$ and $U''(W) = -\\gamma W^{-\\gamma-1}$, which gives $RRA(W) = - \\frac{W (-\\gamma W^{-\\gamma-1})}{W^{-\\gamma}} = \\gamma$.\n\nThe well-known Merton's ratio gives the optimal allocation as:\n$$ \\omega^* = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\gamma \\sigma^2} $$\nHere, $\\mu - r$ is the market price of risk, or the equity risk premium. The term $\\gamma \\sigma^2$ is the product of the investor's risk aversion and the variance of the risky asset's returns.\n\nThe problem states that the investor maintains a constant allocation $\\omega = 0.60$. We equate this observed allocation to the investor's optimal allocation, so we set $\\omega^* = \\omega$. We are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\mu = 0.07$\n- $r = 0.02$\n- $\\sigma = 0.20$\n- $\\omega^* = 0.60$\n\nWe can now solve for the implied coefficient of relative risk aversion, $\\gamma$, by rearranging the formula for the optimal allocation:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\omega^* \\sigma^2} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{0.07 - 0.02}{0.60 \\times (0.20)^2} $$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- The equity risk premium: $\\mu - r = 0.05$.\n- The variance of the risky asset: $\\sigma^2 = (0.20)^2 = 0.04$.\n- The denominator product: $\\omega^* \\sigma^2 = 0.60 \\times 0.04 = 0.024$.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{0.05}{0.024} $$\nTo compute the numerical value, we can express this as a fraction of integers:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{50}{24} = \\frac{25}{12} $$\nThis evaluates to approximately $2.08333...$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\gamma \\approx 2.08 $$\nThis value is a plausible measure of risk aversion.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of a risk aversion parameter, $\\gamma$, by maximizing the log-likelihood of a series of observed binary choices.

The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity and Completeness**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical definitions and objective numerical data. All parameters, functions, and data required for a solution are explicitly provided. The problem is self-contained and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.

This is achieved through numerical optimization.\n\nThe utility function is:\n$$\nU(W, \\gamma) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{W^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma},  \\gamma \\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln(W),  \\gamma = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor each choice task $i$, defined by the tuple $(S_i, p_i, x_{h,i}, x_{\\ell,i}, c_i)$, we first compute the utility difference $\\Delta_i(\\gamma)$:\n$$\n\\Delta_i(\\gamma) = \\left[ p_i \\cdot U(x_{h,i}, \\gamma) + (1-p_i) \\cdot U(x_{\\ell,i}, \\gamma) \\right] - U(S_i, \\gamma)\n$$\nThe probability of having chosen the risky lottery is then:\n$$\nP_{\\text{risky},i}(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta_i(\\gamma)\\right)}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood contribution from observation $i$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_i(\\gamma) = c_i \\cdot \\log\\left(P_{\\text{risky},i}(\\gamma)\\right) + (1-c_i)\\cdot \\log\\left(1 - P_{\\text{risky},i}(\\gamma)\\right)\n$$\nThe total log-likelihood for a dataset is $L(\\gamma) = \\sum_{i} \\ell_i(\\gamma)$. Our objective is to solve the following optimization problem for each dataset:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma} = \\arg\\max_{\\gamma \\in [0.01, 3.0]} L(\\gamma)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma} = \\arg\\min_{\\gamma \\in [0.01, 3.0]} -L(\\gamma)\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional, bounded optimization problem. It can be solved efficiently using a standard numerical algorithm, such as the one provided by `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` with the `bounded` method.\n\nFor numerical stability, the log-likelihood calculation should avoid direct computation of $\\exp(-z)$ for large $z$ and $\\log(p)$ for $p$ near $0$. Let $z_i = \\lambda \\Delta_i(\\gamma)$. The log-probability of choosing the risky and certain options can be expressed using the log-sigmoid function, which is often implemented in a numerically stable way. Specifically, $\\log(P_{\\text{risky}}) = \\log(\\sigma(z)) = -\\log(1+e^{-z})$ and $\\log(1-P_{\\text{risky}}) = \\log(\\sigma(-z)) = -\\log(1+e^{z})$. This avoids overflow and maintains precision.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each dataset, define an objective function that takes $\\gamma$ as input and returns the negative of the total log-likelihood, $-L(\\gamma)$.\n$2$. Use a numerical minimization routine to find the value of $\\gamma$ in the interval $[0.01, 3.0]$ that minimizes this objective function.\n$3$. The resulting value of $\\gamma$ is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate. This process is repeated for Datasets A, B, and C.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the value of diversification, $V$, defined as the difference between the certainty equivalent of an equally weighted portfolio, $\\mathrm{CE}(P)$, and the certainty equivalent of a single asset, $\\mathrm{CE}(X_1)$. The portfolio is $P=\\tfrac{1}{2}X_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}X_2$, where asset returns $X_1$ and $X_2$ are jointly normally distributed. The agent's utility is of the exponential form $u(x)=-\\exp(-ax)$ with a coefficient of absolute risk aversion $a0$.\n\nFirst, we derive a general formula for the certainty equivalent, $\\mathrm{CE}(Y)$, of a random payoff $Y$ that follows a normal distribution, $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$. The certainty equivalent $c=\\mathrm{CE}(Y)$ is defined by the relation $u(c) = \\mathbb{E}[u(Y)]$.\nThe expected utility is given by $\\mathbb{E}[u(Y)] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\exp(-aY)] = -\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-aY)]$.\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-aY)]$ corresponds to the moment-generating function (MGF) of the normal random variable $Y$, $M_Y(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(tY)]$, evaluated at $t=-a$. The MGF of a normal distribution is $M_Y(t) = \\exp(\\mu_Y t + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma_Y^2 t^2)$.\nSubstituting $t=-a$, we obtain:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-aY)] = M_Y(-a) = \\exp(\\mu_Y(-a) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma_Y^2(-a)^2) = \\exp(-a\\mu_Y + \\tfrac{1}{2}a^2\\sigma_Y^2) $$\nThus, the expected utility is $\\mathbb{E}[u(Y)] = -\\exp(-a\\mu_Y + \\tfrac{1}{2}a^2\\sigma_Y^2)$.\nBy definition of the certainty equivalent $c$, we have $u(c) = -\\exp(-ac)$. Equating this with the expected utility:\n$$ -\\exp(-ac) = -\\exp(-a\\mu_Y + \\tfrac{1}{2}a^2\\sigma_Y^2) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and dividing by $-a$ (since $a0$) yields the expression for the certainty equivalent:\n$$ c = \\mu_Y - \\tfrac{1}{2}a\\sigma_Y^2 $$\nThis is the well-known certainty equivalent for an agent with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility facing a normally distributed payoff.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the specific assets in the problem.\nFor asset $X_1$, we are given that $X_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)$. Its certainty equivalent is therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{CE}(X_1) = \\mu_1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}a\\sigma_1^2 $$\n\nFor the portfolio $P=\\tfrac{1}{2}X_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}X_2$, we must first determine its distribution. As a linear combination of jointly normal random variables, $P$ is also normally distributed. We compute its mean, $\\mu_P$, and variance, $\\sigma_P^2$.\nThe mean of the portfolio is:\n$$ \\mu_P = \\mathbb{E}[P] = \\mathbb{E}[\\tfrac{1}{2}X_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}X_2] = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[X_1] + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[X_2] = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_2 $$\nThe variance of the portfolio is:\n$$ \\sigma_P^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(P) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\tfrac{1}{2}X_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}X_2) = (\\tfrac{1}{2})^2\\mathrm{Var}(X_1) + (\\tfrac{1}{2})^2\\mathrm{Var}(X_2) + 2(\\tfrac{1}{2})(\\tfrac{1}{2})\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) $$\nUsing $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma_i^2$ and $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_P^2 = \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_2^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 $$\nNow we can compute the certainty equivalent of the portfolio $P$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CE}(P) = \\mu_P - \\tfrac{1}{2}a\\sigma_P^2 = (\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_2) - \\tfrac{1}{2}a(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_2^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the value of diversification, $V = \\mathrm{CE}(P) - \\mathrm{CE}(X_1)$.\n$$ V = \\left[ (\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_2) - \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_2^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2) \\right] - \\left[ \\mu_1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}a\\sigma_1^2 \\right] $$\nWe group the terms by mean and variance components:\n$$ V = (\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_2 - \\mu_1) - \\tfrac{a}{2} \\left[ (\\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_2^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2) - \\sigma_1^2 \\right] $$\nSimplifying each part:\n$$ V = (\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_2 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu_1) - \\tfrac{a}{2} \\left[ \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sigma_2^2 - \\tfrac{3}{4}\\sigma_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\right] $$\nTo obtain the final compact form, we distribute the factors:\n$$ V = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1) - \\tfrac{a}{8}(\\sigma_2^2 - 3\\sigma_1^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ V = \\tfrac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{2} + \\tfrac{a}{8}(3\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_2^2 - 2\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2) $$\nThis analytical expression is used to compute the value of $V$ for each test case provided in the problem statement.",
