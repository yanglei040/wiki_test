Let the vector of gross domestic products (GDP) in a common monetary unit be $g \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $g = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.

Choose $A$ so that the sum of the off-diagonal entries of $T$ equals $S$. Compute the numerical value of $A$. Provide a single real number; no rounding is required, and do not include units with your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation. It is found to be scientifically grounded, describing a standard gravity model of trade from computational economics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. It is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All necessary conditions for validity are satisfied. Therefore, a solution is derived as follows.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the value of the proportionality constant $A$, given the vector of gross domestic products $g$, the distance matrix $D$, the mask matrix $M$, and the total observed bilateral trade $S$. The matrix of predicted bilateral trade flows, $T$, is defined by the equation:\n$$\nT \\;=\\; A \\,\\big( (g g^{\\top}) \\oslash D \\big) \\circ M\n$$\nThe condition to determine $A$ is that the sum of the off-diagonal entries of $T$ must be equal to the total observed trade $S = 2.95$. Let us denote the sum of all entries of a matrix $X$ by $\\Sigma(X)$. The condition is $\\sum_{i \\neq j} T_{ij} = S$.\n\nThe mask matrix $M$ is defined as:\n$$\nM \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe entries on the main diagonal of $M$ are all $0$. The definition of the Hadamard product $\\circ$ implies that the entries on the main diagonal of $T$ will also be $0$, since $(X \\circ M)_{ii} = X_{ii} M_{ii} = X_{ii} \\cdot 0 = 0$. Consequently, the sum of the off-diagonal entries of $T$ is identical to the sum of all entries of $T$. The governing equation is therefore $\\Sigma(T) = S$.\n\nLet us define the matrix $T_0 = \\big( (g g^{\\top}) \\oslash D \\big) \\circ M$. The trade matrix is then $T = A \\cdot T_0$. The sum of its elements is $\\Sigma(T) = \\Sigma(A \\cdot T_0) = A \\cdot \\Sigma(T_0)$. The equation to solve for $A$ becomes:\n$$\nA \\cdot \\Sigma(T_0) = S\n$$\nwhich yields $A = \\frac{S}{\\Sigma(T_0)}$. Our task reduces to computing the numerical value of $\\Sigma(T_0)$.\n\nThe given data are:\n$S = 2.95$, $g = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $D = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the outer product $g g^{\\top}$:\n$$\ng g^{\\top} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\times 2 & 2 \\times 3 & 2 \\times 5 \\\\ 3 \\times 2 & 3 \\times 3 & 3 \\times 5 \\\\ 5 \\times 2 & 5 \\times 3 & 5 \\times 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 & 10 \\\\ 6 & 9 & 15 \\\\ 10 & 15 & 25 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSecond, we perform the Hadamard (element-wise) division of $g g^{\\top}$ by the distance matrix $D$:\n$$\n(g g^{\\top}) \\oslash D \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{4}{1} & \\frac{6}{1} & \\frac{10}{2} \\\\ \\frac{6}{1} & \\frac{9}{1} & \\frac{15}{4} \\\\ \\frac{10}{2} & \\frac{15}{4} & \\frac{25}{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 & 5 \\\\ 6 & 9 & 3.75 \\\\ 5 & 3.75 & 25 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the diagonal entries of $D$ are described as placeholders and are not used in the final calculation due to the mask matrix $M$. The off-diagonal entries of $D$ are all non-zero, so the division is well-defined for the relevant elements.\n\nThird, we compute $T_0$ by applying the Hadamard product with the mask matrix $M$:\n$$\nT_0 \\;=\\; \\big( (g g^{\\top}) \\oslash D \\big) \\circ M \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 & 5 \\\\ 6 & 9 & 3.75 \\\\ 5 & 3.75 & 25 \\end{pmatrix} \\circ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 6 & 5 \\\\ 6 & 0 & 3.75 \\\\ 5 & 3.75 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFourth, we calculate the sum of all elements of $T_0$, which we denoted $\\Sigma(T_0)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma(T_0) \\;=\\; 0 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 0 + 3.75 + 5 + 3.75 + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma(T_0) \\;=\\; (6 + 6) + (5 + 5) + (3.75 + 3.75) \\;=\\; 12 + 10 + 7.5 = 29.5\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values of $S$ and $\\Sigma(T_0)$ into the expression for $A$:\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\frac{S}{\\Sigma(T_0)} \\;=\\; \\frac{2.95}{29.5}\n$$\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\frac{29.5 \\times 0.1}{29.5} \\;=\\; 0.1\n$$\nThe proportionality constant $A$ is precisely $0.1$. This result is consistent with the condition $A>0$.",

We are tasked with constructing a portfolio weight vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that minimizes portfolio variance, given by $w^{\\top} \\Sigma w$, while adhering to a set of linear constraints. The constraints require the portfolio to have zero correlation with the first $k$ principal components of asset returns and to be fully invested.\n\nFirst, we formalize the optimization problem.

The eigenvalues are ordered such that $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_n > 0$.\n\nThe zero-correlation constraint can be simplified. From the eigenvector definition, $\\Sigma v_i = \\lambda_i v_i$. Substituting this into the constraint gives:\n$$ w^{\\top} (\\lambda_i v_i) = \\lambda_i (w^{\\top} v_i) = 0 $$\nSince $\\Sigma$ is positive definite, all its eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ are strictly positive. Thus, we can divide by $\\lambda_i$, and the constraint becomes equivalent to:\n$$ w^{\\top} v_i = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\} $$\nThis condition states that the weight vector $w$ must be orthogonal to the first $k$ eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$.

A vector orthogonal to the first $k$ basis vectors must lie in the subspace spanned by the remaining $n-k$ basis vectors, $\\{v_{k+1}, \\dots, v_n\\}$.\nTherefore, $w$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these remaining eigenvectors:\n$$ w = \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j v_j $$\nfor some scalar coefficients $c_{k+1}, \\dots, c_n$. Let $c$ be the vector of these coefficients.\n\nNow, we substitute this representation of $w$ into the objective function and the unit-budget constraint.\nThe objective function becomes:\n$$ w^{\\top} \\Sigma w = \\left(\\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j v_j\\right)^{\\top} \\Sigma \\left(\\sum_{l=k+1}^{n} c_l v_l\\right) = \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \\sum_{l=k+1}^{n} c_j c_l (v_j^{\\top} \\Sigma v_l) $$\nDue to the property $v_j^{\\top} \\Sigma v_l = v_j^{\\top} (\\lambda_l v_l) = \\lambda_l (v_j^{\\top} v_l) = \\lambda_l \\delta_{jl}$, where $\\delta_{jl}$ is the Kronecker delta, the objective function simplifies to:\n$$ w^{\\top} \\Sigma w = \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j^2 \\lambda_j $$\nThe unit-budget constraint becomes:\n$$ \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} w = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\left(\\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j v_j\\right) = \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j (\\mathbf{1}^{\\top} v_j) = 1 $$\nLet us define $u_j = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} v_j$.

This significantly simplifies the calculations. For a diagonal matrix $\\Sigma = \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n)$, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements $\\lambda_i$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors $v_i = e_i$, where $e_i$ has a $1$ at the $i$-th position and zeros elsewhere.\nIn this case, the scalars $u_j$ become:\n$$ u_j = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} v_j = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} e_j = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } j $$\nThe expression for the coefficients $c_j$ simplifies to:\n$$ c_j = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} 1 / \\lambda_i} \\right) $$\nThe weight vector $w$ is $w = \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} c_j e_j$. This means the components of $w$, denoted by $w_j$, are:\n$$ w_j = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 1 \\le j \\le k \\\\ c_j & \\text{if } k+1 \\le j \\le n \\end{cases} $$\nSo, for $j \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$, the weight is:\n$$ w_j = \\frac{1/\\lambda_j}{\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} 1/\\lambda_i} $$\nThis formula provides a direct method to compute the weight vector for the given test cases.
