The curved top profile of this element, spanning a horizontal distance between two pillars, is described by the function $f(x) = h_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L}\\right)$. Here, $x$ is the horizontal position in meters, with $x=0$ at the midpoint between the pillars. The pillars are located at $x=-L$ and $x=L$. The parameter $h_0$ is the maximum height of the arch, and $2L$ is the total span.\n\nTo estimate the cost of materials, the team needs to calculate the cross-sectional area under this curve, which is given by the integral $\\int_{-L}^{L} f(x) \\,dx$.
