This exercise explores what happens when we apply QR decomposition to a matrix whose columns are already orthonormal, a scenario encountered in finance when working with pre-whitened or uncorrelated factors. Understanding this simple case clarifies the fundamental roles of the $Q$ and $R$ matrices and reinforces the concept of uniqueness in the decomposition .",

Consider the thin orthogonal–triangular (QR) decomposition without column pivoting, defined as $X = QR$ with $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$ satisfying $Q^{\\top} Q = I_k$ and $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times k}$ upper triangular whose diagonal entries are strictly positive.

            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  A matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$.\n2.  The columns of $X$ are orthonormal, which means $X^{\\top} X = I_k$. This implies $n \\ge k$.\n3.  The thin QR decomposition of $X$ is $X = QR$.\n4.  $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$ has orthonormal columns, $Q^{\\top} Q = I_k$.\n5.  $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times k}$ is upper triangular.\n6.  The diagonal entries of $R$ are strictly positive, i.e., $R_{ii} > 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, k$.\n\nThe problem is mathematically well-defined and self-contained. It is a standard question in linear algebra concerning the properties of QR decomposition when applied to a matrix with orthonormal columns. The premises are consistent and the terminology is precise. The problem is valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to determine the matrices $Q$ and $R$ given the stated conditions. We begin with the defining equation of the decomposition:\n$$X = QR$$\nWe are given that the columns of $X$ are orthonormal, meaning $X^{\\top}X = I_k$. Let us substitute the QR decomposition into this condition:\n$$(QR)^{\\top}(QR) = I_k$$\nUsing the property of the transpose of a product, $(AB)^{\\top} = B^{\\top}A^{\\top}$, we have:\n$$R^{\\top}Q^{\\top}QR = I_k$$\nBy definition of the thin QR decomposition, $Q$ is a matrix with orthonormal columns, so $Q^{\\top}Q = I_k$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$R^{\\top}I_k R = I_k$$\n$$R^{\\top}R = I_k$$\nThis result indicates that the matrix $R$ is an orthogonal matrix.\n\nWe have now established two fundamental properties for the matrix $R$:\n1.  $R$ is an upper triangular matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries.\n2.  $R$ is an orthogonal matrix.\n\nLet us analyze the implications of a matrix satisfying both properties. Since $R$ is orthogonal, its inverse is equal to its transpose: $R^{-1} = R^{\\top}$. The inverse of an upper triangular matrix is also upper triangular. The transpose of an upper triangular matrix is a lower triangular matrix.\nTherefore, the matrix $R^{\\top}$ must be both lower triangular (as it is the transpose of the upper triangular $R$) and upper triangular (as it is the inverse of the upper triangular $R$). A matrix that is simultaneously upper and lower triangular must be a diagonal matrix.\nSo, $R^{\\top}$ is a diagonal matrix. This implies $R$ itself must also be a diagonal matrix.\n\nWe have a diagonal matrix $R$ that is also orthogonal. For a diagonal matrix to be orthogonal, its columns (which have only one non-zero element) must have a norm of $1$. If $R_{ii}$ are the diagonal elements, this means $R_{ii}^2 = 1$ for all $i$. Thus, the diagonal elements must be either $+1$ or $-1$.\nHowever, the problem statement imposes an additional constraint: the diagonal entries of $R$ must be strictly positive.\n$$R_{ii} > 0$$\nCombining this with $R_{ii}^2 = 1$, the only possible value is $R_{ii} = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$.\nThis forces the matrix $R$ to be the identity matrix of size $k \\times k$:\n$$R = I_k$$\nNow we determine $Q$. Substituting $R = I_k$ back into the original decomposition equation:\n$$X = QR = Q I_k = Q$$\nTherefore, we must have $Q = X$.\n\nThe unique solution satisfying all the given conditions is $Q=X$ and $R=I_k$. This is a fundamental result: the QR decomposition (with positive diagonal on $R$) of a matrix with orthonormal columns is the matrix itself and the identity matrix.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options:\n\nA. $Q = X$ and $R = I_k$.\nThis statement matches our derived result precisely. All conditions are satisfied: $X = X \\cdot I_k$; $Q=X$ has orthonormal columns since $X^{\\top}X=I_k$; $R=I_k$ is upper triangular and has positive diagonal entries (all are $1$). This statement is **Correct**.\n\nB. $Q = X D$ and $R = D$, where $D$ is any diagonal matrix with entries $\\pm 1$, because the QR decomposition remains non-unique even under the positive-diagonal convention.\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the QR decomposition of a full-rank matrix is unique under the positive-diagonal convention for $R$. Since $X$ has orthonormal columns, it has full column rank, and the decomposition is unique. The claim of non-uniqueness is false. Second, for $R=D$ to be a valid factor, its diagonal entries must be strictly positive. This forces $D$ to have only $+1$ on its diagonal, meaning $D=I_k$. The option's allowance for entries of $-1$ violates this condition. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $Q = I_n$ and $R = X^{\\top}$, since orthogonality transfers from $X$ into $R$.\nThis statement is dimensionally flawed. The thin QR decomposition requires $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$. $I_n$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. This option is only possible if $n=k$. Even if $n=k$, the decomposition would be $X = I_n X^{\\top} = X^{\\top}$, which is generally not true for an orthogonal matrix $X$. Furthermore, $R=X^{\\top}$ is not guaranteed to be upper triangular. The reasoning \"orthogonality transfers from $X$ into $R$\" is not a principle of linear algebra. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $Q = X$ and $R$ is an arbitrary upper-triangular orthogonal matrix with positive diagonal entries, not necessarily equal to $I_k$.\nThis statement suggests a non-uniqueness in $R$ that does not exist. As rigorously proven above, the combined conditions of being upper triangular, orthogonal, and having positive diagonal entries uniquely define the identity matrix $I_k$. There is no such \"arbitrary\" matrix other than $I_k$. The phrase \"not necessarily equal to $I_k$\" is a direct contradiction of the mathematical facts. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $Q$ equals the eigenvectors of $X^{\\top} X$ and $R$ equals the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, because QR coincides with the eigenvalue decomposition for orthogonal $X$.\nThis statement conflates QR decomposition with eigenvalue decomposition. They are distinct concepts. We are given $X^{\\top}X=I_k$. The eigenvalues of $I_k$ are all $1$, so the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues would be $I_k$. This matches our result for $R$. However, the eigenvectors of $I_k$ are any $k$ linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$. The matrix of these eigenvectors would be a $k \\times k$ matrix. The matrix $Q$ is an $n \\times k$ matrix. There is a dimensional mismatch. The reasoning provided is entirely false. This statement is **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational finance, free from inconsistencies or ambiguities. The task is to estimate the Jensen's alpha for several sets of asset and factor returns using a linear factor model.\n\nThe governing model for a single asset's excess returns $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T}$ over $T$ time periods is given by the linear equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r} = \\alpha \\mathbf{1} + \\mathbf{F}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the asset's alpha, $\\mathbf{1}$ is a $T$-dimensional vector of ones, $\\mathbf{F} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times K}$ is a matrix of $K$ factor returns, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ is the vector of factor loadings (betas), and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the vector of residuals.\n\nFor a collection of $N$ assets, with returns given by the matrix $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$, this model can be written in matrix form. We define an augmented regressor matrix $\\mathbf{X} = [\\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{F}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times (K+1)}$. The full system of equations for all $N$ assets is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(K+1) \\times N}$ is the coefficient matrix and $\\mathbf{E} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$ is the matrix of residuals. The first row of $\\mathbf{B}$ contains the vector of alphas for the $N$ assets, and the subsequent $K$ rows contain the factor loadings.\n\nThe objective is to find the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimate of the coefficient matrix, denoted $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}$, which minimizes the Frobenius norm of the residual matrix, $\\lVert\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{B}\\rVert_F^2$. The standard solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{B}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{R}\n$$\nThis approach, however, requires the explicit computation of the inverse of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$. This can be numerically unstable, particularly when the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ are nearly linearly dependent (multicollinearity), as is suggested in Case $3$.\n\nA numerically superior and more robust method for solving the least-squares problem is QR decomposition. We decompose the regressor matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ into the product of an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times (K+1)}$ (with $\\mathbf{Q}^\\top\\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}_{K+1}$) and an upper triangular matrix $\\mathbf{R}_{qr} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(K+1) \\times (K+1)}$. That is, $\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}_{qr}$.\nThe least-squares problem is to minimize $\\lVert\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}_{qr}\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{R}\\rVert_F^2$. Since multiplication by an orthogonal matrix preserves the Frobenius norm, this is equivalent to minimizing $\\lVert\\mathbf{R}_{qr}\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{Q}^\\top\\mathbf{R}\\rVert_F^2$. The minimum is achieved when:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{qr}\\hat{\\mathbf{B}} = \\mathbf{Q}^\\top\\mathbf{R}\n$$\nThis represents a system of linear equations with an upper triangular coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{R}_{qr}$, which can be solved efficiently and stably for $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}$ using back substitution. This procedure avoids the direct inversion of the potentially ill-conditioned matrix $\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}$. Modern numerical libraries implement such robust algorithms for solving least-squares problems.\n\nFor each test case, we will first construct the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ from the given factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$. Then, we solve the system $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{B}$ in the least-squares sense to obtain $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}$. The required vector of alphas is the first row of this estimated coefficient matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}$.\n\nCase $1$: $T=6$, $K=2$, $N=2$. This is a standard overdetermined system ($T > K+1$).\nThe augmented regressor matrix is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 3}$. Solving for $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 2}$ yields two alphas in its first row. The calculation results in alphas of $-0.005$ and $0.012$.\n\nCase $2$: $T=3$, $K=2$, $N=2$. In this case, $T = K+1 = 3$, so the regressor matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is a square $3 \\times 3$ matrix. Since $\\mathbf{X}$ is invertible, the least-squares problem has an exact solution with zero residuals, given by $\\hat{\\mathbf{B}} = \\mathbf{X}^{-1}\\mathbf{R}$. The calculation results in alphas of $0.01$ and $0.02$.\n\nCase $3$: $T=6$, $K=2$, $N=1$. This case presents near-collinearity between the columns of the factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$, as the second factor is approximately twice the first. This highlights the importance of using a numerically stable solver like one based on QR decomposition. Solving the system yields a single alpha value, which is approximately $1.34 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nThe calculated alphas for each case are then rounded to six decimal places as required.",

The indices are zero-based.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (rectangular, one exact linear dependency, “happy path”): $X_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 4}$ with columns\n  - $x^{(1)} = [\\,1,\\ 2,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 3,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $x^{(2)} = [\\,0,\\ 1,\\ 1,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 2\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $x^{(3)} = [\\,2,\\ 0,\\ 1,\\ 1,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $x^{(4)} = x^{(1)} + 2 x^{(2)}$.\n- Case $2$ (square, full rank): $X_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 5}$ is the identity matrix of size $5$.\n- Case $3$ (wide matrix, more features than observations, with duplicates): $X_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 5}$ with columns\n  - $e_1 = [\\,1,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $e_2 = [\\,0,\\ 1,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $e_3 = [\\,0,\\ 0,\\ 1\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $d_1 = e_2$,\n  - $d_2 = e_1$.\n- Case $4$ (contains a zero column and a duplicate column): $X_4 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 4}$ with columns\n  - $c_0 = [\\,1,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $c_1 = [\\,0,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $c_2 = [\\,1,\\ 1,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $c_3 = c_0$.\n- Case $5$ (independent but ill-scaled features): $X_5 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 3}$ with columns\n  - $u_1 = [\\,1,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $u_2 = [\\,0,\\ 10^{-8},\\ 0,\\ 0\\,]^\\top$,\n  - $u_3 = [\\,0,\\ 0,\\ 10^{8},\\ 0\\,]^\\top$.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use floating-point arithmetic in double precision and QR decomposition with column pivoting to determine the permutation of columns and the upper-triangular factor.\n- Decide numerical rank using a principled tolerance based on floating-point machine precision and a scale inferred from the factorization.\n- Return the zero-based indices of retained columns, sorted in strictly increasing order, for each test case.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a single list of lists, with no spaces, where each inner list contains the retained column indices for the corresponding test case in ascending order. For example, an output with three cases might look like $[[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3]]$ (this is only an example format).\n- The required output type is a list of lists of integers.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It presents a well-defined task in numerical linear algebra, directly applicable to feature selection in quantitative fields such as econometrics. The problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and requires the design of a numerically robust algorithm, which is a standard and meaningful exercise. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in distinguishing between the theoretical concept of linear independence and its practical, computational equivalent, which must contend with the limitations of floating-point arithmetic. A set of vectors $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is theoretically linearly dependent if there exists a non-trivial set of coefficients $\\{\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n\\}$ such that $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_j x_j = 0$. In a computational context, due to representation and round-off errors, a set of vectors that is theoretically dependent might not yield an exact zero vector but rather a vector with a very small norm. Conversely, a set of ill-conditioned but theoretically independent vectors might behave as if they are dependent. Therefore, we must operate with the concept of *numerical rank*.\n\nThe appropriate tool for this task is the QR decomposition with column pivoting. For a given matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, this decomposition finds a permutation matrix $P$, an orthogonal matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ (meaning $Q^\\top Q = I$), and an upper triangular matrix $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ such that:\n$$\nX P = Q R\n$$\nThe permutation matrix $P$ reorders the columns of $X$ according to a greedy strategy. At each step $k$ of the factorization process (from $k=0$ to $n-1$), the algorithm selects the remaining column that is \"most independent\" from the columns already chosen. This is typically the column whose component orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the previously selected columns has the largest Euclidean norm. This strategy ensures that the diagonal elements of the resulting upper triangular matrix $R$ are sorted by magnitude in a decreasing fashion:\n$$\n|R_{00}| \\ge |R_{11}| \\ge \\dots \\ge |R_{n-1, n-1}|\n$$\nThese diagonal elements, $R_{kk}$, represent the norm of the component of the $(k+1)$-th permuted column of $X$ that is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the first $k$ permuted columns. A small value of $|R_{kk}|$ indicates that the $(k+1)$-th column of $XP$ is nearly linearly dependent on the preceding $k$ columns.\n\nThe determination of numerical rank, $r$, then becomes a matter of identifying where this drop-off in magnitude occurs. We must define a tolerance, $\\tau$, to distinguish \"significant\" diagonal elements from \"numerically zero\" ones. A principled tolerance must be relative, not absolute. It should scale with the magnitude of the data and account for machine precision. A standard and robust choice for this tolerance is given by:\n$$\n\\tau = \\max(m, n) \\cdot \\varepsilon_{\\text{mach}} \\cdot |R_{00}|\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mach}}$ is the machine epsilon for the floating-point precision being used (for double precision, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{mach}} \\approx 2.22 \\times 10^{-16}$). The term $|R_{00}|$ is the largest diagonal element of $R$ and serves as a scale factor for the matrix $X$. The factor $\\max(m, n)$ accounts for the potential accumulation of floating-point errors in the factorization of a matrix of size $m \\times n$.\n\nThe numerical rank $r$ is then defined as the number of diagonal elements of $R$ whose absolute value is greater than this tolerance $\\tau$:\n$$\nr = |\\{k \\mid |R_{kk}| > \\tau, k = 0, \\dots, n-1\\}|\n$$\n\nThe algorithm to extract the indices of a maximal linearly independent subset of columns from the original matrix $X$ is as follows:\n\n1.  For the input matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, compute the QR decomposition with column pivoting. This yields matrices $Q$ and $R$, and a permutation vector $P_{\\text{idx}}$ which contains the $0$-based indices of the columns of $X$ in their permuted order. For instance, if $P_{\\text{idx}} = [2, 0, 1, \\dots]$, it means the first column of the permuted matrix $XP$ is the original column $x_2$, the second is $x_0$, and so on.\n\n2.  Establish the tolerance $\\tau$ for rank determination. If the matrix is empty or consists of only zero columns, the rank is $0$. Otherwise, calculate $\\tau = \\max(m, n) \\cdot \\varepsilon_{\\text{mach}} \\cdot |R_{00}|$.\n\n3.  Determine the numerical rank $r$ by iterating through the diagonal of $R$ from $k=0$ to $n-1$ and counting how many elements satisfy $|R_{kk}| > \\tau$.\n\n4.  The first $r$ indices in the permutation vector, $\\{P_{\\text{idx}}[0], P_{\\text{idx}}[1], \\dots, P_{\\text{idx}}[r-1]\\}$, correspond to the original column indices of a maximal set of linearly independent columns.\n\n5.  As per the problem requirement, sort these $r$ indices in strictly increasing order to produce the final result.\n\nThis procedure is numerically stable and provides a reliable method for identifying and removing redundant features from a dataset, which is a critical preprocessing step for many statistical and machine learning models.",
