            "problem": "A set of companies is represented by vectors of three financial ratios per company, with each vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider three vector norms on $\\mathbb{R}^3$: the $L_1$ norm defined by $\\lVert x \\rVert_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\lvert x_j \\rvert$, the $L_2$ norm defined by $\\lVert x \\rVert_2 = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j^2\\right)^{1/2}$, and the $L_\\infty$ norm defined by $\\lVert x \\rVert_\\infty = \\max\\{\\lvert x_1 \\rvert, \\lvert x_2 \\rvert, \\lvert x_3 \\rvert\\}$. For any two vectors $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, define the distance under norm $p \\in \\{1,2,\\infty\\}$ by $d_p(x,y) = \\lVert x-y \\rVert_p$.\n\nYou must implement the following clustering procedure, parameterized by the choice of norm $p \\in \\{1,2,\\infty\\}$:\n- The number of clusters is $K=2$.\n- Initialize cluster centroids $\\mu_1^{(0)}, \\mu_2^{(0)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ as specified for each dataset below.\n- At iteration $t \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$, perform the assignment step: for each data vector $x_i$, assign it to the cluster index $k^\\star \\in \\{1,2\\}$ minimizing $d_p(x_i,\\mu_{k}^{(t)})$. If there is a tie, select the smallest cluster index $k^\\star$ achieving the minimum.\n- Perform the update step: for each cluster $k \\in \\{1,2\\}$, if the set of assigned vectors to cluster $k$ at iteration $t$ is nonempty, set $\\mu_k^{(t+1)}$ to the arithmetic mean of those assigned vectors; if it is empty, set $\\mu_k^{(t+1)} = \\mu_k^{(t)}$.\n- Stop when an iteration produces no change in any assignment compared to the previous iteration, or after $T=10$ iterations, whichever occurs first.\n\nAll quantities are unitless ratios; no physical units apply. Angles are not involved. Percentages do not appear.\n\nYour task is to run the above procedure on the datasets and norms listed in the test suite below and report, for each test case, the final cluster assignment vector as a list of integers in $\\{1,2\\}$, in the same order as the companies are listed. Cluster labels must be $1$-indexed as specified. The arithmetic mean is the componentwise mean in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Dataset A (happy path; well-separated clusters):\n  - Companies (in order): $x_1=(0.9,1.1,1.0)$, $x_2=(1.2,0.9,1.1)$, $x_3=(1.0,1.2,0.8)$, $x_4=(8.1,7.9,8.0)$, $x_5=(7.8,8.2,8.1)$, $x_6=(8.0,8.1,7.9)$.\n  - Initial centroids: $\\mu_1^{(0)}=(1.0,1.0,1.0)$, $\\mu_2^{(0)}=(8.0,8.0,8.0)$.\n  - Norms to test: $p \\in \\{2,1,\\infty\\}$, producing three distinct test cases.\n- Dataset B (boundary condition; equidistant point requiring tie-breaking):\n  - Companies (in order): $x_1=(0.0,0.0,0.0)$, $x_2=(2.0,0.0,0.0)$, $x_3=(1.0,0.0,0.0)$.\n  - Initial centroids: $\\mu_1^{(0)}=(0.0,0.0,0.0)$, $\\mu_2^{(0)}=(2.0,0.0,0.0)$.\n  - Norms to test: $p \\in \\{2\\}$, producing one test case.\n- Dataset C (edge case; anisotropy and an outlier affecting norms differently):\n  - Companies (in order): $x_1=(0.1,0.1,0.1)$, $x_2=(0.0,0.0,0.0)$, $x_3=(0.2,0.1,0.0)$, $x_4=(4.2,0.1,0.0)$, $x_5=(3.8,-0.1,0.0)$, $x_6=(3.0,0.0,5.0)$.\n  - Initial centroids: $\\mu_1^{(0)}=(0.0,0.0,0.0)$, $\\mu_2^{(0)}=(4.0,0.0,0.0)$.\n  - Norms to test: $p \\in \\{2,\\infty,1\\}$, producing three distinct test cases.\n\nTherefore, there are $7$ test cases total, in this order:\n$($A with $p=2)$, $($A with $p=1)$, $($A with $p=\\infty)$, $($B with $p=2)$, $($C with $p=2)$, $($C with $p=\\infty)$, $($C with $p=1)$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a list of integers indicating the final cluster labels for the corresponding test case, in the order specified above.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed and computationally tractable task. It requires the implementation of a variant of the K-means clustering algorithm, a fundamental procedure in unsupervised machine learning and data analysis. The problem is scientifically grounded, relying on standard definitions of vector norms ($L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_\\infty$) and the arithmetic mean. All parameters, initial conditions, data, and procedural rules—including termination and tie-breaking—are specified with sufficient precision to guarantee a unique, deterministic outcome. The context of applying these methods to vectors of financial ratios is a standard application within computational economics and finance, where different norms can represent distinct concepts of 'distance' or 'dissimilarity' between economic entities. For example, the $L_2$ norm corresponds to the familiar Euclidean distance, the $L_1$ norm (or 'Manhattan distance') sums the absolute differences across ratios, and the $L_\\infty$ norm (or 'Chebyshev distance') is determined by the single largest difference in any ratio, which can be relevant for worst-case analysis. The choice of norm fundamentally alters the geometry of the space, thereby influencing the shape of cluster boundaries and, consequently, the final assignments. This problem is therefore a valid and instructive exercise in understanding the practical implications of theoretical norms.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is an iterative procedure defined as follows. Given a set of data vectors $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, an initial set of $K=2$ centroids $\\{\\mu_1^{(0)}, \\mu_2^{(0)}\\}$, and a chosen norm $p \\in \\{1, 2, \\infty\\}$, we proceed through iterations indexed by $t=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. Each iteration consists of two steps.\n\nFirst, the **Assignment Step**: Each data vector $x_i$ is assigned to a cluster $k^\\star \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The assignment is made by finding the cluster centroid $\\mu_k^{(t)}$ that is closest to $x_i$ as measured by the distance $d_p(x_i, \\mu_k^{(t)}) = \\lVert x_i - \\mu_k^{(t)} \\rVert_p$. The cluster index $k^\\star$ is thus given by:\n$$\nk^\\star = \\underset{k \\in \\{1,2\\}}{\\arg\\min} \\lVert x_i - \\mu_k^{(t)} \\rVert_p\n$$\nThe problem specifies a tie-breaking rule: if distances to both centroids are equal, the point is assigned to cluster $1$. Let $C_k^{(t)}$ be the set of indices of data vectors assigned to cluster $k$ at iteration $t$.\n\nSecond, the **Update Step**: The centroids for the next iteration, $\\mu_k^{(t+1)}$, are recalculated. For each cluster $k$, if the set of assigned vectors is non-empty (i.e., $C_k^{(t)} \\neq \\emptyset$), the new centroid is the component-wise arithmetic mean of all vectors assigned to that cluster:\n$$\n\\mu_k^{(t+1)} = \\frac{1}{|C_k^{(t)}|} \\sum_{i \\in C_k^{(t)}} x_i\n$$\nIf a cluster becomes empty ($C_k^{(t)} = \\emptyset$), its centroid is not updated: $\\mu_k^{(t+1)} = \\mu_k^{(t)}$.\n\nThe process **Terminates** under one of two conditions: either the cluster assignments at iteration $t$ are identical to the assignments at iteration $t-1$, indicating convergence, or a maximum of $T=10$ iterations have been completed.\n\nThe solution will be produced by a program that systematically executes this algorithm for each of the seven specified test cases, which combine three datasets (A, B, C) with different norms ($p=2, 1, \\infty$). The program will compute the final cluster assignments for each case and format the output according to the specified requirements. The use of NumPy is appropriate for efficient and accurate vector and matrix operations, including the calculation of norms and means.",

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Algorithmic Design**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the induced matrix $2$-norm for a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$:\n$$\n\\lVert A \\rVert_2 = \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\lVert A \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2}\n$$\nSince the norm is always non-negative, we can consider its square:\n$$\n\\lVert A \\rVert_2^2 = \\left( \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\lVert A \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2} \\right)^2 = \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\lVert A \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2^2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2^2}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Euclidean norm, $\\lVert \\mathbf{v} \\rVert_2^2 = \\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{v}$, we can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\n\\lVert A \\rVert_2^2 = \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}} \\frac{(A \\mathbf{x})^\\top (A \\mathbf{x})}{\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{x}} = \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}^\\top A^\\top A \\mathbf{x}}{\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nThis expression is the Rayleigh quotient for the matrix $B = A^\\top A$. A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that the supremum of the Rayleigh quotient for a symmetric matrix is its largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$. The matrix $B = A^\\top A$ is indeed symmetric (since $(A^\\top A)^\\top = A^\\top (A^\\top)^\\top = A^\\top A$) and positive semidefinite. Therefore, we have the crucial relationship:\n$$\n\\lVert A \\rVert_2^2 = \\lambda_{\\text{max}}(A^\\top A)\n$$\nThis implies that the induced matrix $2$-norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of $A^\\top A$:\n$$\n\\lVert A \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(A^\\top A)}\n$$\nThe value $\\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(A^\\top A)}$ is also, by definition, the largest singular value of $A$, denoted $\\sigma_1(A)$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(A^\\top A)$ without explicitly computing the matrix $A^\\top A$. This can be achieved using the **power iteration** method. The power method is an iterative algorithm to find the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude (the dominant eigenvalue) and its corresponding eigenvector. For a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix like $A^\\top A$, all eigenvalues are real and non-negative, so the largest magnitude eigenvalue is simply $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe standard power iteration for a matrix $B$ is:\n1.  Start with a non-zero vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$.\n2.  Iterate for $k = 1, 2, \\dots$: $\\mathbf{v}_k = \\frac{B \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}}{\\lVert B \\mathbf{v}_{k-1} \\rVert_2}$.\nThe sequence of vectors $\\{\\mathbf{v}_k\\}$ converges to the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(B)$, provided the initial vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$ has a non-zero component in the direction of this eigenvector.\n\nIn our case, $B = A^\\top A$. The iterative step is $\\mathbf{v}_k \\propto (A^\\top A) \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}$. As required, we avoid forming $A^\\top A$ by performing the multiplication as two sequential matrix-vector products:\n1.  First, compute $\\mathbf{y}_{k-1} = A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}$.\n2.  Then, compute $\\mathbf{x}_k = A^\\top \\mathbf{y}_{k-1}$.\nSo, the core update is $\\mathbf{x}_k = A^\\top (A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1})$. The next normalized vector is $\\mathbf{v}_k = \\mathbf{x}_k / \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_k \\rVert_2$.\n\nWe also need an estimate for $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(A^\\top A)$ at each iteration. This can be obtained from the Rayleigh quotient using the current eigenvector estimate $\\mathbf{v}_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_k \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{k-1}^\\top (A^\\top A) \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}}{\\mathbf{v}_{k-1}^\\top \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}}\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{v}_{k-1}$ is a unit vector ($\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_{k-1} \\rVert_2 = 1$), its denominator is $1$. The numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{k-1}^\\top A^\\top A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1} = (A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1})^\\top (A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}) = \\mathbf{y}_{k-1}^\\top \\mathbf{y}_{k-1} = \\lVert \\mathbf{y}_{k-1} \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nSo, the estimate for the largest eigenvalue at iteration $k$ is $\\lambda_k = \\lVert A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1} \\rVert_2^2$.\nConsequently, the estimate for the matrix $2$-norm, $\\sigma_k = \\sqrt{\\lambda_k}$, is simply:\n$$\n\\sigma_k = \\lVert A \\mathbf{v}_{k-1} \\rVert_2 = \\lVert \\mathbf{y}_{k-1} \\rVert_2\n$$\nThis provides a simple and efficient way to update the norm estimate at each iteration.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\nLet $A$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix. Let $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ be the tolerance and $K_{\\text{max}} = 10^4$ be the maximum number of iterations.\n\n1.  **Handle trivial cases**: If $n=0$, the domain is empty, so $\\lVert A \\rVert_2 = 0$.\n2.  **Initialization**:\n    - Choose a deterministic non-zero starting vector $\\mathbf{v}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. A standard choice is a vector of ones.\n    - Normalize it: $\\mathbf{v} \\leftarrow \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_0}{\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_0 \\rVert_2}$.\n    - Initialize the norm estimate, e.g., $\\sigma_{\\text{new}} \\leftarrow 0$.\n3.  **Iteration**: For $k=1, \\dots, K_{\\text{max}}$:\n    a.  Store the previous estimate: $\\sigma_{\\text{old}} \\leftarrow \\sigma_{\\text{new}}$.\n    b.  Apply the first matrix-vector product: $\\mathbf{y} \\leftarrow A \\mathbf{v}$.\n    c.  Update the norm estimate: $\\sigma_{\\text{new}} \\leftarrow \\lVert \\mathbf{y} \\rVert_2$.\n    d.  **Check for convergence**: If $k>1$ and $|\\sigma_{\\text{new}} - \\sigma_{\\text{old}}| < \\varepsilon \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{new}}$, break the loop.\n    e.  **Handle zero matrix case**: If $\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = 0$, it implies $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{0}$. This means $A\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$. The matrix $A$ is singular, or possibly the zero matrix. The algorithm correctly yields $\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = 0$ and should terminate. We can break.\n    f.  Apply the second matrix-vector product: $\\mathbf{x} \\leftarrow A^\\top \\mathbf{y}$.\n    g.  Normalize the resulting vector for the next iteration: $\\mathbf{v} \\leftarrow \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2}$. If $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_2 = 0$, break. This happens if $\\mathbf{y}$ is in the null space of $A^\\top$, which for $\\mathbf{y}=A\\mathbf{v}$ implies $A\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$, correctly yielding a norm of $0$.\n4.  **Return**: The final estimate $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$.\n\nThis algorithm only uses matrix-vector products, adheres to all constraints, and correctly estimates $\\lVert A \\rVert_2$.",

The experiment must be based strictly on first principles: norms, relative errors, and the definition of the linear solve. All quantities must use the vector and matrix $2$-norm. The program must compute, for each specified test case, the amplification factor defined as\n$$\nr \\;=\\; \\frac{\\lVert x_{\\epsilon} - x^\\star\\rVert_{2} / \\lVert x^\\star\\rVert_{2}}{\\lVert\\delta b\\rVert_{2} / \\lVert b\\rVert_{2}}\n$$\nwhere $x^\\star$ is the exact solution corresponding to the unperturbed right-hand side $b$, $\\delta b$ is a perturbation of $b$, and $x_{\\epsilon}$ is the solution of $A x = b + \\delta b$.

Specifically, using $\\lVert A^{-1} \\delta b\\rVert_2 \\le \\lVert A^{-1}\\rVert_2 \\, \\lVert \\delta b\\rVert_2$ and $\\lVert b\\rVert_2 = \\lVert A x^\\star\\rVert_2 \\le \\lVert A\\rVert_2 \\, \\lVert x^\\star\\rVert_2$, we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{\\lVert x_\\epsilon - x^\\star\\rVert_2}{\\lVert x^\\star\\rVert_2} \\le \\lVert A^{-1}\\rVert_2 \\, \\lVert \\delta b\\rVert_2 \\,\\frac{1}{\\lVert x^\\star\\rVert_2}\n\\le \\lVert A^{-1}\\rVert_2 \\, \\lVert A\\rVert_2 \\, \\frac{\\lVert \\delta b\\rVert_2}{\\lVert b\\rVert_2} = \\kappa_2(A) \\, \\frac{\\lVert \\delta b\\rVert_2}{\\lVert b\\rVert_2}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nr \\le \\kappa_2(A).\n$$\nThis inequality shows that the relative error in the solution can be amplified by up to approximately the condition number. For well-conditioned matrices such as the identity matrix $I$, we have $\\kappa_2(I) = 1$, and thus $r$ should be close to $1$. For ill-conditioned matrices such as Hilbert matrices, $\\kappa_2(A)$ is very large, and even a very small $\\epsilon$ can result in a large relative error in $x$, producing a large $r$.\n\nThe test suite covers several regimes:\n- Case $1$ uses a Hilbert matrix of size $5$, which is ill-conditioned but moderate in size.\n- Case $2$ uses a Hilbert matrix of size $10$, which is more ill-conditioned, typically yielding a much larger amplification $r$.\n- Case $3$ uses the identity matrix of size $8$, which is perfectly conditioned, so $r$ should be approximately $1$.\n- Case $4$ uses a nearly singular $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries differing by $10^{-10}$ on one element, producing a very large amplification.\n\nFor each case, the program constructs $x^\\star$, $b$, the unit-norm perturbation direction $v$, the perturbation $\\delta b$ with the specified $\\epsilon$, solves for $x_\\epsilon$, computes the relative errors, and reports $r$ rounded to $6$ significant digits. The final output is a single line containing the list $[r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4]$ in that order. This procedure directly and transparently exhibits how ill-conditioning in $A$ magnifies small relative perturbations in $b$ into large relative errors in the solution $x$.",
