The problem is well-posed, unambiguous, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in a sequence of logical steps. First, we must construct the matrix representations, $R(g)$, for each of the four symmetry operations $g$ in the $C_{2v}$ point group, acting on the basis vectors corresponding to $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$. In the basis $\\{\\chi_1, \\chi_2\\}$, the basis vectors are represented as $\\chi_1 \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\chi_2 \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n1.  **Identity, $E$:** This operation leaves both orbitals unchanged: $E\\chi_1 = \\chi_1$ and $E\\chi_2 = \\chi_2$.\n    The matrix representation is the identity matrix:\n    $$R(E) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n2.  **$C_2$ Rotation:** This operation swaps the two orbitals: $C_2\\chi_1 = \\chi_2$ and $C_2\\chi_2 = \\chi_1$.\n    The matrix representation is a permutation matrix:\n    $$R(C_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n3.  **$\\sigma_v$ Mirror Plane (in the molecular plane):** This operation leaves both orbitals unchanged: $\\sigma_v\\chi_1 = \\chi_1$ and $\\sigma_v\\chi_2 = \\chi_2$.\n    The matrix representation is identical to that of $E$:\n    $$R(\\sigma_v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n4.  **$\\sigma_v'$ Mirror Plane (perpendicular to the molecular plane):** This operation swaps the two orbitals: $\\sigma_v'\\chi_1 = \\chi_2$ and $\\sigma_v'\\chi_2 = \\chi_1$.\n    The matrix representation is identical to that of $C_2$:\n    $$R(\\sigma_v') = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we construct the projection operator $P^{(A_1)}$ using the given formula, which requires summing these matrices.

The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique, verifiable solution. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe task requires us to find the normalization constants for two specific SALCs, one derived from a set of in-plane $\\sigma$ orbitals and one from a set of out-of-plane $p_z$ orbitals of the chlorine ligands in a planar trigonal $\\text{BCl}_3$ molecule (point group $D_{3h}$).\n\n**Part 1: SALC from $\\sigma$ orbitals**\n\nFirst, we consider the basis set of three orthonormal $\\sigma$ orbitals, $\\{\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3\\}$, each oriented along a $\\text{B}-\\text{Cl}$ bond. We must determine the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$, generated by this basis set. The character $\\chi_{\\sigma}(R)$ for a symmetry operation $R$ is found by counting the number of basis functions that are left unchanged by the operation.\n\n- $\\hat{E}$: The identity operation leaves all $3$ orbitals unmoved. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(E) = 3$.\n- $\\hat{C}_3$: A $120^{\\circ}$ rotation about the $z$-axis permutes all three orbitals, so none are left in their original position. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(C_3) = 0$.\n- $\\hat{C}_2'$: A $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about an axis passing through the $\\text{B}$ atom and one $\\text{Cl}$ atom (e.g., $\\text{Cl}_1$). This leaves $\\sigma_1$ unchanged, while $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ are interchanged. Thus, $1$ orbital is unmoved. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(C_2') = 1$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_h$: Reflection through the molecular ($xy$) plane. All three $\\sigma$ orbitals are in this plane and are therefore unmoved. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(\\sigma_h) = 3$.\n- $\\hat{S}_3$: An improper rotation, $\\hat{S}_3 = \\hat{\\sigma}_h \\hat{C}_3$. Since $\\hat{C}_3$ moves all orbitals, none are left in place to be reflected. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(S_3) = 0$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$: Reflection through a vertical plane containing a $\\text{B}-\\text{Cl}$ bond. This plane is coincident with a $C_2'$ axis. It leaves $1$ orbital unchanged and interchanges the other $2$. $\\chi_{\\sigma}(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe character vector for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ is therefore $\\chi_{\\sigma} = (3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNext, we reduce $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ into its constituent irreducible representations using the reduction formula:\n$$n_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} N_R \\, \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R) \\, \\chi_{\\text{irrep}}(R)$$\nwhere $h=12$ is the order of the group and $N_R$ is the number of operations in each class.\nFor $A_1'$:\n$$n_{A_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12} [3+3+3+3] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\nFor $E'$:\n$$n_{E'} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(0) + 1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{12} [6+6] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\nThe characters for $\\sigma_h$ are positive, so no double-primed (e.g., $A_1''$, $A_2''$, $E''$) irreps can be present.\nThus, the reduction is $\\Gamma_{\\sigma} = A_1' \\oplus E'$.\n\nWe are asked to construct the totally symmetric SALC, which transforms as $A_1'$. We use the projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(A_1')} \\propto \\sum_{R} \\chi_{A_1'}(R) \\hat{R}$ on a basis function, e.g., $\\sigma_1$. Since all characters of $A_1'$ are $1$, the projector sums the result of applying every group operation to $\\sigma_1$. Any operation either leaves $\\sigma_1$ as is or transforms it into $\\sigma_2$ or $\\sigma_3$. The resulting combination will be a sum of all basis functions. The unnormalized SALC is thus:\n$$\\Psi_{A_1'} = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3$$\nTo normalize this SALC, let $\\Phi_1 = c_1(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)$. The normalization condition is $\\langle \\Phi_1 | \\Phi_1 \\rangle = 1$. Given that the basis is orthonormal, i.e., $\\langle \\sigma_i | \\sigma_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$:\n$$c_1^2 \\langle \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3 | \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3 \\rangle = 1$$\n$$c_1^2 (\\langle \\sigma_1|\\sigma_1\\rangle + \\langle \\sigma_2|\\sigma_2\\rangle + \\langle \\sigma_3|\\sigma_3\\rangle) = 1$$\n$$c_1^2 (1 + 1 + 1) = 1 \\implies 3c_1^2 = 1 \\implies c_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n**Part 2: SALC from $p_z$ orbitals**\n\nNext, we consider the basis set of three orthonormal out-of-plane orbitals, $\\{p_{z,1}, p_{z,2}, p_{z,3}\\}$. The character $\\chi_{p_z}(R)$ is the trace of the transformation matrix for the basis under operation $R$. An unshifted orbital that is inverted contributes $-1$.\n\n- $\\hat{E}$: All $3$ orbitals are unchanged. $\\chi_{p_z}(E) = 3$.\n- $\\hat{C}_3$: All $3$ orbitals are permuted. $\\chi_{p_z}(C_3) = 0$.\n- $\\hat{C}_2'$: One orbital ($p_{z,1}$) is unshifted but inverted (a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about an axis in the $xy$-plane maps $z \\to -z$). It contributes $-1$. The other two are interchanged. $\\chi_{p_z}(C_2') = -1$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_h$: Reflection through the $xy$-plane inverts all $3$ orbitals ($z \\to -z$). All are unshifted. $\\chi_{p_z}(\\sigma_h) = 3 \\times (-1) = -3$.\n- $\\hat{S}_3$: All $3$ orbitals are permuted. $\\chi_{p_z}(S_3) = 0$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$: One orbital ($p_{z,1}$) lies in the reflection plane and is unchanged (the plane contains the $z$-axis). It contributes $+1$. The other two are interchanged. $\\chi_{p_z}(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe character vector for $\\Gamma_{p_z}$ is $\\chi_{p_z} = (3, 0, -1, -3, 0, 1)$. The negative character for $\\sigma_h$ indicates that this representation is composed of double-primed irreps only.\n\nWe reduce $\\Gamma_{p_z}$:\nFor $A_2''$:\n$$n_{A_2''} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(-1)(-1) + 1(-3)(-1) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(1)]$$\n$$n_{A_2''} = \\frac{1}{12} [3 + 3 + 3 + 3] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\nFor $E''$:\n$$n_{E''} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(-1)(0) + 1(-3)(-2) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(0)]$$\n$$n_{E''} = \\frac{1}{12} [6 + 6] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\nThe reduction is $\\Gamma_{p_z} = A_2'' \\oplus E''$.\n\nWe are asked for the SALC corresponding to the $A_2''$ irrep. Applying the projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(A_2'')}$ to $p_{z,1}$ results in a sum where each transformed function is weighted by the appropriate character from $\\chi_{A_2''}=(1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1)$. As shown by detailed application of the projector, a sum of all basis functions is produced. The unnormalized SALC is:\n$$\\Psi_{A_2''} = p_{z,1} + p_{z,2} + p_{z,3}$$\nTo normalize this SALC, let $\\Phi_2 = c_2(p_{z,1} + p_{z,2} + p_{z,3})$. The basis is orthonormal, so $\\langle p_{z,i} | p_{z,j} \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$.\n$$c_2^2 \\langle p_{z,1} + p_{z,2} + p_{z,3} | p_{z,1} + p_{z,2} + p_{z,3} \\rangle = 1$$\n$$c_2^2 (\\langle p_{z,1}|p_{z,1}\\rangle + \\langle p_{z,2}|p_{z,2}\\rangle + \\langle p_{z,3}|p_{z,3}\\rangle) = 1$$\n$$c_2^2 (1 + 1 + 1) = 1 \\implies 3c_2^2 = 1 \\implies c_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the product of the two normalization constants, $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n$$c_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$c_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe product is:\n$$c_1 \\times c_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is the final answer.",

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe irreducible representations spanned by the six hydrogen $1s$ orbitals can be found by determining the characters of the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{6H}$, generated by this basis set under the symmetry operations of the $D_{3d}$ group, and then reducing this representation.\n\nThe character of an operation is the number of basis functions (in this case, H $1s$ orbitals) that are unshifted by that operation.\n\nThe $D_{3d}$ point group has the following classes of symmetry operations: $E$ (identity), $2C_3$ (rotations by $120^\\circ$ around the C-C axis), $3C_2'$ (rotations by $180^\\circ$ around axes perpendicular to the C-C axis), $i$ (inversion through the center of the C-C bond), $2S_6$ (improper rotations by $60^\\circ$), and $3\\sigma_d$ (dihedral mirror planes). The order of the group is $h=12$.\n\nLet's calculate the character $\\chi(R)$ for each class $R$:\n1.  **$E$**: The identity operation leaves all six H atoms unmoved.\n    $$\\chi(E) = 6$$\n2.  **$C_3$**: The $C_3$ rotation permutes the three H atoms on the top methyl group and separately permutes the three H atoms on the bottom methyl group. No H atom remains in its original position.\n    $$\\chi(C_3) = 0$$\n3.  **$C_2'$**: Each $C_2'$ axis passes through the midpoint of the C-C bond, perpendicular to the principal axis. This operation maps each H atom on the top fragment to a different H atom on the bottom fragment, and vice versa. All H atoms are moved.\n    $$\\chi(C_2') = 0$$\n4.  **$i$**: Inversion through the center of the molecule maps each H atom on one fragment to a corresponding H atom on the other fragment. All H atoms are moved.\n    $$\\chi(i) = 0$$\n5.  **$S_6$**: The $S_6$ operation (a $C_6$ rotation followed by reflection, equivalent to $C_3 \\circ i$ in this group's generation) maps H atoms from one fragment to the other. No H atom is left unshifted.\n    $$\\chi(S_6) = 0$$\n6.  **$\\sigma_d$**: There are three dihedral mirror planes. Each $\\sigma_d$ plane contains the C-C axis and passes through one H atom on the top fragment and one H atom on the bottom fragment (these H atoms are anti-periplanar to each other with respect to the C-C bond). Therefore, each $\\sigma_d$ operation leaves exactly two H atoms unshifted.\n    $$\\chi(\\sigma_d) = 2$$\n\nThe resulting reducible representation for the six H orbitals is:\n$$\\Gamma_{6H} = \\{6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2\\}$$\nfor the classes $\\{E, 2C_3, 3C_2', i, 2S_6, 3\\sigma_d\\}$, respectively.\n\nNow, we use the reduction formula to find the number of times, $n_I$, each irreducible representation $I$ appears in $\\Gamma_{6H}$:\n$$n_I = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\cdot \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R) \\cdot \\chi_I(R)$$\nwhere $h=12$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the number of operations in class $R$, $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)$ is the character of the reducible representation, and $\\chi_I(R)$ is the character of the irreducible representation from the $D_{3d}$ character table.\n\nThe $D_{3d}$ character table is:\n| $D_{3d}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3C_2'$ | $i$ | $2S_6$ | $3\\sigma_d$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_{1g}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_{2g}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E_g$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ |\n| $A_{1u}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ |\n| $A_{2u}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |\n| $E_u$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $-2$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\nApplying the reduction formula:\n$n_{A_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(0)(1) + 1(0)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(2)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[6+6] = 1$\n$n_{A_{2g}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(1) + 3(2)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[6-6] = 0$\n$n_{E_g} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(2)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12] = 1$\n$n_{A_{1u}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(1) + 3(2)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[6-6] = 0$\n$n_{A_{2u}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(1) + 3(2)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[6+6] = 1$\n$n_{E_u} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(6)(2)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12] = 1$\n\nThe total dimension check: $1(A_{1g}) + 2(E_g) + 1(A_{2u}) + 2(E_u) = 1+2+1+2=6$. This matches the number of basis orbitals.\nThus, the correct reduction is:\n$$\\Gamma_{6H} = A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus A_{2u} \\oplus E_u$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Treat all $6$ hydrogen $1s$ orbitals as a single equivalent set under $D_{3d}$ and apply a projection directly in $D_{3d}$ to obtain only $A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2g} \\oplus E_g$, because inversion symmetry eliminates all ungerade combinations for $s$-type functions.**\nThe procedure of treating the 6 H orbitals as a single set under $D_{3d}$ is correct—this is precisely what was done in the derivation above. However, the resulting set of irreducible representations, $A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2g} \\oplus E_g$, is incorrect. It is missing the $A_{2u}$ and $E_u$ components and incorrectly includes $A_{2g}$. The justification that inversion eliminates ungerade combinations is scientifically false; inversion symmetry requires that eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are either gerade ($g$) or ungerade ($u$), it does not eliminate either class.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. First, construct fragment SALCs on each $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group using its local site symmetry ($C_{3v}$) to obtain $A_1 \\oplus E$ on the top and $A_1 \\oplus E$ on the bottom. Then, combine each pair of corresponding fragment SALCs into symmetric (gerade) and antisymmetric (ungerade) pairs with respect to the inversion center of $D_{3d}$, yielding $A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2u} \\oplus E_g \\oplus E_u$ for the $6$ hydrogen SALCs in $D_{3d}$.**\nThis option describes the fragment orbital method.\n1.  On one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ fragment, the three H $1s$ orbitals under its isolated symmetry ($C_{3v}$) span the representation $\\Gamma_{3H} = A_1 \\oplus E$. This is a standard result.\n2.  The two fragments are related by inversion. It is a standard and sound procedure to combine the SALCs from each fragment into symmetric (gerade) and antisymmetric (ungerade) combinations. The $A_1$ SALCs from each fragment combine to form a $g$ and a $u$ molecular SALC. The $E$ SALCs (a degenerate pair) from each fragment combine to form a $g$ and a $u$ pair of molecular SALCs.\n3.  The final result given, $A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2u} \\oplus E_g \\oplus E_u$, exactly matches the result derived from first principles. This confirms that the correlations made during this procedure (e.g., that the symmetric combination of fragment $A_1$ states yields an $A_{1g}$ state, the antisymmetric an $A_{2u}$, etc.) are correct. This describes a valid and correct approach.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Form two $E$-type SALCs on the top and bottom fragments and one $A_2$-type SALC identified directly in $D_{3d}$, which together give $A_{2g} \\oplus E_u \\oplus E_g$ for the $6$ hydrogen SALCs.**\nThe procedure described is incoherent and does not align with any standard group theoretical method. The fragment SALCs are of $A_1$ and $E$ symmetry, not $A_2$. The resulting representations $A_{2g} \\oplus E_u \\oplus E_g$ have a total dimension of $1+2+2 = 5$, which is incorrect as there must be six SALCs for six basis orbitals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Because the two $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ groups are distinct sets of equivalent atoms, SALCs cannot be coupled across them; the best one can do is $A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus A_1 \\oplus E$ in $C_{3v}$ without any $g/u$ classification in $D_{3d}$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. In the $D_{3d}$ point group, the six hydrogen atoms are not two distinct sets; they form a single set of symmetry-equivalent atoms because operations like inversion ($i$) and $C_2'$ interchange them. The presence of an inversion center makes the classification into gerade ($g$) and ungerade ($u$) mandatory for all SALCs. The idea that SALCs cannot be coupled across the fragments negates the purpose of applying the full molecular symmetry.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
