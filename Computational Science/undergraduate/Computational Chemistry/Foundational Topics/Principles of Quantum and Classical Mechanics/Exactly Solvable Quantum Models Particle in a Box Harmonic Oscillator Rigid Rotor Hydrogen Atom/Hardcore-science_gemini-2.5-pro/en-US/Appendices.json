            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ confined within a two-dimensional $L$-shaped domain $\\Omega$ with impenetrable walls. The governing equation is\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y) \\,=\\, E\\,\\psi(x,y)$$\nwhere $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the Laplacian operator, $\\psi(x,y)$ is the wavefunction, $E$ is the energy eigenvalue, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The boundary condition is $\\psi(x,y)=0$ on all boundaries of the domain $\\Omega$.\n\nThis constitutes an eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2$. The specified $L$-shaped geometry does not permit a straightforward analytical solution via separation of variables. Therefore, a numerical approach is necessary. We will employ the finite difference method, which is well-suited for such problems.\n\nFirst, we discretize the continuous domain $\\Omega$ by imposing a uniform square grid with a given spacing $h$. A grid point is denoted by $(x_i, y_j) = (i h, j h)$ for integer indices $i$ and $j$. The wavefunction $\\psi(x,y)$ is then represented by its values at these grid points, $\\psi_{i,j} = \\psi(x_i, y_j)$.\n\nThe Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ is approximated at each interior grid point $(i,j)$ using the standard five-point finite difference stencil:\n$$(\\nabla^2 \\psi)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{1}{h^2} \\left( \\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j} + \\psi_{i,j+1} + \\psi_{i,j-1} - 4\\psi_{i,j} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the Schrödinger equation yields a system of linear equations for the grid point values $\\psi_{i,j}$:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mh^2} \\left( \\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j} + \\psi_{i,j+1} + \\psi_{i,j-1} - 4\\psi_{i,j} \\right) = E \\psi_{i,j}$$\nThe boundary condition $\\psi = 0$ implies that any term $\\psi_{k,l}$ where the point $(k,l)$ lies on or outside the domain boundary is set to zero.\n\nThis system of equations for all $N$ interior grid points can be formulated as a matrix eigenvalue problem:\n$$\\mathbf{H} \\vec{\\psi} = E \\vec{\\psi}$$\nHere, $\\vec{\\psi}$ is a column vector of size $N$ formed by flattening the grid values $\\psi_{i,j}$ from the $N$ interior points, and $\\mathbf{H}$ is the $N \\times N$ discrete Hamiltonian matrix. It is computationally more convenient to solve the eigenvalue problem for a simpler matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ that represents the discrete negative Laplacian, defined by the equation:\n$$4\\psi_{i,j} - \\psi_{i+1,j} - \\psi_{i-1,j} - \\psi_{i,j+1} - \\psi_{i,j-1} = \\lambda \\psi_{i,j}$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\frac{2mh^2E}{\\hbar^2}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$. The energy eigenvalues are then recovered via the relation:\n$$E = \\lambda \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mh^2}$$\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, define the domain geometry parameters $(W, H, a, b)$ and grid spacing $h$, converting all lengths to SI units (meters).\n$2$. Identify the set of all interior grid points. The domain is defined as $(x,y)\\in(0,W)\\times(0,H)$ excluding the region where $x\\ge a$ and $y\\ge b$. A grid point $(i,j)$ is an interior point if $0 < ih < W$, $0 < jh < H$, and it is not the case that $ih \\ge a$ and $jh \\ge b$. Let the total number of such points be $N$.\n$3$. Construct the $N \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. A mapping is established between the 2D grid coordinates $(i,j)$ of the interior points and a 1D linear index $p \\in [0, N-1]$. The matrix elements $A_{p,q}$ are set as follows:\n    - For the diagonal elements, $A_{p,p} = 4$.\n    - For off-diagonal elements, if point $q$ is an adjacent interior neighbor to point $p$, then $A_{p,q} = -1$.\n    - All other elements are $0$.\nThe resulting matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is a real, symmetric, and sparse matrix.\n$4$. Solve the matrix eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{A}\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}$ to find its eigenvalues $\\lambda$. Since we require the lowest energy states, we compute the smallest $k$ eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$. Standard numerical linear algebra routines, such as those provided by the `SciPy` library, are used for this task.\n$5$. For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$, calculate the corresponding energy $E_n$ in Joules using the scaling factor derived above.\n$$E_n \\,[\\mathrm{J}] = \\lambda_n \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m h^2}$$\n$6$. Convert the energies from Joules to electronvolts (eV) by dividing by the elementary charge $q_\\mathrm{e}$:\n$$E_n \\,[\\mathrm{eV}] = \\frac{E_n \\,[\\mathrm{J}]}{q_\\mathrm{e}}$$\nThese numerical values are then rounded to the specified precision to obtain the final answer. For Case $3$, where the cut-out is outside the domain, the geometry reduces to a simple square box, providing a useful validation of the numerical method against a known analytical solution.",

All energies $E$ are to be converted to wavenumbers $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ using the provided formula:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} [\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}] = \\frac{E}{h c} \\frac{1}{100}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$. This is equivalent to $\\tilde{\\nu} = E / (h c_{\\mathrm{cm/s}})$, where $c_{\\mathrm{cm/s}} = c \\times 100$.\n\n1.  **Rigid Rotor (RR) Model Prediction**\n    This model assumes the potential barrier is zero ($V_0=0$). The energy levels of a rigid rotor are $E_m = \\frac{m^2\\hbar^2}{2I}$ for $m = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, \\dots$. The fundamental transition is from the ground state ($m=0$) to the first excited state ($|m|=1$). The transition energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{RR}}$, is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{RR}} = E_1 - E_0 = \\frac{1^2\\hbar^2}{2I} - 0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}\n    $$\n    This value depends only on the moment of inertia $I$ and is constant for all test cases.\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{(1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s})^2}{2 \\times (5.300600 \\times 10^{-47}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2})} \\approx 1.049052 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n    $$\n    Converting to wavenumbers:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1.049052 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s}) \\times (2.99792458\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times 100} \\approx 5.281035\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\n    $$\n    This value serves as the RR prediction for all three cases.\n\n2.  **Harmonic Oscillator (HO) Model Prediction**\n    This model approximates the potential $V(\\phi) = \\frac{V_0}{2}(1 - \\cos(6\\phi))$ by a quadratic function around a potential minimum ($\\phi=0$). The Taylor expansion yields $V(\\phi) \\approx 9V_0\\phi^2$, which corresponds to a harmonic potential $\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa\\phi^2$ with a torsional force constant $\\kappa = 18V_0$. The fundamental transition energy for this harmonic oscillator is $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HO}} = \\hbar\\omega$, where $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\kappa/I}$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HO}} = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{18V_0}{I}}\n    $$\n    This value depends on the barrier height $V_0$, so it must be calculated for each case. The barrier height is given in $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and must be converted to Joules per molecule:\n    $$\n    V_0 [\\mathrm{J}] = \\frac{V_0^{(\\mathrm{mol})} [\\mathrm{kJ/mol}] \\times 1000}{N_{\\mathrm{A}}}\n    $$\n\n**Case-by-case Analysis:**\n\n*   **Case 1: $V_0^{(\\mathrm{mol})} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$**\n    In this case, $V_0=0$.\n    -   The RR prediction is $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}} \\approx 5.281035\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   For the HO model, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HO}} = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{18 \\times 0}{I}} = 0$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $V_0^{(\\mathrm{mol})} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$**\n    First, convert $V_0$ to Joules:\n    $$\n    V_0 = \\frac{7.0 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}} \\approx 1.162363 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n    $$\n    -   The RR prediction remains $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}} \\approx 5.281035\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   For the HO model:\n        $$\n        \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HO}} = (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{18 \\times (1.162363 \\times 10^{-20})}{5.300600 \\times 10^{-47}}} \\approx 6.624796 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n        $$\n        Converting to wavenumbers:\n        $$\n        \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}} = \\frac{6.624796 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(h c) \\times 100} \\approx 333.493895\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\n        $$\n\n*   **Case 3: $V_0^{(\\mathrm{mol})} = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$**\n    First, convert $V_0$ to Joules:\n    $$\n    V_0 = \\frac{30.0 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}} \\approx 4.981557 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n    $$\n    -   The RR prediction is again $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}} \\approx 5.281035\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   For the HO model:\n        $$\n        \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HO}} = (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{18 \\times (4.981557 \\times 10^{-20})}{5.300600 \\times 10^{-47}}} \\approx 1.371383 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n        $$\n        Converting to wavenumbers:\n        $$\n        \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}} = \\frac{1.371383 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(h c) \\times 100} \\approx 690.354145\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\n        $$\n\nIn summary, the six required values, rounded to six decimal places, are:\n- Case 1: $[\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}}, \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}}] = [5.281035, 0.000000]$\n- Case 2: $[\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}}, \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}}] = [5.281035, 333.493895]$\n- Case 3: $[\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{RR}}, \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{HO}}] = [5.281035, 690.354145]$\nThese are aggregated into a single flat list as requested.",
