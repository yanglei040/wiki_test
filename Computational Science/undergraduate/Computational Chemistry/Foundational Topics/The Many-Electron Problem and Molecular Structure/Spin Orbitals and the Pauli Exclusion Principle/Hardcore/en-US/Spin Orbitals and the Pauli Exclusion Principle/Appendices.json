This first exercise  provides a way to quantify the energetic cost of the Pauli exclusion principle. By using the simple particle-in-a-box model and temporarily ignoring electron-electron repulsion, you can isolate and calculate the kinetic energy penalty that arises when two electrons are forced to have parallel spins, a phenomenon often referred to as \"Pauli repulsion.\"",

            "problem": "Consider two non-interacting electrons of mass $m$ confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$, with $V(x)=0$ for $0<x<L$ and $V(x)=\\infty$ otherwise. Treat each electron quantum mechanically and neglect electron-electron Coulomb interactions so that the total energy is the sum of one-electron energies. Use the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE) as your starting point and apply physically appropriate boundary conditions.\n\nBy the Pauli exclusion principle, electrons are fermions with spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and the full two-electron wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. Consider the following two scenarios:\n- Scenario A (parallel spins): the two electrons are constrained to have parallel spins, so the spin state is symmetric and the spatial state must be antisymmetric. Determine the lowest-energy allowed configuration consistent with this symmetry constraint and compute its total energy.\n- Scenario B (hypothetical reference): imagine a hypothetical case in which both electrons occupy the lowest spatial state while having opposite spins, so that their overall wavefunction is antisymmetric. Compute its total energy.\n\nDefine the Pauli-induced kinetic energy penalty (a model of “Pauli repulsion” in this idealized system) as the energy difference $\\Delta E$ between Scenario A and Scenario B. Starting from the TISE and boundary conditions for a particle in an infinite well, derive the quantized one-electron energy levels, use them to evaluate the total energies in both scenarios, and obtain a closed-form expression for $\\Delta E$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a simplified symbolic expression in terms of $h$, $m$, and $L$ only.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in introductory quantum mechanics, is scientifically grounded, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional potential $V(x)$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) $$\nThe potential is that of an infinite well of length $L$, given by $V(x)=0$ for $0 < x < L$ and $V(x)=\\infty$ otherwise.\n\nInside the well, where $V(x)=0$, the TISE simplifies to:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi_n(x)}{dx^2} = E_n\\psi_n(x) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi_n(x)}{dx^2} = -k_n^2 \\psi_n(x) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k_n^2 = \\frac{2mE_n}{\\hbar^2} $$\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ \\psi_n(x) = A\\sin(k_n x) + B\\cos(k_n x) $$\nWe must apply the boundary conditions imposed by the infinite potential walls. The wavefunction must be continuous, so it must be zero at the boundaries of the well.\n1. Boundary condition at $x=0$: $\\psi_n(0) = 0$.\n   $$ A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = 0 \\implies B \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies B=0 $$\n   The solution reduces to $\\psi_n(x) = A\\sin(k_n x)$.\n2. Boundary condition at $x=L$: $\\psi_n(L) = 0$.\n   $$ A\\sin(k_n L) = 0 $$\n   For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_n L) = 0$. This condition is satisfied when $k_n L = n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer. The case $n=0$ yields $\\psi(x)=0$, which is not a physical state. Negative integers for $n$ do not produce new, linearly independent states, but only change the sign of the wavefunction. Thus, we take $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nFrom the quantization condition $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$, we derive the quantized energy levels $E_n$:\n$$ E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} $$\nThe problem requires the expression in terms of Planck's constant $h$, not the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$. Using the relation $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$:\n$$ E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)^2}{2mL^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 h^2}{4\\pi^2 \\cdot 2mL^2} = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2} $$\nThese are the quantized one-electron energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The lowest energy level (ground state) corresponds to $n=1$, the first excited state to $n=2$, and so on.\n\nNow we consider the system of two non-interacting electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction for a system of identical fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two particles. The total wavefunction is a product of a spatial part $\\Phi(x_1, x_2)$ and a spin part $\\chi(s_1, s_2)$.\n$$ \\Psi(x_1, s_1; x_2, s_2) = \\Phi(x_1, x_2)\\chi(s_1, s_2) $$\nAntisymmetry of $\\Psi$ means that if $\\Phi$ is symmetric, $\\chi$ must be antisymmetric, and if $\\Phi$ is antisymmetric, $\\chi$ must be symmetric.\n\nScenario A (parallel spins):\nThe two electrons are constrained to have parallel spins. This corresponds to a symmetric spin state (a triplet state). For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, the spatial part $\\Phi_A(x_1, x_2)$ must be antisymmetric.\nTo construct the lowest-energy antisymmetric spatial wavefunction, we must use two different single-particle orbitals. If we used the same orbital $\\psi_n$, the combination $\\psi_n(x_1)\\psi_n(x_2) - \\psi_n(x_2)\\psi_n(x_1)$ would be identically zero. Therefore, the electrons must occupy different quantum states. The lowest total energy is achieved by occupying the two lowest-energy orbitals, which are for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\nThe energies of these two electrons are $E_1$ and $E_2$.\n$$ E_1 = \\frac{1^2 h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} $$\n$$ E_2 = \\frac{2^2 h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} $$\nSince the electrons are non-interacting, the total energy $E_A$ is the sum of the individual energies:\n$$ E_A = E_1 + E_2 = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} + \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{5h^2}{8mL^2} $$\n\nScenario B (hypothetical reference):\nIn this case, the two electrons are imagined to occupy the same lowest spatial state, $\\psi_1(x)$. The spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\Phi_B(x_1, x_2) = \\psi_1(x_1)\\psi_1(x_2)$, is symmetric under particle exchange. For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, the spin state must be antisymmetric. Indeed, the problem specifies the electrons have opposite spins, which allows for the formation of the antisymmetric spin singlet state. This configuration is physically valid and represents the true ground state of the two-electron system.\nBoth electrons occupy the $n=1$ energy level. The energy of each electron is $E_1$.\n$$ E_1 = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} $$\nThe total energy $E_B$ is the sum of their energies:\n$$ E_B = E_1 + E_1 = 2E_1 = 2 \\left(\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}\\right) = \\frac{2h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{4mL^2} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the Pauli-induced kinetic energy penalty, $\\Delta E$, defined as the difference between the energy of the lowest-energy parallel-spin state and the lowest-energy antiparallel-spin state.\n$$ \\Delta E = E_A - E_B $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $E_A$ and $E_B$:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{5h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{2h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{(5-2)h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2} $$\nThis energy difference arises because the Pauli exclusion principle forces electrons with parallel spins into higher kinetic energy states (here, one electron is promoted from $n=1$ to $n=2$) compared to the case where they can both occupy the lowest spatial orbital with antiparallel spins. This effect is a manifestation of what is often qualitatively termed \"Pauli repulsion\".\nThe final expression for $\\Delta E$ in terms of $h$, $m$, and $L$ is derived.",

The result is $E_{\\mathrm{per}} = h_{aa} + h_{bb} + J_{ab} + K_{ab}$.\n\nElectrons are fermions, not bosons. According to the Pauli exclusion principle (a consequence of the spin-statistics theorem), the total wavefunction for a system of identical fermions must be antisymmetric under the exchange of any two particles. The spin part of the wavefunction in this problem, $\\alpha(s_1)\\alpha(s_2)$, is symmetric under spin exchange. For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, its spatial part must be antisymmetric.\nThe correct (fermionic) wavefunction, a triplet state, is represented by a Slater determinant:\n$$ \\Psi_{\\mathrm{det}}(x_{1},x_{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\chi_{a}(x_{1})\\chi_{b}(x_{2}) - \\chi_{a}(x_{2})\\chi_{b}(x_{1})] $$\nThe energy of this correct state is $E_{\\mathrm{det}} = h_{aa} + h_{bb} + J_{ab} - K_{ab}$.\n\nComparing the two results:\n$E_{\\mathrm{per}} = h_{aa} + h_{bb} + J_{ab} + K_{ab}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{det}} = h_{aa} + h_{bb} + J_{ab} - K_{ab}$\n\nThe difference is $E_{\\mathrm{per}} - E_{\\mathrm{det}} = 2K_{ab}$. The exchange integral $K_{ab}$ can be interpreted as the self-repulsion energy of the overlap charge density $\\rho_{ab}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varphi_{a}(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi_{b}(\\mathbf{r})$, and as such, $K_{ab}$ is a strictly positive quantity for real, non-zero orbitals.\n\nWhat goes wrong when using the permanent (bosonic symmetry) is a fundamental misrepresentation of electron correlation.\n1.  **Fermionic Case (Correct):** The antisymmetric spatial wavefunction vanishes when $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=\\mathbf{r}_{2}$, meaning the probability of finding two electrons with parallel spins at the same location is zero. This phenomenon is the \"Fermi hole\" or \"Pauli repulsion.\" It keeps the electrons, on average, farther apart than they would be classically, thus reducing their electrostatic repulsion. This stabilizing reduction in energy is quantified by the term $-K_{ab}$.\n2.  **Bosonic Case (Erroneous):** The symmetric spatial wavefunction is enhanced (constructive interference) when $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=\\mathbf{r}_{2}$. This implies an unphysical, increased probability of finding the two parallel-spin \"bosonic\" electrons close together. This \"Bose clumping\" increases their average electrostatic repulsion, leading to a destabilizing energy contribution of $+K_{ab}$.\n\nIn summary, the use of a permanent to construct the wavefunction violates the Pauli exclusion principle. It erroneously models electrons as bosons, leading to a prediction of spatial \"attraction\" instead of the correct spatial \"repulsion\" for parallel-spin particles. This results in an energy that is artificially high by an amount $2K_{ab}$ compared to the true fermionic state. This demonstrates why antisymmetry is a critical and non-negotiable requirement for describing multi-electron systems.",

Work entirely in atomic units, where the Bohr radius is $a_0 = 1$. The nucleus is fixed at the origin. The lithium atom has nuclear charge $Z = 3$. The three occupied spin orbitals correspond to the ground-state electronic configuration and are ordered as follows: column $1$ is the $1s\\,\\alpha$ spin orbital, column $2$ is the $1s\\,\\beta$ spin orbital, and column $3$ is the $2s\\,\\alpha$ spin orbital.\n\nFor an electron at space-spin coordinate $(x, y, z, s)$, define the spatial orbitals as functions of $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ by\n$$\n\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\left(\\frac{Z^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-Z r}, \\quad\n\\phi_{2s}(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}} Z^{3/2} \\left(2 - Z r\\right) e^{-Z r/2},\n$$\nwith $Z = 3$. Define the spin functions by\n$$\n\\alpha(s) = \\begin{cases} 1, & s = +\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\ 0, & s = -\\tfrac{1}{2} \\end{cases}, \\quad\n\\beta(s) = \\begin{cases} 1, & s = -\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\ 0, & s = +\\tfrac{1}{2} \\end{cases}.\n$$\nThe three spin orbitals are therefore\n$$\n\\chi_1(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{1s}(r)\\,\\alpha(s), \\quad\n\\chi_2(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{1s}(r)\\,\\beta(s), \\quad\n\\chi_3(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{2s}(r)\\,\\alpha(s).\n$$\nGiven three electrons with space-spin coordinates $(x_1,y_1,z_1,s_1)$, $(x_2,y_2,z_2,s_2)$, $(x_3,y_3,z_3,s_3)$, construct the $3 \\times 3$ Slater matrix $S$ with entries\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\chi_j\\!\\left((x_i,y_i,z_i), s_i\\right), \\quad i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}.\n$$\nThe normalized Slater determinant value to be reported is\n$$\n\\Psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3!}} \\det(S).\n$$\nAll computations must use the above definitions, with $Z = 3$ and $a_0 = 1$. Report the final values as real numbers in atomic units.\n\nTest Suite:\nImplement your program to compute $\\Psi$ for the following four test cases. In each case, the input is the ordered triple of electrons listed as three $(x,y,z,s)$ tuples, where $s \\in \\{+\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\}$.\n\n- Case $1$ (general mixed spins and positions): $[(0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\n- Case $2$ (all spins down; expected to test spin selection rules): $[(0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\n- Case $3$ (duplicate space-spin coordinates; expected to test the Pauli exclusion principle via row duplication): $[(0.5,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\n- Case $4$ (row swap of Case $1$ to test antisymmetry sign change): $[(0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$), where each $r_k$ is the computed real value of $\\Psi$ for Case $k$ in the order given above. The output must be exactly one line, with no additional text. All spatial coordinates are in Bohr, and spins are dimensionless. Report the values as real numbers (atomic units).",

Verdict:**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction and evaluation of a Slater determinant for a three-electron system, which is the proper antisymmetric wavefunction for fermions. The value of this determinant at specific electron coordinates gives the amplitude of the wavefunction for that configuration.\n\nThe three spin orbitals for the ground state of Lithium ($1s^2 2s^1$) are given as:\n$\\chi_1(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{1s}(r)\\alpha(s)$\n$\\chi_2(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{1s}(r)\\beta(s)$\n$\\chi_3(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\phi_{2s}(r)\\alpha(s)$\n\nFor three electrons with space-spin coordinates $(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1)$, $(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2)$, and $(\\mathbf{r}_3, s_3)$, the Slater matrix $S$ is constructed with rows indexed by the electron number ($i=1,2,3$) and columns by the spin orbital number ($j=1,2,3$). The matrix element $S_{ij}$ is the value of the $j$-th spin orbital evaluated at the coordinates of the $i$-th electron.\n$$\nS =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\chi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1) & \\chi_2(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1) & \\chi_3(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1) \\\\\n\\chi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) & \\chi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) & \\chi_3(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) \\\\\n\\chi_1(\\mathbf{r}_3, s_3) & \\chi_2(\\mathbf{r}_3, s_3) & \\chi_3(\\mathbf{r}_3, s_3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_{1s}(r_1)\\alpha(s_1) & \\phi_{1s}(r_1)\\beta(s_1) & \\phi_{2s}(r_1)\\alpha(s_1) \\\\\n\\phi_{1s}(r_2)\\alpha(s_2) & \\phi_{1s}(r_2)\\beta(s_2) & \\phi_{2s}(r_2)\\alpha(s_2) \\\\\n\\phi_{1s}(r_3)\\alpha(s_3) & \\phi_{1s}(r_3)\\beta(s_3) & \\phi_{2s}(r_3)\\alpha(s_3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe normalized wavefunction value is $\\Psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3!}} \\det(S)$. We evaluate this for each case with $Z=3$.\n\n**Case 1:** Electrons at $[(0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\n- Electron 1: $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,0,0) \\implies r_1=0$, $s_1=+\\tfrac{1}{2} \\implies \\alpha(s_1)=1, \\beta(s_1)=0$.\n- Electron 2: $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (0.5,0,0) \\implies r_2=0.5$, $s_2=-\\tfrac{1}{2} \\implies \\alpha(s_2)=0, \\beta(s_2)=1$.\n- Electron 3: $\\mathbf{r}_3 = (1.0,0,0) \\implies r_3=1.0$, $s_3=+\\tfrac{1}{2} \\implies \\alpha(s_3)=1, \\beta(s_3)=0$.\n\nThe Slater matrix becomes:\n$$\nS_1 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_{1s}(0) & 0 & \\phi_{2s}(0) \\\\\n0 & \\phi_{1s}(0.5) & 0 \\\\\n\\phi_{1s}(1.0) & 0 & \\phi_{2s}(1.0)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is calculated by cofactor expansion along the second row:\n$\\det(S_1) = \\phi_{1s}(0.5) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{1s}(0) & \\phi_{2s}(0) \\\\ \\phi_{1s}(1.0) & \\phi_{2s}(1.0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\phi_{1s}(0.5) \\left[ \\phi_{1s}(0)\\phi_{2s}(1.0) - \\phi_{2s}(0)\\phi_{1s}(1.0) \\right]$.\nThis is a straightforward numerical computation.\n\n**Case 2:** Electrons at $[(0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\nAll three electrons have spin $s = -\\tfrac{1}{2}$, so for all $i=1,2,3$, $\\alpha(s_i)=0$ and $\\beta(s_i)=1$.\nThe Slater matrix is:\n$$\nS_2 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_{1s}(r_1)\\cdot 0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_1)\\cdot 1 & \\phi_{2s}(r_1)\\cdot 0 \\\\\n\\phi_{1s}(r_2)\\cdot 0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_2)\\cdot 1 & \\phi_{2s}(r_2)\\cdot 0 \\\\\n\\phi_{1s}(r_3)\\cdot 0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_3)\\cdot 1 & \\phi_{2s}(r_3)\\cdot 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_1) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_2) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\phi_{1s}(r_3) & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first and third columns are zero vectors. A matrix with a zero column has a determinant of $0$. Thus, $\\det(S_2)=0$ and $\\Psi_2=0$. This is required by the Pauli principle: our basis of spin orbitals contains only one $\\beta$-spin orbital ($\\chi_2$). It is impossible to place three electrons with $\\beta$-spin into this basis without violating the principle, which is reflected by the vanishing determinant.\n\n**Case 3:** Electrons at $[(0.5,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0.5,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\nThe space-spin coordinates for electron $1$ and electron $2$ are identical: $(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1) = (\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) = ((0.5,0,0), +\\tfrac{1}{2})$.\nThe rows of the Slater matrix are given by evaluating the set of spin orbitals for a given electron. Since electrons $1$ and $2$ have the same coordinates, the first and second rows of the matrix $S_3$ will be identical:\n$$\nS_{1j} = \\chi_j(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1) = \\chi_j(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) = S_{2j} \\quad \\text{for } j=1,2,3.\n$$\nA matrix with two identical rows has a determinant of $0$. Therefore, $\\det(S_3)=0$ and $\\Psi_3 = 0$. This is a direct illustration of the Pauli exclusion principle: if any two electrons occupy the same space-spin state, the wavefunction must be zero.\n\n**Case 4:** Electrons at $[(0.5,0,0,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\ (1.0,0,0,+\\tfrac{1}{2})]$.\nThese are the same electron coordinates as in Case 1, but with the positions of electron 1 and electron 2 interchanged.\nThis operation corresponds to swapping the first and second rows of the Slater matrix $S_1$. A fundamental property of determinants is that swapping any two rows (or columns) multiplies the determinant by $-1$.\n$$\n\\det(S_4) = -\\det(S_1)\n$$\nTherefore, the result must be the negative of the result from Case 1: $\\Psi_4 = -\\Psi_1$. This demonstrates the antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction upon the exchange of two particles.",
