Express your answer as an exact rational number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation of the Landé $g$-factor for the ground level of the scandium dication, $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the electron configuration of $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$. The neutral scandium atom ($\\mathrm{Sc}$) has an atomic number $Z=21$ and the ground-state electron configuration is given as $[\\mathrm{Ar}]\\,3d^{1}4s^{2}$. To form the dication $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$, two electrons must be removed. According to the problem statement, and consistent with the principles of transition metal ionization, the outermost $4s$ electrons are removed before the $3d$ electron. Therefore, the electron configuration of $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$ is $[\\mathrm{Ar}]\\,3d^{1}$. The spectroscopic properties are determined by this single valence electron in the $3d$ orbital.\n\nThe problem provides the ground-term symbol as ${}^{2}D$. This symbol, written in the standard format ${}^{2S+1}L$, encodes the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $S$, and the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.\nFrom the superscript, the spin multiplicity is $2S+1=2$, which gives a total spin of $S = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is expected for a single-electron system.\nFrom the letter $D$, the total orbital angular momentum is $L=2$. This is also correct for a single electron in a $d$-orbital, for which the individual orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n\nWith $S$ and $L$ known, we must determine the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$, for the ground energy level. Within the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme, the possible values of $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series, ranging from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\nFor $L=2$ and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$, the possible values for $J$ are:\n$$ J = \\left|2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right|, \\dots, 2 + \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ J = \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2} $$\nThese two values of $J$ correspond to the two possible levels, ${}^{2}D_{3/2}$ and ${}^{2}D_{5/2}$, which arise from the fine-structure splitting of the ${}^{2}D$ term.\n\nTo identify the ground level, we apply Hund's third rule. This rule depends on the filling of the electron subshell. The $3d$ subshell can hold a maximum of $2(2l+1) = 2(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 10$ electrons. The configuration of $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$ is $3d^1$. Since the number of electrons ($1$) is less than half the maximum ($5$), the subshell is less than half-full. For less-than-half-full subshells, Hund's third rule dictates that the level with the minimum value of $J$ has the lowest energy.\nTherefore, the ground level is characterized by $J = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow we can compute the Landé $g$-factor, $g_{J}$, for this ground level. The formula for the Landé $g$-factor under LS coupling is:\n$$ g_{J} = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)} $$\nWe substitute the quantum numbers for the ground level of $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$: $J=\\frac{3}{2}$, $S=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $L=2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required products:\n$$ J(J+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\frac{15}{4} $$\n$$ S(S+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n$$ L(L+1) = 2(2+1) = 2(3) = 6 $$\nNext, we substitute these values into the expression for $g_{J}$:\n$$ g_{J=\\frac{3}{2}} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} - 6}{2\\left(\\frac{15}{4}\\right)} $$\nWe simplify the numerator of the fractional term:\n$$ \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} - 6 = \\frac{18}{4} - \\frac{24}{4} = -\\frac{6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2} $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ 2\\left(\\frac{15}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{2} $$\nThe fractional term is thus:\n$$ \\frac{-\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{15}{2}} = -\\frac{3}{15} = -\\frac{1}{5} $$\nFinally, we compute the value of $g_{J}$:\n$$ g_{J=\\frac{3}{2}} = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} $$\nThe Landé $g$-factor for the ground level of $\\mathrm{Sc}^{2+}$ is an exact rational number.",

            "introduction": "Building on the single-electron case, we now tackle a more complex multi-electron atom. This practice challenges you to determine the ground state of Technetium, which involves a half-filled $d$-subshell .

Then, as your final reported quantity, provide the spin multiplicity $2S+1$ implied by that ground-state term. Express your final answer as an integer. Do not include any units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a standard, solvable problem in atomic physics. We will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the ground-state spin multiplicity of a neutral technetium atom. This requires first determining the ground-state term symbol, $^{2S+1}L_{J}$, from which the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$, is directly obtained. The analysis is based on the electron configuration and the application of Hund's rules within the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling scheme.\n\nFirst, we establish the electronic configuration of a neutral technetium atom. Technetium has an atomic number $Z=43$, which means a neutral atom possesses $43$ electrons. The electronic configuration is built upon the core of the preceding noble gas, Krypton ($Kr$, $Z=36$). The remaining $43-36=7$ electrons must be placed in the available $5s$ and $4d$ orbitals. The ground-state electronic configuration for technetium is $[Kr] \\, 4d^5 5s^2$.\n\nThe ground-state term symbol is determined by the electrons in open, partially filled subshells. The Krypton core, $[Kr]$, consists of completely filled subshells. A completely filled subshell has a total orbital angular momentum $L=0$ and a total spin angular momentum $S=0$, contributing a term of $^{1}S_0$. Similarly, the $5s^2$ subshell is also completely filled, and it too contributes $L=0$ and $S=0$. Consequently, these filled subshells do not affect the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the atom, and we can disregard them for the purpose of finding the term symbol. The problem reduces to analyzing the configuration of the partially filled $4d^5$ subshell.\n\nFor the $4d^5$ subshell, the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a single $d$-electron is $l=2$. The magnetic quantum number $m_l$ can take values from $-l$ to $+l$, which are $m_l \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\\}$. There are $2l+1=5$ degenerate $d$-orbitals. We must place $5$ electrons into these $5$ orbitals according to Hund's rules.\n\nHund's First Rule: The state with the maximum total spin quantum number $S$ has the lowest energy. To maximize $S$, the electrons must occupy as many different orbitals as possible with their spins aligned in parallel. In the case of $4d^5$, we have $5$ electrons and $5$ orbitals. The Pauli exclusion principle permits placing one electron in each orbital. To maximize $S$, all five electrons must have parallel spins. We can represent this configuration as:\nOrbital ($m_l$):  $-2$ | $-1$ |  $0$ | $+1$ | $+2$\nSpin ($m_s$):  $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$\nAssuming each spin-up electron has $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the individual spin projections:\n$$S = \\sum m_s = 5 \\times \\left(+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{2}$$\nThe spin multiplicity is given by the formula $2S+1$. For this configuration, the spin multiplicity is:\n$$2S+1 = 2 \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n\nHund's Second Rule: For a given multiplicity, the state with the maximum total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ has the lowest energy. The value of $L$ is determined from the maximum possible value of the total magnetic quantum number $M_L = \\sum m_l$. For the configuration established by the first rule (one electron in each orbital), the sum of the $m_l$ values is:\n$$M_L = (-2) + (-1) + 0 + (+1) + (+2) = 0$$\nSince this is the only possible arrangement that maximizes $S$, the only possible value for $M_L$ is $0$. Therefore, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $L=0$. The spectroscopic letter corresponding to $L=0$ is $S$.\n\nHund's Third Rule: For a term with given $S$ and $L$, the ground state level is determined by the total angular momentum quantum number $J$. The possible values of $J$ range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. With $L=0$ and $S=\\frac{5}{2}$, the only possible value for $J$ is:\n$$J = \\left|0 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right| = \\frac{5}{2} \\quad \\text{to} \\quad 0+\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$$\nThus, $J$ must be $\\frac{5}{2}$. The third rule states that for subshells that are less than half-filled, the level with minimum $J$ is lowest in energy, while for those more than half-filled, the level with maximum $J$ is lowest. For a precisely half-filled subshell, as is the case here ($4d^5$ in a $d$-shell that can hold $10$ electrons), there is only one possible $J$ value, so this rule is trivially satisfied.\n\nCombining these results, the ground-state term symbol $^{2S+1}L_J$ for technetium is $^{6}S_{5/2}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly asks for the spin multiplicity, which is the value of $2S+1$. Based on our calculation, this value is $6$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe system under consideration is the dinitrogen cation, $N_{2}^{+}$. A neutral nitrogen atom, $N$, has an atomic number $Z=7$ and thus possesses $7$ electrons. The neutral homonuclear diatomic molecule, $N_{2}$, therefore contains $2 \\times 7 = 14$ electrons. The cation, $N_{2}^{+}$, is formed by the removal of one electron, resulting in a total of $13$ electrons.\n\nThe problem specifies the molecular orbital (MO) energy level ordering for homonuclear diatomics with $Z \\leq 7$, which is:\n$$1\\sigma_{g}  1\\sigma_{u}  2\\sigma_{g}  2\\sigma_{u}  1\\pi_{u}  3\\sigma_{g}  1\\pi_{g}^{*}  3\\sigma_{u}^{*}$$\nWe must populate these orbitals with the $13$ electrons of $N_{2}^{+}$ according to the Aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle. The resulting ground-state electron configuration is:\n$$(1\\sigma_{g})^{2}(1\\sigma_{u})^{2}(2\\sigma_{g})^{2}(2\\sigma_{u})^{2}(1\\pi_{u})^{4}(3\\sigma_{g})^{1}$$\nThe term symbol, denoted as $^{2S+1}\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{g/u}}^{\\pm}$, is determined by the angular momenta of the electrons in partially filled orbitals. All fully occupied subshells, such as $(\\sigma)^{2}$ and $(\\pi)^{4}$, are closed shells. A closed shell is spherically or cylindrically symmetric and has a total orbital angular momentum projection $\\Lambda=0$ and a total spin angular momentum $S=0$. Consequently, they do not contribute to the final term symbol, which is determined solely by the single electron in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the $3\\sigma_{g}$ orbital.\n\nWe now determine each component of the term symbol for the $(3\\sigma_{g})^{1}$ configuration.\n\n1.  **Total orbital angular momentum projection, $\\Lambda$**:\n    The quantum number $\\Lambda$ is the absolute value of the sum of the individual projections of orbital angular momentum, $m_{\\lambda}$, onto the internuclear axis: $\\Lambda = |\\sum_{i} m_{\\lambda_{i}}|$. For a single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital, by definition, $m_{\\lambda}=0$. Therefore, the total $\\Lambda$ is:\n    $$\\Lambda = |0| = 0$$\n    A value of $\\Lambda=0$ corresponds to a $\\Sigma$ state.\n\n2.  **Total spin angular momentum, $S$, and spin multiplicity, $2S+1$**:\n    The total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the spin quantum numbers of the unpaired electrons. There is only one electron in the open shell, which has a spin of $s = 1/2$. Thus, the total spin is:\n    $$S = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    The spin multiplicity is given by the formula $2S+1$. Substituting the value of $S$:\n    $$2S+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n    This is a doublet state.\n\n3.  **Parity, $\\mathrm{g/u}$**:\n    The overall parity of the electronic state is determined by the product of the parities of the individual occupied orbitals. For any fully occupied orbital (e.g., $(1\\pi_{u})^{4}$), the total parity is always gerade ($g$), as $u \\times u \\times u \\times u = (u \\times u) \\times (u \\times u) = g \\times g = g$. Therefore, the overall parity is determined solely by the parity of the singly occupied orbital. The unpaired electron resides in the $3\\sigma_{g}$ orbital, which has gerade symmetry. Thus, the overall state parity is $g$.\n\n4.  **Reflection symmetry, $\\pm$**:\n    This superscript applies only to $\\Sigma$ states. It describes the symmetry of the total electronic wavefunction upon reflection through an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis. For a state arising from a single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital, the wavefunction is, by definition of a $\\sigma$ orbital, cylindrically symmetric and does not change sign upon such a reflection. This corresponds to a '$+$' symmetry.\n\nCombining these components, the full ground-state term symbol for $N_{2}^{+}$ is $^{2}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$.\n\nThe problem asks whether the state is paramagnetic or diamagnetic. Paramagnetism arises from the presence of one or more unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetism corresponds to a state where all electrons are paired. Since the $N_{2}^{+}$ cation has one unpaired electron ($S=1/2$), it possesses a net magnetic moment and is therefore paramagnetic.\n\nThe final question asks for the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$, which we have calculated to be $2$.",
