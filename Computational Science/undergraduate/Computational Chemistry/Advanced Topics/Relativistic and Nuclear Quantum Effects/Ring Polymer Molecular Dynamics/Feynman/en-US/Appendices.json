This first exercise allows you to explore this connection by calculating a key structural property: the radius of gyration ($R_g$), which quantifies the spatial extent of the polymer. By comparing the result for a finite number of beads, $P$, to the exact quantum limit, you will develop a concrete intuition for how the path integral discretization converges to the correct quantum statistical result .",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the absolute difference between the radius of gyration of a finite $P$-bead ring polymer, $R_g(P)$, and its value in the continuous path-integral limit ($P \\to \\infty$), denoted $R_g(\\infty)$, for a quantum particle in a one-dimensional harmonic potential.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The system is a single particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q^2$ at temperature $T$. In the path-integral formulation, this quantum system is mapped onto a classical ring polymer of $P$ beads. The potential energy of this classical analog is given by the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH_P(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sum_{j=1}^P \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 (q_j - q_{j+1})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q_j^2 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{q} = \\{q_1, \\dots, q_P\\}$ are the bead positions, the indices are cyclic ($q_{P+1} = q_1$), $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, and $\\omega_P = P/(\\beta \\hbar)$ is the inter-bead spring frequency parameter. The canonical average of an observable $A(\\mathbf{q})$ is $\\langle A \\rangle = Z_P^{-1} \\int d\\mathbf{q} \\, A(\\mathbf{q}) \\exp(-\\beta H_P(\\mathbf{q}))$, where $Z_P$ is the partition function.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the squared radius of gyration, defined as:\n$$\nR_g^2 = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{j=1}^P \\left(q_j - q_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right)^2 \\right\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $q_c = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{j=1}^P q_j$ is the centroid of the polymer.\n\nTo evaluate this thermal average, we diagonalize the quadratic Hamiltonian $H_P$ by transforming to the normal modes of the ring polymer. The Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of these modes, which are independent harmonic oscillators. The variance of the non-centroid modes gives the radius of gyration. A direct calculation using the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution defined by $H_P$ yields a compact result. The covariance matrix element $\\langle q_i q_j \\rangle$ is the $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix $(\\beta \\mathbf{K})^{-1}$, where $\\mathbf{K}$ is the Hessian matrix of $H_P$. This leads to the exact expression for the squared radius of gyration for a finite number of beads $P$:\n$$\nR_g^2(P) = \\frac{1}{P \\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + \\left(2 \\omega_P \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right)\\right)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\omega_P = P/(\\beta\\hbar)$, we obtain the formula for computation:\n$$\nR_g^2(P) = \\frac{1}{P \\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + \\left(\\frac{2P}{\\beta \\hbar} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right)\\right)^2}\n$$\nFor the special case $P=1$, the sum is empty, which correctly yields $R_g^2(1) = 0$. This is physically necessary, as a single bead is its own centroid.\n\nNext, we determine the continuous limit, $R_g(\\infty)$. In the limit $P \\to \\infty$, the ring polymer becomes a continuous path $q(\\tau)$ in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta\\hbar]$. The radius of gyration is related to the total variance of the particle's position, $\\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\text{QM}}$, and the variance of the path's centroid, $\\langle \\bar{q}^2 \\rangle$, where $\\bar{q} = \\frac{1}{\\beta\\hbar} \\int_0^{\\beta\\hbar} q(\\tau)d\\tau$. The relationship is:\n$$\nR_g^2(\\infty) = \\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\text{QM}} - \\langle \\bar{q}^2 \\rangle\n$$\nThe total quantum thermal variance for a harmonic oscillator is a standard result from statistical mechanics:\n$$\n\\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\text{QM}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe variance of the centroid corresponds to the classical thermal variance of a particle in the potential, as the centroid represents the \"classical-like\" degree of freedom of the path:\n$$\n\\langle \\bar{q}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\beta m \\omega^2} = \\frac{k_B T}{m \\omega^2}\n$$\nCombining these results gives the exact quantum limit for the squared radius of gyration:\n$$\nR_g^2(\\infty) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\beta m \\omega^2}\n$$\nFor numerical implementation, it is advantageous to rewrite this as:\n$$\nR_g^2(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{\\beta m \\omega^2} \\left( \\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis form is more stable when the argument of the hyperbolic cotangent is small.\n\nThe final task is to compute the absolute difference $\\Delta R_g(P) = |R_g(P) - R_g(\\infty)|$. The algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For a given set of parameters $(m, \\omega, T, P)$, calculate $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n2.  Compute $R_g^2(P)$ using the summation formula. If $P=1$, $R_g^2(1)=0$.\n3.  Compute $R_g^2(\\infty)$ using the closed-form expression.\n4.  Calculate the square roots: $R_g(P) = \\sqrt{R_g^2(P)}$ and $R_g(\\infty) = \\sqrt{R_g^2(\\infty)}$.\n5.  Determine the absolute difference $\\Delta R_g(P) = |R_g(P) - R_g(\\infty)|$.\nThis procedure is applied to each test case provided.",

The goal is to derive from first principles the equations of motion for the ring polymer beads, construct an orthonormal normal-mode transformation that diagonalizes the inter-bead spring coupling, and design a symplectic integrator that uses these normal modes to compute the internal spring forces. You will then use your implementation to generate quantitative diagnostics that can be used to assess correctness and stability. All quantities are to be treated in a dimensionless system of units where the mass, reduced Planck’s constant, and Boltzmann constant are set to unity, that is, $m = 1$, $\\hbar = 1$, and $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1$.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The path-integral discretization of the quantum canonical partition function for a single particle of mass $m$ at inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$ maps to a classical ring polymer with $P$ beads. The effective classical Hamiltonian of the ring polymer (in one dimension) is the sum of three contributions: kinetic energy of beads, harmonic inter-bead springs with frequency parameter $\\omega_{P}$, and the physical potential evaluated beadwise.\n- The inter-bead spring parameter is defined by $\\omega_{P} = \\dfrac{P}{\\beta \\hbar}$.\n- The harmonic physical potential considered here is $V(q) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\,k\\,q^{2}$, with $k > 0$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTask A (derivation):\n1.

Construct an orthonormal normal-mode transformation matrix that diagonalizes the discrete Laplacian corresponding to the ring polymer springs, and derive the corresponding set of normal-mode spring frequencies. Your derivation must be explicit about the structure of the transform (including degeneracies) and the mapping between bead coordinates and normal-mode coordinates.\n\nTask B (algorithm design):\n3. Design a time-reversible, symplectic velocity-Verlet integrator for the bead equations of motion in bead space, but compute the internal spring forces by transforming bead coordinates to normal modes, applying diagonal spring forces in normal-mode space, and transforming back to bead space.

Normal-Mode Transformation**\n\nThe spring potential energy, $U_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} (q_j - q_{j-1})^2$, can be expressed in quadratic form as $U_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{q}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{q}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $P \\times P$ circulant matrix representing the discrete Laplacian:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & \\dots & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & \\dots & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & \\dots & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe normal modes are defined by the transformation that diagonalizes $\\mathbf{A}$. The eigenvectors of a circulant matrix are the discrete Fourier basis vectors. The eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ corresponding to the $k$-th mode are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = 2 - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{P}\\right) = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\dots, P-1\n$$\nNote that $\\lambda_k = \\lambda_{P-k}$, leading to degeneracies for $k \\neq 0$ and $k \\neq P/2$. To obtain a real, orthonormal transformation matrix $\\mathbf{C}$, we form linear combinations of the complex eigenvectors:\n- **Centroid mode ($k=0$):** This mode has eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$ and corresponds to uniform translation of the entire ring. The column of $\\mathbf{C}$ is:\n  $$ C_{j0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} $$\n- **Internal modes ($k=1, \\dots, \\lfloor(P-1)/2\\rfloor$):** For each $k$, we form a pair of real eigenvectors from the degenerate complex pair:\n  $$ C^{\\text{cos}}_{jk} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{P}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j k}{P}\\right), \\quad C^{\\text{sin}}_{jk} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{P}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j k}{P}\\right) $$\n- **Nyquist mode (if $P$ is even, $k=P/2$):** This unique, non-degenerate mode has eigenvalue $\\lambda_{P/2} = 4$. The eigenvector corresponds to alternating displacements of beads:\n  $$ C_{j, P/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}(-1)^j $$\n\nLet $\\tilde{\\mathbf{q}}$ be the vector of normal-mode coordinates. The transformation is $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{C}\\tilde{\\mathbf{q}}$ and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{q}} = \\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{q}$. In this basis, the spring potential energy becomes diagonal:\n$$\nU_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{q}}^T (\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{C}) \\tilde{\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} \\lambda_k \\tilde{q}_k^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{2} m \\Omega_k^2 \\tilde{q}_k^2\n$$\nThe normal-mode spring frequencies $\\Omega_k$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\Omega_k = 2\\omega_P \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, \\dots, P-1$. The centroid mode frequency is $\\Omega_0 = 0$.\n\n### Task B: Algorithm Design\n\n**3. Symplectic Integrator**\n\nWe employ the velocity-Verlet algorithm, which is time-reversible and symplectic. A single time step from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ proceeds as follows:\n1. Update velocities by a half step: $\\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t/2) = \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{q}(t))}{m} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n2. Update positions by a full step: $\\mathbf{q}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{q}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t/2) \\Delta t$\n3. Compute forces $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{q}(t + \\Delta t))$ at the new positions.\n4. Update velocities by the second half step: $\\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t/2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{q}(t+\\Delta t))}{m} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n\nThe total force $\\mathbf{F}$ is composed of the external and spring forces, $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\text{ext}} + \\mathbf{F}^{\\text{spring}}$.\n- The external force is computed in bead space: $F_j^{\\text{ext}} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V(q_j)}{\\mathrm{d}q_j}$.\n- The spring force is computed efficiently in normal-mode space:\n    a. Transform bead coordinates to normal modes: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{q}} = \\mathbf{C}^T \\mathbf{q}$.\n    b. Compute diagonal spring forces in normal-mode space: $\\tilde{F}_k^{\\text{spring}} = -m \\Omega_k^2 \\tilde{q}_k$.\n    c. Transform forces back to bead space: $\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{spring}} = \\mathbf{C} \\tilde{\\mathbf{F}}^{\\text{spring}}$.\n\n**4. Total Energy**\n\nThe instantaneous total energy $E(t)$ is the sum of the kinetic energy, spring potential energy, and physical potential energy:\n$$\nE(t) = K(t) + U_{\\text{spring}}(t) + U_{\\text{phys}}(t)\n$$\nwhere:\n- Kinetic energy: $K(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{2}m v_j(t)^2$\n- Spring potential energy: $U_{\\text{spring}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} (q_j(t) - q_{j-1}(t))^2$\n- Physical potential energy: $U_{\\text{phys}}(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} V(q_j(t))$\nFor the given potential $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}kq^2$, this becomes $U_{\\text{phys}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}k\\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} q_j(t)^2$. This expression is used to monitor energy conservation.\n\n### Task C: Analytic Check for Harmonic Potential\n\n**5. Centroid Motion Decoupling**\n\nFor the harmonic potential $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}kq^2$, the external force on bead $j$ is $F_j^{\\text{ext}} = -kq_j$. Summing the equations of motion over all beads $j=0, \\dots, P-1$:\n$$\nm \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} \\ddot{q}_j = \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} F_j^{\\text{spring}} + \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} F_j^{\\text{ext}}\n$$\nThe sum of internal spring forces is zero due to their pairwise nature and periodic boundary conditions:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} F_j^{\\text{spring}} = -m\\omega_P^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} (2q_j - q_{j-1} - q_{j+1}) = 0\n$$\nThe sum of external forces is:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} F_j^{\\text{ext}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} (-kq_j) = -k \\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} q_j\n$$\nDefining the centroid coordinate as $q_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) = \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{j=0}^{P-1} q_j(t)$, the sum becomes $mP\\ddot{q}_{\\mathrm{c}} = -kPq_{\\mathrm{c}}$, which simplifies to:\n$$\nm\\ddot{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) + k q_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation of an independent harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$. The initial conditions $q_j(0) = q_0$ and $v_j(0) = v_0$ for all $j$ imply that the centroid starts at $q_{\\mathrm{c}}(0) = q_0$ with velocity $\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}(0) = v_0$. The exact solution is thus:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\mathrm{exact}}(t) = q_{0}\\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{v_{0}}{\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis provides a precise benchmark for validating the numerical integration. The condition that initial internal modes are zero is satisfied by setting $q_j(0)$ and $v_j(0)$ to constant values for all beads, which ensures that only the centroid mode ($k=0$) is initially populated. Due to the linearity of the harmonic potential, the normal modes remain decoupled for all time, and the internal modes remain unexcited.",

The force on the particle is given by $F = -\\frac{dV}{dx} = -kx$. According to Newton's second law, $m\\ddot{x} = -kx$, or $\\ddot{x} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$. This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, whose angular frequency $\\omega_{phys}$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_{phys} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the normal mode frequencies of the free ring polymer.

Substituting this into the resonance condition:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{P k_{B} T}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the force constant $k$:\n$$\nk = m \\left(2 \\frac{P k_{B} T}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4 m P^2 k_{B}^2 T^2}{\\hbar^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n$P = 10$\n$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$m = 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n\n$$\nk = \\frac{4 (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (10)^2 (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})^2 (300\\,\\mathrm{K})^2}{(1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s})^2}\n$$\nLet's compute the value:\n$$\nk = \\frac{4 \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times 100 \\times (1.9061916... \\times 10^{-46}) \\times 90000}{1.1121196... \\times 10^{-68}} \\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{1.1398772... \\times 10^{-65}}{1.1121196... \\times 10^{-68}} \\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nk \\approx 1.0249588 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}} = 1024.9588 \\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nk \\approx 1025 \\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\nThis value of the force constant creates a harmonic potential whose frequency matches the highest, and most problematic, spurious frequency of the RPMD internal modes for this system.",
