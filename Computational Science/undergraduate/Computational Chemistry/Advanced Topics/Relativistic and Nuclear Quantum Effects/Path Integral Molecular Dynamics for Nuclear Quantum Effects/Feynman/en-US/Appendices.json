            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. All terms are defined unambiguously, and the necessary physical constants and parameters are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution can be derived from first principles.\n\nThe task is to compute the squared radius of gyration $R_g^2$, the mean-squared bond length $b^2$, and a dimensionless size parameter $s$ for a free quantum particle described by a $P$-bead ring polymer. The derivation proceeds in three main steps.\n\nFirst, we exploit the separability of the problem. The Gaussian probability density is a product of identical distributions for each of the $d$ spatial dimensions. Let $\\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i,1}, \\dots, x_{i,d})$ be the coordinate vector of the $i$-th bead. The exponent in the distribution is a sum over the spatial dimensions $k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{P} \\frac{m P}{2 \\beta \\hbar^2}\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} \\rVert^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{P} \\frac{m P}{2 \\beta \\hbar^2}\\,(x_{i,k} - x_{i+1,k})^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis implies that expectation values of quantities that are sums over spatial dimensions, such as squared norms, can be calculated by solving a one-dimensional problem and multiplying the result by $d$. By symmetry, the expectation value for each Cartesian component is identical.\nFor the squared radius of gyration and mean-squared bond length, we have:\n$$\nR_g^2(d;m,T,P) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{i=1}^{P} \\left\\langle (x_{i,k} - x_{c,k})^2 \\right\\rangle = d \\cdot R_{g,1D}^2\n$$\n$$\nb^2(d;m,T,P) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\left\\langle (x_{i,k} - x_{i+1,k})^2 \\right\\rangle = d \\cdot b_{1D}^2\n$$\nwhere $R_{g,1D}^2$ and $b_{1D}^2$ are the corresponding quantities for a one-dimensional system ($d=1$). The dimensionless parameter $s$ is defined with a factor of $1/d$, so it will be independent of the dimensionality. Our primary task is thus reduced to solving the $1D$ problem.\n\nSecond, we analyze the $1D$ problem by transforming to normal modes. The probability distribution for the $1D$ bead positions $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^P$ is\n$$\np(x_1, \\dots, x_P) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{P} (x_i - x_{i+1})^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\frac{mP}{\\beta\\hbar^2}$ and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The quadratic form in the exponent can be diagonalized by a discrete Fourier transform. We define the normal mode coordinates $q_k$ as:\n$$\nq_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} \\sum_{j=1}^P x_j e^{-i 2\\pi k(j-1)/P}, \\quad k=0, 1, \\dots, P-1\n$$\nIn terms of these modes, the sum becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^P (x_j - x_{j+1})^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} \\lambda_k |q_k|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k = 4\\sin^2(\\pi k/P)$ are the eigenvalues of the ring connectivity matrix.\nThe mode $q_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}\\sum_j x_j = \\sqrt{P} x_c$ corresponds to the centroid motion. Its eigenvalue is $\\lambda_0=0$, so the probability distribution is independent of $q_0$. This reflects the translational invariance of the free particle system, which leads to a non-normalizable distribution over the full coordinate space. However, the quantities $R_g^2$ and $b^2$ are translationally invariant. We can compute their expectation values by fixing the centroid, for example at $x_c=0$, which is equivalent to setting $q_0=0$.\nFor the other modes ($k=1, \\dots, P-1$), the distribution is a product of independent Gaussians. The average squared amplitude for each mode in $1D$ is found to be:\n$$\n\\left\\langle |q_k|^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\lambda_k} \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, P-1\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the desired quantities. With the centroid fixed at $x_c=0$, the squared radius of gyration in $1D$ is $R_{g,1D}^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_j \\langle x_j^2 \\rangle$. By symmetry, $\\langle x_j^2 \\rangle$ is the same for all $j$. We can calculate $\\langle x_1^2 \\rangle$ by expressing $x_1$ in terms of normal modes ($x_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}\\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} q_k$) and using the orthogonality of the modes ($\\langle q_k q_l^* \\rangle = \\delta_{kl} \\langle |q_k|^2 \\rangle$):\n$$\nR_{g,1D}^2 = \\langle x_1^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} q_k \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} \\sum_{l=1}^{P-1} q_l^* \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\langle |q_k|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle |q_k|^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\nR_{g,1D}^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\lambda_k} = \\frac{1}{P \\alpha} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{4\\sin^2(\\pi k/P)}\n$$\nUsing the standard summation identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\csc^2(\\pi k/N) = \\frac{N^2-1}{3}$, we obtain:\n$$\nR_{g,1D}^2 = \\frac{1}{4P\\alpha} \\frac{P^2-1}{3} = \\frac{P^2-1}{12 P \\alpha} = \\frac{P^2-1}{12 P} \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^2}{mP} = \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^2}{m} \\frac{P^2-1}{12P^2}\n$$\nFor the mean-squared bond length in $1D$, we compute $b_{1D}^2 = \\langle(x_1-x_2)^2\\rangle$. Expressing the difference in normal modes:\n$$\nx_1 - x_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} q_k (1 - e^{-i2\\pi k/P})\n$$\nThe expectation value is:\n$$\nb_{1D}^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\langle |q_k|^2 \\rangle |1 - e^{-i2\\pi k/P}|^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\lambda_k} (2 - 2\\cos(2\\pi k/P))\n$$\nSince $2 - 2\\cos(2\\pi k/P) = \\lambda_k$, the terms cancel:\n$$\nb_{1D}^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{P-1}{P\\alpha} = \\frac{P-1}{P} \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^2}{mP} = \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^2}{m} \\frac{P-1}{P^2}\n$$\nFinally, we can write the expressions for the $d$-dimensional case:\n$$\nR_g^2(d,m,T,P) = d \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m k_B T} \\frac{P^2-1}{12P^2}\n$$\n$$\nb^2(d,m,T,P) = d \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m k_B T} \\frac{P-1}{P^2}\n$$\nThe dimensionless size $s$ is then:\n$$\ns(d,m,T,P) = \\frac{m k_B T}{\\hbar^2}\\,\\frac{R_g^2}{d} = \\frac{m k_B T}{\\hbar^2d} \\left( d \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m k_B T} \\frac{P^2-1}{12P^2} \\right) = \\frac{P^2-1}{12P^2}\n$$\nThese formulae provide the exact analytical solution to the problem. The special case $P=1$ correctly yields $R_g^2=0$, $b^2=0$, and $s=0$, which corresponds to the classical limit of a point particle. The provided program will implement these final expressions.",

            "problem": "Consider two distinguishable, non-interacting, one-dimensional quantum particles of mass $m$ confined in identical harmonic potentials $V(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$ at inverse temperature $\\beta$. In the path integral representation with $P$ time slices (beads), each particle is mapped to a classical ring polymer of $P$ beads with nearest-neighbor harmonic springs. Work in dimensionless units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ equals $1$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ equals $1$.\n\nFor a single particle, define the closed-ring polymer configurational potential\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{closed}}(x_1,\\dots,x_P) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{P} \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_j^2 \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{P} (x_j - x_{j+1})^2,\n$$\nwith cyclic indexing $x_{P+1}\\equiv x_1$, and the angular frequency\n$$\n\\omega_P \\;=\\; \\frac{P}{\\beta}.\n$$\nDefine the “cut” (open-chain) polymer configurational potential by removing the spring between bead $P$ and bead $1$:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_1,\\dots,x_P) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{P} \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_j^2 \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_P^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{P-1} (x_j - x_{j+1})^2.\n$$\nThe configurational probability density for bead coordinates is proportional to\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\Big( - \\beta_P \\, U(\\mathbf{x}) \\Big), \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\beta_P \\;=\\; \\frac{\\beta}{P},\n$$\nwhere $U$ is either $U_{\\mathrm{closed}}$ or $U_{\\mathrm{cut}}$.\n\nLet the ring-polymer centroid be $x_c = \\tfrac{1}{P}\\sum_{j=1}^{P} x_j$, and define the ring-polymer radius of gyration squared\n$$\nR_g^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{j=1}^{P} (x_j - x_c)^2.\n$$\nIn a two-particle simulation where the particles do not interact with each other and are otherwise identical, suppose particle $2$ remains a closed ring polymer while particle $1$ has one spring artificially cut as above. Because the particles are non-interacting, the configurational distribution factorizes, and $R_g^2$ for particle $1$ is determined solely by its own polymer.\n\nTask: For each parameter set in the test suite below, compute the change in the expected radius of gyration squared for particle $1$ due to cutting one spring,\n$$\n\\Delta \\;=\\; \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{cut}}[R_g^2] \\;-\\; \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{closed}}[R_g^2],\n$$\nwhere expectations are with respect to the corresponding configurational distributions.

            "solution": "The user's problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We will proceed with a full derivation and computational solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the expectation value of the radius of gyration squared, $\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{cut}}[R_g^2] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{closed}}[R_g^2]$. The expectation value $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ is taken with respect to the probability distribution $p(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta_P U(\\mathbf{x}))$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_P)$ is the vector of bead coordinates and the effective inverse temperature is $\\beta_P = \\beta/P$. The potential energy $U(\\mathbf{x})$ is a quadratic form in both the `closed` and `cut` cases. This structure is best analyzed using a normal mode decomposition.\n\nThe potential energy can be written in matrix form as:\n$$\nU(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{P} x_j^2 + \\text{spring term} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{x}^T (m\\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} + m\\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{K}) \\mathbf{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $P \\times P$ identity matrix and $\\mathbf{K}$ is the matrix representing the harmonic spring couplings, which differs between the closed and cut chains. The Boltzmann factor is $\\exp(-\\beta_P U(\\mathbf{x})) = \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{x}^T (\\frac{\\beta}{P} (m\\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} + m\\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{K})) \\mathbf{x})$. This defines a multivariate normal distribution for $\\mathbf{x}$ with zero mean.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we transform to normal mode coordinates $\\mathbf{q}$ which diagonalize the matrix $\\mathbf{A} = m\\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} + m\\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{K}$. As the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$ is already diagonal, this is equivalent to diagonalizing $\\mathbf{K}$. Let $\\mathbf{T}$ be the orthogonal matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{K}$, such that $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{T} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{T}^T$, where $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$. With the transformation $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{Tq}$, the potential energy decouples:\n$$\nU(\\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{q}^T \\mathbf{T}^T (m\\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} + m\\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{K}) \\mathbf{Tq} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{q}^T (m\\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} + m\\omega_P^2 \\mathbf{\\Lambda}) \\mathbf{q} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} (m\\omega^2 + m\\omega_P^2 \\lambda_k) q_k^2\n$$\nThe normal modes $q_k$ are statistically independent. The probability distribution for each mode is a simple Gaussian, and by applying the equipartition theorem to each quadratic degree of freedom, we find the variance of each normal mode:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[q_k^2] = \\langle q_k^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\beta_P(m\\omega^2 + m\\omega_P^2 \\lambda_k)} = \\frac{P}{\\beta m (\\omega^2 + \\omega_P^2 \\lambda_k)}\n$$\n\nNext, we express the radius of gyration squared, $R_g^2 = \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{j=1}^{P} (x_j - x_c)^2$, in terms of the normal modes. Using the property of orthogonal transformations that $\\sum_{j=1}^P x_j^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} q_k^2$ (Parseval's theorem), and noting that the centroid $x_c = \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_j x_j$ corresponds to the $k=0$ normal mode (the `zero-frequency` or `center-of-mass` mode), we proceed. For both `closed` and `cut` chains, the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ has an eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$ with the corresponding eigenvector proportional to $(1,1,\\dots,1)^T$. The associated normal mode is $q_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}\\sum_j x_j = \\sqrt{P}x_c$, which implies $x_c^2 = q_0^2/P$. Substituting into the definition of $R_g^2$:\n$$\nR_g^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^P x_j^2\\right) - x_c^2 = \\frac{1}{P} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{P-1} q_k^2\\right) - \\frac{q_0^2}{P} = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} q_k^2\n$$\nThe expectation value is therefore a sum over the non-centroid modes ($k=1, \\dots, P-1$):\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R_g^2] = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\mathbb{E}[q_k^2] = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{P}{\\beta m (\\omega^2 + \\omega_P^2 \\lambda_k)} = \\frac{1}{\\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + \\omega_P^2 \\lambda_k}\n$$\nThe final step is to substitute the specific eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ for the closed and cut cases.\n\n**Case 1: Closed Ring Polymer ($U_{\\mathrm{closed}}$)**\nThe coupling matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{closed}}$ is a circulant matrix representing interactions on a ring. Its eigenvalues are given by discrete Fourier analysis:\n$$\n\\lambda_k^{\\mathrm{closed}} = 2 - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{P}\\right) = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right), \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, P-1\\}\n$$\nThe expectation value is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{closed}}[R_g^2] = \\frac{1}{\\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4\\omega_P^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{P})}\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Cut (Open) Polymer Chain ($U_{\\mathrm{cut}}$)**\nThe coupling matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ is the graph Laplacian of a path graph on $P$ vertices. Its eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_k^{\\mathrm{cut}} = 2 - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{P}\\right) = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{2P}\\right), \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, P-1\\}\n$$\nThe expectation value is thus:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{cut}}[R_g^2] = \\frac{1}{\\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4\\omega_P^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{2P})}\n$$\n\n**Final Calculation of $\\Delta$**\nCombining the results, the change in the expected radius of gyration squared is:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{cut}}[R_g^2] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{closed}}[R_g^2] = \\frac{1}{\\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4\\omega_P^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{2P})} - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4\\omega_P^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{P})} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition $\\omega_P = P/\\beta$, we obtain the final formula for numerical evaluation:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{1}{\\beta m} \\sum_{k=1}^{P-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4(P/\\beta)^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{2P})} - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + 4(P/\\beta)^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{P})} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is implemented to solve for the given parameters.",
