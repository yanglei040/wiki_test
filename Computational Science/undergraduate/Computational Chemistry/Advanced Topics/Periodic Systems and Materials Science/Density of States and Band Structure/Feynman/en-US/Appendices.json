            "problem": "You are asked to implement a program that numerically predicts and compares the density of states (DOS) and band gaps for one-dimensional tight-binding models that represent a uniform atomic chain and an alternating two-atom chain. All results must be computed from first principles starting from the definitions below, without relying on any pre-derived expressions for band energies or the density of states. Energies must be expressed in electronvolts (eV), wave vectors in reciprocal length, and the density of states in states per electronvolt per unit cell. Round all requested floating-point outputs to $6$ decimal places.\n\nUse the following foundational base:\n- The tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian in real space for a one-dimensional chain with nearest-neighbor coupling and periodic boundary conditions is defined by an on-site term and a hopping term between nearest neighbors. For a single-atom unit cell (uniform chain), there is one atomic orbital per cell with on-site energy $\\varepsilon$ and hopping integral $t$ between neighboring cells separated by lattice constant $a$. For a two-atom unit cell (alternating chain), there are two orbitals per cell, A and B, with on-site energies $\\varepsilon_A$ and $\\varepsilon_B$, respectively, and nearest-neighbor hopping $t$ between A and B orbitals in adjacent and the same unit cell.\n- By Bloch's theorem, eigenstates can be labeled by a wave vector $k$ in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), and the tight-binding Hamiltonian becomes a finite-dimensional Bloch Hamiltonian $H(k)$ for each $k$ that can be diagonalized to obtain band energies $E_n(k)$.\n- The density of states (DOS) per unit cell is given by $g(E) = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathrm{BZ}} \\sum_{n} \\delta\\!\\left(E - E_n(k)\\right)$ in the discrete sampling limit, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points used to approximate the Brillouin zone integral. To obtain a numerically stable estimate, replace the Dirac delta by a normalized Gaussian of width $\\sigma$: $\\delta(E) \\to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct the Bloch Hamiltonian $H(k)$ from the real-space tight-binding description for both the uniform one-atom chain and the alternating two-atom chain, for each $k$ in a uniform grid sampling of the first Brillouin zone $k \\in [-\\pi/a,\\pi/a]$ (inclusive).\n- Diagonalize $H(k)$ for each $k$ to obtain the set of band energies $\\{E_n(k)\\}$ for all bands $n$ and all $k$-points.\n- Compute the band gap at Fermi energy $E_F = 0$ eV as $\\Delta = E_{\\min}^{(+)} - E_{\\max}^{(-)}$, where $E_{\\min}^{(+)}$ is the smallest eigenvalue strictly greater than $E_F$ and $E_{\\max}^{(-)}$ is the largest eigenvalue strictly less than $E_F$. If either set is empty, or if $E_F$ lies at a band crossing or within a band such that the computed difference would be negative due to discretization, return $\\Delta = 0$ eV.\n- Compute the density of states at the Fermi energy $g(E_F)$ using the Gaussian-broadened definition with width $\\sigma$ and the $k$-point average. Report the DOS in states per electronvolt per unit cell.\n- Use a uniform $k$-point mesh of size $N_k$ over the first Brillouin zone, including both endpoints. Use the lattice constant $a$ to set the Brillouin zone limits.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following four parameter sets. Each test case specifies the model type, on-site energies, hopping, lattice constant, number of $k$-points, and Gaussian width. Energies are in electronvolts (eV), lattice constants in angstroms (Å), and $\\sigma$ in electronvolts (eV). The Fermi energy is fixed at $E_F = 0$ eV for all cases.\n    1. Uniform chain (single-atom unit cell): $(\\text{model}=\\text{mono},\\, \\varepsilon = 0.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, t = 1.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, a = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},\\, N_k = 4001,\\, \\sigma = 0.05\\,\\text{eV})$.\n    2. Alternating chain (two-atom unit cell): $(\\text{model}=\\text{diatomic},\\, \\varepsilon_A = 1.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, \\varepsilon_B = -1.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, t = 1.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, a = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},\\, N_k = 4001,\\, \\sigma = 0.05\\,\\text{eV})$.\n    3. Alternating chain (small contrast): $(\\text{model}=\\text{diatomic},\\, \\varepsilon_A = 0.1\\,\\text{eV},\\, \\varepsilon_B = -0.1\\,\\text{eV},\\, t = 1.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, a = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},\\, N_k = 4001,\\, \\sigma = 0.02\\,\\text{eV})$.\n    4. Uniform chain (wider band): $(\\text{model}=\\text{mono},\\, \\varepsilon = 0.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, t = 2.0\\,\\text{eV},\\, a = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},\\, N_k = 4001,\\, \\sigma = 0.05\\,\\text{eV})$.\n\nFinal outputs:\n- For each test case, compute two quantities: the band gap $\\Delta$ in eV, and the density of states at the Fermi energy $g(E_F)$ in states per eV per unit cell, both rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[\\Delta_1, g_1, \\Delta_2, g_2, \\Delta_3, g_3, \\Delta_4, g_4]$.\n- The program must be entirely self-contained and must not read any input. It must embed and execute the specified test suite.",
            "solution": "The problem statement presented is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics, specifically the tight-binding approximation, and is mathematically well-posed. All required parameters, constants, and definitions are provided, forming a self-contained and unambiguous problem. The task is to numerically compute band gaps and the density of states for two variants of a one-dimensional crystal. We will proceed by first deriving the necessary theoretical constructs and then outlining the computational algorithm.\n\nThe core of the problem is the construction of the Bloch Hamiltonian, $H(k)$, for each model. Its eigenvalues provide the electronic band structure $E_n(k)$.\n\n**1. Uniform (Monoatomic) Chain**\n\nThis model consists of a one-dimensional chain of identical atoms. The unit cell contains a single atom with one orbital, and its basis vector can be denoted as $|j\\rangle$ for the orbital in cell $j$. The lattice constant is $a$. The Hamiltonian includes on-site energy $\\varepsilon$ and nearest-neighbor hopping $t$. The matrix elements in the real-space atomic orbital basis are:\n$$\n\\langle j|H|m\\rangle = \\begin{cases} \\varepsilon & \\text{if } j = m \\\\ t & \\text{if } |j - m| = 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nAccording to Bloch's theorem, the eigenstates of a periodic system can be written as Bloch waves, constructed from a basis of cell-periodic functions. For a single orbital per unit cell, the Bloch Hamiltonian $H(k)$ is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix (a scalar), whose element is given by the Fourier transform of the real-space Hamiltonian matrix elements:\n$$\nH(k) = \\sum_{m} e^{ik(m-j)a} \\langle j|H|m \\rangle\n$$\nSetting the reference cell $j=0$:\n$$\nH(k) = \\sum_{m} e^{ikma} \\langle 0|H|m \\rangle\n$$\nThe sum has three non-zero terms:\n- For $m=0$: $\\langle 0|H|0 \\rangle = \\varepsilon$. The term is $\\varepsilon e^{ik(0)a} = \\varepsilon$.\n- For $m=1$: $\\langle 0|H|1 \\rangle = t$. The term is $t e^{ika}$.\n- For $m=-1$: $\\langle 0|H|-1 \\rangle = t$. The term is $t e^{-ika}$.\n\nSumming these terms gives the Bloch Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH(k) = \\varepsilon + t(e^{ika} + e^{-ika}) = \\varepsilon + 2t\\cos(ka)\n$$\nAs this is a scalar, the single energy band is directly given by $E(k) = \\varepsilon + 2t\\cos(ka)$. However, to adhere to the problem's requirement of not using pre-derived expressions for energy, we will construct this $1 \\times 1$ matrix and numerically find its eigenvalue for each $k$.\n\n**2. Alternating (Diatomic) Chain**\n\nThis model describes a chain with a two-atom basis, atoms A and B, in each unit cell. The on-site energies are $\\varepsilon_A$ and $\\varepsilon_B$. The hopping parameter $t$ connects nearest-neighbor A and B atoms. The unit cell can be visualized as ...-[A-B]-[A-B]-..., where the lattice constant $a$ is the distance between consecutive A atoms. Within a unit cell $j$, there are two basis orbitals, $|A_j\\rangle$ and $|B_j\\rangle$. The Hamiltonian matrix elements in this real-space basis are:\n- On-site: $\\langle A_j|H|A_j\\rangle = \\varepsilon_A$, $\\langle B_j|H|B_j\\rangle = \\varepsilon_B$.\n- Intra-cell hopping: $\\langle A_j|H|B_j\\rangle = t$.\n- Inter-cell hopping: $\\langle A_j|H|B_{j-1}\\rangle = t$.\n\nThe Bloch Hamiltonian $H(k)$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix in the basis of Bloch sums $|\\phi_{A,k}\\rangle, |\\phi_{B,k}\\rangle$. The matrix elements are $H_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\sum_m e^{ikma} \\langle \\mu_0|H|\\nu_m\\rangle$ where $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\{A, B\\}$.\n\n- **Diagonal elements:**\n  - $H_{AA}(k) = \\langle A_0|H|A_0 \\rangle = \\varepsilon_A$.\n  - $H_{BB}(k) = \\langle B_0|H|B_0 \\rangle = \\varepsilon_B$.\n\n- **Off-diagonal elements:**\n  - $H_{AB}(k) = \\sum_m e^{ikma} \\langle A_0|H|B_m\\rangle$. The non-zero terms are for neighbors of $A_0$: atom $B_0$ (same cell, $m=0$) and atom $B_{-1}$ (previous cell, $m=-1$).\n  $$\n  H_{AB}(k) = e^{ik(0)a} \\langle A_0|H|B_0\\rangle + e^{ik(-1)a} \\langle A_0|H|B_{-1}\\rangle = t + te^{-ika} = t(1 + e^{-ika})\n  $$\n  - $H_{BA}(k)$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $H_{AB}(k)$. Assuming $t$ is real:\n  $$\n  H_{BA}(k) = (H_{AB}(k))^* = t(1 + e^{ika})\n  $$\n\nThe resulting $2 \\times 2$ Bloch Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_A & t(1 + e^{-ika}) \\\\ t(1 + e^{ika}) & \\varepsilon_B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe two energy bands, $E_n(k)$ for $n=1,2$, are the two eigenvalues of this matrix for each wave vector $k$.\n\n**3. Numerical Computation Algorithm**\n\nFor each specified test case, the following procedure is implemented:\n\n**a. Discretization of the Brillouin Zone:** The first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$, is sampled using a uniform grid of $N_k$ points, inclusive of the endpoints.\n\n**b. Band Structure Calculation:** A loop iterates through each $k$ value in the grid. In each iteration, the appropriate Bloch Hamiltonian matrix $H(k)$ ($1 \\times 1$ for uniform, $2 \\times 2$ for alternating) is constructed. The eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using a numerical eigensolver for Hermitian matrices. All computed eigenvalues $\\{E_n(k)\\}$ are collected into a single flat list.\n\n**c. Band Gap Calculation:** The band gap $\\Delta$ is calculated with respect to the Fermi energy $E_F = 0 \\, \\text{eV}$. The set of all computed eigenvalues is partitioned into two subsets: those strictly greater than $E_F$ and those strictly less than $E_F$. The minimum of the first set, $E_{\\min}^{(+)}$, and the maximum of the second set, $E_{\\max}^{(-)}$, are determined. The gap is $\\Delta = E_{\\min}^{(+)} - E_{\\max}^{(-)}$. If either subset is empty, or if the calculated difference is negative due to discretization effects, the gap is set to $\\Delta = 0$.\n\n**d. Density of States Calculation:** The density of states per unit cell at the Fermi level, $g(E_F)$, is computed by approximating the Dirac delta function with a normalized Gaussian function of standard deviation $\\sigma$. The formula given is implemented directly:\n$$\ng(E_F) = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{k,n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(E_F - E_n(k))^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe sum is taken over all computed eigenvalues $\\{E_n(k)\\}$, and the result is normalized by the number of $k$-points, $N_k$.\n\nThis rigorous, step-by-step procedure starting from the fundamental tight-binding Hamiltonian definition ensures that the solutions are derived from first principles as required. The final program implements this logic to process the test suite and produce the required outputs.",

A solution will now be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\nThe solution is derived in two parts: calculation of a) the band gap $E_{\\mathrm{gap}}$ and b) the density of states at the Fermi level $D(E_{F}=0)$.\n\n**a) Band Gap Calculation**\nThe band energies $E(k)$ are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H(k)$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(H(k) - E I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -E  -(t_{1} + t_{2} e^{-i k a}) \\\\ -(t_{1} + t_{2} e^{i k a})  -E \\end{pmatrix} = E^2 - |t_{1} + t_{2} e^{-i k a}|^2 = 0\n$$\nThe term $|t_{1} + t_{2} e^{-i k a}|^2$ is calculated as:\n$$\n|t_{1} + t_{2}(\\cos(ka) - i\\sin(ka))|^2 = (t_{1} + t_{2}\\cos(ka))^2 + (-t_{2}\\sin(ka))^2 = t_{1}^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_{1}t_{2}\\cos(ka)\n$$\nThe band energies are symmetric around $E=0$:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(k) = \\pm \\sqrt{t_1^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_{1}t_{2}\\cos(ka)}\n$$\n$E_{+}(k)$ is the conduction band and $E_{-}(k)$ is the valence band. The direct energy gap at a given $k$ is $E_{+}(k) - E_{-}(k) = 2|E_{+}(k)|$. The overall band gap $E_{\\mathrm{gap}}$ is the minimum of this quantity over the Brillouin zone. The minimum occurs when the term under the square root is minimized. Since $t_{1} = t(1+\\eta) > 0$ and $t_{2} = t(1-\\eta) \\ge 0$, the minimum occurs when $\\cos(ka) = -1$, i.e., at the Brillouin zone edge $k = \\pm\\pi/a$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{gap}} = 2 \\sqrt{t_1^2 + t_2^2 - 2t_{1}t_{2}} = 2 \\sqrt{(t_1 - t_2)^2} = 2|t_1 - t_2|\n$$\nSubstituting $t_{1} = t(1+\\eta)$ and $t_{2} = t(1-\\eta)$:\n$$\nt_1 - t_2 = t(1+\\eta) - t(1-\\eta) = 2t\\eta\n$$\nSince $t > 0$ and $\\eta \\ge 0$, the absolute value is redundant. The band gap is given by the simple analytical formula:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{gap}} = 4t\\eta\n$$\n\n**b) Density of States Calculation**\nThe density of states at the Fermi level, $E_{F}=0$, is to be computed using the provided numerical formula:\n$$\nD(E_F=0) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{k}\\sum_{n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(0-E_{n}(k))^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe sum over bands $n$ includes the conduction ($n=+$) and valence ($n=-$) bands. Since $E_{-}(k) = -E_{+}(k)$, their squares are identical: $E_{-}^2(k) = E_{+}^2(k) = E(k)^2$, where $E(k)^2 = t_1^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_{1}t_{2}\\cos(ka)$. The sum over $n$ can be simplified:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=\\pm} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{n}(k)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = 2\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E(k)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis leads to the final expression for the numerical DOS at $E_F=0$:\n$$\nD(0) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{k} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t_1^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_{1}t_{2}\\cos(ka)}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe summation is performed over a uniform mesh of $N_{k}$ $k$-points in the first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\nFor each given parameter set $(t,\\eta,a,N_{k},\\sigma)$:\n1.  Calculate $E_{\\mathrm{gap}} = 4t\\eta$.\n2.  Initialize the sum for the DOS calculation to zero.\n3.  Generate a uniform vector of $N_{k}$ $k$-points from $-\\pi/a$ to $\\pi/a$ (exclusive of the upper bound).\n4.  For this vector of $k$-points, compute the vector of corresponding $E(k)^2$ values using the derived expression.\n5.  Apply the Gaussian broadening function element-wise to the energy-squared vector, and sum the resulting terms.\n6.  Multiply the sum by the prefactors $\\frac{1}{N_k}$ and $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}$ to obtain $D(0)$.\n7.  Round both $E_{\\mathrm{gap}}$ and $D(0)$ to $6$ decimal places and store them.\n8.  Format the final output as specified.\nThe calculations will be implemented using `numpy` for efficient vector operations.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from condensed matter physics that is free of contradictions or ambiguity. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the conduction band energy $E_+(k)$ and the density of states $D(E)$ for a two-dimensional massive Dirac system described by the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = \\hbar v_F \\left( \\sigma_x k_x + \\sigma_y k_y \\right) + \\Delta \\, \\sigma_z\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ are the Pauli matrices. In the standard basis where $\\sigma_z$ is diagonal, the Hamiltonian is represented as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -i \\\\ i  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting these matrices into the expression for $H$ yields:\n$$\nH = \\hbar v_F \\begin{pmatrix} 0  k_x - i k_y \\\\ k_x + i k_y  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\Delta \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta  \\hbar v_F (k_x - i k_y) \\\\ \\hbar v_F (k_x + i k_y)  -\\Delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe energy eigenvalues $E$ are the solutions to the secular equation $\\det(H - E I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta - E  \\hbar v_F (k_x - i k_y) \\\\ \\hbar v_F (k_x + i k_y)  -\\Delta - E \\end{pmatrix}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta - E)(-\\Delta - E) - \\left( \\hbar v_F \\right)^2 (k_x - i k_y)(k_x + i k_y) = 0\n$$\n$$\nE^2 - \\Delta^2 - \\left( \\hbar v_F \\right)^2 (k_x^2 + k_y^2) = 0\n$$\nLet $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ be the magnitude of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. The dispersion relation becomes:\n$$\nE^2 = \\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2\n$$\nThis gives two energy bands, a conduction band ($+$) and a valence band ($-$):\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(k) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the positive-branch conduction-band energy, $E_+(\\mathbf{k})$, along the $k_x$ axis, where $k_y=0$ and thus $k = |k_x|$. The formula is:\n$$\nE_+(k) = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2}\n$$\nThis expression will be used to compute the results for cases $7$ through $9$.\n\nNext, we derive the single-particle electronic density of states (DOS) per unit area, $D(E)$. For a two-dimensional system with spin and valley degeneracy $g_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, the DOS is defined as:\n$$\nD(E) = g_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\delta(E - E_+(k))\n$$\nWe consider only the positive energy branch $E_+(k)$ for $E \\ge 0$. Since the dispersion $E_+(k)$ is isotropic, we can integrate over the angular component in k-space by transforming to polar coordinates ($d^2k = k \\, dk \\, d\\theta$). The integration over $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$\nD(E) = g_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\frac{2\\pi}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_0^\\infty k \\, \\delta(E - \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2}) \\, dk\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral involving the Dirac delta function, we find the root $k_0$ of its argument, $E = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k_0)^2}$. This requires $E^2 = \\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k_0)^2$, which is solvable for $k_0 \\ge 0$ only if $E \\ge \\Delta$. If $0 \\le E  \\Delta$, there are no states, and thus $D(E)=0$.\nFor $E \\ge \\Delta$, the root is $k_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta^2}}{\\hbar v_F}$.\nUsing the identity $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where $x_i$ are the roots of $g(x)=0$, we have $f(k)=k$ and $g(k) = E - E_+(k)$. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_+(k)}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2} = \\frac{(\\hbar v_F)^2 k}{\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (\\hbar v_F k)^2}} = \\frac{(\\hbar v_F)^2 k}{E_+(k)}\n$$\nAt the root $k_0$, the magnitude of the derivative of the argument of the delta function is $|- \\frac{dE_+}{dk}|_{k=k_0} = \\frac{(\\hbar v_F)^2 k_0}{E}$.\nSubstituting this into the DOS expression:\n$$\nD(E) = g_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{k_0}{\\frac{(\\hbar v_F)^2 k_0}{E}} = g_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\frac{E}{2\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}\n$$\nGiven the degeneracy factor $g_{\\mathrm{deg}} = 4$, the final expression for the DOS is:\n$$\nD(E) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{2E}{\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}  \\text{if } E \\ge \\Delta \\\\ 0  \\text{if } 0 \\le E  \\Delta \\end{cases}\n$$\nNote that for the gapless case $\\Delta=0$, the expression simplifies to $D(E) = \\frac{2E}{\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}$ for all $E \\ge 0$, which is the correct linear DOS for pristine graphene. For $E=0$ and $\\Delta=0$, $D(0)=0$. These formulas will be used to compute the results for cases $1$ through $6$.\n\nThe calculations will be performed using the provided constants:\n- $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s\n- $v_F = 1.0 \\times 10^6$ m/s\n- $g_{\\mathrm{deg}} = 4$",
