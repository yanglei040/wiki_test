            "problem": "A crystalline solid’s resistance to uniform compression is quantified by the isothermal bulk modulus, denoted $B_0$. For a cubic solid such as titanium nitride (TiN), the bulk modulus at zero pressure and $0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ can be obtained by fitting an Equation of State (EOS) to a set of total energies $E$ as a function of volume $V$.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid and well-posed exercise in computational materials science, specifically in the analysis of equation of state (EOS) data. It requires the determination of the isothermal bulk modulus, $B_0$, for a cubic solid by fitting synthetic energy-volume data to the third-order Birch–Murnaghan EOS. The problem is scientifically grounded, logically consistent, and all necessary data and constraints are provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in applying non-linear least squares fitting to a known physical model. The governing equation is the third-order Birch–Murnaghan EOS, which describes the total energy $E$ of a solid as a function of its volume $V$:\n$$\nE(V) \\;=\\; E_0 \\;+\\; \\frac{9 V_0 B_0}{16} \\left\\{ \\left[\\left(\\frac{V_0}{V}\\right)^{\\tfrac{2}{3}} - 1\\right]^3 B_0' \\;+\\; \\left[\\left(\\frac{V_0}{V}\\right)^{\\tfrac{2}{3}} - 1\\right]^2 \\left(6 \\;-\\; 4 \\left(\\frac{V_0}{V}\\right)^{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\right) \\right\\}\n$$\nThe parameters to be determined by the fit are the equilibrium energy $E_0$, the equilibrium volume $V_0$, the bulk modulus $B_0$, and its first pressure derivative $B_0'$.\n\nThe specified procedure involves two main steps for each test case:\n$1$. **Data Generation**: A set of energy-volume pairs $(V, E)$ is first synthesized using the provided \"true\" parameters ($E_0, V_0, B_0, B_0'$) and a list of volumes. For Test Case $3$, a constant energy offset of $+5.000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is added to all calculated energies. This simulates a change in the reference energy, which should only affect the fitted value of $E_0$ and leave other parameters, such as $B_0$, unchanged, as they depend on the shape of the $E(V)$ curve, not its absolute vertical position.\n\n$2$. **Parameter Fitting**: The synthesized $(V, E)$ data is then used as input for a non-linear least squares fitting procedure. The objective is to find the set of parameters $(E_0, V_0, B_0, B_0')$ that best reproduces the data when plugged into the Birch–Murnaghan EOS model. The primary value of interest is the fitted bulk modulus, $B_0$.\n\nThis task will be accomplished using the `curve_fit` function from the `scipy.optimize` library, which implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear optimization. The function requires a model function to fit, the independent data ($V$), the dependent data ($E$), and a set of initial guesses for the parameters.\n\nThe model function will be a direct implementation of the Birch–Murnaghan EOS. A critical detail is the handling of units. The equation requires the bulk modulus $B_0$ to be in units of energy per volume, specifically $\\mathrm{eV/\\AA^3}$. The input and output values for $B_0$ are specified in Gigapascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$). Therefore, the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{eV/\\AA^3} = 160.21766208\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ must be applied correctly within the model function. The fitting function will be defined to accept $B_0$ in $\\mathrm{GPa}$ and perform the conversion internally.\n\nTo ensure the stability and success of the fitting algorithm, reasonable initial guesses for the parameters are necessary. These can be estimated directly from the input $(V, E)$ data:\n- The initial guess for the equilibrium volume, $V_0^{\\text{guess}}$, is the volume corresponding to the minimum energy in the dataset.\n- The initial guess for the equilibrium energy, $E_0^{\\text{guess}}$, is this minimum energy value.\n- For the bulk modulus, $B_0^{\\text{guess}}$, a physically plausible value such as $200\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ can be used as a starting point.\n- For its pressure derivative, $B_0'^{\\text{guess}}$, a typical value is $4.0$.\n\nSince the data for fitting is generated from the exact model function without any noise, the non-linear least squares fit is expected to converge to the original \"true\" parameters with very high numerical precision. The final step is to report the fitted $B_0$ for each test case, in $\\mathrm{GPa}$ and rounded to two decimal places as required.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a standard task in solid-state physics: the determination of carrier effective mass from a given energy dispersion relation $E(k)$. The data, constants, and definitions are scientifically sound, consistent, and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying this problem is the effective mass approximation. Near a band extremum, such as a Conduction Band Minimum (CBM) or a Valence Band Maximum (VBM), the energy dispersion $E(k)$ can be approximated by a parabolic function of the wave vector $k$. For a one-dimensional dispersion along a specific direction, with the extremum located at $k=0$, this approximation is given by:\n$$\nE(k) \\approx E(0) + \\frac{1}{2} E''(0) k^2\n$$\nwhere $E(0)$ is the energy at the extremum and $E''(0)$ is the second derivative of the energy with respect to the wave vector, evaluated at $k=0$. This second derivative, or curvature, determines the effective mass $m^\\ast$ of the charge carrier.\n\nThe problem provides the definitions for electron and hole effective masses:\n- For an electron at a CBM (a minimum, so $E''(0) > 0$): $m_e^\\ast = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{E''(0)}$. The positive curvature results in a positive effective mass.\n- For a hole at a VBM (a maximum, so $E''(0) < 0$): $m_h^\\ast = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{E''(0)}$. The negative curvature, combined with the negative sign in the definition, results in a positive effective mass for the hole, as is conventional.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the value of the curvature, $E''(0)$, from the discrete data points $(k_i, E_i)$ provided for each case. The parabolic nature of the approximation suggests that fitting the data to a quadratic polynomial is the correct and most direct approach. We fit the function $E(k) = ak^2 + bk + c$ to the data. From this functional form, the second derivative is a constant:\n$$\nE'(k) = 2ak + b\n$$\n$$\nE''(k) = 2a\n$$\nTherefore, $E''(0) = 2a$. The coefficient $a$ of the quadratic term directly gives us the required curvature. The `numpy.polyfit` function is employed to perform a least-squares polynomial fit of degree $2$, which robustly determines the coefficient $a$.\n\nA critical aspect of the calculation is the consistent use of units. The input data provides energy $E$ in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) and wave vector $k$ in inverse meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$). The polynomial fit will therefore yield the coefficient $a$ in units of $\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$. The formula for effective mass requires all quantities to be in SI units. The reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, is given in $\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$. Thus, the curvature $E''(0) = 2a$ must be converted from units of $\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$ to $\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$. This conversion is achieved by multiplying by the elementary charge $e$, using the relation $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = e\\ \\mathrm{J}$, where $e$ is in Coulombs ($C$).\nThe curvature in SI units is therefore:\n$$\nE''_{\\mathrm{SI}}(0) = 2a \\times e\n$$\n\nThe calculation procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Use `numpy.polyfit` with the given arrays of $k$ and $E(k)$ data and a degree of $2$ to find the coefficients of the best-fit quadratic polynomial, $E(k) = ak^2 + bk + c$. The first returned coefficient is $a$.\n2.  Calculate the second derivative in SI units: $E''_{\\mathrm{SI}}(0) = 2 \\cdot a \\cdot e$. The value of $a$ is in $\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$ and $e$ is in $\\mathrm{C}$.\n3.  Calculate the effective mass $m^\\ast$ in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) using the appropriate formula based on the carrier type:\n    - If 'electron', $m^\\ast = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{E''_{\\mathrm{SI}}(0)}$.\n    - If 'hole', $m^\\ast = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{E''_{\\mathrm{SI}}(0)}$.\n4.  Compute the final dimensionless ratio $m^\\ast / m_e$, where $m_e$ is the free electron mass.\n5.

            "introduction": "Beyond static properties and electronic excitations, computational methods allow us to model dynamic processes at the atomic scale, such as diffusion. The rate of ion diffusion in a solid is critical for applications ranging from batteries to fuel cells and is governed by the energy barriers ions must overcome to hop between stable sites. This final practice  challenges you to build a potential energy model for a lithium ion migrating through a crystal lattice. By assembling a potential from fundamental physical interactions like electrostatics and Pauli repulsion, you will calculate the diffusion barrier, $\\Delta E$, and explore how it is influenced by local geometry and charge, providing insight into the design of high-performance energy materials.",

            "problem": "A lithium ion in layered lithium cobalt oxide is known to diffuse between two symmetry-equivalent octahedral sites by passing through a triangular oxygen gate that lies in the mid-plane between the sites. In a simplified, symmetry-preserving one-dimensional model, treat the migration coordinate as the scalar position $z$ of the lithium ion along the straight line connecting the two octahedral sites, with the mid-plane at $z=0$ and the octahedral site centers at $z=\\pm z_0$. Three equivalent oxygen ions form an equilateral triangle in the plane $z=0$ with in-plane radius $R$ from the path center. In this geometry, the lithium-to-oxygen distance is the same for all three oxygens and is $r(z)=\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}$.\n\nStarting from the following foundational and widely used ingredients:\n- Classical electrostatics (Coulomb’s law) in vacuum, expressed in electronvolts and ångströms by the constant $k_e = 14.399645478\\,\\mathrm{eV\\cdot \\AA \\cdot e^{-2}}$, so that the electrostatic interaction between point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ at separation $r$ is $V_C(r)=k_e\\,\\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r}$.\n- Short-range Pauli repulsion modeled by a Born–Mayer exponential, $V_{BM}(r)=A\\,e^{-r/\\rho}$, where $A$ and $\\rho$ are positive constants.\n- A symmetry-constrained even Taylor expansion for the lattice field energy along the migration coordinate that yields the minimal double-well form with two minima at $z=\\pm z_0$: $U_{lat}(z)=k_{lat}\\,(z^2-z_0^2)^2$, where $k_{lat}>0$.\n\nDefine the total potential energy along the migration path as\n$$\nE(z) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\big[\\, V_{BM}(r_i(z)) \\;+\\; V_C(r_i(z)) \\,\\big] \\;+\\; U_{lat}(z),\n$$\nwhere $r_i(z)=\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}$ for $i=1,2,3$, and $q_{Li}$ and $q_O$ are the effective charges (in units of the elementary charge $e$) assigned to lithium and oxygen, respectively.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that:\n- Constructs $E(z)$ from the given definitions.\n- Samples $E(z)$ on a uniform grid of at least $N=20001$ points over the closed interval $z\\in[-z_0,+z_0]$ (inclusive).\n- Computes the diffusion barrier\n$$\n\\Delta E \\;=\\; \\max_{z\\in[-z_0,+z_0]} E(z) \\;-\\; \\min\\big\\{E(-z_0),\\,E(+z_0)\\big\\}.\n$$\nBy symmetry, $E(-z_0)=E(+z_0)$ for the model parameters specified below, but your code should not assume this and must compute the stated expression.\n\nAll distances must be in ångströms ($\\AA$), charges in units of $e$, and energies in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$).

            "solution": "We begin from classical potential energy contributions and a symmetry-mandated lattice field to construct an effective one-dimensional energy profile along the lithium migration path between symmetry-equivalent octahedral sites. The fundamental physical bases are (i) Coulomb’s law for electrostatics, (ii) a Born–Mayer form for short-range repulsion capturing Pauli exclusion, and (iii) an even, minimal-degree Taylor expansion for a double-well lattice field consistent with the two equivalent sites.\n\nGeometry and distances. The three oxygen ions form an equilateral triangle in the plane $z=0$, each at in-plane radius $R$ from the path center. If the lithium is at $(0,0,z)$, the distance to any of the three oxygens is $r(z)=\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}$. Because of this symmetry, the three lithium–oxygen separations are equal for any $z$, so the sum over the three oxygen neighbors simply multiplies a single-pair interaction by $3$.\n\nPairwise interaction terms. For a single lithium–oxygen pair at separation $r$ we use\n$$\nV_{BM}(r)=A\\,e^{-r/\\rho},\\qquad\nV_C(r)=k_e\\,\\frac{q_{Li}\\,q_O}{r},\n$$\nwith $k_e=14.399645478\\,\\mathrm{eV\\cdot \\AA \\cdot e^{-2}}$, charges $q_{Li}$ and $q_O$ in units of the elementary charge $e$, and $r$ in $\\AA$. The Born–Mayer term $V_{BM}$ rises steeply at small $r$ due to Pauli repulsion, and the Coulomb term $V_C$ is attractive for opposite-sign charges ($q_{Li}q_O<0$).\n\nLattice field term. The minimal even polynomial with two equivalent minima at $z=\\pm z_0$ is\n$$\nU_{lat}(z)=k_{lat}\\,\\big(z^2-z_0^2\\big)^2,\n$$\nwith $k_{lat}>0$. This term is zero at $z=\\pm z_0$ and positive elsewhere, representing the crystal field preference for the octahedral sites.\n\nTotal energy profile. Combining the symmetric geometry (three identical $r(z)$ values) and the pairwise interactions with the lattice field yields\n$$\nE(z)=3\\left[A\\,e^{-\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}/\\rho}+k_e\\,\\frac{q_{Li}\\,q_O}{\\sqrt{R^2+z^2}}\\right]+k_{lat}\\,(z^2-z_0^2)^2.\n$$\n\nDiffusion barrier. The diffusion barrier along this path is the difference between the maximum energy encountered and the energy at the initial minimum. Since the two endpoints are symmetry-equivalent, we define\n$$\n\\Delta E=\\max_{z\\in[-z_0,+z_0]}E(z)-\\min\\{E(-z_0),E(+z_0)\\}.\n$$\nThis definition correctly yields $\\Delta E=0$ in the barrierless case where the interior is everywhere lower than or equal to the endpoints, and a positive value when a saddle exists along the path. It does not presume the position of the maximum.\n\nNumerical strategy. The function $E(z)$ is smooth and even, with potential strong gradients near $z=0$ if $R$ is small (narrow gate) due to the exponential $V_{BM}$. To robustly locate the maximum without resorting to derivative-based methods, we discretize the interval $[-z_0,+z_0]$ uniformly with $N\\ge 20001$ points (including endpoints), evaluate $E(z)$ at each point, and take the maximum. The endpoint energy is obtained by evaluating $E$ at $z=\\pm z_0$ directly; by symmetry they are equal, but the program computes both and takes their minimum to preserve generality. Finally, we round the barrier value to three decimal places as required.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n1. Read parameters $R$, $z_0$, $A$, $\\rho$, $k_{lat}$, $q_{Li}$, $q_O$.\n2. Construct a uniform grid $z_j=-z_0+j\\,\\Delta z$ for $j=0,\\dots,N-1$ with $N=20001$ and $\\Delta z=2z_0/(N-1)$.\n3. For each $z_j$, compute $r_j=\\sqrt{R^2+z_j^2}$.\n4. Compute $E_j=3\\left[A\\,e^{-r_j/\\rho}+k_e\\,\\dfrac{q_{Li}\\,q_O}{r_j}\\right]+k_{lat}\\,(z_j^2-z_0^2)^2$.\n5. Set $E_{max}=\\max_j E_j$ and $E_{end}=\\min(E(z=-z_0),E(z=+z_0))$.\n6. Compute $\\Delta E=\\max\\{E_{max}-E_{end},\\,0\\}$, where the outer maximum prevents negative values due to floating-point roundoff in barrierless cases.\n7. Output the list $[\\Delta E_1,\\Delta E_2,\\Delta E_3,\\Delta E_4]$ rounded to three decimals in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nPhysical interpretation of test cases:\n- Case 1 sets a baseline gate radius and moderate lattice anchoring, producing a finite barrier primarily controlled by the competition between Born–Mayer repulsion (raising energy near the gate) and Coulomb attraction (lowering energy as the ion approaches the gate).\n- Case 2 increases $R$ (a wider gate), which reduces short-range repulsion near $z=0$, possibly eliminating the barrier so that the maximum occurs at the endpoints, yielding $\\Delta E=0$.\n- Case 3 decreases $R$ (a narrower gate), steepening the repulsive wall and increasing the barrier.\n- Case 4 reduces the magnitude of the effective charges, weakening Coulomb stabilization and increasing the barrier relative to Case 1 for the same gate geometry.\n\nThis pipeline implements a first-principles-informed, symmetry-consistent effective model suitable for advanced undergraduate computational exploration of diffusion barriers in layered oxides, while remaining fully deterministic and testable.",
