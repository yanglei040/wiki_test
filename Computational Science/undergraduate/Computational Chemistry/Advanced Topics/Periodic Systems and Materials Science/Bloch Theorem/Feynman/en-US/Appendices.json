            "problem": "In the study of electron states in a one-dimensional crystal, a wavefunction must satisfy Bloch's theorem. Consider a hypothetical one-dimensional crystal with a lattice constant $a$. An electron in this crystal is proposed to have a wavefunction of the form $\\psi(x) = A \\sin(k_0 x)$, where $A$ is a normalization constant and $k_0$ is a positive real number representing a wavevector.\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, can this wavefunction be considered a valid Bloch function for this crystal?\n\nA. Yes, provided that $k_0 a = n \\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n\nB. Yes, provided that $k_0 a = 2n \\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n\nC. No, because a valid Bloch function must be a complex exponential, not a real-valued sinusoidal function.\n\nD. No, because the function $\\psi(x) = A \\sin(k_0 x)$ is not periodic with the lattice period $a$ for an arbitrary $k_0$.\n\nE. Yes, this is always a valid Bloch function for any value of $k_0$.",
            "solution": "According to Bloch's theorem, a function $\\psi(x)$ is a valid Bloch function for a one-dimensional lattice with lattice constant $a$ if it satisfies the condition:\n$$ \\psi(x+a) = C \\psi(x) $$\nfor all $x$, where $C$ is a complex constant with unit modulus, typically written as $C = \\exp(ika)$ for some real wavevector $k$. This wavevector $k$ is known as the crystal momentum.\n\nLet's test the given wavefunction, $\\psi(x) = A \\sin(k_0 x)$, against this condition.\nFirst, we evaluate the wavefunction at $x+a$:\n$$ \\psi(x+a) = A \\sin(k_0(x+a)) = A \\sin(k_0 x + k_0 a) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum, $\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) = \\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$ \\psi(x+a) = A (\\sin(k_0 x) \\cos(k_0 a) + \\cos(k_0 x) \\sin(k_0 a)) $$\nNow, we substitute this into the Bloch condition:\n$$ A (\\sin(k_0 x) \\cos(k_0 a) + \\cos(k_0 x) \\sin(k_0 a)) = C (A \\sin(k_0 x)) $$\nThe normalization constant $A$ is non-zero, so it can be canceled from both sides:\n$$ \\sin(k_0 x) \\cos(k_0 a) + \\cos(k_0 x) \\sin(k_0 a) = C \\sin(k_0 x) $$\nTo make the analysis clearer, let's rearrange the equation by moving all terms to one side:\n$$ \\sin(k_0 x) (\\cos(k_0 a) - C) + \\cos(k_0 x) \\sin(k_0 a) = 0 $$\nThis equation must hold for all values of $x$. The functions $\\sin(k_0 x)$ and $\\cos(k_0 x)$ are linearly independent for $k_0 \\neq 0$. For a linear combination of linearly independent functions to be zero for all values of the variable, the coefficients of each function must be zero.\nThis gives us two simultaneous conditions:\n1. The coefficient of $\\sin(k_0 x)$ must be zero: $\\cos(k_0 a) - C = 0 \\implies C = \\cos(k_0 a)$.\n2. The coefficient of $\\cos(k_0 x)$ must be zero: $\\sin(k_0 a) = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the second condition first. For $\\sin(k_0 a) = 0$, the argument $k_0 a$ must be an integer multiple of $\\pi$. That is:\n$$ k_0 a = n \\pi \\quad \\text{for some integer } n $$\nIf this condition is not met, the equation cannot be satisfied for all $x$, and $\\psi(x)$ is not a Bloch function.\n\nNow, let's assume this condition is met. We can then check the first condition. Substituting $k_0 a = n\\pi$ into the expression for $C$:\n$$ C = \\cos(n \\pi) $$\nFor any integer $n$, $\\cos(n \\pi)$ is either $+1$ (for even $n$) or $-1$ (for odd $n$). In both cases, the constant $C$ is a real number. We must also verify that its modulus is 1, i.e., $|C|=1$. Since $C = \\pm 1$, we have $|C|=1$, which is consistent with the requirements for a Bloch function.\nIf $n$ is even, $k_0 a = 2m\\pi$, $C=1$, so the crystal momentum $k$ satisfies $\\exp(ika)=1$, meaning $k=2p\\pi/a$ (a reciprocal lattice vector, including $k=0$).\nIf $n$ is odd, $k_0 a = (2m+1)\\pi$, $C=-1$, so the crystal momentum $k$ satisfies $\\exp(ika)=-1$, meaning $k=(2p+1)\\pi/a$ (the Brillouin zone boundary).\n\nTherefore, the function $\\psi(x) = A \\sin(k_0 x)$ is a valid Bloch function if and only if $k_0 a = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. The condition is $k_0 a = n \\pi$ for some integer $n$. This matches our derivation.\nB. This is too restrictive, as it only covers the cases where $C=+1$ and excludes the cases where $C=-1$ (odd $n$).\nC. This is incorrect. A Bloch function can be real. For instance, a superposition of Bloch states $\\psi_k(x)$ and $\\psi_{-k}(x)$ can be real. Our function is a standing wave, which can arise in a periodic potential.\nD. This is a common misunderstanding of Bloch's theorem. The theorem does not require the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ itself to be periodic with period $a$. It requires that it can be written as $\\psi(x) = u_k(x) \\exp(ikx)$ where the envelope function $u_k(x)$ is periodic with period $a$.\nE. This is incorrect, as we have shown that a specific condition must be met.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is A.",
