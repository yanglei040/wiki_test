            "problem": "You will implement a program to compute an approximation of the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) for the umbrella inversion of ammonia using a reduced two-mode model and to classify whether the IRC is straight or curved in mass-weighted coordinates. The IRC is defined as the steepest-descent path on the potential energy surface when expressed in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates. You must base your implementation on first principles and well-tested definitions, as specified below, and produce a single-line output summarizing classification results for a small test suite.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- In the reduced model, use two generalized coordinates: $x$ for the inversion (umbrella) coordinate and $y$ for a coupled totally symmetric stretch coordinate. The potential energy surface is specified as\n$$\nV(x,y) = A\\,(x^2 - x_0^2)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}k\\,y^2 + \\alpha\\,x^2\\,y,\n$$\nwith $A$, $x_0$, $k$, and $\\alpha$ being real constants.\n- Let the mass matrix be diagonal with entries $m_x$ and $m_y$ for $x$ and $y$, respectively. Define mass-weighted coordinates $\\mathbf{Q} = (Q_x,Q_y)$ by $Q_x = \\sqrt{m_x}\\,x$ and $Q_y = \\sqrt{m_y}\\,y$.\n- The mass-weighted gradient is defined by the chain rule as $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial Q_x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial Q_y}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_x}}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_y}}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\n- The IRC is the steepest-descent path in $\\mathbf{Q}$-space parameterized by the mass-weighted arc length $s$, satisfying unit-speed descent:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{Q}}{ds} = -\\frac{\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V(\\mathbf{Q})}{\\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V(\\mathbf{Q})\\rVert}.\n$$\n- The transition state (TS) for this model is at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. The initial IRC direction is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the mass-weighted Hessian at the TS. The mass-weighted Hessian is $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{Q}} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\,\\mathbf{H}\\,\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}$, where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the Hessian with respect to $(x,y)$ and $\\mathbf{M}=\\text{diag}(m_x,m_y)$.\n- The curvature $\\kappa(s)$ of a unit-speed curve $\\mathbf{Q}(s)$ is the norm of the derivative of the unit tangent $\\mathbf{T}(s)$ with respect to arc length:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\left\\lVert \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{ds}\\right\\rVert,\\quad \\text{where } \\mathbf{T}(s) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{Q}}{ds}.\n$$\nNumerically, with a discrete step $\\Delta s$, you may approximate $\\kappa$ at step $n$ by $\\kappa_n \\approx \\lVert \\mathbf{T}_{n+1}-\\mathbf{T}_n\\rVert / \\Delta s$.\n\nComputational task:\n- For each parameter set in the test suite, construct the IRC branches on both sides of the TS starting from $\\mathbf{Q}_0=(0,0)$ by taking an initial displacement of length $\\Delta s$ along $\\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{TS}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ is the unit unstable eigenvector of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{Q}}$ at the TS. Then iteratively step according to the unit-speed steepest-descent direction until the mass-weighted gradient norm falls below a specified threshold $\\varepsilon$ or a maximum number of steps is reached.\n- Along each branch, compute the discrete curvature sequence and take the maximum curvature $\\kappa_{\\max}$ observed on that branch. Combine the two branches by taking the overall maximum curvature across both branches.\n- Classify the IRC for that parameter set as straight if $\\kappa_{\\max} \\le \\tau$ and curved if $\\kappa_{\\max} > \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a given curvature tolerance.\n- You must implement all quantities strictly from the definitions above. No external data files are allowed.\n\nNumerical details:\n- Use $x$ and $y$ in ångström ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$), $m_x$ and $m_y$ in atomic mass units (amu), and energy in consistent arbitrary units. The curvature threshold $\\tau$ is in inverse mass-weighted length units, that is $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{amu}^{-1/2}$. The program’s final answers are booleans and therefore do not carry units.\n\nTest suite:\nFor all cases, use step length $\\Delta s = 0.002$, gradient norm threshold $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$, and maximum steps $N_{\\max} = 5000$. The parameters $(A,x_0,k,\\alpha,m_x,m_y)$ are:\n- Case 1: $A=10.0$, $x_0=0.5$, $k=5.0$, $\\alpha=0.0$, $m_x=1.0$, $m_y=1.0$, curvature threshold $\\tau=10^{-3}$.\n- Case 2: $A=10.0$, $x_0=0.5$, $k=5.0$, $\\alpha=0.5$, $m_x=1.0$, $m_y=1.0$, curvature threshold $\\tau=10^{-3}$.\n- Case 3: $A=10.0$, $x_0=0.5$, $k=5.0$, $\\alpha=0.5$, $m_x=1.0$, $m_y=9.0$, curvature threshold $\\tau=10^{-3}$.\n- Case 4: $A=10.0$, $x_0=0.5$, $k=5.0$, $\\alpha=2.0$, $m_x=1.0$, $m_y=1.0$, curvature threshold $\\tau=10^{-3}$.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the classification results for the four cases as a comma-separated list of booleans enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[ \\text{False}, \\text{True}, \\dots ]$), but with no whitespace, that is exactly of the form $[\\text{result1},\\text{result2},\\text{result3},\\text{result4}]$ where each $\\text{result}$ is either $True$ or $False$.\n\nNo user input should be read by the program. The program must be fully deterministic and self-contained. The final printed line must strictly match the specified format.",
            "solution": "The problem presented is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in computational chemistry concerning the calculation of an Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) and its geometric properties. All necessary parameters, definitions, and algorithmic procedures are provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe objective is to compute an approximation of the IRC for a two-dimensional model potential energy surface (PES) and classify its path as either straight or curved based on its maximum curvature in mass-weighted coordinates.\n\nThe PES is given by the function $V(x,y)$:\n$$\nV(x,y) = A(x^2 - x_0^2)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 + \\alpha x^2 y\n$$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are generalized coordinates. To follow the IRC, which is a steepest-descent path, we require the gradient of the potential. The components of the gradient $\\nabla V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\right)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 4A(x^2 - x_0^2)(2x) + 2\\alpha xy = 4A(x^3 - x_0^2 x) + 2\\alpha xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = ky + \\alpha x^2\n$$\nThe IRC is defined in mass-weighted coordinates $\\mathbf{Q} = (Q_x, Q_y)$, where $Q_x = \\sqrt{m_x} x$ and $Q_y = \\sqrt{m_y} y$. The mass matrix is $\\mathbf{M} = \\text{diag}(m_x, m_y)$. The gradient in these coordinates, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V$, is obtained through the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial Q_x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial Q_y}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_x}}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_y}}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThe IRC path $\\mathbf{Q}(s)$, parameterized by the mass-weighted arc length $s$, is governed by the differential equation for unit-speed steepest descent:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{Q}}{ds} = -\\frac{\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V(\\mathbf{Q})}{\\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V(\\mathbf{Q})\\rVert} \\equiv \\mathbf{T}(\\mathbf{Q})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}(\\mathbf{Q})$ is the unit tangent vector to the path.\n\nThe path begins at the transition state (TS), which is a first-order saddle point on the PES. The problem states the TS is at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. At this point, the gradient components are $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}|_{(0,0)} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}|_{(0,0)} = 0$, confirming it is a stationary point.\n\nTo determine the character of this stationary point and the initial direction of the IRC, we must analyze the Hessian matrix of second derivatives. The Hessian in $(x,y)$ coordinates is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12Ax^2 - 4Ax_0^2 + 2\\alpha y & 2\\alpha x \\\\ 2\\alpha x & k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAt the TS $(x,y)=(0,0)$, the Hessian simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4Ax_0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe corresponding mass-weighted Hessian is $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{Q}} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}$. At the TS, this is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{Q}}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{m_x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{m_y} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4Ax_0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & k \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{m_x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{m_y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4Ax_0^2/m_x & 0 \\\\ 0 & k/m_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor the given parameters, $A > 0$ and $k > 0$, hence $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{Q}}(0,0)$ has one negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = -4Ax_0^2/m_x$, and one positive eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = k/m_y$. This confirms the TS is a first-order saddle point. The eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue, the unstable mode, defines the initial direction of the IRC. For this diagonal Hessian, the normalized eigenvector is simply $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{TS}} = (1, 0)^T$.\n\nThe IRC is traced numerically using a forward Euler integration scheme. Two branches are generated, starting with an initial displacement of $\\Delta s$ from the TS along the directions $\\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{TS}}$. The first points on the two branches are $\\mathbf{Q}_1^{\\pm} = (0,0) \\pm \\Delta s \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathrm{TS}} = (\\pm \\Delta s, 0)^T$. From each of these starting points, the path is propagated iteratively:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{Q}_n + \\Delta s \\cdot \\mathbf{T}(\\mathbf{Q}_n)\n$$\nThe iteration continues until the norm of the mass-weighted gradient $\\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{Q}} V(\\mathbf{Q}_n)\\rVert$ falls below a threshold $\\varepsilon$, or a maximum number of steps $N_{\\max}$ is reached.\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of the path measures its deviation from a straight line. It is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length: $\\kappa(s) = \\lVert d\\mathbf{T}/ds \\rVert$. Numerically, for a sequence of tangent vectors $\\mathbf{T}_n$ computed at each step, the curvature is approximated using a finite difference:\n$$\n\\kappa_n \\approx \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{T}_{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}_n \\rVert}{\\Delta s}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}_n$ is the tangent vector at point $\\mathbf{Q}_n$. The maximum curvature $\\kappa_{\\max}$ is found by taking the maximum value of $\\kappa_n$ over the entire path, comprising both branches.\n\nFinally, the IRC is classified as \"curved\" if $\\kappa_{\\max} > \\tau$ and \"straight\" if $\\kappa_{\\max} \\le \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a given tolerance. For the special case where the coupling constant $\\alpha = 0$, the potential is separable in $x$ and $y$. The initial displacement is along the $Q_x$ axis, and since the gradient component along $Q_y$ will always be zero if $y=0$, the path remains confined to the $Q_x$ axis. The tangent vector does not change direction, resulting in zero curvature. For $\\alpha \\neq 0$, the $x$ and $y$ motions are coupled. The gradient at a point with $y=0$ but $x \\neq 0$ has a non-zero $y$-component, causing the path to curve into the $Q_y$ dimension. The extent of this curvature depends on the parameters $\\alpha$, $m_x$, and $m_y$.",

It is normalized to unit length, oriented such that its $y$-component is positive, and scaled by $\\varepsilon = 10^{-3}$ to give the initial position $\\mathbf{r}_{0, \\mathrm{faulty}} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{faulty}}$.\n\nThe mass-weighted Hessian $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{mw}}$ is defined as\n$$ \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{mw}} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{-2B}{m_1} & \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{m_1 m_2}} \\\\ \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{m_1 m_2}} & \\frac{2C}{m_2} \\end{pmatrix}, $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} = \\text{diag}(1/\\sqrt{m_1}, 1/\\sqrt{m_2})$. The determinant of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{mw}}$ is $(-4BC - D^2)/(m_1 m_2)$, which is also always negative, guaranteeing a unique unstable mode. The correct-flow initial condition is determined by the eigenvector of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{mw}}$ corresponding to its negative eigenvalue. Let this eigenvector (in mass-weighted coordinates) be $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{correct}}$. It must be converted back to Cartesian coordinates via $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{correct}} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{correct}}$. This Cartesian vector is then normalized, oriented such that its $x$-component is positive, and scaled by $\\varepsilon$ to give the initial position $\\mathbf{r}_{0, \\mathrm{correct}} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{correct}}$.\n\nWith the ODEs and initial conditions defined, we numerically integrate both systems forward in the path parameter $s$ until they converge to a stable critical point of the PES, i.e., a point where $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V = \\mathbf{0}$. These are the potential energy minima. For this task, a robust numerical ODE solver, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, is employed.\n\nThe potential $V(x,y)$ has two minima, located at positions $(\\pm x_{\\min}^\\star, y_{\\min, \\pm}^\\star)$ where\n$$ x_{\\min}^\\star = \\sqrt{\\frac{2B + D^2/(2C)}{4A}}, \\quad y_{\\min}^\\star = -\\frac{D}{2C} x_{\\min}^\\star. $$\nLet us denote the minimum with a positive $x$-coordinate as $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, +1}$ and the one with a negative $x$-coordinate as $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, -1}$. The terminal point of each flow, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{final}}$, is classified by assigning it a label of $+1$ if it is closer in Euclidean distance to $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, +1}$, and $-1$ if it is closer to $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, -1}$.\n\nFor each set of parameters $(A, B, C, D, m_1, m_2)$, we perform the following procedure:\n1.  Compute $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{mw}}$.\n2.  Find the unstable eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{faulty}}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{correct}}$ in Cartesian coordinates, applying the specified orientation rules.\n3.  Determine the initial positions $\\mathbf{r}_{0, \\mathrm{faulty}}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{0, \\mathrm{correct}}$.\n4.  Numerically solve the ODEs for both flows to find the terminal points $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{final, faulty}}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{final, correct}}$.\n5.  Compute the locations of the two minima, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, +1}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\min, -1}$.\n6.  Assign labels $L_{\\mathrm{faulty}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{correct}}$ by comparing the distances of the terminal points to the two minima.\n7.  The result for the test case is the boolean value of the expression $L_{\\mathrm{faulty}} \\neq L_{\\mathrm{correct}}$.\n\nThis entire logic is implemented in a Python script, which iterates through the provided test cases and generates the final list of boolean values.",

This is a standard procedure in computational chemistry for analyzing the nature of vibrational normal modes or, as in this case, the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC). The IRC at a transition state describes the path of steepest descent from a first-order saddle point on the potential energy surface down to the reactants and products. Its tangent vector indicates the primary atomic motions involved in traversing the transition state barrier. We are tasked to compute the fractional contribution of the C-N bond stretch to this tangent vector for three given cases.\n\nThe problem is scientifically and computationally well-posed. All necessary data, including atomic masses, Cartesian coordinates for the transition state geometry, and definitions for all relevant vectors and metrics, are provided unambiguously. The underlying principles—mass-weighting of coordinates, vector normalization, and projection—are fundamental concepts in classical mechanics and linear algebra, correctly applied to a chemical physics context. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe will proceed with a systematic, step-by-step calculation for each test case.\n\nFirst, we establish the constant parameters and vectors derived from the provided geometry and masses.\nThe atomic masses are given as $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.008$ u, $m_{\\mathrm{C}} = 12.000$ u, and $m_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.000$ u.

For a $9$-dimensional Cartesian displacement vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{9}$, the corresponding mass-weighted vector is $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{M}^{1/2} \\mathbf{x}$. The diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{M}^{1/2}$ are $(\\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{C}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{C}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{C}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}, \\sqrt{m_{\\mathrm{N}}})$.\n\nThe transition state coordinates are $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{H}} = (-0.200, 0.000, 0.900)$ Å, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} = (0.000, 0.000, 0.000)$ Å, and $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{N}} = (1.160, 0.000, 0.000)$ Å.\n\nThe unit vector along the carbon–nitrogen bond, $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{N}} - \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} = (1.160, 0.000, 0.000) - (0.000, 0.000, 0.000) = (1.160, 0.000, 0.000)\n$$\n$$\n\\lVert \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{N}} - \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{C}} \\rVert = \\sqrt{1.160^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = 1.160\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN}} = \\frac{(1.160, 0.000, 0.000)}{1.160} = (1, 0, 0)\n$$\nThis vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN}}$ is used to define the normalized Cartesian C–N bond-stretch displacement direction, $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$, which serves as our reference vector for the C-N stretch motion.\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(0,0,0,\\,-\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},x},-\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},y},-\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},z},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},x},\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},y},\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN},z}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\mathrm{CN}} = (1, 0, 0)$, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)\n$$\nThis vector is normalized in Cartesian space, i.e., $\\lVert \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} \\rVert = 1$.\n\nFor each test case, we are given a Cartesian displacement pattern $\\mathbf{v}^{(\\mathrm{cart})}$ and must perform the following sequence of operations:\n$1$.
