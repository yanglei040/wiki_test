This elegant formula connects the reaction's thermodynamic driving force, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, with the energy cost of structural rearrangement, $\\lambda$.

Mastering this classification is key to understanding the full scope of electron transfer kinetics and interpreting experimental data. ",

            "problem": "The Marcus theory of electron transfer provides a framework for understanding the rates of outer-sphere electron transfer reactions, which are fundamental processes in chemistry and biology. The theory relates the activation energy of the reaction, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, to two key parameters: the standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, and the reorganization energy, $\\lambda$.

            "problem": "A donor–acceptor electron transfer is modeled by two harmonic free-energy surfaces along a single dimensionless solvent coordinate $q$ with identical curvature $\\kappa$, with the donor surface given by $G_{\\mathrm{D}}(q)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa(q-q_{\\mathrm{D}})^{2}$ and the acceptor surface given by $G_{\\mathrm{A}}(q)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa(q-q_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2}+\\Delta G^\\circ$.

Use the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ as needed. All energies must be treated in electronvolts.\n\nYou are given the following fixed parameter values for the donor–acceptor pair:\n- Reorganization energy $\\lambda = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Electronic coupling $V = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Temperature $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Harmonic curvature $\\kappa = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ per squared unit of the dimensionless coordinate (you may assume $q_{\\mathrm{D}}=0$, which fixes $q_{\\mathrm{A}}$ by $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$).\n- Constants: $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\hbar = 6.582119569\\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,s}$.\n\nFor this fixed donor–acceptor pair, scan the driving force values $\\Delta G^\\circ$ in the following test set (in electronvolts): $\\left[-1.8,-1.2,-0.6,0.0,0.6,1.2\\right]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement provides a well-defined scenario for calculating electron transfer rates based on classical Marcus theory. The problem is chemically and physically sound, self-contained, and all parameters are provided with consistent units. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe electron transfer process involves a transition from a donor state, $\\mathrm{D}$, to an acceptor state, $\\mathrm{A}$. The free energies of these states are modeled as harmonic functions of a collective solvent coordinate, $q$:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{D}}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(q-q_{\\mathrm{D}})^{2} $$\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{A}}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(q-q_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2} + \\Delta G^\\circ $$\nwhere $G_{\\mathrm{D}}(q)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{A}}(q)$ are the free energies of the initial and final states, $\\kappa$ is the harmonic curvature, $q_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{A}}$ are the equilibrium solvent coordinates, and $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is the standard free energy change of the reaction, or driving force.\n\nIn the nonadiabatic, high-temperature, and classical limit, the rate constant for electron transfer, $k_{\\mathrm{ET}}$, is given by the Marcus equation, which is derived from Fermi's Golden Rule:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{ET}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |V|^2 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\Delta G^\\circ + \\lambda)^2}{4 \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) $$\nThe terms in this fundamental equation are:\n- $\\hbar$: The reduced Planck constant.\n- $V$: The electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor electronic states.\n- $\\lambda$: The reorganization energy, defined as $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(q_{\\mathrm{A}}-q_{\\mathrm{D}})^{2}$. It is the energy required to reorganize the solvent and intramolecular geometry from the donor's equilibrium configuration to that of the acceptor, without the electron having been transferred.\n- $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$: The Boltzmann constant.\n- $T$: The absolute temperature.\n\nThe argument of the exponential represents the ratio of the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, to the thermal energy, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$. The classical activation barrier is given by:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\frac{(\\Delta G^\\circ + \\lambda)^2}{4 \\lambda} $$\nThis barrier arises at the intersection of the $G_{\\mathrm{D}}(q)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{A}}(q)$ surfaces.\n\nThe calculation requires direct substitution of the given parameters into the rate equation. The constant parameter values are:\n- $\\lambda = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $V = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,s}$\n\nThe equation for $k_{\\mathrm{ET}}$ will be solved for each driving force $\\Delta G^\\circ$ in the test set $\\{-1.8, -1.2, -0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 1.2\\}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe relationship between $k_{\\mathrm{ET}}$ and $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is of critical importance. The rate is maximized when the activation energy $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is at a minimum. This minimum, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 0$, occurs when $\\Delta G^\\circ = -\\lambda$. This is the condition for barrierless electron transfer. For the given $\\lambda = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the maximum rate will occur at $\\Delta G^\\circ = -0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This corresponds to the third value in the test set, thus the $0$-based index of the maximum rate, $i_{\\max}$, must be $2$.\n\nWhen $\\Delta G^\\circ > -\\lambda$, the reaction is in the \"normal\" Marcus region, where increasing the driving force (making $\\Delta G^\\circ$ more negative) increases the rate. When $\\Delta G^\\circ  -\\lambda$, the reaction is in the \"inverted\" region, where increasing the driving force *decreases* the rate. The boolean flag checks whether the rate at $\\Delta G^\\circ = -1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is strictly less than the rate at $\\Delta G^\\circ = -0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Since $\\Delta G^\\circ = -0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ yields the maximum rate, the rate at any other point, including $\\Delta G^\\circ = -1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, must be lower. Therefore, the boolean flag must evaluate to $\\mathrm{True}$.\n\nThe computational task is to evaluate the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ET}}$ for each of the specified $\\Delta G^\\circ$ values, round the results to $6$ significant figures, and assemble them along with the index of the maximum rate and the specified boolean flag into the final output structure.
