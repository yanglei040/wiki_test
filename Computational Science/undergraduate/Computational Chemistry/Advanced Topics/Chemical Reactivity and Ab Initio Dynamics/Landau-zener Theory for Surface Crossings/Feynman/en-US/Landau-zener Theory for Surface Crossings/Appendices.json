In many systems, such as molecular vibrations or an electron in a quantum well, a particle can pass through a potential energy surface crossing multiple times. This exercise  builds upon the single-passage Landau-Zener formula to explore a two-passage scenario. By assuming decoherence between passages, you will practice combining probabilities from independent events to predict the final state of the system after a full oscillation.",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional nuclear degree of freedom moves on two coupled electronic states described by two diabatic potential energy surfaces that cross linearly at coordinate $x_{c}$. Near $x_{c}$, the diabatic energy difference is linear in $x$ with slope magnitude $|\\Delta F|$, and the diabatic electronic coupling is a constant $V$. A classical nuclear trajectory is trapped in a potential well that causes it to pass the crossing point $x_{c}$ twice per oscillation with the same speed magnitude $v$ at each passage. Assume:\n- the motion is sufficiently localized that the linear crossing approximation holds at each passage,\n- the coupling $V$ and the speed $v$ are constant across the crossing region for each passage,\n- complete decoherence between passages so that the two passages are statistically independent,\n- the system starts the period far from the crossing on the lower adiabatic electronic state.\n\nUsing Landau-Zener theory for a single passage through a linear avoided crossing, express the probability (as a decimal, not a percentage) that, after completing one full oscillation (i.e., after two passages through $x_{c}$), the system is found on the upper adiabatic electronic state. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $V$, $v$, $|\\Delta F|$, and $\\hbar$. Do not round your answer.",
            "solution": "The fundamental component of this problem is the Landau-Zener formula, which gives the probability of a diabatic transition during a single passage through a linear curve crossing. A diabatic transition, in this context, means the system remains on its initial diabatic potential energy curve. This corresponds to a \"hop\" between adiabatic potential energy surfaces. The probability of such a transition, which we denote as $P_{hop}$, is given by:\n$$\nP_{hop} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar v \\left| \\frac{d(E_1 - E_2)}{dx} \\right| }\\right)\n$$\nHere, $V$ is the diabatic coupling, $v$ is the nuclear speed through the crossing, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\left| \\frac{d(E_1 - E_2)}{dx} \\right|$ is the magnitude of the slope of the difference between the diabatic energies at the crossing point. The problem provides this slope magnitude as $|\\Delta F|$. Therefore, the single-passage probability of hopping from one adiabatic state to the other is:\n$$\np = P_{hop} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar v |\\Delta F|}\\right)\n$$\nCorrespondingly, the probability of an adiabatic transition (staying on the same adiabatic potential energy surface) during a single passage is:\n$$\nP_{stay} = 1 - p = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar v |\\Delta F|}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system starts on the lower adiabatic state. It then undergoes two passages through the crossing region. The assumption of complete decoherence between passages implies that the two events are statistically independent. We can calculate the final state probability by tracking the population on each adiabatic state through the two-step process.\n\nLet $P_L(n)$ and $P_U(n)$ be the probabilities of finding the system on the lower and upper adiabatic states, respectively, after $n$ passages.\nThe initial condition is that the system is on the lower adiabatic state:\n$P_L(0) = 1$\n$P_U(0) = 0$\n\nAfter the first passage ($n=1$):\nThe system can transition to the upper state with probability $p$ or remain on the lower state with probability $1-p$.\nThe probability of being on the upper state is:\n$P_U(1) = P_L(0) \\cdot p + P_U(0) \\cdot (1-p) = (1)(p) + (0)(1-p) = p$\nThe probability of being on the lower state is:\n$P_L(1) = P_L(0) \\cdot (1-p) + P_U(0) \\cdot p = (1)(1-p) + (0)(p) = 1-p$\nAs a check, the total probability is $P_U(1) + P_L(1) = p + (1-p) = 1$.\n\nAfter the second passage ($n=2$):\nThe system starts this passage with populations $P_L(1)$ and $P_U(1)$. We wish to find the final probability of being on the upper state, $P_U(2)$. This can be achieved in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1. The system was on the lower state after the first passage (with probability $P_L(1)$) and then hopped to the upper state during the second passage (with probability $p$). The probability for this path is $P_L(1) \\cdot p$.\n2. The system was on the upper state after the first passage (with probability $P_U(1)$) and then stayed on the upper state during the second passage (with probability $1-p$). The probability for this path is $P_U(1) \\cdot (1-p)$.\n\nThe total probability of being on the upper state after two passages is the sum of the probabilities of these two paths:\n$P_U(2) = (P_L(1) \\cdot p) + (P_U(1) \\cdot (1-p))$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_L(1)$ and $P_U(1)$:\n$P_U(2) = ((1-p) \\cdot p) + (p \\cdot (1-p))$\n$P_U(2) = p(1-p) + p(1-p) = 2p(1-p)$\n\nNow, we substitute the full expression for the single-passage hopping probability $p$:\n$$\nP_U(2) = 2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar v |\\Delta F|}\\right) \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar v |\\Delta F|}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the probability that the system is found on the upper adiabatic state after one full oscillation comprising two independent passages.",

This practice  puts you in the driver's seat, asking you to model a charge transfer reaction where an external electric field modifies the potential energy surfaces.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional charge transfer system modeled by two diabatic electronic states interacting along a reaction coordinate $R$. Use atomic units (a.u.) throughout. The diabatic potentials are taken to be linear functions of $R$ with opposite slopes and an energy offset, and an external uniform electric field $F$ modifies their relative energies via a constant dipole moment difference. Let the diabatic energy difference be\n$$\n\\Delta E(R;F) = V_1(R;F) - V_2(R;F) = 2 a \\left(R - R_0\\right) + \\Delta_0 - \\Delta \\mu\\, F,\n$$\nwhere $a$ is a constant slope parameter, $R_0$ is a reference coordinate, $\\Delta_0$ is the zero-field energy offset at $R=R_0$, and $\\Delta \\mu$ is the constant diabatic dipole moment difference that couples to the field $F$.\n\nThe diabatic states are coupled by an off-diagonal electronic coupling $V_{12}(F)$ that depends on the field according to\n$$\nV_{12}(F) = V_{12}^0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta F^2\\right),\n$$\nwhere $V_{12}^0$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants.\n\nAssume the Landau–Zener model applies for a classical trajectory that traverses the crossing region with a constant positive velocity $v$ along $R$. In this model, the crossing coordinate $R_c$ satisfies $V_1(R_c;F) = V_2(R_c;F)$, the minimum adiabatic energy gap at $R_c$ equals $2 \\lvert V_{12}(F)\\rvert$, and the nonadiabatic transition probability to change adiabatic surface upon traversing the avoided crossing is given by the standard Landau–Zener result expressed in terms of the local sweep rate through the diabatic energy difference. Work entirely in atomic units (a.u.), where $\\hbar = 1$.\n\nUse the following parameter values, all in atomic units:\n- $a = 0.2$,\n- $R_0 = 3.0$,\n- $\\Delta_0 = 0.1$,\n- $\\Delta \\mu = 2.0$,\n- $V_{12}^0 = 0.05$,\n- $\\beta = 0.5$.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that, for each test case $(F, v)$ listed below, computes:\n- the crossing coordinate $R_c$ in Bohr, rounded to $6$ decimal places,\n- the minimum adiabatic energy gap at the avoided crossing, $2 \\lvert V_{12}(F)\\rvert$, in Hartree, rounded to $6$ decimal places,\n- the Landau–Zener nonadiabatic transition probability to change adiabatic surface, expressed as a decimal rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite (each pair is $(F,v)$, with $F$ in atomic units of electric field and $v$ in Bohr per atomic unit of time):\n- $(0.0, 0.02)$,\n- $(0.5, 0.02)$,\n- $(-0.5, 0.02)$,\n- $(2.0, 0.02)$,\n- $(0.5, 0.2)$,\n- $(4.0, 0.02)$.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is the list $[R_c,\\; \\text{gap},\\; P_{\\mathrm{NA}}]$ for one test case.

            "solution": "The solution requires the calculation of three quantities for each test case $(F, v)$: the crossing coordinate $R_c$, the minimum adiabatic energy gap at $R_c$, and the nonadiabatic transition probability $P_{\\mathrm{NA}}$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Crossing Coordinate, $R_c$**\n\nThe crossing coordinate $R_c$ is the point where the diabatic potential energies are equal, $V_1(R_c;F) = V_2(R_c;F)$. This is equivalent to the condition that their difference is zero: $\\Delta E(R_c;F) = 0$.\nUsing the given expression for the diabatic energy difference:\n$$\n\\Delta E(R;F) = 2 a \\left(R - R_0\\right) + \\Delta_0 - \\Delta \\mu\\, F\n$$\nWe set this expression to zero at $R = R_c$:\n$$\n2 a \\left(R_c - R_0\\right) + \\Delta_0 - \\Delta \\mu\\, F = 0\n$$\nSolving for $R_c$ yields the following formula:\n$$\n2 a (R_c - R_0) = \\Delta \\mu F - \\Delta_0\n$$\n$$\nR_c - R_0 = \\frac{\\Delta \\mu F - \\Delta_0}{2a}\n$$\n$$\nR_c(F) = R_0 + \\frac{\\Delta \\mu F - \\Delta_0}{2a}\n$$\nThis formula allows for the direct calculation of the crossing coordinate for any given electric field strength $F$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Minimum Adiabatic Energy Gap**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the minimum adiabatic energy gap at the avoided crossing is equal to $2 \\lvert V_{12}(F)\\rvert$. The field-dependent diabatic coupling $V_{12}(F)$ is given by:\n$$\nV_{12}(F) = V_{12}^0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta F^2\\right)\n$$\nSince the parameters $V_{12}^0$ and $\\beta$ are given as positive constants, the value of $V_{12}(F)$ is always real and positive for any real field $F$. Therefore, the absolute value is redundant. The energy gap, which we denote as $\\Delta E_{\\text{gap}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{gap}}(F) = 2 V_{12}(F) = 2 V_{12}^0 \\exp(-\\beta F^2)\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Landau-Zener Nonadiabatic Transition Probability, $P_{\\mathrm{NA}}$**\n\nThe Landau-Zener probability for a nonadiabatic transition (i.e., for the system to remain on the diabatic curve and thus switch adiabatic surfaces) is given by the formula:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{NA}} = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{2\\pi \\lvert V_{12} \\rvert^2}{\\hbar \\left| \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(V_1 - V_2\\right) \\right|_{R=R_c}} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $V_{12}$ is the coupling at the crossing, which is $V_{12}(F)$. In atomic units, $\\hbar=1$. The term in the denominator is the time rate of change of the diabatic energy difference as the system passes through the crossing point. This sweep rate can be expressed using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(V_1 - V_2\\right) = \\frac{d (\\Delta E)}{dt} = \\frac{d (\\Delta E)}{dR} \\frac{dR}{dt}\n$$\nThe velocity along the reaction coordinate is constant, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = v$. The slope of the diabatic energy difference with respect to $R$ is found by differentiating $\\Delta E(R;F)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d (\\Delta E)}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ 2 a (R - R_0) + \\Delta_0 - \\Delta \\mu F \\right] = 2a\n$$\nThis slope is constant. Therefore, the absolute value of the sweep rate is:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{d (\\Delta E)}{dt} \\right|_{R=R_c} = |(2a) \\cdot v|\n$$\nSince both $a$ and $v$ are given as positive constants, the absolute value is not needed. The sweep rate is $2av$. Substituting these components into the Landau-Zener formula:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{NA}}(F, v) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{2\\pi (V_{12}(F))^2}{1 \\cdot (2av)} \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\pi (V_{12}(F))^2}{av} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{12}(F) = V_{12}^0 \\exp(-\\beta F^2)$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{NA}}(F, v) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\pi \\left(V_{12}^0 \\exp(-\\beta F^2)\\right)^2}{av} \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\pi (V_{12}^0)^2 \\exp(-2\\beta F^2)}{av} \\right)\n$$\nThis final expression will be used for computation.\n\n**Summary of Formulas for Implementation**:\nGiven the parameters $a, R_0, \\Delta_0, \\Delta \\mu, V_{12}^0, \\beta$ and a test case $(F, v)$:\n1.  Crossing Coordinate: $R_c = R_0 + (\\Delta \\mu F - \\Delta_0) / (2a)$\n2.  Energy Gap: $\\Delta E_{\\text{gap}} = 2 V_{12}^0 \\exp(-\\beta F^2)$\n3.  Transition Probability: $P_{\\mathrm{NA}} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{\\pi (V_{12}^0)^2 \\exp(-2\\beta F^2)}{av} \\right)$\n\nThese formulas will be implemented for each test case to produce the final results.",
