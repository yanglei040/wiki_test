We will build a simple yet powerful continuum solvent model to estimate the hydration free energy change when an amino acid sidechain is mutated. By implementing the Born model for electrostatics and a surface-area-dependent term for nonpolar effects, you will gain hands-on experience in how these physical contributions are quantified and combined . This exercise is a crucial first step toward understanding how computational models parse the complex interplay of forces that govern molecular behavior in solution.",

            "problem": "You are asked to compute the change in hydration free energy for mutating a single amino acid sidechain from Alanine to Valine using a physically grounded, continuum-solvent model. Your program must implement the following modeling assumptions, which are to be derived from foundational definitions in statistical mechanics and classical electrostatics:\n\n- The hydration free energy is the reversible work to transfer a solute from vacuum into a continuum solvent. The change upon mutation is defined as the hydration free energy of the Valine sidechain minus that of the Alanine sidechain. You must assume an additive decomposition into a polar electrostatic term and a nonpolar term based on solvent-accessible surface area (SASA).\n\n- For the polar term, use the classical charging argument for a single spherical site with net charge $q$ and radius $R$ embedded in a dielectric continuum of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_s$. The reversible charging work must be consistent with the Born model, which you should derive in your reasoning and then implement. Use the Coulomb conversion constant $k_e = 332.06371$ in units of $\\mathrm{kcal \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}/(mol \\cdot e^2)}$, elementary charge $e$, and Ångström $\\mathrm{\\AA}$. The solvent permittivity $\\varepsilon_s$ is dimensionless.\n\n- For the nonpolar term, approximate the free energy of cavity formation and dispersion as proportional to the SASA: $G_{\\mathrm{np}} = \\gamma A + \\beta$, where $A = 4 \\pi R^2$ for a single spherical site, $\\gamma$ is a constant with units $\\mathrm{kcal/(mol \\cdot \\AA^2)}$, and $\\beta$ is an offset with units $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$. The offset $\\beta$ cancels out for a mutation in which $\\beta$ is unchanged between states.\n\nGiven a parameter set defining solvent and sidechain sphere parameters for Alanine and Valine, compute the hydration free energy change\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = \\left[G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} + G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Val}}\\right] - \\left[G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}} + G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}}\\right]\n$$\nin units of $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.\n\nYour program must implement the model from first principles described above and produce numerical results for the following test suite. Each case specifies the solvent permittivity $\\varepsilon_s$, the nonpolar coefficient $\\gamma$, the nonpolar offset $\\beta$, and the spherical site parameters for Alanine and Valine: charge $q$ (in units of $e$) and radius $R$ (in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical electrostatics and statistical mechanics, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the change in hydration free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$, for the mutation of an Alanine ($\\mathrm{Ala}$) sidechain to a Valine ($\\mathrm{Val}$) sidechain. The total hydration free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$, is defined as the reversible work to transfer a solute from vacuum into a solvent. The change for the mutation is given by:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(\\mathrm{Val}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}(\\mathrm{Ala}) $$\nThe model specified decomposes the hydration free energy into an electrostatic polar term, $G_{\\mathrm{polar}}$, and a nonpolar term, $G_{\\mathrm{np}}$, related to surface area. Thus, for a given species $i$ (either $\\mathrm{Ala}$ or $\\mathrm{Val}$):\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}^{i} = G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{i} + G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{i} $$\nThe total change for the mutation is:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = (G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} + G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Val}}) - (G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}} + G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}}) = (G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}}) + (G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}}) $$\n\nWe shall derive each term from the fundamental principles stipulated.\n\nFirst, we address the polar contribution, $G_{\\mathrm{polar}}$, using the Born model. This term represents the electrostatic work of transferring a charged sphere from vacuum (relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{vac} = 1$) to a solvent with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_s$. This work is equivalent to the change in the electrostatic self-energy of the ion. The self-energy of a conducting sphere of radius $R$ is the work required to charge it from a net charge of $0$ to its final charge $Q$.\n\nIn a medium with uniform permittivity $\\varepsilon$, the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$ carrying a charge $q'$ is $\\phi(q') = k_c \\frac{q'}{\\varepsilon R}$, where $k_c = (4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^{-1}$ is Coulomb's constant in SI units. The incremental work $dW$ required to bring an additional infinitesimal charge $dq'$ to the sphere's surface is $dW = \\phi(q') dq'$.\nThe total self-energy, $W_{self}$, is the integral of this work as the sphere is charged from $0$ to $Q$:\n$$ W_{self} = \\int_0^Q \\phi(q') dq' = \\int_0^Q k_c \\frac{q'}{\\varepsilon R} dq' = \\frac{k_c Q^2}{2\\varepsilon R} $$\nThe problem provides a pre-factored Coulomb conversion constant, $k_e$, in units of $\\mathrm{kcal \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}/(mol \\cdot e^2)}$. This constant is designed to be used with charge $q$ expressed as a pure number (in units of elementary charge $e$) and radius $R$ in Ångströms ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$) to yield energy in $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$. The formula for self-energy in these units becomes:\n$$ W_{self} = \\frac{k_e q^2}{2\\varepsilon R} $$\nThe polar contribution to the hydration free energy, $G_{\\mathrm{polar}}$, is the difference in self-energy between the solvent ($\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_s$) and vacuum ($\\varepsilon = 1$):\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{polar}} = W_{self}(\\text{solvent}) - W_{self}(\\text{vacuum}) = \\frac{k_e q^2}{2\\varepsilon_s R} - \\frac{k_e q^2}{2R} $$\nFactoring out common terms, we arrive at the Born equation:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{polar}} = \\frac{k_e q^2}{2R} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) $$\n\nSecond, we formulate the nonpolar contribution, $G_{\\mathrm{np}}$. The problem states this term is a linear function of the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), $A$:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{np}} = \\gamma A + \\beta $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the surface tension coefficient in $\\mathrm{kcal/(mol \\cdot \\AA^2)}$ and $\\beta$ is a constant offset in $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$. The sidechains are modeled as spheres of radius $R$. The surface area of a sphere is:\n$$ A = 4\\pi R^2 $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G_{\\mathrm{np}}$ gives:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{np}} = \\gamma (4\\pi R^2) + \\beta $$\n\nNow, we combine these components to find the overall free energy change for the mutation, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nThe change in the polar term is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{polar}} = G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{polar}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}} = \\frac{k_e}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) \\left( \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{Val}}^2}{R_{\\mathrm{Val}}} - \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{Ala}}^2}{R_{\\mathrm{Ala}}} \\right) $$\nThe change in the nonpolar term is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} = G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{Ala}} = \\left(\\gamma (4\\pi R_{\\mathrm{Val}}^2) + \\beta\\right) - \\left(\\gamma (4\\pi R_{\\mathrm{Ala}}^2) + \\beta\\right) $$\nAs stated in the problem, the offset $\\beta$ is assumed to be the same for both states and thus cancels out:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} = 4\\pi\\gamma (R_{\\mathrm{Val}}^2 - R_{\\mathrm{Ala}}^2) $$\nThe total change in hydration free energy is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = \\frac{k_e}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) \\left( \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{Val}}^2}{R_{\\mathrm{Val}}} - \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{Ala}}^2}{R_{\\mathrm{Ala}}} \\right) + 4\\pi\\gamma (R_{\\mathrm{Val}}^2 - R_{\\mathrm{Ala}}^2) $$\nThis final equation is implemented to compute the numerical results for each test case. For all provided cases, the charges $q_{\\mathrm{Ala}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{Val}}$ are $0.0$, which simplifies the calculation by making the polar contribution $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{polar}}$ equal to zero. The calculation thus reduces to the nonpolar term only.",

You will use a thermodynamic cycle—a powerful conceptual tool that exploits the path-independence of free energy—to calculate how a protein mutation affects its binding affinity for a ligand. Using raw potential energy data from hypothetical simulations, you will implement the statistically robust Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method to extract the free energy difference, offering a glimpse into the data analysis workflows used in cutting-edge computational chemistry .",

            "problem": "You are given a thermodynamic cycle for evaluating the change in binding free energy upon a single point mutation of a receptor protein, using a relative alchemical cycle between two molecular states: the wild-type state (state $A$) and the mutant state (state $B$). The change in binding free energy due to mutation is defined as the difference between the mutation free energy in the bound (receptor–ligand complex) environment and the mutation free energy in the unbound (bulk solvent) environment. Denote the mutation free energy in the bound and unbound environments by $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$, respectively. The binding free energy shift to be reported is $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$.\n\nFor each environment, you are provided with finite samples of potential energy differences evaluated on configurations from each endpoint state of the alchemical transformation. Specifically, for an environment $s \\in \\{\\mathrm{bound},\\mathrm{unbound}\\}$:\n- A set of \"forward-ensemble\" samples $\\{\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i}\\}$, where $\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i} = u_B(x_i)-u_A(x_i)$ and $\\{x_i\\}$ are configurations drawn from the canonical ensemble of state $A$,\n- A set of \"reverse-ensemble\" samples $\\{\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j}\\}$, where $\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j} = u_A(y_j)-u_B(y_j)$ and $\\{y_j\\}$ are configurations drawn from the canonical ensemble of state $B$.\n\nAll potential energies are expressed in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

Use only these units to produce your final answers, and express each reported free energy shift in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nYour task is to use the given samples and the canonical statistical mechanics definitions at temperature $T$ to compute $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$ for each test case, and then report $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ for that case.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be **valid**. It is a well-posed problem in computational statistical mechanics, grounded in fundamental principles and free of any scientific or logical inconsistencies. The data provided is complete and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the change in binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, for a protein mutation. This quantity is defined as $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$, where $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$ are the free energy changes of mutation in the bound and unbound states, respectively. For each state, we are provided with samples of potential energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations of the initial (wild-type, $A$) and final (mutant, $B$) states.\n\nThe most statistically robust method for calculating the free energy difference $\\Delta G = G_B - G_A$ using samples from both ensembles is the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method. This method provides the minimum variance estimate of $\\Delta G$ and is considered the gold standard. We will employ BAR to compute $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy difference between two states $A$ and $B$ is given by $\\Delta G = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln(Z_B/Z_A)$, where $Z$ is the canonical partition function, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The BAR method provides an implicit equation for $\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta(\\Delta U - \\Delta G)}} \\right\\rangle_B = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta(\\Delta U - \\Delta G)}} \\right\\rangle_A\n$$\nHere, $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$, $\\Delta U = U_B - U_A$ is the potential energy difference, and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_A$ and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_B$ denote canonical ensemble averages over states $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides finite samples to estimate these averages:\n- Forward samples from state $A$: $\\{\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N_f}$, where $\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i} = U_B(x_i) - U_A(x_i)$.\n- Reverse samples from state $B$: $\\{\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{N_r}$, where $\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j} = U_A(y_j) - U_B(y_j)$. Note that this implies $\\Delta U(y_j) = -\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j}$.\n\nSubstituting the sample averages into the BAR equation, we get the equation to be solved for $\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_f} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_f} \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta(\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i} - \\Delta G)}} = \\frac{1}{N_r} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_r} \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta(-\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j} - \\Delta G)}}\n$$\nSince for all test cases, the number of forward samples $N_f$ equals the number of reverse samples $N_r$, the equation simplifies slightly by canceling the pre-factors $1/N_f$ and $1/N_r$. We must find the root of the function $F(\\Delta G)$:\n$$\nF(\\Delta G) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_f} \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta(\\Delta u^{(f)}_{i} - \\Delta G)}} - \\sum_{j=1}^{N_r} \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta(-\\Delta u^{(r)}_{j} - \\Delta G)}} = 0\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear equation that can be solved numerically. The function $F(\\Delta G)$ is monotonic, guaranteeing a unique root. We will use a numerical root-finding algorithm, specifically the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq`), provided by the `SciPy` library, for its robustness.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1. Define the physical constants: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.00831446261815324\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. From these, compute the thermal energy term $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\n2. For the `bound` environment, use the provided forward and reverse samples $\\{\\Delta u^{(f, \\mathrm{bound})}_{i}\\}$ and $\\{\\Delta u^{(r, \\mathrm{bound})}_{j}\\}$ to set up and solve the BAR equation for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}}$.\n3. For the `unbound` environment, use the provided samples $\\{\\Delta u^{(f, \\mathrm{unbound})}_{i}\\}$ and $\\{\\Delta u^{(r, \\mathrm{unbound})}_{j}\\}$ to set up and solve the BAR equation for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$.\n4. Compute the final quantity $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}}$.\n5. Round the resulting value to three decimal places as required.\n\nThe calculation for $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ is:\n$k_{\\mathrm{B}}T = (0.00831446261815324\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.494338785\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nAn interesting observation in the provided test data is the symmetry: for each case, the set of forward samples $\\{\\Delta u_i^{(f)}\\}$ is identical to the set of negated reverse samples $\\{-\\Delta u_j^{(r)}\\}$. Furthermore, each of these sets is numerically symmetric about its arithmetic mean. Under these specific conditions, the solution to the BAR equation is simply the arithmetic mean of the energy samples, $\\Delta G = \\overline{\\Delta u^{(f)}}$. While this provides a convenient analytical check, the implementation will use the general numerical solver to demonstrate rigorous application of the BAR method.\n\n- For Case $1$:\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\text{mean}([-2.2, -1.8, -2.0, -2.1, -1.9]) = -2.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = \\text{mean}([0.8, 1.2, 1.0, 1.1, 0.9]) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -2.0 - 1.0 = -3.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- For Case $2$:\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\text{mean}([-0.1, 0.0, 0.1]) = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = \\text{mean}([-0.1, 0.0, 0.1]) = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 0.0 - 0.0 = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- For Case $3$:\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\text{mean}([-5.5, -4.5, -5.0]) = -5.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = \\text{mean}([-4.9, -4.7, -4.8]) = -4.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  - $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -5.0 - (-4.8) = -0.2\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nThe numerical implementation will confirm these values before formatting them for the final output.",
