            "problem": "You are implementing a quantitative analysis relevant to the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method in computational chemistry. The task is to assess the error introduced when modeling the electrostatic potential of a distant fragment using either a point-charge (monopole) approximation or higher-order multipole expansions. Begin from the fundamental Coulomb potential of discrete charges and formal definitions of multipole moments. Work entirely in atomic units, where the Coulomb constant equals $1$, electric charge is measured in units of the elementary charge, length in bohr, and electrostatic potential in Hartree per elementary charge. All reported potentials and errors must be in Hartree per elementary charge.\n\nYour program must:\n\n- Use the electrostatic potential due to a set of discrete point charges defined by positions and charges. The exact potential at a field point $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by the sum over all charges via Coulomb’s law. All calculations must be performed using a multipole expansion about a well-defined origin chosen as the geometric centroid (arithmetic mean of the fragment’s site positions). Define the multipole moments (monopole, dipole, and quadrupole) of the fragment about this centroid.\n\n- Define the multipole approximation at order $L \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ as follows: order $L=0$ uses the monopole term only (point-charge model), order $L=1$ uses monopole and dipole terms, and order $L=2$ uses monopole, dipole, and quadrupole terms. The multipole expansion must be derived from the Taylor expansion of the Green’s function $|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R}|^{-1}$ about the origin and expressed in terms of the fragment’s multipole moments about the geometric centroid. The quadrupole tensor must use the standard traceless definition based on the second moments of the charge distribution.\n\n- For each test case, evaluate the exact electrostatic potential and its multipole approximations on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the geometric centroid of the fragment. Use $N$ uniformly distributed directions on the sphere generated by the Fibonacci spherical grid defined by the golden angle $\\alpha = \\pi \\left(3 - \\sqrt{5}\\right)$. For $k \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$, define\n  - $z_k = 1 - \\dfrac{2(k+0.5)}{N}$,\n  - $\\rho_k = \\sqrt{1 - z_k^2}$,\n  - $\\phi_k = k \\, \\alpha$,\n  - $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_k = \\left(\\rho_k \\cos \\phi_k,\\ \\rho_k \\sin \\phi_k,\\ z_k\\right)$,\n  - $\\mathbf{r}_k = R \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_k$.\n  Use these $\\mathbf{r}_k$ as the $N$ field points.\n\n- Compute, for each order $L \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, the root-mean-square (RMS) absolute error between the exact potential $V_{\\text{exact}}(\\mathbf{r}_k)$ and the order-$L$ multipole approximation $V_L(\\mathbf{r}_k)$ over the $N$ directions:\n  $$\\mathrm{RMS}_L = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left( V_{\\text{exact}}(\\mathbf{r}_k) - V_L(\\mathbf{r}_k) \\right)^2 }.$$\n  Report $\\mathrm{RMS}_L$ in Hartree per elementary charge.\n\nFundamental base you may use:\n- Coulomb’s law for point charges and linear superposition.\n- Taylor expansion of $|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R}|^{-1}$ about the origin for $|\\mathbf{r}| \\gg |\\mathbf{R}|$.\n- Definitions of multipole moments (monopole, dipole vector, and traceless quadrupole tensor) about a specified origin.\n\nImplement the following test suite. Each test case specifies a fragment as a list of tuples $(q_i, x_i, y_i, z_i)$, the observation radius $R$, and the number of directions $N$:\n\n- Test case A (charged, well-separated):\n  - Fragment: $\\left[(+1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0),\\ (+0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)\\right]$.\n  - Radius: $R = 25.0$.\n  - Directions: $N = 64$.\n\n- Test case B (neutral dipole, well-separated):\n  - Fragment: $\\left[(+1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0),\\ (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, +1.0)\\right]$.\n  - Radius: $R = 30.0$.\n  - Directions: $N = 64$.\n\n- Test case C (neutral, dipole-free, quadrupole-dominated, well-separated):\n  - Fragment: $\\left[(+1.0, +1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\\ (+1.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\\ (-1.0, 0.0, +1.0, 0.0),\\ (-1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0)\\right]$.\n  - Radius: $R = 40.0$.\n  - Directions: $N = 64$.\n\n- Test case D (neutral dipole, borderline separation):\n  - Fragment: $\\left[(+1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -5.0),\\ (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, +5.0)\\right]$.\n  - Radius: $R = 10.0$.\n  - Directions: $N = 64$.\n\nAll coordinates $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and the radius $R$ are in bohr. All charges $q_i$ are in units of the elementary charge. The geometric centroid (arithmetic mean of the site positions) must be used as the expansion origin and as the center of the observation sphere.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- Each test case result must be a list of three floating-point numbers $[\\mathrm{RMS}_0, \\mathrm{RMS}_1, \\mathrm{RMS}_2]$, corresponding to the RMS absolute errors for orders $L=0,1,2$, respectively.\n- The overall output must therefore be a list of four lists, in the order of the test cases A, B, C, D.\n- Each floating-point number must be rounded to exactly $8$ decimal places.\n- For example, a syntactically correct output with placeholder values would look like: $[[0.12345678,0.01234567,0.00123456],[\\dots],[\\dots],[\\dots]]$.\n\nYour program must implement all steps and print only the required single-line output in the exact format described.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative analysis of the error introduced by multipole approximations to the electrostatic potential of a discrete charge distribution, which is a foundational concept in methods such as the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method. The analysis must be performed in atomic units.\n\nThe first step is to establish the rigorous mathematical framework. For a collection of $n$ point charges $\\{q_i\\}$ located at positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_i\\}$, the exact electrostatic potential at a field point $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by the principle of linear superposition and Coulomb's law:\n$$\nV_{\\text{exact}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{q_i}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_i|}\n$$\nThis exact potential serves as the reference against which all approximations are measured.\n\nThe multipole expansion provides an approximation for this potential at points $\\mathbf{r}$ that are distant from the charge distribution. The expansion is formulated as a Taylor series of the Green's function, $1/|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R}|$, around a chosen origin. As specified, the origin for the expansion, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$, is the geometric centroid of the charge sites:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{R}_i\n$$\nThis choice of origin is standard in many FMO implementations. We define coordinates relative to this centroid: the positions of the charges are $\\mathbf{R'}_i = \\mathbf{R}_i - \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$, and the field point is $\\mathbf{r'} = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$. The expansion is valid when $|\\mathbf{r'}| \\gg |\\mathbf{R'}_i|$ for all $i$.\n\nThe electrostatic potential can then be expressed as a series in terms of the multipole moments of the charge distribution. The moments are defined with respect to the centroid.\nThe monopole moment is the total charge of the fragment:\n$$\nq = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i\n$$\nThe dipole moment is a vector quantity:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i \\mathbf{R'}_i\n$$\nThe traceless quadrupole moment is a second-rank tensor with components $Q_{\\alpha\\beta}$ (where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$):\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i (3 R'_{i\\alpha} R'_{i\\beta} - |\\mathbf{R'}_i|^2 \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta})\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nUsing these moments, the potential at a field point $\\mathbf{r'}$ can be approximated to different orders, $L$.\nThe order $L=0$ approximation includes only the monopole term:\n$$\nV_{0}(\\mathbf{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\mathbf{r'}|}\n$$\nThis is the point-charge approximation.\nThe order $L=1$ approximation includes monopole and dipole terms:\n$$\nV_{1}(\\mathbf{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\mathbf{r'}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{r'}}{|\\mathbf{r'}|^{3}}\n$$\nThe order $L=2$ approximation adds the quadrupole term:\n$$\nV_{2}(\\mathbf{r'}) = \\frac{q}{|\\mathbf{r'}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{r'}}{|\\mathbf{r'}|^{3}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} Q_{\\alpha\\beta} \\frac{r'_{\\alpha} r'_{\\beta}}{|\\mathbf{r'}|^{5}}\n$$\n\nTo assess the accuracy of these approximations, we evaluate the potentials at a set of $N$ field points distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$, centered at the fragment's geometric centroid. The positions of these field points are generated using the Fibonacci spherical grid algorithm. For $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., N-1\\}$, the position vector of the $k$-th field point, relative to the centroid, is $\\mathbf{r'}_k = R \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_k$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_k$ is a unit vector. The absolute position is $\\mathbf{r}_k = \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}} + \\mathbf{r'}_k$.\n\nThe error of each approximation is quantified by the root-mean-square (RMS) absolute error over the $N$ field points:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMS}_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left( V_{\\text{exact}}(\\mathbf{r}_k) - V_L(\\mathbf{r'}_k) \\right)^2 }\n$$\nfor $L \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the fragment's charges $\\{q_i\\}$ and positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_i\\}$, compute the geometric centroid $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$.\n2.  Calculate the relative positions $\\mathbf{R'}_i = \\mathbf{R}_i - \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$.\n3.  Compute the monopole moment $q$, dipole moment vector $\\mathbf{p}$, and traceless quadrupole tensor $\\mathbf{Q}$.\n4.  Generate $N$ field points $\\{\\mathbf{r}_k\\}$ on the sphere of radius $R$ centered at $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{orig}}$. The relative positions are $\\{\\mathbf{r'}_k\\}$.\n5.  For each point $k$, calculate the exact potential $V_{\\text{exact}}(\\mathbf{r}_k)$ using the original charge positions.\n6.  For each point $k$, calculate the approximate potentials $V_0(\\mathbf{r'}_k)$, $V_1(\\mathbf{r'}_k)$, and $V_2(\\mathbf{r'}_k)$ using the multipole moments.\n7.  Compute the RMS errors $\\mathrm{RMS}_0$, $\\mathrm{RMS}_1$, and $\\mathrm{RMS}_2$ according to the formula above.\nThis procedure is systematically applied to all provided test cases to yield the required numerical results.",

We will analyze each component separately, ensuring all quantities are expressed in SI units for calculation, and then convert the final energy to the required units of $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental constants and conversion factors in their SI form:\n- Coulomb's constant: $k_e = 8.9875517923 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{N\\,m^2\\,C^{-2}}$\n- Elementary charge: $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}$\n- Avogadro constant: $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}~\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n- Angstrom to meter conversion: $1~\\mathrm{\\AA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}~\\mathrm{m}$\n- Polarizability volume conversion ($\\mathrm{\\AA^3}$ to SI): $1~\\mathrm{\\AA^3} = 1.64877727436 \\times 10^{-41}~\\mathrm{C\\,m^2\\,V^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we establish the geometry of the water molecule. The oxygen atom is at the origin, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}} = (0, 0, 0)$. The O-H bond length is $d_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 0.9572~\\mathrm{\\AA}$ and the H-O-H angle is $\\phi = 104.52^\\circ$. The half-angle, $\\theta = \\phi/2 = 52.26^\\circ$, must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric functions: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 52.26 \\cdot (\\pi / 180)$. The coordinates of the hydrogen atoms are then:\n$z_{\\mathrm{H}} = d_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\cos(\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}})$\n$x_{\\mathrm{H}} = d_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}})$\nSo, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = (x_{\\mathrm{H}}, 0, z_{\\mathrm{H}})$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = (-x_{\\mathrm{H}}, 0, z_{\\mathrm{H}})$.\nThe ion is located at $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{ion}} = (0, 0, R)$. All coordinates are initially in Angstroms.\n\n**1. Coulomb Interaction Energy, $E_{\\mathrm{coul}}$**\n\nThe Coulomb energy is the sum of pairwise interactions between the ion and the partial charges on the water molecule:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R; q_{\\mathrm{ion}}) = k_e \\sum_{a \\in \\{\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}_1, \\mathrm{H}_2\\}} \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{ion}} q_a}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{ion}} - \\mathbf{r}_a\\|}\n$$\nThe charges $q_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ and $q_a$ are given as multiples of $e$. Let the dimensionless charge values be $q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ and $q'_a$. The actual charges are $q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}e$ and $q'_a e$. The distances must be in meters.\nThe distances between the ion and the water atoms are:\n- Ion-Oxygen distance: $d_{\\mathrm{ion-O}} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{ion}} - \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}\\| = \\|(0,0,R) - (0,0,0)\\| = R$.\n- Ion-Hydrogen distance: By symmetry, the distance is the same for both hydrogen atoms.\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{ion-H}} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{ion}} - \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1}\\| = \\sqrt{(0 - x_{\\mathrm{H}})^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (R - z_{\\mathrm{H}})^2} = \\sqrt{x_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 + (R - z_{\\mathrm{H}})^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the energy expression, with distances in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$ and a conversion factor $10^{-10}~\\mathrm{m/\\AA}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{coul}} [\\mathrm{J}] = k_e \\frac{(q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}e)(q'_{\\mathrm{O}}e)}{R \\times 10^{-10}} + 2 \\cdot k_e \\frac{(q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}e)(q'_{\\mathrm{H}}e)}{d_{\\mathrm{ion-H}} \\times 10^{-10}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{coul}} [\\mathrm{J}] = \\frac{k_e e^2}{10^{-10}} q'_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\left( \\frac{q'_{\\mathrm{O}}}{R} + \\frac{2q'_{\\mathrm{H}}}{d_{\\mathrm{ion-H}}} \\right)\n$$\nTo convert this to $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, we multiply by $N_{\\mathrm{A}}/1000$. The prefactor becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{coul}} = \\frac{k_e e^2 N_{\\mathrm{A}}}{10^{-10} \\times 1000} \\approx 1389.3546~\\mathrm{kJ \\cdot \\AA \\cdot mol^{-1}}\n$$\nSo, the practical formula for the Coulomb energy, with $q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}=+1$, is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R; +1e) [\\mathrm{kJ/mol}] = C_{\\mathrm{coul}} \\left( \\frac{-0.834}{R} + \\frac{2 \\times 0.417}{\\sqrt{x_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 + (R - z_{\\mathrm{H}})^2}} \\right)\n$$\nNote that $E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R; -1e) = -E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R; +1e)$.\n\n**2. Induction Energy, $E_{\\mathrm{ind}}$**\n\nThe induction energy arises from the polarization of the water molecule by the ion's electric field. It is given by:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R; q_{\\mathrm{ion}}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\|\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{ion}\\to\\mathrm{O}}\\|^2\n$$\nThe magnitude of the electric field at the oxygen nucleus (origin) due to the ion at distance $R$ is:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{ion}\\to\\mathrm{O}}\\| = \\frac{k_e |q_{\\mathrm{ion}}|}{(R \\times 10^{-10})^2} = \\frac{k_e |q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}| e}{(R \\times 10^{-10})^2}\n$$\nThe polarizability $\\alpha = 1.45~\\mathrm{\\AA^3}$ must be converted to SI units: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{SI}} = 1.45 \\times (1.64877727436 \\times 10^{-41})~\\mathrm{C\\,m^2\\,V^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these into the induction energy formula (with $|q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}|=1$):\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ind}} [\\mathrm{J}] = -\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha_{\\mathrm{SI}} \\left( \\frac{k_e e}{R^2 \\times (10^{-10})^2} \\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{SI}} (k_e e)^2}{(10^{-10})^4} \\frac{1}{R^4}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is in Angstroms. To convert to $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, we again multiply by $N_{\\mathrm{A}}/1000$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{SI}} (k_e e)^2 N_{\\mathrm{A}}}{(10^{-10})^4 \\times 1000} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(1.45 \\times 1.648... \\times 10^{-41}) (k_e e)^2 N_{\\mathrm{A}}}{10^{-40} \\times 1000} \\approx 149.2868~\\mathrm{kJ \\cdot \\AA^4 \\cdot mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThus, the practical formula for induction energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ind}} [\\mathrm{kJ/mol}] = - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ind}}}{R^4}\n$$\nThis term is independent of the sign of the ion's charge, as it depends on $|q_{\\mathrm{ion}}|^2$.\n\n**3. Total Energy and Difference Term**\n\nFor each distance $R$ in the test suite, we compute the required quantities:\n1.  For $\\mathrm{Li}^+$ ($q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}=+1$):\n    $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;+1e) = E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e) + E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R)$\n2.  For $\\mathrm{F}^-$ ($q'_{\\mathrm{ion}}=-1$):\n    $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;-1e) = E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;-1e) + E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R) = -E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e) + E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R)$\n3.  The difference term:\n    $\\Delta E(R) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;+1e) - E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;-1e)$\n    $\\Delta E(R) = (E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e) + E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R)) - (-E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e) + E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R))$\n    $\\Delta E(R) = 2 \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e)$\n\nThis demonstrates that the asymmetry in interaction energy is entirely due to the fixed, asymmetric charge distribution of the water molecule, as the induction term is symmetric with respect to the sign of the ion charge.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n- Define all constants and conversion factors.\n- Pre-calculate the water geometry parameters ($x_H, z_H$).\n- Iterate through each specified distance $R$.\n- For each $R$, calculate $E_{\\mathrm{coul}}(R;+1e)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{ind}}(R)$ in $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ using the derived practical formulas.\n- Combine these to find $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;+1e)$, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(R;-1e)$, and $\\Delta E(R)$.\n- Round each of these three values to six decimal places.\n- Store the results and format the final output as specified.",

Consider the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method at the two-body expansion level (FMO2) applied to this system under a simplified Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) model with zero overlap. The Hückel Hamiltonian for any set of atoms $S$ is defined as a real symmetric matrix $H(S)$ with elements\n$$\nH_{ij}(S) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\alpha, & \\text{if } i=j \\in S, \\\\\n\\beta, & \\text{if } i\\neq j,\\ i\\in S,\\ j\\in S,\\ \\text{and } i \\text{ and } j \\text{ are bonded in benzene}, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the Coulomb parameter (on-site energy) and $\\beta$ is the resonance integral (nearest-neighbor interaction). The benzene bonding pattern is that of a $6$-cycle: atom $i$ is bonded to atoms $i-1$ and $i+1$ modulo $6$. Assume zero orbital overlap and no nuclear repulsion contribution. For any subsystem $S$, the total electronic energy $E(S)$ is defined by solving the eigenvalue problem $H(S)\\mathbf{c}_k=\\varepsilon_k\\mathbf{c}_k$, sorting the eigenvalues $\\varepsilon_k$ in ascending order, and then filling electrons according to the aufbau principle: each molecular orbital can accommodate at most $2$ electrons of opposite spin.

All required definitions, parameters, and constraints are provided. I will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the error of the two-body FMO approximation (FMO2) for two different fragmentations of a benzene ring. The error, $\\Delta E_{\\mathcal{F}}$, is defined as the difference between the FMO2 energy and the exact energy of the full system:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathcal{F}} = E_{\\mathrm{FMO2}}(\\mathcal{F}) - E_{\\mathrm{exact}}\n$$\nThe system is a benzene ring with six carbon atoms, each contributing one $\\pi$ electron. The total number of electrons in any subsystem $S$ is equal to its number of atoms, $|S|$.\n\nFirst, a general procedure for calculating the total electronic energy $E(S)$ for a subsystem $S$ under the HMO model must be established.\n1.  **Construct the Hückel Hamiltonian Matrix $H(S)$**: For a subsystem consisting of a set of atoms $S$, the Hamiltonian $H(S)$ is an $|S| \\times |S|$ matrix. Its elements are defined as $H_{ii}(S) = \\alpha$ for an atom $i \\in S$, and $H_{ij}(S) = \\beta$ if atoms $i, j \\in S$ are bonded in the original benzene molecule. All other elements are $0$. The bonding in benzene is cyclic: atom $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$ is bonded to $i-1$ and $i+1$ (with indices taken modulo $6$, mapping $0$ to $6$).\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Problem**: The molecular orbital energies, $\\varepsilon_k$, are the eigenvalues of $H(S)$. We find these by solving the secular equation $H(S)\\mathbf{c}_k = \\varepsilon_k \\mathbf{c}_k$. The eigenvalues must be sorted in ascending order.\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy**: The total electronic energy $E(S)$ is obtained by filling the molecular orbitals with the available electrons, $N(S) = |S|$, according to the aufbau principle. With $N_{\\text{pairs}} = \\lfloor N(S)/2 \\rfloor$ doubly-occupied orbitals and $N_{\\text{unpaired}} = N(S) \\pmod 2$ singly-occupied orbitals, the energy is:\n    $$\n    E(S) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{pairs}}} 2\\varepsilon_k + \\sum_{k=N_{\\text{pairs}}+1}^{N_{\\text{pairs}}+N_{\\text{unpaired}}} \\varepsilon_k\n    $$\n\nThe exact energy, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, is the energy of the entire benzene molecule, $E(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\})$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the FMO2 energy for each fragmentation. The general FMO2 formula is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{FMO2}}(\\mathcal{F}) = \\sum_{I=1}^{M} E(F_I) + \\sum_{1\\le I < J \\le M} \\left[ E(F_I \\cup F_J) - E(F_I) - E(F_J) \\right]\n$$\n\n**Fragmentation $\\mathcal{F}_{3+3}$:**\nThis fragmentation consists of two fragments, $G_1=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $G_2=\\{4,5,6\\}$.

The FMO2 energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{FMO2}}(\\mathcal{F}_{2+2+2}) = \\sum_{I=1}^{3} E(F_I) + \\sum_{1\\le I < J \\le 3} \\left[ E(F_I \\cup F_J) - E(F_I) - E(F_J) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{FMO2}}(\\mathcal{F}_{2+2+2}) = E(F_1 \\cup F_2) + E(F_1 \\cup F_3) + E(F_2 \\cup F_3) - E(F_1) - E(F_2) - E(F_3)\n$$\nBy symmetry of the benzene ring and the fragmentation pattern:\n- The fragments $F_1, F_2, F_3$ are equivalent (two adjacent atoms), so $E(F_1) = E(F_2) = E(F_3)$.\n- The fragment pairs $F_1 \\cup F_2 = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $F_2 \\cup F_3 = \\{3,4,5,6\\}$ are equivalent (linear chain of four atoms), so $E(F_1 \\cup F_2) = E(F_2 \\cup F_3)$.\n- The fragment pair $F_1 \\cup F_3 = \\{1,2,5,6\\}$ is different, as atoms $1$ and $6$ are bonded, forming a non-linear structure.\n\nThe simplified formula for the FMO2 energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{FMO2}}(\\mathcal{F}_{2+2+2}) = 2E(F_1 \\cup F_2) + E(F_1 \\cup F_3) - 3E(F_1)\n$$\nTo find the error $\\Delta E_{\\mathcal{F}_{2+2+2}}$, we must compute the energies for four subsystems:\n1.  $S_1 = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to get $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$.\n2.  $S_2 = F_1 = \\{1,2\\}$ to get $E(F_1)$.\n3.  $S_3 = F_1 \\cup F_2 = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ to get $E(F_1 \\cup F_2)$.\n4.  $S_4 = F_1 \\cup F_3 = \\{1,2,5,6\\}$ to get $E(F_1 \\cup F_3)$.\n\nFor each test case $(\\alpha, \\beta)$, we will numerically construct the Hamiltonian matrix for each of these subsystems, compute their eigenvalues, determine the total electronic energy by filling orbitals, and finally calculate the error $\\Delta E_{\\mathcal{F}_{2+2+2}}$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.
