This exercise grounds your understanding in this core principle, using a simple but effective point-charge model for the ammonia molecule, $\\text{NH}_3$. You will directly explore how the molecular dipole moment is not just a function of charge magnitude, but is critically dependent on the precise three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, a concept you will investigate by comparing results from experimental and theoretically optimized geometries .",

            "problem": "You will implement a program that computes the molecular dipole moment magnitude of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) using a point-charge model, once for an experimental geometry and once for a theoretical geometry, and then evaluates boundary and scaling behavior. Work from the first-principles definition of the dipole moment as a charge-weighted position vector sum. Use a neutral, atom-centered point-charge model with nitrogen assigned charge $q_{\\mathrm{N}} = -0.84\\,e$ and each hydrogen assigned charge $q_{\\mathrm{H}} = +0.28\\,e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. Place the nitrogen atom at the origin.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the molecular dipole moment magnitude for ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) under various geometric configurations using a point-charge model. We must first validate the problem statement and then develop a solution from first principles.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental definition of the electric dipole moment and utilizes a standard, albeit simplified, point-charge model. All necessary parameters, including charges, geometric arrangements, and physical constants, are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The relationship provided between the H–N–H angle $\\psi$ and the angle $\\theta$ of the N–H bond with the symmetry axis is a correct geometric identity for a trigonal pyramidal structure. The instructions for coordinate construction contain a potentially ambiguous step involving an angle $\\theta'$, but as will be shown, this ambiguity does not affect the calculation of the dipole moment magnitude, which is the required output. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe electric dipole moment vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ for a collection of point charges $q_i$ at positions $\\mathbf{r}_i$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\sum_i q_i \\mathbf{r}_i\n$$\nThe problem specifies a neutral point-charge model for $\\text{NH}_3$ with the nitrogen atom ($N$) at the origin, $\\mathbf{r}_N = \\mathbf{0}$. The charge on the nitrogen atom is $q_N = -0.84\\,e$, and the charge on each of the three hydrogen atoms ($H$) is $q_H = +0.28\\,e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The total charge is $q_{total} = q_N + 3 q_H = -0.84\\,e + 3(0.28\\,e) = 0$, confirming the system is neutral. For a neutral system, the calculated dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. Placing the nitrogen atom at the origin is a convenient choice that simplifies the calculation.\n\nWith $\\mathbf{r}_N = \\mathbf{0}$, the contribution of the nitrogen charge to the sum is zero, so the expression for the dipole moment becomes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = q_H (\\mathbf{r}_{H1} + \\mathbf{r}_{H2} + \\mathbf{r}_{H3})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}_{Hi}$ are the position vectors of the three hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the principal symmetry axis of the molecule aligns with the $z$-axis. The three hydrogen atoms are arranged symmetrically around this axis. We can describe their positions using spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta_p, \\phi)$, where $r$ is the N–H bond length, $\\theta_p$ is the polar angle with respect to the positive $z$-axis, and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. The three hydrogen atoms are placed at azimuthal angles $\\phi_1 = 0$, $\\phi_2 = 2\\pi/3$ radians ($120^\\circ$), and $\\phi_3 = 4\\pi/3$ radians ($240^\\circ$). The Cartesian coordinates of the hydrogen atoms are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{Hi} = (r \\sin\\theta_p \\cos\\phi_i, r \\sin\\theta_p \\sin\\phi_i, r \\cos\\theta_p)\n$$\nThe sum of the position vectors $\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mathbf{r}_{Hi}$ is required. Let's evaluate the sum component-wise:\nThe $x$-component sum is proportional to $\\sum \\cos\\phi_i = \\cos(0) + \\cos(2\\pi/3) + \\cos(4\\pi/3) = 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$.\nThe $y$-component sum is proportional to $\\sum \\sin\\phi_i = \\sin(0) + \\sin(2\\pi/3) + \\sin(4\\pi/3) = 0 + \\sqrt{3}/2 - \\sqrt{3}/2 = 0$.\nThe $z$-component sum is $\\sum z_i = r\\cos\\theta_p + r\\cos\\theta_p + r\\cos\\theta_p = 3r\\cos\\theta_p$.\n\nDue to symmetry, the $x$ and $y$ components of the total dipole moment are zero. The resulting dipole moment vector is aligned with the $z$-axis:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (0, 0, 3 q_H r \\cos\\theta_p)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the dipole moment, $\\mu$, is the absolute value of the non-zero component:\n$$\n\\mu = |\\boldsymbol{\\mu}| = |3 q_H r \\cos\\theta_p|\n$$\nSince $q_H = +0.28\\,e$ is positive and $r$ is a length, we have $\\mu = 3 q_H r |\\cos\\theta_p|$.\n\nNext, we must relate $|\\cos\\theta_p|$ to the given H–N–H angle $\\psi$. We use the dot product between the position vectors of two hydrogen atoms, for instance $\\mathbf{r}_{H1}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{H2}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{H1} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{H2} = |\\mathbf{r}_{H1}| |\\mathbf{r}_{H2}| \\cos\\psi = r^2 \\cos\\psi\n$$\nCalculating the dot product explicitly from the Cartesian coordinates:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{H1} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{H2} = (r\\sin\\theta_p \\cos\\phi_1)(r\\sin\\theta_p \\cos\\phi_2) + (r\\sin\\theta_p \\sin\\phi_1)(r\\sin\\theta_p \\sin\\phi_2) + (r\\cos\\theta_p)(r\\cos\\theta_p)\n$$\n$$\n= r^2\\sin^2\\theta_p(\\cos\\phi_1\\cos\\phi_2 + \\sin\\phi_1\\sin\\phi_2) + r^2\\cos^2\\theta_p = r^2\\sin^2\\theta_p\\cos(\\phi_1 - \\phi_2) + r^2\\cos^2\\theta_p\n$$\nSubstituting $\\phi_1=0$ and $\\phi_2=2\\pi/3$, we get $\\cos(\\phi_1-\\phi_2) = \\cos(-2\\pi/3) = -1/2$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{H1} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{H2} = r^2\\sin^2\\theta_p(-1/2) + r^2\\cos^2\\theta_p = r^2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos^2\\theta_p) + \\cos^2\\theta_p\\right) = r^2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\theta_p - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the dot product gives the identity provided in the problem statement, where $\\theta$ corresponds to our $\\theta_p$:\n$$\nr^2 \\cos\\psi = r^2\\frac{3\\cos^2\\theta_p - 1}{2} \\implies \\cos\\psi = \\frac{3\\cos^2\\theta_p - 1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $|\\cos\\theta_p|$:\n$$\n\\cos^2\\theta_p = \\frac{2\\cos\\psi + 1}{3} \\implies |\\cos\\theta_p| = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\cos\\psi + 1}{3}}\n$$\nThis expression uniquely determines the magnitude $|\\cos\\theta_p|$ from the angle $\\psi$. Substituting this back into the formula for the dipole moment magnitude:\n$$\n\\mu = 3 q_H r \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\cos\\psi + 1}{3}}\n$$\nThis is the final formula for the calculation. The computational steps are:\n$1$. Convert the input bond length $r$ from Angstroms to meters ($1\\,\\text{\\AA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$).\n$2$. Convert the input angle $\\psi$ from degrees to radians for use in the cosine function.\n$3$. Calculate the charge $q_H$ in Coulombs: $q_H = 0.28 \\times e$, using $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n$4$. Substitute these values into the derived formula to obtain $\\mu$ in SI units ($\\mathrm{C \\cdot m}$).\n$5$. Convert the result from $\\mathrm{C \\cdot m}$ to Debye ($D$) using the conversion factor $1\\,D = 3.33564 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\mathrm{C \\cdot m}$.\n$6$. For each test case, apply the formula. For Case C, where $\\psi=120^\\circ$, $\\cos\\psi = -0.5$, the term under the square root becomes zero, correctly yielding $\\mu = 0$ for a planar geometry. Case E is the absolute difference between the magnitudes from Case B and Case A.\n$7$. Round all final values to six decimal places.",

The foundation of this model is the principle of electronegativity equalization, which states that charge flows between atoms in a molecule until a state of minimum energy is achieved, corresponding to a uniform chemical potential throughout the system.\n\nThe energy of an isolated atom $i$ is approximated as a quadratic function of its net charge $q_i$:\n$$E_i(q_i) = \\chi_i q_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\eta_i q_i^2$$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is the Mulliken electronegativity and $\\eta_i$ is the absolute hardness.
