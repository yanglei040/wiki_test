The premises are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and a specific constraint ($\\sigma_{ii} = 2\\sigma_{jj}$) to allow for the unambiguous calculation of the quantity $D$.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to compute the expression for $D$. We begin with the provided definitions for the arithmetic and geometric means of $\\sigma_{ij}$.\nLet $\\sigma_{jj}$ be a positive constant, which we can denote as $x$ for algebraic simplicity. Since $\\sigma_{jj}$ represents a physical length, $x > 0$.\nFrom the given condition, $\\sigma_{ii} = 2\\sigma_{jj}$, we have $\\sigma_{ii} = 2x$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the formulas for the two mixing rules.\nThe arithmetic mean is:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij}^{(A)} = \\frac{\\sigma_{ii} + \\sigma_{jj}}{2} = \\frac{2x + x}{2} = \\frac{3x}{2} $$\nThe geometric mean is:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij}^{(G)} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{ii}\\sigma_{jj}} = \\sqrt{(2x)(x)} = \\sqrt{2x^2} = x\\sqrt{2} $$\n\nNext, we substitute these results into the definition of $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}^{(A)} - \\sigma_{ij}^{(G)}}{\\sigma_{ij}^{(A)}} = \\frac{\\frac{3x}{2} - x\\sqrt{2}}{\\frac{3x}{2}} $$\nSince $x = \\sigma_{jj}$ is a non-zero diameter, we can cancel $x$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$ D = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3} $$\nThis is the required exact algebraic expression for $D$.\n\nThe second task is to discuss the physical significance of the sign and magnitude of $D$.\nFirst, let us determine the sign of $D$. We compare the two terms in the expression, $1$ and $\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. To compare them, we can compare $3$ and $2\\sqrt{2}$. Since both quantities are positive, we can compare their squares:\n$$ 3^2 = 9 $$\n$$ (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\times 2 = 8 $$\nSince $9 > 8$, it follows that $3 > 2\\sqrt{2}$, and therefore $1 > \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nThis proves that $D = 1 - \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ is a positive quantity.\n\nThe fact that $D > 0$ implies that $\\sigma_{ij}^{(A)} > \\sigma_{ij}^{(G)}$. This is a direct consequence of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that for any non-negative numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\frac{a+b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab}$, with equality holding only if $a=b$. In our case, $a = \\sigma_{ii}$ and $b = \\sigma_{jj}$, and since $\\sigma_{ii} = 2\\sigma_{jj} \\ne \\sigma_{jj}$, the strict inequality $\\sigma_{ij}^{(A)} > \\sigma_{ij}^{(G)}$ holds.\n\nPhysical Significance:\nThe parameter $\\sigma_{ij}$ represents the effective diameter or distance of closest approach for an interacting pair of unlike particles $i$ and $j$.\n- **Sign of D**: The positive sign of $D$ indicates that the arithmetic (Lorentz) mixing rule predicts a larger effective diameter for the unlike pair interaction compared to the geometric mean rule. The arithmetic rule is physically motivated by a model of hard-sphere collisions, where the collision distance is the average of the diameters. This larger effective diameter implies a greater excluded volume for the $i$-$j$ pair. In terms of thermodynamics, this typically corresponds to a positive deviation from Raoult's law and a positive excess volume of mixing ($V^E > 0$). It suggests that the packing of unlike particles is less efficient than a simple idealized mixing, which can energetically disfavor mixing and, in strong cases, lead to phase separation.\n- **Magnitude of D**: The magnitude of $D$, calculated as $1 - \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\approx 1 - \\frac{2 \\times 1.4142}{3} \\approx 1 - 0.9428 = 0.0572$, quantifies the relative difference between the two rules. For a size ratio of $2$, the arithmetic mean predicts an interaction diameter that is approximately $5.7\\%$ larger than that predicted by the geometric mean. This magnitude is a measure of the \"non-additivity\" of the particle diameters as interpreted by the two rules. The magnitude of this difference increases with greater size asymmetry between the particles. For example, if $\\sigma_{ii} = \\sigma_{jj}$, then $D = 0$. As the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{ii}}{\\sigma_{jj}}$ deviates from $1$, the value of $D$ increases, indicating that the choice of mixing rule becomes more consequential for systems with high particle size disparity.\n\nIn summary, a positive $D$ signifies that the commonly used arithmetic rule implies a larger excluded volume for unlike pairs, which is a key factor contributing to non-ideal mixing behavior and positive excess volumes in fluid mixtures. The magnitude of $D$ scales with the size asymmetry of the constituent particles.",

The qualitative statements regarding the properties of He, Ar, and Xe are consistent with established experimental and theoretical data. The physical reasoning invoked (dependence on similarity of size and polarizability) is standard and correct. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The question asks for a qualitative ranking based on provided physical principles and qualitative data.

The problem is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent:** All necessary information for a conceptual ranking is provided. There are no contradictions in the given data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe central premise provided is that a greater dissimilarity in the properties of two interacting species leads to a larger deviation from the Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) combining rules. We are given the qualitative ordering of size ($\\sigma$), polarizability ($\\alpha$), and interaction well-depth ($\\varepsilon$) for Helium (He), Argon (Ar), and Xenon (Xe):\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{He}}  \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ar}}  \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Xe}} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ll \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Ar}}  \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Xe}} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Ar}}  \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Xe}} $$\nThe notation $\\ll$ implies a much larger difference in magnitude compared to $$. The task is to rank the pairs Ar–Xe, Ar–He, and Xe–He from largest to smallest deviation. This is equivalent to ranking them from most dissimilar to most similar.\n\nLet us analyze each pair based on the dissimilarity of their properties.\n\n1.  **The Xe–He pair:** This pair exhibits the maximum possible dissimilarity within this set of atoms.\n    -   **Size difference:** The size difference between Xe (the largest atom) and He (the smallest atom) is the largest among all possible pairs. The arithmetic mean for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Xe-He}}$ is known to be a particularly poor approximation for such disparate sizes.\n    -   **Electronic property difference:** The polarizability and well-depth difference is also maximal. We have $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ll \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{He}} \\ll \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$. The geometric mean rule for $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is theoretically derived from London's theory under the assumption of similar ionization potentials ($I_i \\approx I_j$). The ionization potentials are $I_{\\mathrm{He}} \\approx 24.6 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, $I_{\\mathrm{Ar}} \\approx 15.8 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, and $I_{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\approx 12.1 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. The ratio $I_{\\mathrm{He}} / I_{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\approx 2.03$ is substantial, invalidating the key assumption behind the geometric mean rule. This large difference in electronic structure leads to a significant overestimation of the well depth by the LB rule.\n    -   **Quantum Effects:** Helium is a very light atom, and its behavior is subject to significant quantum effects not captured by a classical potential model, further increasing the deviation from any simple combining rule when paired with a heavy, classical-like atom such as Xenon.\n    -   Conclusion: The Xe–He pair is maximally dissimilar, and thus its interaction will show the largest deviation from the LB rules.\n\n2.  **The Ar–He pair:** This pair also involves Helium and thus has a large dissimilarity.\n    -   **Size difference:** The difference between $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{He}}$ is large.\n    -   **Electronic property difference:** The difference between $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{He}}$ (and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{He}}$) is also large, indicated by $\\ll$. The ionization potential ratio $I_{\\mathrm{He}} / I_{\\mathrm{Ar}} \\approx 1.56$ is also significant.\n    -   Conclusion: The dissimilarity is large due to the presence of He, but less extreme than for the Xe–He pair since Ar is intermediate in properties between He and Xe. The deviation from LB rules for this pair will be large, but smaller than that for Xe–He.\n\n3.  **The Ar–Xe pair:** This pair consists of two heavier noble gases from adjacent periods (in the set).\n    -   **Size difference:** The sizes $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ are the closest of any pair.\n    -   **Electronic property difference:** The polarizabilities $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ are relatively close (compared to pairs involving He), and the well-depths $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ are also the most similar. The ionization potential ratio $I_{\\mathrm{Ar}} / I_{\\mathrm{Xe}} \\approx 1.31$ is the smallest among the three pairs.\n    -   Conclusion: The Ar–Xe pair is the most similar in physical properties. Therefore, it is expected to adhere most closely to the LB combining rules, exhibiting the smallest deviation.\n\n**Final Ranking:**\nBased on the analysis, the ranking of pairs by the magnitude of their deviation from the Lorentz–Berthelot rules, from largest deviation to smallest, is:\nXe–He (largest deviation)  Ar–He  Ar–Xe (smallest deviation).\n\nThis corresponds to the ordering: Xe–He, Ar–He, Ar–Xe.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Xe–He, Ar–He, Ar–Xe**\nThis ordering matches the derived ranking. The most dissimilar pair (Xe–He) is listed first, followed by the next most dissimilar (Ar–He), and finally the most similar pair (Ar–Xe).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Ar–Xe, Ar–He, Xe–He**\nThis is the exact reverse of the correct ordering. It incorrectly claims that the most similar pair deviates the most. This contradicts the fundamental principle upon which the problem is based.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Ar–He, Xe–He, Ar–Xe**\nThis ordering incorrectly suggests that the Ar–He pair deviates more than the Xe–He pair. The disparities in size, polarizability, and ionization potential are all greater for Xe–He than for Ar–He.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. All three pairs deviate equally**\nThis is assertion is physically baseless. The degree of similarity between the atoms in each pair is clearly different, as established by the given qualitative facts. Therefore, the magnitude of the deviation from an approximate rule based on similarity cannot be equal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. It is impossible to rank without any experiment or calculation**\nWhile quantitative determination of the deviation requires experiment or high-level calculation, the problem specifically asks for a qualitative ranking based on \"first-principles physical reasoning\". Such reasoning, based on the documented limitations of the LB rules with respect to atomic dissimilarity, is sufficient to establish a clear hierarchy. This option denies the utility of physical reasoning itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The pure-component entries (indices $3$ to $6$) are identical to the input parameters, reflecting the physical constraint that a combining rule must reproduce the pure-component limits.\n\nThe error is calculated using the $\\mathrm{nRMSE}$ metric:\n$$\n\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(m)} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left( \\frac{y^{(m)}_i - y^{(\\text{target})}_i}{y^{(\\text{target})}_i} \\right)^{2} }\n$$\nSince $y^{(m)}_i = y^{(\\text{target})}_i$ for $i \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, the error formula simplifies to a sum over the unlike-pair terms only:\n$$\n\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(m)} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{12}^{(m)} - \\sigma_{12}^{(\\text{target})}}{\\sigma_{12}^{(\\text{target})}} \\right)^{2} + \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon'_{12}{}^{(m)} - \\varepsilon'^{(\\text{target})}_{12}}{\\varepsilon'^{(\\text{target})}_{12}} \\right)^{2} \\right] }\n$$\n\nWe now compute the unlike-pair parameters and the corresponding error for each rule.\n\n**Rule 1: Lorentz–Berthelot**\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}}{2} = \\frac{3.405 + 3.636}{2} = 3.5205\\ \\text{\\AA}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{12}{}^{(1)} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon'_{11}\\,\\varepsilon'_{22}} = \\sqrt{119.8 \\times 164.0} \\approx 140.16847\\ \\text{K}\n$$\nThe relative errors are:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\sigma}^{(1)} = \\frac{3.5205 - 3.5205}{3.5205} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\varepsilon}^{(1)} = \\frac{140.16847 - 138.17618}{138.17618} \\approx 0.0144185\n$$\nThe error is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(1)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6} \\left( 0^2 + (0.0144185)^2 \\right)} \\approx 0.005886\n$$\n\n**Rule 2: Fender–Halsey**\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}}{2} = 3.5205\\ \\text{\\AA}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{12}{}^{(2)} = \\frac{2\\,\\varepsilon'_{11}\\,\\varepsilon'_{22}}{\\varepsilon'_{11} + \\varepsilon'_{22}} = \\frac{2 \\times 119.8 \\times 164.0}{119.8 + 164.0} \\approx 138.45807\\ \\text{K}\n$$\nThe relative errors are:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\sigma}^{(2)} = \\frac{3.5205 - 3.5205}{3.5205} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\varepsilon}^{(2)} = \\frac{138.45807 - 138.17618}{138.17618} \\approx 0.0020401\n$$\nThe error is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6} \\left( 0^2 + (0.0020401)^2 \\right)} \\approx 0.000833\n$$\n\n**Rule 3: Geometric–Arithmetic Hybrid**\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}^{(3)} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{11}\\,\\sigma_{22}} = \\sqrt{3.405 \\times 3.636} \\approx 3.51832\\ \\text{\\AA}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{12}{}^{(3)} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon'_{11}\\,\\varepsilon'_{22}} \\approx 140.16847\\ \\text{K}\n$$\nThe relative errors are:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\sigma}^{(3)} = \\frac{3.51832 - 3.5205}{3.5205} \\approx -0.0006192\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\varepsilon}^{(3)} = \\frac{140.16847 - 138.17618}{138.17618} \\approx 0.0144185\n$$\nThe error is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(3)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6} \\left( (-0.0006192)^2 + (0.0144185)^2 \\right)} \\approx 0.005892\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the errors for the three rules:\n- $\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(1)} \\approx 0.005886$\n- $\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(2)} \\approx 0.000833$\n- $\\mathrm{nRMSE}^{(3)} \\approx 0.005892$\n\nThe minimum error is achieved by Rule $2$ (Fender–Halsey).
