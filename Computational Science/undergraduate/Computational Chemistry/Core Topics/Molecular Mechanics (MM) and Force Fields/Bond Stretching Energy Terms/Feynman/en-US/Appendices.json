Assume the small-amplitude (harmonic) approximation, so that the restoring force is governed by Hooke’s law with force constant $k$. Starting only from Newton’s second law and Hooke’s law, write down the coupled equations of motion for the displacements of the two nuclei from equilibrium, eliminate the center-of-mass motion to obtain a single ordinary differential equation for the internal (bond-stretch) coordinate, and from that determine the vibrational angular frequency in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, and $k$.\n\nExpress your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for the angular frequency.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard and well-posed exercise in classical mechanics applied to molecular vibrations. It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the positions of the two point masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, along the internuclear axis be denoted by $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$, respectively. The equilibrium positions are $x_{1,e}$ and $x_{2,e}$. The equilibrium separation is a constant, $r_e = x_{2,e} - x_{1,e}$. We define the displacements of each mass from its respective equilibrium position as $\\delta_1(t) = x_1(t) - x_{1,e}$ and $\\delta_2(t) = x_2(t) - x_{2,e}$.\n\nThe instantaneous internuclear separation is $r(t) = x_2(t) - x_1(t)$. The internal coordinate, which represents the stretching of the bond from its equilibrium length, is defined as $q(t) = r(t) - r_e$. This can be expressed in terms of the individual displacements:\n$$q(t) = (x_2(t) - x_1(t)) - (x_{2,e} - x_{1,e}) = (x_2(t) - x_{2,e}) - (x_1(t) - x_{1,e}) = \\delta_2(t) - \\delta_1(t)$$\n\nThe restoring force is governed by Hooke's law, $F = -k'x'$, where $x'$ is the displacement from equilibrium. In our case, the displacement is the internal coordinate $q$. The potential energy of the system is $V = \\frac{1}{2} k q^2$. The force acting on each mass is found from the negative gradient of the potential energy.\nThe force on mass $m_1$ is:\n$$F_1 = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (x_2 - x_1 - r_e)^2 \\right) = -k(x_2 - x_1 - r_e) \\cdot (-1) = k(x_2 - x_1 - r_e) = k q$$\nThe force on mass $m_2$ is:\n$$F_2 = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (x_2 - x_1 - r_e)^2 \\right) = -k(x_2 - x_1 - r_e) \\cdot (1) = -k(x_2 - x_1 - r_e) = -k q$$\nThe total external force on the system is $F_{total} = F_1 + F_2 = k q - k q = 0$, which confirms that the center-of-mass motion is uncoupled from the internal motion.\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, $F=ma$, to each mass. The acceleration is the second time derivative of the position, $\\ddot{x}$. Since the equilibrium positions are constant, $\\ddot{x}_1 = \\ddot{\\delta}_1$ and $\\ddot{x}_2 = \\ddot{\\delta}_2$.\nThe resulting coupled equations of motion for the displacements are:\n$$m_1 \\ddot{\\delta}_1 = F_1 = k q$$\n$$m_2 \\ddot{\\delta}_2 = F_2 = -k q$$\nSubstituting $q = \\delta_2 - \\delta_1$, we have:\n$$m_1 \\ddot{\\delta}_1 = k (\\delta_2 - \\delta_1)$$\n$$m_2 \\ddot{\\delta}_2 = -k (\\delta_2 - \\delta_1)$$\n\nTo obtain a single differential equation for the internal coordinate $q$, we take its second time derivative:\n$$\\ddot{q} = \\ddot{\\delta}_2 - \\ddot{\\delta}_1$$\nFrom the equations of motion, we isolate the accelerations:\n$$\\ddot{\\delta}_1 = \\frac{k}{m_1} q$$\n$$\\ddot{\\delta}_2 = -\\frac{k}{m_2} q$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $\\ddot{q}$:\n$$\\ddot{q} = \\left(-\\frac{k}{m_2} q\\right) - \\left(\\frac{k}{m_1} q\\right) = -k \\left( \\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} \\right) q$$\nThis is the single ordinary differential equation for the internal coordinate $q$. It is common to define the reduced mass, $\\mu$, as $\\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2}$, which simplifies the equation to:\n$$\\ddot{q} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} q$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\\ddot{q} + \\frac{k}{\\mu} q = 0$$\nThe general equation for a simple harmonic oscillator is $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. By direct comparison of our equation for $q$ with the general form, we identify the square of the angular frequency:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{\\mu}$$\nTherefore, the vibrational angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\nTo express this solely in terms of the given parameters $k$, $m_1$, and $m_2$, we substitute the definition of the reduced mass:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} = \\frac{m_2 + m_1}{m_1 m_2}$$\nThus, the final expression for the angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{k \\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}}$$\nThis result is the fundamental frequency of vibration for a diatomic molecule within the harmonic approximation.",

The derivative of $h(x)$ is $h'(x) = a - (-ae^{-ax} + 2ae^{-2ax}) = a(1 + e^{-ax} - 2e^{-2ax})$. Let $y = e^{-ax}$. For $x>0$, we have $0 < y < 1$. Then $h'(x) = a(1+y-2y^2) = a(1-y)(1+2y)$. Since $a>0$, $1-y > 0$, and $1+2y > 0$ for $y \\in (0,1)$, we have $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x>0$. As $h(0)=0$, it follows that $h(x) > 0$ for all $x>0$. Consequently, $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x>0$.\n\nSince $g(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x > 0$, starts with a negative value $g(0) = -\\Delta E$, and grows indefinitely (as $g(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ for large $x$), there must be exactly one positive root $x$.\n\nThis unique root can be found using a robust numerical algorithm like Brent's method. For each test case, we first calculate $a$ from the given $k$ and $D_e$, then solve $g(x)=0$ for $x$ in an interval like $[0, 5]$ angstroms, which is guaranteed to contain the root.
