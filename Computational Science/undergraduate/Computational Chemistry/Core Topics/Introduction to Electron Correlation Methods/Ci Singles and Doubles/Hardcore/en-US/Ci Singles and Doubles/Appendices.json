            "problem": "Consider the water molecule treated at the level of Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD). Use a Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) closed-shell reference determinant built in the minimal Slater-Type Orbital with three Gaussian primitives (STO-3G) basis. In this minimal basis, oxygen contributes contracted functions corresponding to $1s$, $2s$, and the three $2p$ functions, and each hydrogen contributes a contracted $1s$ function, yielding a total of $M=7$ spatial molecular orbitals (MOs) after the Hartree–Fock procedure. Water has $N_{e}=10$ electrons, so the RHF reference determinant occupies $n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}}=5$ spatial MOs doubly.\n\nWork in a spin-orbital Slater determinant basis (no spin adaptation), with creation and annihilation operators $a_{p}^{\\dagger}$ and $a_{p}$ acting on spin orbitals.

Then determine the total number of distinct determinants in the union of these sets for water in this basis. Express the final answer as a single integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in introductory computational quantum chemistry. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for symbolic expressions for the sets of singly and doubly excited Slater determinants relative to a reference determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$, and for the total number of such determinants for a water molecule under specified conditions. The calculation is performed in a basis of spin orbitals, without spin adaptation.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimensions of the orbital space. The system is a water molecule with $N_{e}=10$ electrons. The calculation is performed in a minimal STO-3G basis, which results in $M=7$ spatial molecular orbitals (MOs). The reference state $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ is a Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) closed-shell determinant, where the $N_{e}=10$ electrons doubly occupy the $n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}} = \\frac{N_{e}}{2} = 5$ lowest-energy spatial MOs. This is consistent with the provided information.\n\nThe number of virtual spatial MOs is the total number of spatial MOs minus the number of occupied ones:\n$$ n_{\\text{virt}}^{\\text{spatial}} = M - n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}} = 7 - 5 = 2 $$\nThe problem is formulated in a spin-orbital basis. Each spatial orbital $\\phi_k$ gives rise to two spin orbitals, $\\psi_{k,\\alpha} = \\phi_k \\alpha$ and $\\psi_{k,\\beta} = \\phi_k \\beta$.\nThe total number of spin orbitals is $2M = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\nThe set of occupied spin orbitals, $\\mathcal{O}$, consists of the spin orbitals formed from the $n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}}=5$ occupied spatial MOs. The size of this set, $N_{\\text{occ}}$, is equal to the number of electrons.\n$$ N_{\\text{occ}} = |\\mathcal{O}| = 2 \\times n_{\\text{occ}}^{\\text{spatial}} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 $$\nThe set of virtual spin orbitals, $\\mathcal{V}$, consists of the spin orbitals formed from the $n_{\\text{virt}}^{\\text{spatial}}=2$ virtual spatial MOs. The size of this set is $N_{\\text{virt}}$.\n$$ N_{\\text{virt}} = |\\mathcal{V}| = 2 \\times n_{\\text{virt}}^{\\text{spatial}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nAs a check, the total number of spin orbitals is $N_{\\text{occ}} + N_{\\text{virt}} = 10 + 4 = 14$, which equals $2M$. The setup is correct.\n\nWe use the standard notation where indices $i, j, k, \\dots$ refer to occupied spin orbitals ($i, j, k, \\dots \\in \\mathcal{O}$) and indices $a, b, c, \\dots$ refer to virtual spin orbitals ($a, b, c, \\dots \\in \\mathcal{V}$).\n\nA single excitation promotes one electron from an occupied spin orbital $i$ to a virtual spin orbital $a$. In second quantization, this is represented by applying the operator combination $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{i}$ to the reference determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$. Each distinct pair $(i, a)$ yields a unique singly excited determinant. The set of all unique single-excitation determinants, $\\mathcal{S}_1$, is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{S}_1 = \\{ a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{i} \\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle \\mid i \\in \\mathcal{O}, a \\in \\mathcal{V} \\} $$\n\nA double excitation promotes two electrons from occupied spin orbitals $i$ and $j$ to virtual spin orbitals $a$ and $b$. This is represented by the operator $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{j} a_{i}$. Due to the fermionic nature of electrons, the creation and annihilation operators anti-commute. For example, $a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} = -a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{a}^{\\dagger}$ and $a_{j} a_{i} = -a_{i} a_{j}$. Consequently, the determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \\rangle = a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{j} a_{i} \\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ is unique only up to a sign with respect to the ordering of indices. The problem specifies that determinants differing only by such a sign are to be considered the same. This means we are counting the number of unique ways to choose two occupied spin orbitals and two virtual spin orbitals. To represent this set symbolically without redundancy, we impose a strict ordering on the indices, for instance, $i<j$ and $a<b$, where the inequality refers to the integer labels assigned to the spin orbitals. The set of all unique double-excitation determinants, $\\mathcal{S}_2$, is:\n$$ \\mathcal{S}_2 = \\{ a_{a}^{\\dagger} a_{b}^{\\dagger} a_{j} a_{i} \\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle \\mid i, j \\in \\mathcal{O} \\text{ with } i<j; \\ a, b \\in \\mathcal{V} \\text{ with } a<b \\} $$\n\nNow we calculate the number of determinants in each set.\nThe number of single excitations, $N_S$, is the number of ways to choose one spin orbital from $\\mathcal{O}$ and one from $\\mathcal{V}$.\n$$ N_S = N_{\\text{occ}} \\times N_{\\text{virt}} = 10 \\times 4 = 40 $$\n\nThe number of double excitations, $N_D$, is the number of ways to choose two distinct spin orbitals from $\\mathcal{O}$ multiplied by the number of ways to choose two distinct spin orbitals from $\\mathcal{V}$. This is a combinatorial calculation.\n$$ N_D = \\binom{N_{\\text{occ}}}{2} \\binom{N_{\\text{virt}}}{2} $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ N_D = \\binom{10}{2} \\binom{4}{2} = \\left(\\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1}\\right) = 45 \\times 6 = 270 $$\n\nThe set of single excitations and the set of double excitations are disjoint. Therefore, the total number of distinct determinants in the union of these sets is the sum of their individual counts.\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = N_S + N_D = 40 + 270 = 310 $$\nThe CISD space for this system, which includes the reference determinant plus all unique single and double excitations, contains $1 + N_S + N_D = 1 + 310 = 311$ determinants. However, the problem asks only for the total number of determinants in the union of the single and double excitation sets, which is $N_S + N_D$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, fundamental problem in quantum chemistry concerning the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule at the dissociation limit. All provided information is self-contained and consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the total ionic weight, $w_{\\mathrm{ionic}}$, in the Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD) ground state wavefunction of the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ molecule in a minimal basis at the dissociation limit, $R \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe CISD wavefunction for the singlet ground state in the given minimal basis is expressed as a linear combination of two configurations:\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = c_0 |g^2\\rangle + c_2 |u^2\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $|g^2\\rangle$ and $|u^2\\rangle$ are spin-adapted configurations with spatial parts $\\phi_g(1)\\phi_g(2)$ and $\\phi_u(1)\\phi_u(2)$, respectively. The coefficients $c_0$ and $c_2$ are determined by solving the secular equation for the Hamiltonian matrix, $H$, in the basis $\\{|g^2\\rangle, |u^2\\rangle\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that in the limit $R \\to \\infty$, the diagonal elements of this matrix are equal. Let us denote this common diagonal element by $E_0$. The off-diagonal element, $H_{12} = \\langle g^2 | \\hat{H} | u^2 \\rangle$, is a real value we denote by $K$. The Hamiltonian matrix is thus:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0 & K \\\\ K & E_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $E$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n(E_0 - E)^2 - K^2 = 0 \\implies E = E_0 \\pm K\n$$\nThe ground state corresponds to the lower energy. The problem states that the off-diagonal coupling $K$ is \"determined by electron-electron repulsion\". According to the Slater-Condon rules for matrix elements between configurations differing by a double excitation (from $\\phi_g, \\phi_g$ to $\\phi_u, \\phi_u$), this element is the two-electron integral:\n$$\nK = \\langle \\phi_g \\phi_g | \\frac{1}{r_{12}} | \\phi_u \\phi_u \\rangle = \\iint \\phi_g^*(1)\\phi_g^*(2) \\frac{1}{r_{12}} \\phi_u(1)\\phi_u(2) \\,d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2\n$$\nSince the molecular orbitals $\\phi_g$ and $\\phi_u$ are real and the electron-electron repulsion operator $1/r_{12}$ is positive definite, the integral $K$ must be positive, $K>0$.\nTherefore, the ground state energy is $E_{\\mathrm{GS}} = E_0 - K$.\n\nTo find the ground state eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, we solve the system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} E_0 & K \\\\ K & E_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = (E_0 - K) \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row gives $E_0 c_0 + K c_2 = (E_0 - K) c_0$, which simplifies to $K c_2 = -K c_0$. Since $K \\neq 0$, we have $c_2 = -c_0$.\nThe wavefunction is normalized, $\\langle\\Psi|\\Psi\\rangle = c_0^2 + c_2^2 = 1$. Substituting $c_2 = -c_0$ gives $c_0^2 + (-c_0)^2 = 2c_0^2 = 1$, so $c_0 = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The problem specifies the convention $c_0 \\ge 0$, thus we must choose $c_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Consequently, $c_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe CISD ground state wavefunction is:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{\\mathrm{GS}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |g^2\\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |u^2\\rangle\n$$\nTo determine the ionic weight, we must express this wavefunction in the atomic orbital basis $\\{\\chi_A, \\chi_B\\}$. The spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\Psi(1,2)$, determines its character.\n$$\n\\Psi(1,2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\phi_g(1)\\phi_g(2) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\phi_u(1)\\phi_u(2)\n$$\nAt the dissociation limit $R \\to \\infty$, the overlap integral $\\langle \\chi_A | \\chi_B \\rangle \\to 0$, and the definitions for the normalized MOs become exact:\n$$\n\\phi_g = \\frac{\\chi_A + \\chi_B}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\qquad \\phi_u = \\frac{\\chi_A - \\chi_B}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nWe substitute these into the spatial wavefunction. First, we expand the products of MOs:\n$$\n\\phi_g(1)\\phi_g(2) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_A(1) + \\chi_B(1))(\\chi_A(2) + \\chi_B(2)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2) + \\chi_B(1)\\chi_B(2) + \\chi_A(1)\\chi_B(2) + \\chi_B(1)\\chi_A(2)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_u(1)\\phi_u(2) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_A(1) - \\chi_B(1))(\\chi_A(2) - \\chi_B(2)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2) + \\chi_B(1)\\chi_B(2) - \\chi_A(1)\\chi_B(2) - \\chi_B(1)\\chi_A(2)\\right]\n$$\nNow we compute the linear combination for $\\Psi(1,2)$:\n$$\n\\Psi(1,2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[ \\phi_g(1)\\phi_g(2) - \\phi_u(1)\\phi_u(2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Psi(1,2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\chi_A\\chi_A + \\chi_B\\chi_B + \\chi_A\\chi_B + \\chi_B\\chi_A\\right) - \\left(\\chi_A\\chi_A + \\chi_B\\chi_B - \\chi_A\\chi_B - \\chi_B\\chi_A\\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere we use the shorthand $\\chi_A\\chi_A$ for $\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2)$, etc. The \"ionic\" terms, $\\chi_A\\chi_A$ and $\\chi_B\\chi_B$, cancel out:\n$$\n\\Psi(1,2) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ 2\\chi_A(1)\\chi_B(2) + 2\\chi_B(1)\\chi_A(2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\chi_A(1)\\chi_B(2) + \\chi_B(1)\\chi_A(2)\\right]\n$$\nThis is the spatial wavefunction of the purely covalent Heitler-London state, representing two neutral hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe \"ionic\" determinants are defined as those with spatial parts proportional to $\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2)$ or $\\chi_B(1)\\chi_B(2)$. The total ionic weight, $w_{\\mathrm{ionic}}$, is the sum of the squared moduli of the coefficients multiplying these ionic determinants in the normalized expansion of $|\\Psi\\rangle$.\nUpon expressing the spatial part $\\Psi(1,2)$ as a linear combination of orthonormal atomic-orbital-based functions, which include the ionic functions $\\chi_A(1)\\chi_A(2)$ and $\\chi_B(1)\\chi_B(2)$, we observe that the coefficients of these ionic functions are precisely zero.\n\nTherefore, the total ionic weight is:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{ionic}} = 0^2 + 0^2 = 0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates a crucial success of configuration interaction methods: unlike the restricted Hartree-Fock approximation which incorrectly predicts $50\\%$ ionic character at dissociation, the multi-reference CISD (or Full CI in this case) correctly describes the dissociation of $\\mathrm{H}_2$ into two neutral, non-interacting hydrogen atoms, a purely covalent situation.",

These do not contribute to the leading-order overall scaling.\n\nThe total number of nonzero elements in the D-D block is dominated by the sum of the contributions from the three leading cases:\n$$ \\text{Number of nonzero elements} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(n_o^4 n_v^2) + \\mathcal{O}(n_o^2 n_v^4) + \\mathcal{O}(n_o^3 n_v^3) $$\nSubstituting the given relations $n_o = \\alpha N$ and $n_v = \\beta N$:\n- $\\mathcal{O}(n_o^4 n_v^2) = \\mathcal{O}((\\alpha N)^4 (\\beta N)^2) = \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^4\\beta^2 N^6)$\n- $\\mathcal{O}(n_o^2 n_v^4) = \\mathcal{O}((\\alpha N)^2 (\\beta N)^4) = \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^2\\beta^4 N^6)$\n- $\\mathcal{O}(n_o^3 n_v^3) = \\mathcal{O}((\\alpha N)^3 (\\beta N)^3) = \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^3\\beta^3 N^6)$\n\nAll three leading terms scale as $N^6$. Therefore, the total number of non-zero elements in the D-D block scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$. Since the cost to compute each element is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, the total computational cost for assembling the D-D block also scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$.\n\nThe exponent $p$ in the asymptotic scaling $\\mathcal{O}(N^p)$ is therefore $6$.",
