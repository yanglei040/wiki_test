This exercise provides the foundational definition of correlation energy, $E_{\\text{corr}} = E_{\\text{exact}} - E_{\\text{HF}}$, and applies it to three fundamental chemical systems. By working through these cases, including the critical one-electron hydrogen atom, you will gain a concrete sense of how much energy is involved in electron correlation and why it is identically zero in the absence of electron-electron interactions .",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a clear, formalizable task based on fundamental principles of quantum chemistry. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe central task is to compute the fraction of the total ground-state electronic energy that originates from electron correlation. This requires an understanding of the hierarchy of approximations in electronic structure theory. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where nuclei are considered fixed, the electronic energy is the solution to the electronic Schrödinger equation. The Hartree-Fock ($HF$) method provides a foundational, yet approximate, solution to this equation. It models each electron as moving in an average, or mean, field created by all other electrons, thereby neglecting the instantaneous correlations in their motions.\n\nThe electron correlation energy, $E_{\\text{corr}}$, is formally defined as the correction needed to elevate the approximate Hartree-Fock energy, $E_{\\text{HF}}$, to the exact nonrelativistic electronic ground-state energy, $E_{\\text{exact}}$, for a given nuclear geometry. This definition is expressed by the equation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} = E_{\\text{exact}} - E_{\\text{HF}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction, $f$, which represents the magnitude of this correlation energy relative to the magnitude of the total exact electronic energy. This is given by:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\lvert E_{\\text{corr}} \\rvert}{\\lvert E_{\\text{exact}} \\rvert}\n$$\nWe will now apply these formulae to the three specified cases. All energies are provided in the atomic unit of energy, the Hartree ($E_{\\mathrm{h}}$).\n\nCase $1$: Water molecule ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)\nThe provided data for the water molecule are:\n$E_{\\text{HF}} = -76.026760737 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\text{exact}} = -76.438000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the correlation energy, $E_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} = (-76.438000000) - (-76.026760737) = -0.411239263 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the fraction, $f_1$:\n$$\nf_1 = \\frac{\\lvert -0.411239263 \\rvert}{\\lvert -76.438000000 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.411239263}{76.438000000} \\approx 0.005379895\n$$\nRounding to eight digits after the decimal point, the result is $0.00537990$.\n\nCase $2$: Hydrogen atom ($\\text{H}$)\nThe provided data for the hydrogen atom are:\n$E_{\\text{HF}} = -0.500000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\text{exact}} = -0.500000000 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nThis is a special boundary case. The hydrogen atom consists of only one proton and one electron. By definition, electron correlation describes the interaction between multiple electrons. Since there is only one electron, there are no electron-electron interactions to correlate. The Hartree-Fock method is therefore exact for any one-electron system. Consequently, the correlation energy must be zero. We verify this with the given data:\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} = (-0.500000000) - (-0.500000000) = 0.0 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nThe corresponding fraction, $f_2$, is therefore also zero:\n$$\nf_2 = \\frac{\\lvert 0.0 \\rvert}{\\lvert -0.500000000 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.0}{0.5} = 0.0\n$$\nAs a decimal with eight digits, the result is $0.00000000$.\n\nCase $3$: Helium atom ($\\text{He}$)\nThe provided data for the two-electron helium atom are:\n$E_{\\text{HF}} = -2.861679995 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$E_{\\text{exact}} = -2.9037243770341195 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the correlation energy, $E_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} = (-2.9037243770341195) - (-2.861679995) = -0.0420443820341195 \\ E_{\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nThis non-zero value is the correlation energy for helium, often cited as a classic example. Now, we compute the fraction, $f_3$:\n$$\nf_3 = \\frac{\\lvert -0.0420443820341195 \\rvert}{\\lvert -2.9037243770341195 \\rvert} = \\frac{0.0420443820341195}{2.9037243770341195} \\approx 0.0144794276\n$$\nRounding to eight digits after the decimal point gives $0.01447943$.\n\nIn summary, the correlation energy constitutes a small but critical fraction of the total electronic energy. For the water molecule, it is approximately $0.54\\%$; for the helium atom, it is approximately $1.45\\%$; and for the one-electron hydrogen atom, it is exactly $0\\%$. The algorithm for the final program will implement these straightforward calculations for each case and format the output as specified.",

            "problem": "In quantum chemistry, the exact non-relativistic electronic energy of a molecule is often approximated using the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The HF method approximates the many-electron wavefunction as a single Slater determinant, effectively treating each electron as moving in the average field created by all other electrons. The difference between the exact energy and the HF energy is defined as the electron correlation energy. This energy can be conceptually partitioned into two types:\n\n1.  **Dynamic Correlation**: This arises from the instantaneous repulsion and correlated motion of electrons trying to avoid each other at short distances. This type of correlation is present in all systems with two or more electrons.\n2.  **Static (or Non-Dynamical) Correlation**: This becomes significant when the electronic ground state of a molecule cannot be well-approximated by a single Slater determinant. This typically occurs in situations with chemical bond breaking, diradical character, or when multiple electronic configurations are nearly degenerate in energy and mix strongly to form the true ground state.\n\nConsider the following chemical systems, all at their ground-state equilibrium geometries.

The solution $\\phi(x)$ must be the ground state of this QHO. The frequency is $\\omega' = \\sqrt{K'/m} = \\sqrt{k+k_{\\mathrm{int}}}$.\nFor the ground state of a QHO with frequency $\\omega'$, the expectation value of $x^2$ is $\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega'}$. This provides the self-consistency condition.\nThe RHF energy is $E_{\\text{HF}} = 2\\langle h \\rangle + J_{11}$, where $\\langle h \\rangle$ is the one-electron energy and $J_{11}$ is the Coulomb integral.\n$\\langle h \\rangle = \\langle \\phi | -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 | \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T \\rangle_{\\phi} + \\frac{k}{2}\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\phi}$.\nFor the HF orbital $\\phi$, which is the ground state of the QHO with frequency $\\omega'$, the virial theorem gives $\\langle T \\rangle_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{4}\\omega'$.\n$\\langle h \\rangle = \\frac{\\omega'}{4} + \\frac{k}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\omega'}\\right) = \\frac{\\omega'}{4} + \\frac{k}{4\\omega'}$.\nThe two-electron integral is $J_{11} = k_{\\mathrm{int}}\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\phi} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{2\\omega'}$.\nThe total RHF energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{HF}} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{4} + \\frac{k}{4\\omega'}\\right) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{2\\omega'} = \\frac{\\omega'}{2} + \\frac{k}{2\\omega'} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{2\\omega'} = \\frac{\\omega'}{2} + \\frac{k+k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{2\\omega'}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\omega'^2 = k+k_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{HF}} = \\frac{\\omega'}{2} + \\frac{\\omega'^2}{2\\omega'} = \\frac{\\omega'}{2} + \\frac{\\omega'}{2} = \\omega' = \\sqrt{k+k_{\\mathrm{int}}}\n$$\nSubstituting $k=4$ and $k_{\\mathrm{int}}=1$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{HF}} = \\sqrt{4+1} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23606798 \\text{ Hartree}\n$$\n\n3.  **Calculation of the Correlation Energy ($E_{\\text{corr}}$)**\n\nThe correlation energy is the difference between the exact and Hartree-Fock energies.\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} = E_{\\text{exact}} - E_{\\text{HF}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\right) - \\sqrt{5}\n$$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$\nE_{\\text{corr}} \\approx 2.22474487 - 2.23606798 = -0.01132311\n$$\nRounding to five significant figures gives $-0.011323$.\nThe correlation energy is negative, as it must be by the variational principle, since the Hartree-Fock energy is an upper bound to the true ground-state energy.",
