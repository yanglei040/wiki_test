It guarantees that the energy calculated from any valid trial density $n(\\vec{r})$ provides an upper bound to the true ground-state energy $E_0$. This exercise challenges you to think critically about the precise conclusions you can draw when comparing the energies of two different trial densities, reinforcing a correct interpretation of the variational principle.

            "problem": "An electron is confined within a one-dimensional potential well defined by a fixed external potential $v_{ext}(x)$. The exact ground-state energy of this system is $E_0$, and the corresponding ground-state electron density is $n_0(x)$. A researcher is attempting to approximate the ground-state energy using the principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT). The universal energy functional, $E[n] = F_{HK}[n] + \\int n(x) v_{ext}(x) dx$, where $F_{HK}[n]$ is the Hohenberg-Kohn functional of the kinetic and electron-electron interaction energies, is assumed to be known exactly.\n\nThe researcher formulates two different, well-behaved trial electron densities, $n_A(x)$ and $n_B(x)$. Both densities are non-negative everywhere and are normalized to represent a single electron, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n_A(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n_B(x) dx = 1$. It is also known that neither trial density is identical to the true ground-state density, so $n_A(x) \\neq n_0(x)$ and $n_B(x) \\neq n_0(x)$.\n\nUpon evaluating the energy functional for each trial density, the researcher obtains the energies $E[n_A]$ and $E[n_B]$ and finds that they satisfy the inequality:\n$E[n_A]  E[n_B]$\n\nBased exclusively on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, which of the following statements can be definitively concluded?\n\nA. $E[n_A]$ is the exact ground-state energy $E_0$.\n\nB. The trial density $n_A(x)$ must be closer to the true ground-state density $n_0(x)$ than $n_B(x)$ is, as measured by the integrated absolute difference $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |n(x) - n_0(x)| dx$.\n\nC. The inequality $E_0 \\leq E[n_A]  E[n_B]$ must hold true.\n\nD. The trial density $n_B(x)$ is unphysical because it does not correspond to the lowest possible energy state for the given potential $v_{ext}(x)$.\n\nE. The kinetic energy part of the functional, when evaluated for $n_A(x)$, must be smaller than the kinetic energy part evaluated for $n_B(x)$.",
            "solution": "We begin with the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional and energy expression for a fixed external potential, written as\n$$\nE[n] = F_{HK}[n] + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n(x)\\, v_{ext}(x)\\, dx.\n$$\nFor a single electron, the electron-electron interaction energy is zero, so the universal functional reduces to the exact kinetic-energy functional, i.e., $F_{HK}[n] = T[n]$. However, for the conclusions required here, only the Hohenberg-Kohn variational principle is needed.\n\nBy the second Hohenberg-Kohn theorem (the DFT variational principle, which is rigorously established by the Levy-Lieb constrained-search formulation), for any $N$-representable trial density $n(x)$ normalized to the correct particle number and used with the fixed $v_{ext}(x)$, one has\n$$\nE[n] \\ge E[n_{0}] = E_{0},\n$$\nwith equality if and only if $n(x)$ is a ground-state density for that $v_{ext}(x)$. The problem states that $n_{A}(x) \\neq n_{0}(x)$ and $n_{B}(x) \\neq n_{0}(x)$, and the densities are well-behaved and normalized for a single electron. For a single electron, any non-negative, integrable, normalized density is $N$-representable by a one-particle wavefunction, so the variational inequality applies to both $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE[n_{A}] > E_{0}, \\quad E[n_{B}] > E_{0}.\n$$\nCombining these inequalities with the given ordering\n$$\nE[n_{A}]  E[n_{B}],\n$$\nwe obtain\n$$\nE_{0}  E[n_{A}]  E[n_{B}],\n$$\nand in particular the weaker statement\n$$\nE_{0} \\leq E[n_{A}]  E[n_{B}]\n$$\nmust hold. This establishes that option C is guaranteed by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems.\n\nWe now assess the other options based solely on Hohenberg-Kohn results:\n\n- A is false because $E[n_{A}] = E_{0}$ would require $n_{A}(x)$ to be a ground-state density for the given $v_{ext}(x)$, which is excluded by $n_{A}(x) \\neq n_{0}(x)$.\n- B cannot be concluded: the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems do not provide any ordering of densities by an $L^{1}$ metric such as $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |n(x) - n_{0}(x)|\\, dx$ based on the ordering of energy functional values. Energy ordering and $L^{1}$ closeness are unrelated by HK theorems.\n- D is false: a trial density yielding a higher energy than another trial density is not “unphysical.” Only the true ground-state density minimizes $E[n]$; trial densities with higher energies are still permissible within the variational framework.\n- E is not implied even though $F_{HK}[n] = T[n]$ for one electron, because the total energy depends on both $T[n]$ and the external-potential term $\\int n v_{ext}$. The inequality $E[n_{A}]  E[n_{B}]$ does not force $T[n_{A}]  T[n_{B}]$; the ordering could arise from the potential-energy contribution.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that can be definitively concluded from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the given information is C.",
