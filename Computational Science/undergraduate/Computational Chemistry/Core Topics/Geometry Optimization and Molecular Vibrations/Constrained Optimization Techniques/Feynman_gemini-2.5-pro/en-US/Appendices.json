This practice simulates this common trade-off by tasking you with minimizing a molecule's conformational energy while ensuring its lipophilicity, represented by the $\\mathrm{LogP}$ value, stays within an acceptable \"drug-like\" range. This exercise provides a clear, tangible example of how an external requirement acts as a constraint, potentially shifting the optimal solution away from the unconstrained minimum. ",

            "problem": "In a simplified, physically grounded drug design scenario, consider a continuous series of analogs parameterized by a single descriptor $x$ that quantifies the hydrophobic substituent extent on a fixed scaffold.

            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a valid, well-posed exercise in constrained optimization, grounded in simplified but standard principles of computational chemistry. We are provided with all necessary information to proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe task is to find the minimum value of the potential energy function $E(x)$, subject to a constraint on the lipophilicity descriptor $\\mathrm{LogP}(x)$.\n\nThe objective function is the potential energy, given by the harmonic model:\n$$ E(x) = E_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa \\left(x - x^{\\star}\\right)^{2} $$\nSubstituting the provided constants, $E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10$ kJ/mol, $\\kappa = 50$ kJ/mol, and $x^{\\star} = 1.3$, we have:\n$$ E(x) = 10 + 50 \\left(x - 1.3\\right)^{2} $$\nThis is a quadratic function of the descriptor $x$. The coefficient of the quadratic term is positive ($\\kappa = 50 > 0$), so the parabola opens upwards, and the function possesses a single global minimum. To find the unconstrained minimum, we differentiate $E(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = 2\\kappa(x - x^{\\star}) = 2(50)(x - 1.3) = 100(x - 1.3) $$\nSetting $\\frac{dE}{dx} = 0$ gives $100(x - 1.3) = 0$, which yields the unconstrained minimizer $x_{\\text{unconstrained}} = 1.3$. At this point, the unconstrained minimum energy is $E(1.3) = 10 + 50(1.3 - 1.3)^{2} = 10$ kJ/mol.\n\nNext, we must analyze the constraint on the system. The drug-likeness constraint is given as $\\mathrm{LogP}(x) \\leq 5$. The function $\\mathrm{LogP}(x)$ is defined by the linear relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{LogP}(x) = \\ell_{0} + \\ell_{1} x $$\nUsing the given parameters $\\ell_{0} = 4.2$ and $\\ell_{1} = 1.0$, the constraint becomes:\n$$ 4.2 + 1.0x \\leq 5 $$\nSolving this inequality for $x$ defines the feasible region for the descriptor:\n$$ x \\leq 5 - 4.2 $$\n$$ x \\leq 0.8 $$\nThe feasible region is the set of all $x$ in the interval $(-\\infty, 0.8]$.\n\nThe optimization problem is to minimize $E(x)$ for $x$ in this feasible region. We must now compare the location of the unconstrained minimum, $x_{\\text{unconstrained}} = 1.3$, with the feasible region. Since $1.3 > 0.8$, the unconstrained minimum lies outside the feasible region.\n\nThe function $E(x)$ is a parabola with its vertex (minimum) at $x = 1.3$. For all $x < 1.3$, the function $E(x)$ is monotonically decreasing as $x$ increases. The feasible region, $x \\leq 0.8$, lies entirely within this domain of monotonic behavior. To find the minimum value of $E(x)$ within the feasible region, we must select the point in the feasible region that is closest to the unconstrained minimizer $x = 1.3$. This point is the boundary of the feasible region, $x_{\\text{opt}} = 0.8$. At this point, the constraint is said to be \"active.\"\n\nFinally, we calculate the constrained minimum energy, $E_{\\text{min}}$, by evaluating the energy function at $x_{\\text{opt}} = 0.8$:\n$$ E_{\\text{min}} = E(0.8) = 10 + 50(0.8 - 1.3)^{2} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{min}} = 10 + 50(-0.5)^{2} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{min}} = 10 + 50(0.25) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{min}} = 10 + 12.5 $$\n$$ E_{\\text{min}} = 22.5 \\, \\text{kJ/mol} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The value $22.5$ is written as $22.50$ to satisfy this requirement.",

This is a standard and well-established model used for molecular modeling. The constraint on non-bonded Hydrogen distances represents a rudimentary model for steric repulsion (Pauli repulsion), which is physically sound. All parameters provided are within realistic ranges for the specified molecules.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a standard non-linear programming (NLP) problem: minimize a continuous and differentiable function (except at points of coordinate collision, which are prevented by the repulsive nature of the potential, and at the boundaries of the `arccos` domain, which are handled by numerical clipping) subject to a set of inequality constraints. A solution is expected to exist.\n- **Objective and Complete**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical definitions and objective language. All necessary data (atomic constitution, parameters, initial geometries) are provided for each test case.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded, and computationally solvable problem in constrained optimization.\n\n**Solution Methodology**\n\nThe problem will be solved using numerical optimization. The vector of all atomic coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ for a system of $N$ atoms, serves as the variable for the optimization. The objective function is the potential energy $E(\\mathbf{x})$. The constraints are of the form $g_p(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0$, which we can write as $d_{\\mathrm{min}} - \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_p - \\mathbf{r}_q \\rVert \\le 0$ for each constrained pair $(p,q)$, where $d_{\\mathrm{min}} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n\nWe will employ the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm, as implemented in the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function. This method is suitable for non-linear optimization problems with inequality constraints.\n\nThe implementation requires a Python function to compute the total energy $E(\\mathbf{x})$ and a set of functions representing the constraints.\n\n**Analysis of Test Cases**\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (Diatomic Hydrogen, $\\mathrm{H}_2$)**: The system consists of two Hydrogen atoms, $(0,1)$, connected by a bond. The potential energy is solely a bond stretching term: $E = \\frac{1}{2} k_{b,01} (\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_0 - \\mathbf{r}_1 \\rVert - r_{0,01})^2$. The minimum of this function occurs when the bond length equals the equilibrium length, $\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_0 - \\mathbf{r}_1 \\rVert = r_{0,01} = 0.74\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$, at which point the energy is $E=0$. The constraint rule applies to non-bonded Hydrogen pairs. Since the only pair of Hydrogens is bonded, there are no constraints. The optimization is unconstrained, and the expected minimum energy is precisely $0.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\n2.  **Test Case 2 (Water, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$)**: The system consists of one Oxygen atom ($0$) and two Hydrogen atoms ($1, 2$). The unconstrained minimum energy conformation would have bond lengths $d_{O-H} = 0.96\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$ and angle $\\theta_{H-O-H} = 104.5^\\circ$. In this geometry, the distance between the two Hydrogen atoms, calculated using the law of cosines, is $d_{H-H} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (0.96)^2 \\cdot (1 - \\cos(104.5^\\circ))} \\approx 1.518\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. This distance violates the constraint $d_{H-H} \\ge 2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. Therefore, the constraint is active. The optimizer must find a new geometry that satisfies $d_{H-H} \\ge 2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$ while minimizing the resulting strain energy in the bonds and angle. The final energy will be greater than zero.\n\n3.  **Test Case 3 (Linear $\\mathrm{H-C-C-H}$)**: The system is configured to be linear, with equilibrium angles of $180^\\circ$. At the unconstrained energy minimum, all bond lengths are at their equilibrium values ($1.09\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$, $1.54\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$, $1.09\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$) and the molecule is perfectly linear. The distance between the two non-bonded Hydrogen atoms ($0, 3$) is the sum of the equilibrium bond lengths: $d_{H-H} = 1.09 + 1.54 + 1.09 = 3.72\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. This distance is greater than the required minimum of $2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. The constraint is therefore inactive, as it is already satisfied at the global unconstrained minimum.

            "problem": "You are asked to construct and minimize a physically motivated two-dimensional potential energy model for the dissociation of molecular nitrogen on an iron surface, formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Consider a two-atom molecule with nitrogen atoms labeled $\\mathrm{N}_1$ and $\\mathrm{N}_2$ in the plane defined by Cartesian coordinates $(x,z)$, where $z$ is the perpendicular distance from a flat, structureless iron surface located at $z=0$. The coordinate $y$ is constrained to be identically zero for both atoms. The atom $\\mathrm{N}_1$ is fixed at position $(x_1,z_1)=(0,h)$ for a given height parameter $h>0$, and the atom $\\mathrm{N}_2$ is free to move at position $(x_2,z_2)$ subject to bound constraints specified below.\n\nThe total potential energy $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the sum of the intramolecular bond energy between $\\mathrm{N}_1$ and $\\mathrm{N}_2$, the interaction of each nitrogen atom with the surface, and a weak laterally periodic surface corrugation term. All energies must be expressed in electronvolts (eV) and all distances in ångströms (Å). Define the following components:\n\n- The intramolecular nitrogen–nitrogen interaction is modeled by a Morse potential\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{NN}}(r) \\;=\\; D_e \\left(1 - e^{-a_m\\,(r - r_e)}\\right)^2 \\;-\\; D_e,\n$$\nwhere $r = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$ is the internuclear separation in the plane, with parameters $D_e = 9.76\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $r_e = 1.10\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, and $a_m = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n\n- The interaction of a single nitrogen atom at height $z$ with the surface is modeled by a $(9\\!-\\!3)$-type potential\n$$\nV_s(z) \\;=\\; \\frac{A}{z^9} \\;-\\; \\frac{B}{z^3},\n$$\nwith $A = 394.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^9$ and $B = 4.735\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^3$.\n\n- The lateral corrugation of the surface potential felt by a nitrogen atom at $(x,z)$ is modeled by\n$$\nV_c(x,z) \\;=\\; C \\, e^{-\\alpha z}\\,\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right),\n$$\nwith $C = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\alpha = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$, and $a = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n\nThe total energy for a given $h$ is therefore\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_2,z_2; h) \\;=\\; V_{\\mathrm{NN}}\\!\\left(\\sqrt{(x_2 - 0)^2 + (z_2 - h)^2}\\right) \\;+\\; V_s(h) \\;+\\; V_s(z_2) \\;+\\; V_c(0,h) \\;+\\; V_c(x_2,z_2).\n$$\n\nThe optimization variables are $x_2$ and $z_2$.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid, well-posed exercise in constrained optimization within the domain of computational chemistry. It asks for the minimum of a physically motivated potential energy surface (PES) for a diatomic molecule near a solid surface. This is a common task in modeling chemical reactions, such as dissociation, at interfaces.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum value of the total potential energy $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ for a system consisting of a nitrogen molecule ($\\mathrm{N}_2$) interacting with an iron surface. The position of one nitrogen atom, $\\mathrm{N}_1$, is fixed at $(x_1, z_1) = (0, h)$ for a given parameter $h$. The position of the second nitrogen atom, $\\mathrm{N}_2$, at $(x_2, z_2)$ is subject to optimization within specified bounds.\n\nThe objective function to be minimized is the total potential energy $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_2, z_2; h)$, which is a function of the optimization variables $x_2$ and $z_2$, and is parameterized by $h$. The function is defined as the sum of several energy contributions:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_2,z_2; h) \\;=\\; V_{\\mathrm{NN}}(r) \\;+\\; V_s(h) \\;+\\; V_s(z_2) \\;+\\; V_c(0,h) \\;+\\; V_c(x_2,z_2)\n$$\nwhere:\n1.  $V_{\\mathrm{NN}}(r)$ is the intramolecular Morse potential between $\\mathrm{N}_1$ and $\\mathrm{N}_2$. It is a function of the internuclear distance $r = \\sqrt{x_2^2 + (z_2 - h)^2}$. The Morse potential provides a realistic description of the bond energy, including its dissociation limit.\n    $$\n    V_{\\mathrm{NN}}(r) \\;=\\; D_e \\left(1 - e^{-a_m\\,(r - r_e)}\\right)^2 \\;-\\; D_e\n    $$\n2.  $V_s(z)$ is the potential describing the interaction of a single nitrogen atom with the iron surface, modeled as a $(9-3)$ potential. It accounts for both the short-range repulsion and long-range attraction. This term appears twice: once for the fixed atom $\\mathrm{N}_1$ at height $h$, $V_s(h)$, and once for the mobile atom $\\mathrm{N}_2$ at height $z_2$, $V_s(z_2)$.\n    $$\n    V_s(z) \\;=\\; \\frac{A}{z^9} \\;-\\; \\frac{B}{z^3}\n    $$\n3.  $V_c(x,z)$ is a weak periodic potential representing the lateral corrugation of the surface. This term accounts for the fact that the surface is not perfectly smooth at the atomic scale, leading to preferred adsorption sites. It also appears twice, for $\\mathrm{N}_1$ at $(0,h)$ and $\\mathrm{N}_2$ at $(x_2,z_2)$.\n    $$\n    V_c(x,z) \\;=\\; C \\, e^{-\\alpha z}\\,\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\n    $$\n\nThe optimization is subject to the box constraints:\n$$\n-10.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} \\le x_2 \\le 10.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0.80\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} \\le z_2 \\le 8.00\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\n\nFor each value of the parameter $h$ in the test suite, we must solve the following constrained optimization problem for the minimum energy $E^\\star(h)$:\n$$\nE^\\star(h) \\;=\\; \\min_{x_2, z_2} \\; E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_2, z_2; h)\n$$\n\nThe total energy function $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-convex function of its variables $(x_2, z_2)$. This means it may possess multiple local minima within the search domain. Standard gradient-based optimization algorithms are guaranteed only to find a local minimum, which may depend on the initial guess for $(x_2, z_2)$. To find the global minimum, a more robust strategy is required.\n\nThe chosen method is a multi-start optimization. This strategy involves running a local optimization algorithm from a large number of different starting points distributed across the feasible domain. The global minimum is then taken as the minimum of all the local minima found. This significantly increases the probability of locating the true global minimum of the non-convex PES.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each specified value of $h$:\n1.  Define the objective function representing $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_2, z_2; h)$ in a form suitable for a numerical solver.\n2.  Define the box constraints for $x_2$ and $z_2$.\n3.  Create a grid of initial guess points $(x_{2,0}, z_{2,0})$ that covers the entire bounded search domain. A sufficiently dense grid ensures that the basins of attraction of all significant local minima are sampled.\n4.  For each initial guess, perform a local minimization using a quasi-Newton method, such as `L-BFGS-B`, which is well-suited for problems with box constraints. The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function provides an implementation of this algorithm.\n5.  The lowest energy value found across all the individual optimization runs is taken as the best approximation to the global minimum energy, $E^\\star(h)$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each value of $h$ given in the test suite. The final results are collected and formatted as specified.",
