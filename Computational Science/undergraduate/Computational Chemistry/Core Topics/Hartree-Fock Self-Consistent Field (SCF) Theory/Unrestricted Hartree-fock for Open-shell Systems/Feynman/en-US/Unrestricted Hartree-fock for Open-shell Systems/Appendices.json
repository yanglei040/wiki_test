            "problem": "In unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) theory for open-shell systems, the spin-resolved Fock operators depend on the spin densities and contain Coulomb and exchange terms. Consider a hydrogen atom described in atomic units by a minimal basis consisting of a single normalized Slater-type orbital $|\\phi\\rangle$ corresponding to the hydrogenic $1s$ function with exponent $\\zeta = 1$. Assume there is a single electron with $\\alpha$ spin, so that the occupation numbers are $n_{\\alpha} = 1$ and $n_{\\beta} = 0$.

It is a standard application of unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) theory to a minimal system, the hydrogen atom, for which an exact solution within the model can be derived. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe UHF Fock operators for spin $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons are given by:\n$$ \\hat{F}^{\\alpha} = \\hat{h} + \\hat{J}^{\\alpha} + \\hat{J}^{\\beta} - \\hat{K}^{\\alpha} $$\n$$ \\hat{F}^{\\beta} = \\hat{h} + \\hat{J}^{\\alpha} + \\hat{J}^{\\beta} - \\hat{K}^{\\beta} $$\nwhere $\\hat{h}$ is the one-electron (core) Hamiltonian, and $\\hat{J}^{\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{K}^{\\sigma}$ are the total Coulomb and exchange operators for spin $\\sigma$, respectively. These operators are constructed from the spin-orbitals occupied by electrons.\n\nIn a basis of atomic orbitals $\\{|\\phi_{\\mu}\\rangle\\}$, the matrix elements of the Fock operator are:\n$$ F_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\sigma} = h_{\\mu\\nu} + \\sum_{\\lambda\\rho} (P_{\\lambda\\rho}^{\\alpha} + P_{\\lambda\\rho}^{\\beta}) (\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\rho) - \\sum_{\\lambda\\rho} P_{\\lambda\\rho}^{\\sigma} (\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\rho) $$\nHere, $h_{\\mu\\nu} = \\langle \\phi_{\\mu} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_{\\nu} \\rangle$ are the one-electron integrals, $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\rho)$ are the two-electron repulsion integrals, and $P^{\\sigma}$ is the spin-density matrix for spin $\\sigma$.\n\nIn the given problem, the basis consists of a single normalized atomic orbital $|\\phi\\rangle$. Consequently, all matrix indices $(\\mu, \\nu, \\lambda, \\rho)$ are equal to $1$, and the matrices become scalars. Let us denote the single basis function as $|\\phi_1\\rangle \\equiv |\\phi\\rangle$. The MO coefficients are trivial; the single $\\alpha$ molecular orbital is $|\\psi^{\\alpha}\\rangle=|\\phi\\rangle$ and the virtual $\\beta$ molecular orbital is $|\\psi^{\\beta}\\rangle=|\\phi\\rangle$. The occupation numbers are given as $n_{\\alpha} = 1$ and $n_{\\beta} = 0$.\n\nThe spin-density matrices are $1 \\times 1$ matrices (scalars) given by $P^{\\sigma} = C^{\\sigma} n^{\\sigma} (C^{\\sigma})^\\dagger$. Since the molecular orbitals are just the basis functions, the coefficient matrices are $C^{\\alpha} = C^{\\beta} = [1]$.\nThe $\\alpha$-spin density matrix element is $P_{11}^{\\alpha} = (1)(1)(1)^* = 1$.\nThe $\\beta$-spin density matrix element is $P_{11}^{\\beta} = (1)(0)(1)^* = 0$.\nThe total density matrix element is $P_{11} = P_{11}^{\\alpha} + P_{11}^{\\beta} = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n\nThe scalar Fock matrix elements, $F^{\\alpha}$ and $F^{\\beta}$, are therefore:\n$$ F^{\\alpha} = F_{11}^{\\alpha} = h_{11} + P_{11} (11|11) - P_{11}^{\\alpha} (11|11) $$\n$$ F^{\\beta} = F_{11}^{\\beta} = h_{11} + P_{11} (11|11) - P_{11}^{\\beta} (11|11) $$\nNote that for a single orbital, the exchange integral $(\\phi_1\\phi_1|\\phi_1\\phi_1)$ is identical to the Coulomb integral, so $K_{11} = J_{11} = (11|11)$, as stated in the problem. The given data are:\n$h \\equiv h_{11} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n$J \\equiv (11|11) = \\frac{5}{8}$\n\nNow, we substitute the density matrix elements and integral values.\nFor the $\\alpha$-spin Fock matrix element:\n$$ F^{\\alpha} = h + (P_{11}^{\\alpha} + P_{11}^{\\beta})J - P_{11}^{\\alpha}J = h + P_{11}^{\\beta}J $$\n$$ F^{\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2} + (0) \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis result is physically correct. The single $\\alpha$ electron does not interact with other electrons, so its energy is determined solely by the core Hamiltonian.\n\nFor the $\\beta$-spin Fock matrix element:\n$$ F^{\\beta} = h + (P_{11}^{\\alpha} + P_{11}^{\\beta})J - P_{11}^{\\beta}J = h + P_{11}^{\\alpha}J $$\n$$ F^{\\beta} = -\\frac{1}{2} + (1) \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThis represents the energy of a virtual $\\beta$ electron, which experiences attraction to the nucleus (term $h$) and repulsion from the existing $\\alpha$ electron (term $J$).\n\nThe orbital energies, $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\beta}$, are the eigenvalues of the corresponding Fock matrices. Since the matrices are scalars, the orbital energies are the matrix elements themselves.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\alpha} = F^{\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\beta} = F^{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the expectation value of the total spin-squared operator, $\\langle S^2 \\rangle$.

The first term is the spin-squared value for the state of maximum spin projection, $S(S+1)$ where $S = \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(N_{\\alpha}-N_{\\beta})$.\n$$ \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(1-0) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe summation term represents the spin contamination. Since $N_{\\beta}=0$, the sum over $j$ is empty, and its value is zero.\n$$ \\sum_{i}^{1} \\sum_{j}^{0} |\\langle \\psi_i^{\\alpha} | \\psi_j^{\\beta} \\rangle|^2 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\langle S^2 \\rangle$ simplifies considerably:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) + 0 - 0 $$\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThis result, $\\frac{3}{4}$, is equivalent to $s(s+1)$ for $s=\\frac{1}{2}$, which is the exact value for a pure doublet state. For a one-electron system, the UHF wavefunction is necessarily an eigenfunction of $\\hat{S}^2$, and there is no spin contamination.\n\nThe required values are $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\varepsilon_{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{8}$, and $\\langle S^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{4}$.",

The concepts of exact ground states, singlets, Unrestricted and Restricted Hartree-Fock methods, spatial orbitals, and spin expectation values are all fundamental components of quantum chemistry. The scenario described—where a UHF calculation for a system with a true singlet ground state converges to a solution with different alpha and beta orbitals—is a well-documented phenomenon known as a broken-symmetry solution or UHF instability. This typically occurs when the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) model provides a poor description of the system, for instance, during bond dissociation. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and describes a physically and computationally realistic situation. It is not invalid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the detailed analysis and solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) approximations for a system that is, in reality, a closed-shell singlet.\n\nFor a closed-shell system with $2N$ electrons, the RHF method constrains the spatial part of the wavefunction to be identical for spin-up ($\\alpha$) and spin-down ($\\beta$) electrons in each occupied orbital. The RHF wavefunction is a single Slater determinant of the form:\n$$ \\Psi_{\\text{RHF}} = \\mathcal{A} |\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1) \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\beta(2) \\dots \\phi_N(\\mathbf{r}_{2N-1})\\alpha(2N-1) \\phi_N(\\mathbf{r}_{2N})\\beta(2N)| $$\nBy construction, this wavefunction is a pure singlet state, meaning it is an exact eigenfunction of the total spin-squared operator $\\hat{S}^2$ with an eigenvalue of $S(S+1) = 0(0+1) = 0$. The electron density for spin-up electrons, $\\rho_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2$, is everywhere equal to the density for spin-down electrons, $\\rho_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2$. Consequently, the net spin density, $\\rho_s(\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\rho_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})$, is zero everywhere.\n\nThe UHF method relaxes the constraint $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} = \\phi_i^{\\beta}$. It allows the spatial orbitals for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons to be optimized independently. The UHF wavefunction is also a single Slater determinant, but of a more general form:\n$$ \\Psi_{\\text{UHF}} = \\mathcal{A} |\\phi_1^{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1) \\phi_1^{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\beta(2) \\dots \\phi_N^{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}_{2N-1})\\alpha(2N-1) \\phi_N^{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}_{2N})\\beta(2N)| $$\nThe problem states that the calculation converged to a solution where $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} \\neq \\phi_i^{\\beta}$ for at least some $i$. This is known as a broken-symmetry solution. By allowing different orbitals for different spins, the UHF wavefunction gains additional variational flexibility compared to the RHF wavefunction. According to the variational principle, this can lead to a lower energy ($E_{\\text{UHF}} \\le E_{\\text{RHF}}$). This usually happens in systems where the simple RHF picture of doubly-occupied orbitals is qualitatively incorrect, such as during the breaking of a chemical bond. The UHF method can partially account for this (static) correlation by localizing the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons in different regions of space. For example, in stretched H$_2$, one electron's $\\alpha$ orbital localizes on one atom, and the other electron's $\\beta$ orbital localizes on the other.\n\nHowever, this energy lowering comes at a cost. When $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} \\neq \\phi_i^{\\beta}$, the single determinant $\\Psi_{\\text{UHF}}$ is no longer a pure eigenstate of $\\hat{S}^2$. It becomes a mixture of the true ground-state singlet and higher-multiplicity states, primarily the lowest-energy triplet state. This is called **spin contamination**. The expectation value of the spin-squared operator, $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$, for this UHF state will not be the correct value of $0$ for a singlet, but some value greater than $0$. For a system that should be a singlet, an uncontaminated UHF solution (where $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} = \\phi_i^{\\beta}$) is identical to the RHF solution and has $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = 0$. A triplet state would have $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = 1(1+1) = 2$. A spin-contaminated UHF state will typically have a value $0 < \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle < 2$.\n\nFurthermore, since the spatial distributions of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons are different, their respective densities, $\\rho_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\phi_i^{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ and $\\rho_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\phi_i^{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$, are not equal. This results in a non-zero spin density, $\\rho_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\rho_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}) \\neq 0$, across the molecule.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. A broken-symmetry, spin-contaminated Unrestricted Hartree-Fock state: the energy is lowered relative to the Restricted Hartree-Fock by allowing different $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals, producing nonzero spin density $\\rho_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\rho_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}) \\neq 0$ and typically $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ larger than the exact singlet value.**\nThis statement is a precise and complete description of the phenomenon.\n- \"broken-symmetry\": Correct, the UHF solution breaks the spin symmetry of the true singlet state.\n- \"spin-contaminated\": Correct, the wavefunction is not an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}^2$.\n- \"energy is lowered relative to the Restricted Hartree-Fock\": Correct, this is the variational reason for finding this solution.\n- \"producing nonzero spin density\": Correct, this is a direct consequence of $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} \\neq \\phi_i^{\\beta}$.\n- \"$\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ larger than the exact singlet value\": Correct, the expectation value will be $> 0$.\nThe verdict is **Correct**.\n\n**B.

Therefore, this option contradicts the given information.\nThe verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A numerical instability causing the orbitals to lose orthonormality; Hartree-Fock requires $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} = \\phi_i^{\\beta}$ for any system, so differing $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals signal an unphysical result.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. First, the result described is a true stationary point of the UHF equations, not a mere numerical artifact. The orbital sets $\\{\\phi_i^{\\alpha}\\}$ and $\\{\\phi_i^{\\beta}\\}$ remain separately orthonormal. Second, the assertion that \"Hartree-Fock requires $\\phi_i^{\\alpha} = \\phi_i^{\\beta}$ for any system\" is incorrect. This is the definition of *Restricted* Hartree-Fock, not the general Hartree-Fock framework. The *Unrestricted* method is specifically designed to lift this constraint.\nThe verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A legitimate pure high-spin triplet ground state, implying that the system is actually open-shell and has the correct spin expectation value $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = S(S+1)$.**\nThis is incorrect on several grounds. The UHF solution is not a \"pure\" spin state; it is spin-contaminated. Its $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ value is an average over multiple spin states and does not equal the exact eigenvalue for a triplet ($S=1, \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = 2$). Furthermore, it contradicts the initial premise that the *exact* ground state is a closed-shell singlet. The UHF solution is an artifact of the single-determinant approximation, not an indication that the system is truly a triplet.\nThe verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A Multiconfiguration Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) wave function with static correlation captured while retaining exact spin purity.**\nThis option misidentifies the computational method. The problem clearly states that a UHF calculation was performed, which yields a single-determinant wavefunction. An MCSCF wavefunction is a linear combination of multiple determinants or configuration state functions. While MCSCF is indeed a superior method for treating such systems because it can capture static correlation while remaining a pure spin state, the result described is from a UHF calculation, not an MCSCF one.\nThe verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that correctly and comprehensively characterizes the described outcome of the UHF calculation.",
