            "introduction": "Before performing any quantum chemistry calculation, a crucial first step is to understand the size and composition of the chosen basis set. This exercise provides foundational practice in this skill by asking you to count the total number of contracted basis functions for a simple molecule, methane, using the STO-3G minimal basis set. By working through this problem , you will solidify your understanding of how a basis set is constructed by combining contributions from the core and valence shells of each atom in a molecule.",

            "problem": "A minimal basis set represents each occupied atomic orbital of the isolated atom by a single contracted Gaussian-type orbital, constructed to approximate a Slater-type orbital (STO). In the Pople-style STO-$n$G family, an STO-$3$G basis replaces each Slater-type orbital by a contraction of $3$ primitive Gaussian functions, but the counting of contracted functions refers to the number of contracted basis functions, not the number of primitive Gaussians. For second-row main-group atoms, the valence shell contains both $s$- and $p$-type atomic orbitals; the Pople convention uses a shared-exponent $sp$-contraction for the valence shell that yields separate $s$- and $p$-type contracted functions with a common radial part. For hydrogen, only the $1s$ shell is present. For angular momentum $l=1$ ($p$-type), there are $3$ angular components whether one uses spherical harmonics or Cartesian Gaussians, whereas for $l \\geq 2$ the counts differ.\n\nStarting from these definitions and facts, determine the total number of contracted Gaussian basis functions in the STO-$3$G minimal basis for methane (one carbon atom bound to four hydrogen atoms). Explicitly identify how many contracted functions arise from the carbon core and valence shells and from each hydrogen, and state any spherical-versus-Cartesian assumption you invoke in your reasoning. Report only the total count of contracted functions as your final answer. Express your final answer as an integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The task is to determine the total number of contracted Gaussian basis functions for the methane molecule, $\\text{CH}_4$, using the STO-$3$G minimal basis set. A minimal basis set provides one basis function for each atomic orbital occupied in the ground-state electron configuration of the neutral atom. The STO-$3$G designation indicates each basis function is a contraction of $3$ primitive Gaussians, but we count the final contracted functions.\n\nWe analyze the contributions from each atom.\n\nFirst, consider the carbon atom, $C$. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The occupied atomic orbitals are $1s$, $2s$, and $2p$.\n\n1.  **Core Shell:** The $1s$ core orbital is represented by one contracted $s$-type basis function.\n2.  **Valence Shell:** The valence shell contains the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals.\n    *   The $2s$ orbital is represented by one contracted $s$-type basis function.\n    *   The $2p$ subshell consists of three degenerate orbitals ($2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z$). Each requires one basis function. This contributes three contracted $p$-type basis functions.\n\nIn total, the carbon atom contributes $1 \\text{ (for } 1s) + 1 \\text{ (for } 2s) + 3 \\text{ (for } 2p) = 5$ basis functions.\n\nNext, consider the hydrogen atoms, $H$. A hydrogen atom's ground-state electron configuration is $1s^1$. The only occupied atomic orbital is the $1s$ orbital. A minimal basis set provides one contracted $s$-type basis function for each hydrogen atom.\n\nThe methane molecule, $\\text{CH}_4$, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. The total number of basis functions is the sum of the contributions from all atoms.\n\nTotal number of functions = (Functions on $C$) + $4 \\times$ (Functions on $H$)\n$$ \\text{Total} = 5 + 4 \\times 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Total} = 5 + 4 $$\n$$ \\text{Total} = 9 $$\n\nTherefore, the STO-$3$G minimal basis set for methane comprises 9 contracted Gaussian basis functions.",

            "introduction": "A well-designed basis set must accurately reflect the underlying physics of atomic structure, using different types of functions to describe the tightly-bound core electrons versus the more diffuse valence electrons. This practice problem  challenges you to apply this core design principle by assigning sets of Gaussian exponents to the core and valence orbitals of a carbon atom. Successfully reasoning through this problem will build your intuition for how the mathematical parameters of a basis set, specifically the exponents $\\alpha$, connect to the physical reality of electron distributions.",

            "problem": "You are designing a minimal contracted Gaussian basis for a carbon atom to be used in a single-determinant molecular calculation. A contracted Gaussian basis function is defined as a fixed-coefficient linear combination of Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitives. An $s$-type GTO primitive centered at the nucleus has the form $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = N \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})$, where $\\alpha$ is the exponent and $N$ is the normalization constant. You wish to build one contracted $s$-type function intended to describe the carbon core orbital (the $1\\mathrm{s}$ shell) and one contracted function to describe the valence space (the $2\\mathrm{s}$ and $2\\mathrm{p}$ shells, ignoring angular dependence here and focusing on radial extent). You are given two candidate pools of exponents for $s$-type primitives:\n- Set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1000, 100, 10, 1\\}$,\n- Set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$.\nEach contracted function must be formed exclusively from primitives chosen within a single set (that is, the core contraction must draw only from one of $\\mathcal{A}$ or $\\mathcal{B}$, and the valence contraction must draw only from the other set). Based only on first principles concerning how the exponent $\\alpha$ controls the spatial extent of a GTO, which assignment is most appropriate for constructing a core versus a valence contracted function for carbon?\n\nA. Use $\\mathcal{A}$ for the core-contracted function and $\\mathcal{B}$ for the valence-contracted function, because larger $\\alpha$ values produce tighter primitives suitable for core and smaller $\\alpha$ values produce more diffuse primitives suitable for valence.\n\nB. Use $\\mathcal{B}$ for the core-contracted function and $\\mathcal{A}$ for the valence-contracted function, because smaller $\\alpha$ values produce tighter primitives suitable for core and larger $\\alpha$ values produce more diffuse primitives suitable for valence.\n\nC. Either set can be used for either purpose with no preference; after contraction, coefficients can arbitrarily control spatial extent regardless of the exponents present.\n\nD. Use $\\mathcal{B}$ for both core and valence, because core and valence orbitals are both outside the nucleus and thus require only diffuse primitives, while very large exponents in $\\mathcal{A}$ are unnecessary for carbon.",
            "solution": "The problem requires assigning exponent sets to the core and valence orbitals of carbon based on the properties of Gaussian functions, $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$.\n\nThe exponent $\\alpha$ determines the spatial extent of the Gaussian. A large $\\alpha$ value results in a \"tight\" function that decays rapidly and is concentrated near the nucleus. A small $\\alpha$ value results in a \"diffuse\" function that is spatially extended.\n\nAtomic orbitals have distinct spatial characteristics:\n- **Core orbitals** (e.g., carbon's $1s$) are tightly bound and close to the nucleus. They are best described by tight primitives with large exponents.\n- **Valence orbitals** (e.g., carbon's $2s, 2p$) are more diffuse and extend further from the nucleus. They are best described by diffuse primitives with smaller exponents.\n\nComparing the exponent sets:\n- Set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1000, 100, 10, 1\\}$ contains large exponents, making it suitable for the tight core orbital.\n- Set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$ contains smaller exponents, making it suitable for the more diffuse valence orbitals.\n\nTherefore, Set $\\mathcal{A}$ should be used for the core and Set $\\mathcal{B}$ for the valence. Option A correctly states this assignment and the underlying reasoning. The other options are incorrect: B reverses the logic, C incorrectly dismisses the importance of exponents, and D incorrectly claims tight functions are unnecessary for describing the core orbital.",
