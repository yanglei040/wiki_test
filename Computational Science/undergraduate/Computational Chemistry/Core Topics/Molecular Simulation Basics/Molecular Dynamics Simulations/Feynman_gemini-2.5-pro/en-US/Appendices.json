            "introduction": "Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations typically model macroscopic systems by simulating a small, representative volume known as the simulation box. To avoid unrealistic surface effects from such a small system, we employ Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), where the box is imagined to be surrounded by identical copies of itself, creating an infinite periodic lattice. This practice  challenges you to implement the most fundamental consequence of PBC, the Minimum Image Convention (MIC), which ensures that the interaction between any two particles is correctly calculated based on the shortest possible distance between them in this periodic space. Mastering this concept is an essential first step in building or understanding any MD simulation program.",

            "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that demonstrates the effect of the minimum image convention for periodic boundary conditions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The program must compute the Euclidean distance between two particles in an orthorhombic periodic simulation box in two ways: (1) the naive Euclidean distance that ignores periodicity, and (2) the Euclidean distance after applying the minimum image convention. Distances must be expressed in nanometers (nm) and reported rounded to exactly six decimal places.\n\nBackground and fundamental base: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), an infinite tiling of the finite simulation box is used to mimic bulk behavior. The physical distance between two particles is interpreted as the minimum distance between one particle and any periodic image of the other. The underlying geometric rule is derived from the definition of Euclidean distance and the translation symmetry of the lattice. For an orthorhombic box with side lengths $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$, the minimum distance is obtained by selecting an integer number of box-length translations along each axis that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the displacement vector. Your program must implement this rule.\n\nYour task:\n- Define a function that, given two $3$-dimensional positions $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\\mathbf{r}_j$ in nanometers and box lengths $(L_x,L_y,L_z)$ in nanometers, returns two values:\n  1) the naive Euclidean distance $d_{\\text{naive}} = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i \\rVert$ in nm,\n  2) the minimum image convention distance $d_{\\text{mic}}$ in nm, obtained by translating the displacement components by integer multiples of $(L_x,L_y,L_z)$ to minimize the norm.\n- Treat the box as orthorhombic and axis-aligned.\n- Positions may lie outside the primary box interval. Your implementation must still correctly compute $d_{\\text{mic}}$ using periodicity.\n- To make your implementation clear, also include within the program a multi-line pseudocode string (not printed) that outlines the minimum image convention logic you implemented.\n\nNumerical and unit requirements:\n- All distances must be in nanometers (nm).\n- Report distances rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nYour program must compute $[d_{\\text{naive}}, d_{\\text{mic}}]$ for each of the following $5$ test cases, in the stated order.\n\n1) Happy path, small separation well within the box:\n- Box: $(L_x,L_y,L_z) = (\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\,0.5\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.5\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_j = (\\,0.7\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.2\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.6\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n\n2) Crossing a periodic boundary along one axis:\n- Box: $(L_x,L_y,L_z) = (\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\,0.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_j = (\\,2.9\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,1.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n\n3) Anisotropic box and wrapping along multiple axes:\n- Box: $(L_x,L_y,L_z) = (\\,2.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,4.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,5.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\,1.9\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.2\\,\\text{nm},\\,4.8\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_j = (\\,0.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.9\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.3\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n\n4) Exactly half-box separation along one axis (tie case):\n- Box: $(L_x,L_y,L_z) = (\\,4.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,4.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,4.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\,0.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_j = (\\,2.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,0.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n\n5) Positions outside the primary box interval:\n- Box: $(L_x,L_y,L_z) = (\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.0\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\,{-}0.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,{-}0.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,{-}0.1\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n- $\\mathbf{r}_j = (\\,3.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.1\\,\\text{nm},\\,3.1\\,\\text{nm}\\,)$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of pairs enclosed in square brackets.

There must be no spaces in the output.\n- For example, the required overall format is like $[[a_1,b_1],[a_2,b_2],\\dots]$ where each $a_k$ and $b_k$ are floats in nanometers with exactly $6$ decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem posed is a fundamental exercise in computational statistical mechanics, specifically concerning the implementation of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The use of PBC is a standard and necessary technique to approximate the properties of a macroscopic system by simulating a small, finite number of particles. It mitigates the severe surface effects that would otherwise dominate the behavior of a small system. The core of this problem is the correct calculation of inter-particle distances, which is governed by the minimum image convention (MIC).\n\nThe problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary data for a unique and verifiable solution. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation and implementation.\n\nLet the orthorhombic simulation box be defined by a set of three orthogonal vectors corresponding to the side lengths, $\\mathbf{L} = (L_x, L_y, L_z)$. The position of two particles, $i$ and $j$, are given by vectors $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\\mathbf{r}_j$.\n\nFirst, we define the naive Euclidean distance, $d_{\\text{naive}}$. This is the standard distance in a non-periodic, three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is calculated from the norm of the displacement vector $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i$.\n$$\nd_{\\text{naive}} = \\lVert \\Delta\\mathbf{r} \\rVert = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2 + (\\Delta z)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = (\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)$. This calculation ignores the periodic nature of the simulation box and treats the system as if it were isolated in a vacuum.\n\nSecond, we address the minimum image convention distance, $d_{\\text{mic}}$. In a periodic system, the simulation box is replicated infinitely in all directions. A particle at position $\\mathbf{r}$ has an infinite lattice of periodic images at positions $\\mathbf{r} + n_x L_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_y L_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_z L_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are any integers. The physical distance between particle $i$ and particle $j$ is the shortest distance between particle $i$ and *any* of the periodic images of particle $j$.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nd_{\\text{mic}} = \\min_{n_x, n_y, n_z \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left\\lVert (\\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i) - (n_x L_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_y L_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_z L_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\right\\rVert\n$$\nFor an orthorhombic box, the minimization of the norm can be performed independently for each Cartesian component. Let us consider the $x$-component of the displacement vector, $\\Delta x = x_j - x_i$. We must find an integer $n_x$ that minimizes $|\\Delta x - n_x L_x|$. This is achieved when $n_x$ is the integer nearest to the ratio $\\Delta x / L_x$. This is the \"nearest integer function,\" often denoted as $\\text{nint}(s)$ or implemented via `round(s)`.\n\nThe MIC-adjusted displacement component, $\\Delta x'$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta x' = \\Delta x - L_x \\cdot \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{L_x}\\right)\n$$\nThis formula correctly \"wraps\" the displacement vector component into the interval $[-L_x/2, L_x/2]$. The same logic applies to the $y$ and $z$ components. The complete MIC-adjusted displacement vector, $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}'$, is then:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{r}' = \\left( \\Delta x - L_x \\cdot \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{L_x}\\right), \\Delta y - L_y \\cdot \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta y}{L_y}\\right), \\Delta z - L_z \\cdot \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta z}{L_z}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis vector operation is robust and correctly handles cases where particle coordinates may lie outside the primary simulation box, as only their relative displacement matters.\n\nThe minimum image distance, $d_{\\text{mic}}$, is the Euclidean norm of this adjusted displacement vector:\n$$\nd_{\\text{mic}} = \\lVert \\Delta\\mathbf{r}' \\rVert = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x')^2 + (\\Delta y')^2 + (\\Delta z')^2}\n$$\n\nThe provided test cases will be solved using this established methodology. The implementation will utilize the `numpy` library for efficient vector arithmetic. For each test case, we will compute $d_{\\text{naive}}$ and $d_{\\text{mic}}$ and report the results rounded to precisely $6$ decimal places as specified. The special case of a displacement of exactly half a box length, e.g., $\\Delta x = L_x/2$, is handled by the `round` function, which typically rounds to the nearest even integer (e.g., in `numpy`), but the resulting distance is uniquely $L_x/2$ regardless of the sign choice for the adjusted displacement. For $\\Delta x = L_x/2$, $\\Delta x' = L_x/2 - L_x \\cdot \\text{round}(0.5) = L_x/2 - L_x \\cdot 0 = L_x/2$. The magnitude is unambiguous.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a computational experiment to determine the stability limit of a numerical integration scheme for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which serves as a model for a stiff vibrational mode in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. It constitutes a direct test of numerical integration stability, a fundamental concept in computational science.\n\nThe system is described by the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\nm \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -k x(t)\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $k$ is the force constant, and $x(t)$ is the position. The angular frequency of this oscillator is $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$. The dynamics are to be propagated from initial conditions $x(0) = x_0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = v_0$ using a discrete time step $dt$.\n\nThe problem statement does not specify the numerical integration algorithm. For MD simulations of Newtonian mechanics, the Velocity-Verlet algorithm is a standard, widely-used, and robust choice due to its time-reversibility and symplectic nature, which leads to good long-term energy conservation properties. Therefore, the Velocity-Verlet integrator is the appropriate algorithm to implement.\n\nThe Velocity-Verlet algorithm consists of the following steps to advance the system from time $t$ to $t+dt$:\n1.  Compute the half-step velocity:\n    $$\n    v(t + \\tfrac{1}{2}dt) = v(t) + \\tfrac{1}{2} a(t) dt\n    $$\n2.

The acceleration is derived from the force $F(x) = -kx$, so $a(x) = F(x)/m = -(k/m)x$:\n    $$\n    a(t + dt) = -\\frac{k}{m} x(t + dt)\n    $$\n4.  Compute the full-step velocity at the new time:\n    $$\n    v(t + dt) = v(t + \\tfrac{1}{2}dt) + \\tfrac{1}{2} a(t + dt) dt\n    $$\n\nFor each test case, we are given a set of parameters $(m, k, x_0, v_0, T, \\varepsilon, B)$ and an ordered list of time steps $[dt_1, dt_2, \\dots]$. The task is to find the smallest $dt_i$ from this list for which the simulation becomes unstable or \"explodes.\" The simulation for a given $dt$ runs for a total time $T$, which corresponds to $N_{steps} = \\lfloor T/dt \\rfloor$ integration steps.\n\nBefore the simulation loop begins, we must establish the baseline for the explosion criteria. The initial total energy $E(0)$ is calculated as:\n$$\nE(0) = \\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x_0^2\n$$\nThe problem states that for all test cases, $x_0$, $v_0$, $m$, and $k$ are positive, ensuring $E(0) > 0$. The characteristic amplitude $A_0$ is then defined as:\n$$\nA_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E(0)}{k}}\n$$\nThis $A_0$ represents the maximum displacement in the exact analytical solution.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iterating the Velocity-Verlet algorithm for $N_{steps}$ times. After each step, we obtain the new state $(x(t+dt), v(t+dt))$ and check for the three explosion conditions:\n1.  **Finiteness of Energy**: The total energy at the new step, $E(t+dt) = \\frac{1}{2} m v(t+dt)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x(t+dt)^2$, must be a finite real number. Computationally, this is checked by verifying if the value is not `NaN` (Not a Number) or infinite. This condition detects catastrophic numerical overflow.\n2.  **Relative Energy Conservation**: The relative deviation of the current energy from the initial energy must not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\lvert E(t+dt) - E(0) \\rvert}{E(0)} > \\varepsilon\n    $$\n    This condition detects when the numerical integration error leads to a significant, unphysical drift in the total energy, even if the trajectory has not yet diverged to infinity.\n3.  **Position Bound**: The magnitude of the position must not exceed a large multiple of the characteristic amplitude.\n    $$\n    \\lvert x(t+dt) \\rvert > B \\cdot A_0\n    $$\n    This is another practical check for trajectory divergence, where the particle escapes to unphysically large distances from the potential minimum.\n\nThe overall procedure for each test case is as follows:\nIterate through the provided list of time steps $dt_i$, which are sorted in ascending order. For each $dt_i$:\n- Run a full simulation for time $T$.\n- At every step of the simulation, check the three explosion conditions.\n- If any condition is met at any point during the simulation, the simulation for this $dt_i$ is deemed unstable. This $dt_i$ is the result for the test case, and we proceed to the next test case.\n- If the simulation completes for $T$ without any explosion, this $dt_i$ is considered stable. We then proceed to test the next $dt_i$ in the list.\n\nIf all time steps in the list for a given test case result in stable simulations, the result for that test case is the sentinel value $-1.0$.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a primary function that iterates through the test cases. This function will call a sub-function for each test case, which in turn iterates through the provided $dt$ values and calls a simulation function.

            "introduction": "While Periodic Boundary Conditions help emulate a bulk environment, our simulations are still performed on a finite number of particles, which can introduce systematic errors known as finite-size artifacts. To deduce properties that are truly representative of the macroscopic system (the thermodynamic limit), it is essential to quantify and correct for these artifacts. This practice  will walk you through a standard and vital procedure in computational science: performing a finite-size scaling analysis to extrapolate a calculated property, such as the diffusion coefficient $D$, from a series of finite simulations to the infinite-system limit.",

The simulations are performed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. It is known that for such systems, the calculated diffusion coefficient, $D(L)$, depends on the side length $L$ of the simulation box due to finite-size effects. A well-established theoretical model predicts this dependence for large $L$ as:\n$$D(L) = D_\\infty - \\frac{k_{H}}{L}$$\nwhere $D_\\infty$ is the true diffusion coefficient in the thermodynamic limit (an infinitely large system), and $k_{H}$ is a constant that depends on the fluid's properties.\n\nTo find $D_\\infty$, the researcher runs three simulations with different numbers of particles, $N$, while keeping the number density $\\rho$ constant at $0.80 \\, \\sigma_0^{-3}$, where $\\sigma_0$ is a characteristic length unit. The measured diffusion coefficients, in units of $\\sigma_0^2/\\tau_0$ where $\\tau_0$ is a characteristic time unit, are recorded as follows:\n\n| Simulation | Number of Particles ($N$) | Measured Diffusion Coefficient ($D/\\left(\\sigma_0^2/\\tau_0\\right)$) |\n|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1          | 256                       | 1.05                                                     |\n| 2          | 512                       | 1.34                                                     |\n| 3          | 1000                      | 1.56                                                     |\n\nUsing the provided data and the theoretical model, determine the best estimate for the true diffusion coefficient, $D_\\infty$.
