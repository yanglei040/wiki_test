            "problem": "Consider a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) composed of identical Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). Each SM has finite hardware resources: a register file of capacity $R_{\\mathrm{SM}}$ (counted as the number of $32$-bit registers), a shared memory capacity of $S_{\\mathrm{SM}}$ bytes, a thread slot capacity of $T_{\\mathrm{SM}}$ threads, and an architectural limit of at most $B_{\\max}$ resident blocks at any time. A thread block with $b$ threads consumes registers because each thread uses $r$ registers, and it consumes shared memory because each block allocates $s$ bytes in shared memory. The basic constraints are: the total registers used by all resident blocks on an SM cannot exceed $R_{\\mathrm{SM}}$, the total shared memory used cannot exceed $S_{\\mathrm{SM}}$, the total threads cannot exceed $T_{\\mathrm{SM}}$, and the number of blocks cannot exceed $B_{\\max}$. All counts are integers, and an SM schedules whole blocks only. Occupancy is the fraction of thread slots on an SM that are filled by resident threads and is defined as the number of resident threads divided by $T_{\\mathrm{SM}}$, with the understanding that it cannot exceed $1$.\n\nYou are given a specific GPU with $R_{\\mathrm{SM}}=65536$, $S_{\\mathrm{SM}}=98304\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$, $T_{\\mathrm{SM}}=2048$, and $B_{\\max}=16$.

It is a well-defined computational problem in the domain of computational science.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the maximum number of blocks, $N$, that can be concurrently resident on a single SM for each kernel. This number is constrained by the SM's finite resources. Since an SM can only schedule whole blocks, the maximum number of blocks supported by each resource limit is the floor of the ratio of total resource capacity to the per-block resource consumption. The overall maximum number of resident blocks, $N$, is the minimum of these individual limits.\n\nFor a kernel with $b$ threads per block, $r$ registers per thread, and $s$ bytes of shared memory per block, the maximum number of blocks, $N$, is given by:\n$N = \\min( N_{\\text{reg}}, N_{\\text{smem}}, N_{\\text{thread}}, N_{\\text{block}} )$\nwhere:\n- $N_{\\text{reg}} = \\lfloor \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{SM}}}{b \\times r} \\rfloor$ (limit from registers)\n- $N_{\\text{smem}} = \\lfloor \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{SM}}}{s} \\rfloor$ (limit from shared memory)\n- $N_{\\text{thread}} = \\lfloor \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{SM}}}{b} \\rfloor$ (limit from thread slots)\n- $N_{\\text{block}} = B_{\\max}$ (architectural limit on blocks)\n\nOnce $N$ is found for each kernel, the occupancy can be calculated. The number of resident threads is $N \\times b$. Occupancy, $O$, is then:\n$O = \\frac{N \\times b}{T_{\\mathrm{SM}}}$\n\nFinally, the runtime ratio is derived from the performance model.\nRuntime $\\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{Throughput}}$ and Throughput $\\propto O$.\nTherefore, Runtime $\\propto \\frac{1}{O}$.\nThe ratio of runtimes is $\\frac{\\text{runtime}_A}{\\text{runtime}_B} = \\frac{1/O_A}{1/O_B} = \\frac{O_B}{O_A}$.\n\n**Analysis for Kernel A**\n- Parameters: $r_A=64$, $s_A=12288$, $b_A=256$.\n- SM limits: $R_{\\mathrm{SM}}=65536$, $S_{\\mathrm{SM}}=98304$, $T_{\\mathrm{SM}}=2048$, $B_{\\max}=16$.\n\n1.

            "problem": "A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) executes memory operations in warps of $32$ threads. Global memory is served in fixed-size segments of $128$ bytes, and a warp generates exactly one memory transaction for each distinct $128$-byte segment that contains any byte of the warp’s requested words. Consider a kernel where each thread in a warp loads a single $4$-byte floating-point value from an array in global memory. The address accessed by thread $t \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,31\\}$ is\n$$\nA(t) \\;=\\; A_{0} \\;+\\; \\delta \\;+\\; t \\, s \\, b,\n$$\nwhere $A_{0}$ is aligned to a $128$-byte boundary, $\\delta$ is the byte offset from that boundary, $s$ is the stride in elements between consecutive threads, and $b=4$ bytes is the element size.

Express the final padding in bytes. No rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal non-negative padding $p$ required to align the starting address of a memory access pattern to a $128$-byte segment boundary, and to determine the number of memory transactions both with and without this padding.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information. A warp consists of $32$ threads, indexed by $t \\in \\{0,\n1, \\ldots, 31\\}$. Each thread accesses a $4$-byte word. The memory segment size is $128$ bytes. The starting byte address accessed by thread $t$ is given by the function:\n$$A(t) = A_0 + \\delta + t \\cdot s \\cdot b$$\nwhere $A_0$ is a base address aligned to a $128$-byte boundary (i.e., $A_0 \\pmod{128} = 0$), $\\delta$ is an initial byte offset, $s$ is the stride in elements, and $b=4$ bytes is the size of one element. A memory transaction is generated for each unique $128$-byte segment accessed by any thread in the warp. The segment containing a byte at address $A$ is identified by the index $\\lfloor A / 128 \\rfloor$.\n\nThe specific parameters for the initial case are $s=3$ and $\\delta=44$ bytes. The address accessed by thread $t$ is therefore:\n$$A(t) = A_0 + 44 + t \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = A_0 + 44 + 12t$$\nSince $A_0$ is aligned to a $128$-byte boundary, the segment index for address $A(t)$ is $\\lfloor (A_0 + 44 + 12t) / 128 \\rfloor = A_0/128 + \\lfloor (44 + 12t) / 128 \\rfloor$. The constant term $A_0/128$ merely shifts all segment indices by an integer amount and does not affect the number of unique segments accessed. We can therefore analyze the memory access pattern by considering the addresses relative to $A_0$, which we denote by $A_{rel}(t) = 44 + 12t$.\n\nTo find the number of transactions, we must determine the number of unique segment indices, $\\lfloor A_{rel}(t) / 128 \\rfloor$, for $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 31\\}$.\nThe first thread ($t=0$) accesses the address $A_{rel}(0) = 44 + 12(0) = 44$.\nThe segment index for this access is $\\lfloor 44 / 128 \\rfloor = 0$.\n\nThe last thread ($t=31$) accesses the address $A_{rel}(31) = 44 + 12(31) = 44 + 372 = 416$.\nThe segment index for this access is $\\lfloor 416 / 128 \\rfloor = 3$.\n\nThe addresses accessed by the warp are monotonic, starting from $44$ and increasing with a step of $12$ bytes between consecutive threads. Since the stride in bytes ($12$) is less than the segment size ($128$), the threads will access all intermediate segments between the first and last segment. Therefore, the total number of unique segments accessed is the difference between the last and first segment indices, plus one.\nNumber of transactions = $(\\text{last segment index}) - (\\text{first segment index}) + 1 = 3 - 0 + 1 = 4$.\nSo, for the initial parameters, the warp generates $4$ memory transactions.\n\nNext, we must determine the minimal non-negative padding $p$ (in bytes) that must be added to the base address such that the first accessed address is aligned to a $128$-byte segment boundary. The new first address, for thread $t=0$, will be $A'(0) = A_0 + \\delta + p$.\nGiven $\\delta = 44$, the new first address is $A'(0) = A_0 + 44 + p$.\nFor $A'(0)$ to be aligned to a $128$-byte boundary, it must be a multiple of $128$.\n$$A_0 + 44 + p = k \\cdot 128$$\nfor some integer $k$. Since $A_0$ is already a multiple of $128$, we can write $A_0 = m \\cdot 128$ for some integer $m$.\n$$m \\cdot 128 + 44 + p = k \\cdot 128$$\n$$44 + p = (k-m) \\cdot 128$$\nLet $k' = k-m$. We need to find the smallest non-negative integer $p$ such that $44 + p = k' \\cdot 128$ for some integer $k'$.\nTo ensure $p \\ge 0$, we require $k' \\cdot 128 \\ge 44$. Since $k'$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k'$ is $1$.\nFor $k' = 1$, we have:\n$$44 + p = 128 \\implies p = 128 - 44 = 84$$\nThe minimal non-negative padding required is $p=84$ bytes.\n\nFinally, we recompute the number of memory transactions with this padding. The new offset is $\\delta' = \\delta + p = 44 + 84 = 128$.\nThe new address function, relative to $A_0$, is:\n$$A'_{rel}(t) = \\delta' + t \\cdot s \\cdot b = 128 + t \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 128 + 12t$$\nThe first thread ($t=0$) now accesses $A'_{rel}(0) = 128$. The segment index is $\\lfloor 128 / 128 \\rfloor = 1$.\nThe last thread ($t=31$) accesses $A'_{rel}(31) = 128 + 12(31) = 128 + 372 = 500$. The segment index is $\\lfloor 500 / 128 \\rfloor = 3$.\nThe number of transactions is again the difference in segment indices plus one:\nNumber of transactions = $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.\nBy adding the padding of $84$ bytes, the number of memory transactions is reduced from $4$ to $3$, improving memory access efficiency.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal padding amount $p$. Based on our calculation, this value is $84$.",

The critical path consists of a sequence of additions and barrier synchronizations.\n    - A thread on the critical path first waits at an initial barrier: cost $T_{\\text{sync}}$.\n    - It then participates in $\\log_2(B)$ levels of reduction. Each level involves one addition followed by a barrier. The cost of each level for a thread on the critical path is $T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}}$.\n    The total span is the sum of these sequential costs:\n    $$S_1 = T_{\\text{sync}} (\\text{initial}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\log_2(B)} (T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}})$$\n    $$S_1 = T_{\\text{sync}} + \\log_2(B) \\cdot (T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}})$$\n    $$S_1 = (\\log_2(B)) T_{\\text{add}} + (1 + \\log_2(B)) T_{\\text{sync}}$$\n\n3.  **Number of Block-Level Barriers ($N_{\\text{sync},1}$)**: As per the derivation, there is one initial barrier and one for each of the $\\log_2(B)$ reduction levels.\n    $$N_{\\text{sync},1} = 1 + \\log_2(B)$$\n\n4.  **Peak Shared Memory Footprint ($M_1$)**: The strategy requires all $B$ initial values to be stored in shared memory at the beginning of the reduction. This is the point of maximum memory usage.\n    $$M_1 = B \\text{ slots}$$\n\n**Strategy 2: Warp-Centric Reduction**\n\n1.  **Work ($W_2$)**: The total number of additions remains $B-1$. The work is $W_2 = (B-1) T_{\\text{add}}$.\n\n2.  **Span ($S_2$)**: The span is the sum of the spans of its three sequential phases.\n    - **Phase 1: Intra-warp reductions.** All $B/W$ warps operate in parallel. Each warp reduces $W$ values to one partial sum. This requires $\\log_2(W)$ sequential additions using warp-synchronous operations (e.g., shuffles), which do not incur the $T_{\\text{sync}}$ cost. The span of this phase is determined by a single warp's reduction time.\n      Span (Phase 1) = $(\\log_2(W)) T_{\\text{add}}$.\n    - **Phase 2: Block-level synchronization.** The $B/W$ partial sums are written to shared memory. A single block-level barrier is then called to ensure all these writes are visible to all threads.\n      Span (Phase 2) = $T_{\\text{sync}}$.\n    - **Phase 3: Final reduction.** A single warp reads the $B/W$ partial sums from shared memory and reduces them to the final value. This reduction takes $\\log_2(B/W)$ sequential steps using warp-synchronous operations.\n      Span (Phase 3) = $(\\log_2(B/W)) T_{\\text{add}}$.\n    The total span $S_2$ is the sum of the spans of these three phases:\n    $$S_2 = (\\log_2(W)) T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}} + (\\log_2(B/W)) T_{\\text{add}}$$\n    Using the logarithm property $\\log(a) + \\log(b) = \\log(ab)$, we simplify:\n    $$S_2 = (\\log_2(W) + \\log_2(B/W)) T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}}$$\n    $$S_2 = (\\log_2(B)) T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}}$$\n\n3.  **Number of Block-Level Barriers ($N_{\\text{sync},2}$)**: The strategy explicitly uses only one such barrier.\n    $$N_{\\text{sync},2} = 1$$\n\n4.  **Peak Shared Memory Footprint ($M_2$)**: Shared memory is used only to store the intermediate partial sums from each warp. There are $B/W$ such sums.\n    $$M_2 = B/W \\text{ slots}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we substitute the given values: $B=256$, $W=32$, $T_{\\text{add}}=4$ cycles, and $T_{\\text{sync}}=80$ cycles.\n\nFirst, we find the values of the logarithms:\n- $\\log_2(B) = \\log_2(256) = \\log_2(2^8) = 8$.\n- $\\log_2(W) = \\log_2(32) = \\log_2(2^5) = 5$.\n- $\\log_2(B/W) = \\log_2(256/32) = \\log_2(8) = 3$.\n\n**Summary of derived quantities:**\n\n| Metric                      | Strategy 1 (Symbolic)                                           | Strategy 1 (Numerical)                          | Strategy 2 (Symbolic)                            | Strategy 2 (Numerical)                    |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Span                        | $(\\log_2 B) T_{\\text{add}} + (1+\\log_2 B) T_{\\text{sync}}$        | $8 \\cdot 4 + (1+8) \\cdot 80 = 752$ cycles       | $(\\log_2 B) T_{\\text{add}} + T_{\\text{sync}}$     | $8 \\cdot 4 + 80 = 112$ cycles             |\n| Num.
