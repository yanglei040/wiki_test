            "introduction": "The Gauss-Seidel method is best understood by visualizing its iterative nature as a journey on a coordinate plane. Each iteration represents a step toward the system's solution, with each component update corresponding to a movement parallel to a coordinate axis. This first practice invites you to calculate the first two points in this sequence, providing a tangible sense of how the approximation refines itself from a starting guess. ",
