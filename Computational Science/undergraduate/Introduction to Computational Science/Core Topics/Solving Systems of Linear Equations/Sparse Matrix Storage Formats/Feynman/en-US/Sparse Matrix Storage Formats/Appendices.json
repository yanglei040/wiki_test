The Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format is a common method for storing sparse matrices by using three one-dimensional arrays.\n\nConsider a sparse matrix $A$ of size $4 \\times 4$. In the CSR format (using 0-based indexing), this matrix is represented by the following three arrays:\n1.  An array `V` containing the non-zero elements of $A$, read row by row, from left to right.\n2.  An array `C` containing the column index for each corresponding element in `V`.\n3.  An array `R` (the row pointer) of size $m+1$ (where $m$ is the number of rows), where the $i$-th element indicates the index in `V` and `C` where the data for the $i$-th row begins.
