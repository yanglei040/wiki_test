They are particularly interested in estimating the maximum deceleration experienced by the probe, a critical parameter for structural design. The numerical algorithm they use to solve the equations of motion has a first-order global truncation error, meaning the error in the estimate is of order $O(h)$, where $h$ is the time step size used in the simulation.\n\nLet $D(h)$ be the estimated maximum deceleration when the simulation is run with a time step of $h$.\nThe team performs two simulations:\n1.  With a time step of $h_1 = 0.4$ seconds, they find the maximum deceleration to be $D(0.4) = 58.6$ $\\text{m/s}^2$.\n2.

            "problem": "Consider the initial value problem (IVP) for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) given by $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ with initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$. The forward Euler method arises from the fundamental definition of the derivative as the limit of a finite difference and the use of a first-order Taylor expansion. In practice, the forward Euler method updates an approximation $y_n$ to the exact solution $y(t_n)$ by advancing the solution in steps of size $h$ starting at $t_0$ and ending at a specified final time $T$, yielding an approximation at $T$ that we denote $y_h(T)$. The global discretization error of forward Euler is known to depend linearly on the step size $h$ under standard regularity assumptions on $f$ and $y(t)$.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Implement a function that computes $y_h(T)$ using the forward Euler method for any given function $f(t,y)$, initial condition $y_0$, initial time $t_0$, final time $T$, and uniform step size $h$, assuming $T - t_0$ is an integer multiple of $h$.\n2. Assume the Euler method’s approximation at $T$ has an asymptotic error expansion of the form $y_h(T) = y(T) + C h + D h^2 + O(h^3)$ for constants $C$ and $D$ that depend on $f$ and the solution but not on $h$. Using the outputs $y_h(T)$ and $y_{h/2}(T)$, derive a linear combination of these two approximations, with constant weights independent of $h$, that cancels the leading $O(h)$ error term and yields an $O(h^2)$-accurate estimate of $y(T)$. Then implement this Richardson extrapolation estimator in code.\n3. For each test case below, compute the absolute error $\\lvert y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) - y(T) \\rvert$, where $y_{\\text{extrap}}(T)$ is your extrapolated estimate and $y(T)$ is the exact solution at time $T$.\n\nUse the following test suite. In all cases, take $t_0 = 0$ and use the provided $h$ such that $(T - t_0)/h$ is an integer:\n\n- Test 1 (happy path, linear homogeneous ODE): $f(t,y) = y$, $y_0 = 1$, $T = 1$, $h = 0.2$. The exact solution is $y(t) = e^{t}$ evaluated at $t = T$.\n- Test 2 (linear nonhomogeneous ODE): $f(t,y) = y + t$, $y_0 = 0$, $T = 2$, $h = 0.4$. The exact solution is $y(t) = e^{t} - t - 1$ evaluated at $t = T$.\n- Test 3 (nonlinear logistic growth): $f(t,y) = r y \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{K}\\right)$ with parameters $r = 1$ and $K = 10$, $y_0 = 1$, $T = 3$, $h = 0.5$. The exact solution is $y(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + A e^{-r t}}$ with $A = \\frac{K - y_0}{y_0}$, evaluated at $t = T$.\n- Test 4 (edge case, zero derivative): $f(t,y) = 0$, $y_0 = 3$, $T = 1$, $h = 0.5$. The exact solution is the constant function $y(t) = 3$ evaluated at $t = T$.\n\nYour program should:\n- Implement the forward Euler method to compute $y_h(T)$ and $y_{h/2}(T)$ for each test case.\n- Implement the derived Richardson extrapolation estimator using the two approximations $y_h(T)$ and $y_{h/2}(T)$ to obtain an $O(h^2)$ estimate at $T$.\n- Compute and record the absolute error for each test case, rounded to ten decimal places.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[0.0123456789,0.0000001234,0.0012340000,0.0000000000]\"), where the entries are the absolute errors for Test 1 through Test 4, each rounded to ten decimal places.",

It specifies the ODEs, initial conditions, step sizes, final times, and the exact solutions for error comparison. The constraint that $(T - t_0)/h$ is an integer simplifies implementation and avoids ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\nThe solution is developed in three stages: first, the implementation of the forward Euler method; second, the derivation of the Richardson extrapolation formula; and third, the application of these methods to the specified test cases to compute the required errors.\n\n**1. The Forward Euler Method**\nThe forward Euler method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving an initial value problem of the form $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ with $y(t_0) = y_0$. It approximates the continuous solution $y(t)$ at discrete time points $t_n = t_0 + n h$, where $h$ is the step size. The method is derived from the first-order Taylor expansion of $y(t_{n+1})$ around $t_n$:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + h y'(t_n) + O(h^2) = y(t_n) + h f(t_n, y(t_n)) + O(h^2)$$\nBy ignoring the $O(h^2)$ term, we obtain the iterative formula for the approximation $y_n \\approx y(t_n)$:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)$$\nStarting with the initial condition $y_0$, we can apply this formula iteratively for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$ where $N = (T-t_0)/h$, to find an approximation $y_N \\approx y(T)$. This defines the function $y_h(T)$.\n\n**2. Richardson Extrapolation**\nRichardson extrapolation is a general technique for improving the accuracy of a numerical approximation. We are given that the approximation $y_h(T)$ from the forward Euler method has an asymptotic error expansion:\n$$y_h(T) = y(T) + C h + D h^2 + O(h^3)$$\nHere, $y(T)$ is the exact solution, and $C$ and $D$ are constants that depend on the function $f$ and its derivatives but not on the step size $h$.\n\nIf we compute the approximation again with a halved step size, $h/2$, the formula becomes:\n$$y_{h/2}(T) = y(T) + C \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) + D \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + O(h^3)$$\n$$y_{h/2}(T) = y(T) + \\frac{1}{2} C h + \\frac{1}{4} D h^2 + O(h^3)$$\nOur goal is to find a linear combination of $y_h(T)$ and $y_{h/2}(T)$, which we denote $y_{\\text{extrap}}(T)$, that provides a more accurate estimate of $y(T)$. Let $y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) = \\alpha y_h(T) + \\beta y_{h/2}(T)$. Substituting the error expansions:\n$$y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) = \\alpha \\left(y(T) + C h + D h^2\\right) + \\beta \\left(y(T) + \\frac{1}{2} C h + \\frac{1}{4} D h^2\\right) + O(h^3)$$\n$$y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) = (\\alpha + \\beta) y(T) + \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right) C h + \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\right) D h^2 + O(h^3)$$\nTo obtain an $O(h^2)$-accurate estimate for $y(T)$, we require the coefficient of $y(T)$ to be $1$ and the coefficient of the leading error term, $Ch$, to be $0$. This gives a system of two linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1. $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$\n2. $\\alpha + \\frac{\\beta}{2} = 0$\nFrom equation (2), we find $\\alpha = -\\beta/2$. Substituting this into equation (1) yields $-\\beta/2 + \\beta = 1$, which simplifies to $\\beta/2 = 1$, so $\\beta = 2$. Consequently, $\\alpha = -1$.\nThe extrapolated estimator is therefore:\n$$y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) = 2 y_{h/2}(T) - y_h(T)$$\nLet's verify the error of this new estimate:\n$$y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) - y(T) = (2 y_{h/2}(T) - y_h(T)) - y(T)$$\n$$= \\left(2\\left(y(T) + \\frac{1}{2}Ch + \\frac{1}{4}Dh^2\\right) - \\left(y(T) + Ch + Dh^2\\right)\\right) - y(T) + O(h^3)$$\n$$= (2y(T) + Ch + \\frac{1}{2}Dh^2) - y(T) - Ch - Dh^2 - y(T) + O(h^3)$$\n$$= (2-1-1)y(T) + (1-1)Ch + (\\frac{1}{2}-1)Dh^2 + O(h^3) = -\\frac{1}{2} D h^2 + O(h^3)$$\nThe error is indeed of order $h^2$, so the method successfully eliminates the leading error term.\n\n**3. Computational Procedure**\nFor each of the four test cases, the following algorithm is applied:\n1.  Define the function $f(t,y)$, initial conditions $y_0, t_0$, final time $T$, and step size $h$.\n2.  Implement a function `forward_euler(f, y0, t0, T, h)` that performs the iterative Euler updates and returns the final approximation at time $T$. The number of steps, $N$, is calculated as the integer `(T - t0) / h`.\n3.  Compute the approximation with the given step size $h$: $A_h = \\text{forward_euler}(f, y_0, t_0, T, h)$.\n4.  Compute the approximation with the halved step size $h/2$: $A_{h/2} = \\text{forward_euler}(f, y_0, t_0, T, h/2)$.\n5.  Calculate the Richardson extrapolated value: $y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) = 2 A_{h/2} - A_h$.\n6.  Calculate the exact solution $y(T)$ using the provided formula for the specific test case.\n7.  Compute the absolute error: $E = \\lvert y_{\\text{extrap}}(T) - y(T) \\rvert$.\n8.  The final result for the test case is this error, rounded to ten decimal places. This process is repeated for all test cases.",
