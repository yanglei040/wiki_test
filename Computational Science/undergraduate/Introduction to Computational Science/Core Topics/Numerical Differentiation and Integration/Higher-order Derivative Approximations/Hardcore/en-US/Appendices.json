            "solution": "The user wants to construct a central finite-difference approximation for the third derivative $f^{(3)}(x)$ with a truncation error of order $O(h^4)$, using a symmetric stencil on the points $\\{x \\pm h, x \\pm 2h, x \\pm 3h\\}$. The derivation must be based on Taylor's theorem.\n\nFirst, we perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The function $f$ is a scalar function with at least $7$ continuous derivatives near $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The grid is uniform with spacing $h > 0$.\n- The target is an approximation for the third derivative, $f^{(3)}(x)$.\n- The approximation method is a central finite-difference scheme.\n- The required truncation error is of order $O(h^4)$.\n- The stencil is symmetric and uses the sample points $\\{x \\pm h, x \\pm 2h, x \\pm 3h\\}$.\n- The derivation must start from Taylor's theorem.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in numerical analysis, concerning the derivation of finite-difference formulas. All concepts are well-established within mathematics and scientific computing. The requirement of $f$ having at least $7$ continuous derivatives is appropriate for an approximation with $O(h^4)$ error for the third derivative, as the leading error term is expected to involve $f^{(3+4)}(x) = f^{(7)}(x)$.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies the function's smoothness, the points in the stencil, the desired derivative, the type of scheme (central), and the order of accuracy. This information is sufficient to uniquely determine the coefficients of the finite-difference formula.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nWe seek a linear combination of the function values at the specified stencil points that approximates $f^{(3)}(x)$. For a central difference approximation of an odd-order derivative, the stencil must be anti-symmetric. That is, the coefficient of $f(x+kh)$ must be the negative of the coefficient of $f(x-kh)$. The point $f(x)$ itself is not included. The general form of the approximation is:\n$$\nf^{(3)}(x) \\approx D_h[f](x) = c_1(f(x+h) - f(x-h)) + c_2(f(x+2h) - f(x-2h)) + c_3(f(x+3h) - f(x-3h))\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ must be determined. We use Taylor's theorem to expand the function values around the point $x$. The function $f$ is assumed to have at least $7$ continuous derivatives, so we can write the Taylor series with a remainder term. For an integer $k$, the expansions are:\n$$\nf(x+kh) = f(x) + (kh)f'(x) + \\frac{(kh)^2}{2!}f''(x) + \\frac{(kh)^3}{3!}f^{(3)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^4}{4!}f^{(4)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^6}{6!}f^{(6)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^7}{7!}f^{(7)}(x) + O(h^8)\n$$\n$$\nf(x-kh) = f(x) - (kh)f'(x) + \\frac{(kh)^2}{2!}f''(x) - \\frac{(kh)^3}{3!}f^{(3)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^4}{4!}f^{(4)}(x) - \\frac{(kh)^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + \\frac{(kh)^6}{6!}f^{(6)}(x) - \\frac{(kh)^7}{7!}f^{(7)}(x) + O(h^8)\n$$\nBy subtracting the second expansion from the first, we obtain an expression for the difference terms:\n$$\nf(x+kh) - f(x-kh) = 2(kh)f'(x) + 2\\frac{(kh)^3}{3!}f^{(3)}(x) + 2\\frac{(kh)^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + 2\\frac{(kh)^7}{7!}f^{(7)}(x) + O(h^9)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the general form of our approximation $D_h[f](x)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nD_h[f](x) = & c_1 \\left( 2h f'(x) + \\frac{2h^3}{6}f^{(3)}(x) + \\frac{2h^5}{120}f^{(5)}(x) + \\frac{2h^7}{5040}f^{(7)}(x) + \\dots \\right) \\\\\n+ & c_2 \\left( 2(2h)f'(x) + \\frac{2(2h)^3}{6}f^{(3)}(x) + \\frac{2(2h)^5}{120}f^{(5)}(x) + \\frac{2(2h)^7}{5040}f^{(7)}(x) + \\dots \\right) \\\\\n+ & c_3 \\left( 2(3h)f'(x) + \\frac{2(3h)^3}{6}f^{(3)}(x) + \\frac{2(3h)^5}{120}f^{(5)}(x) + \\frac{2(3h)^7}{5040}f^{(7)}(x) + \\dots \\right)\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we group the terms by the derivatives of $f(x)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nD_h[f](x) = & f'(x) \\cdot \\left( 2h(c_1 + 2c_2 + 3c_3) \\right) \\\\\n+ & f^{(3)}(x) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3}(c_1 + 8c_2 + 27c_3) \\right) \\\\\n+ & f^{(5)}(x) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{h^5}{60}(c_1 + 32c_2 + 243c_3) \\right) \\\\\n+ & f^{(7)}(x) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{h^7}{2520}(c_1 + 128c_2 + 2187c_3) \\right) + \\dots\n\\end{align*}\nWe want the approximation $D_h[f](x)$ to be equal to $f^{(3)}(x)$ with a truncation error of order $O(h^4)$. This requires setting the coefficients of the derivative terms in the expansion of $D_h[f](x)$ to match those of $f^{(3)}(x)$. Specifically:\n1. The coefficient of $f'(x)$ must be $0$.\n2. The coefficient of $f^{(3)}(x)$ must be $1$.\n3. To achieve an error of $O(h^4)$, the coefficient of the leading error term, which is $O(h^2)$, must be $0$: $a_1 + 32a_2 + 243a_3 = 0$.\n\nLet's define the approximation as\n$$\nD_h[f](x) = \\frac{a_1(f(x+h) - f(x-h)) + a_2(f(x+2h) - f(x-2h)) + a_3(f(x+3h) - f(x-3h))}{h^3}\n$$\nThen the expansion is:\n\\begin{align*}\nD_h[f](x) = & \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[ f'(x) \\cdot 2h \\sum_{k=1}^3 k a_k + f^{(3)}(x) \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k^3 a_k + f^{(5)}(x) \\cdot \\frac{h^5}{60} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k^5 a_k + \\dots \\right] \\\\\n= & f'(x) \\cdot \\frac{2}{h^2} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k a_k + f^{(3)}(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k^3 a_k + f^{(5)}(x) \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{60} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k^5 a_k + O(h^4)\n\\end{align*}\nFor this to approximate $f^{(3)}(x)$, we require:\n1. Coeff of $f'(x)$ must be $0$: $a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 = 0$.\n2. Coeff of $f^{(3)}(x)$ must be $1$: $\\frac{1}{3}(a_1 + 8a_2 + 27a_3) = 1 \\implies a_1 + 8a_2 + 27a_3 = 3$.\n3. For an error of $O(h^4)$, the coefficient of the leading error term, which is $O(h^2)$, must be $0$: $a_1 + 32a_2 + 243a_3 = 0$.\n\nThis gives a system of three linear equations for the coefficients $a_1, a_2, a_3$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 8 & 27 \\\\ 1 & 32 & 243 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe solve this system using row reduction on the augmented matrix:\n$$\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 8 & 27 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 32 & 243 & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]\n\\xrightarrow[R_3 \\to R_3 - R_1]{R_2 \\to R_2 - R_1}\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 6 & 24 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 30 & 240 & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the second row by dividing by $3$ and the third row by dividing by $30$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 8 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 8 & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]\n$$\nFrom the last row, we have $a_2 + 8a_3 = 0$, so $a_2 = -8a_3$.\nSubstituting this into the second row: $2(-8a_3) + 8a_3 = 1 \\implies -16a_3 + 8a_3 = 1 \\implies -8a_3 = 1$, which gives $a_3 = -1/8$.\nNow we find $a_2$: $a_2 = -8(-1/8) = 1$.\nFinally, from the first row: $a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 = 0 \\implies a_1 = -2a_2 - 3a_3$.\n$a_1 = -2(1) - 3(-1/8) = -2 + 3/8 = -16/8 + 3/8 = -13/8$.\n\nThe coefficients are $a_1 = -13/8$, $a_2 = 1$, and $a_3 = -1/8$.\nSubstituting these back into the formula for $D_h[f](x)$:\n$$\nf^{(3)}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[ -\\frac{13}{8}(f(x+h) - f(x-h)) + 1(f(x+2h) - f(x-2h)) - \\frac{1}{8}(f(x+3h) - f(x-3h)) \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain a cleaner expression, we factor out $1/8$:\n$$\nf^{(3)}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{8h^3} \\left[ -13(f(x+h) - f(x-h)) + 8(f(x+2h) - f(x-2h)) - (f(x+3h) - f(x-3h)) \\right]\n$$\nExpanding and collecting terms according to their displacement from $x$:\n$$\nf^{(3)}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{8h^3} [-f(x+3h) + 8f(x+2h) - 13f(x+h) + 13f(x-h) - 8f(x-2h) + f(x-3h)]\n$$\nThis is the desired finite-difference formula. The leading error term is given by the coefficient of $f^{(7)}(x)$ in the expansion of $D_h[f](x)$, which is $O(h^4)$, as required.\nThe error term is $E(h) = f^{(7)}(x) \\cdot \\frac{h^4}{2520} \\sum_{k=1}^3 k^7 a_k = \\frac{h^4 f^{(7)}(x)}{2520} (1^7 a_1 + 2^7 a_2 + 3^7 a_3) = \\frac{h^4 f^{(7)}(x)}{2520} (-\\frac{13}{8} + 128 - \\frac{2187}{8}) = \\frac{h^4 f^{(7)}(x)}{2520} (\\frac{-13+1024-2187}{8}) = \\frac{-1176}{20160}h^4 f^{(7)}(x) = -\\frac{7}{120}h^4 f^{(7)}(x)$.

We will compute its second and fourth derivatives, $f^{(2)}(x)$ and $f^{(4)}(x)$, by direct differentiation.

            "problem": "You are tasked with implementing and testing a general-purpose routine that generates exact finite difference weights for approximating a higher-order derivative using a given set of stencil nodes. The fundamental base for the derivation must be the Taylor series expansion of a smooth function and the induced moment conditions. Your implementation must solve a square linear system derived from the exactness conditions on polynomials, using exact rational arithmetic where possible.\n\nLet $f$ be a smooth function, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ a point, $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$ a step size, and let the stencil be given by distinct nodes $s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{n-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to construct weights $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1}$ such that the finite difference formula\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^p} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j \\, f(x + h s_j)\n$$\nexactly reproduces the $p$-th derivative $f^{(p)}(x)$ for all polynomials up to degree $n-1$.\n\nStarting from the Taylor series expansion\n$$\nf(x + h s_j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (h s_j)^k,\n$$\nimpose the polynomial exactness (moment) conditions for degrees $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k =\n\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } k \\neq p, \\\\\np!, & \\text{if } k = p.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThese conditions yield a linear system of $n$ equations in the $n$ unknowns $w_j$. The matrix of the system is a square Vandermonde-type matrix with entries $s_j^k$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct and solve the linear system for general derivative order $p$ and general stencil nodes $s_j$ that are all distinct.\n- Use exact rational arithmetic when nodes are integers, by operating in the rational number field via standard library facilities, so that the resulting weights are exact rational numbers. If an exact symbolic solve is not applicable (e.g., non-integer nodes), a floating-point solve is acceptable, but for this task all provided stencil nodes are integers.\n- Validate inputs and handle invalid configurations by raising or signaling an error in a controlled manner. Invalid cases include repeated stencil nodes and $p$ outside the range $0 \\leq p \\leq n-1$.\n\nTest suite specification:\nImplement the following test cases inside your program and aggregate the results according to the final output format requirement.\n\n1.

Numerical approximation accuracy for a smooth function using the forward fifth derivative weights. Using the weights from test case 3, set $x = 0$, $h = 10^{-3}$, and $f(x) = e^x$. Compute the absolute error of the approximation to $f^{(5)}(0)$, which equals $1$ for $f(x) = e^x$. Report the absolute error as a floating-point number.\n\n5. Polynomial exactness on a nonuniform stencil. Let $p = 2$, nodes $[-2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4]$ (six distinct integer nodes), $x = 0$, and $h = 0.1$. Use the generated weights to approximate the second derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 0$. Because the scheme is constructed to be exact for polynomials up to degree $n-1$, the result should be exactly $f^{(2)}(0) = 2$. Report a boolean indicating whether the absolute difference from $2$ is below $10^{-12}$.\n\n6. Invalid derivative order. Attempt to generate weights with nodes $[0, 1]$ and $p = 3$. Since $p \\geq n$ is invalid, the routine must signal an error. Report a boolean indicating whether the error was correctly detected.\n\n7. Duplicate nodes (singular system). Attempt to generate weights with nodes $[0, 0, 1]$ and $p = 1$. Since duplicate nodes yield a singular matrix, the routine must signal an error. Report a boolean indicating whether the error was correctly detected.\n\nFinal output format requirement:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the following order corresponding to the test suite above:\n1.

            "solution": "The objective is to determine the weights $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1}$ for a finite difference formula that approximates the $p$-th derivative of a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$ at a point $x$. The formula is given by:\n$$\nf^{(p)}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{h^p} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j f(x + h s_j)\n$$\nwhere $\\{s_j\\}_{j=0}^{n-1}$ is a stencil of $n$ distinct, dimensionless nodes, and $h$ is the step size. The method for deriving the weights is to require the formula to be exact for all polynomials up to degree $n-1$.\n\nWe begin with the Taylor series expansion of $f(x + \\Delta x)$ around the point $x$:\n$$\nf(x + \\Delta x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (\\Delta x)^k\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta x = h s_j$ for each node in the stencil, we have:\n$$\nf(x + h s_j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (h s_j)^k\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expansion into the summation part of the finite difference formula:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j f(x + h s_j) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (h s_j)^k \\right)\n$$\nAssuming uniform convergence allows for the interchange of the order of summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j f(x + h s_j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{h^k f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k \\right)\n$$\nThe full finite difference formula is intended to approximate $f^{(p)}(x)$, which means the right-hand side of the equation above, after being divided by $h^p$, should collapse to $f^{(p)}(x)$. This means we desire:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^p} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{h^k f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k \\right) = f^{(p)}(x)\n$$\nFor this equality to hold for an arbitrary function $f(x)$ (or more specifically, for its Taylor series representation), the coefficients of each derivative term $f^{(k)}(x)$ on the left-hand side must match the corresponding term on the right-hand side. The right-hand side only contains the $f^{(p)}(x)$ term. Therefore, the coefficient of $f^{(k)}(x)$ for $k \\neq p$ must be zero, and the coefficient of $f^{(p)}(x)$ must be $1$. This gives us the following conditions on the inner sum (the moments):\n- For $k = p$: The coefficient of $f^{(p)}(x)$ is $\\frac{1}{h^p} \\frac{h^p}{p!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^p \\right)$. We set this equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^p \\right) = 1 \\implies \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^p = p!\n$$\n- For $k \\neq p$: The coefficient of $f^{(k)}(x)$ is $\\frac{1}{h^p} \\frac{h^k}{k!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k \\right)$. We set this equal to $0$.\n$$\n\\frac{h^k}{h^p k!} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k \\right) = 0 \\implies \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j s_j^k = 0\n$$\nThese conditions are imposed for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. This provides a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown weights $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1}$. The system can be written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ns_0^0 & s_1^0 & \\dots & s_{n-1}^0 \\\\\ns_0^1 & s_1^1 & \\dots & s_{n-1}^1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\ns_0^{n-1} & s_1^{n-1} & \\dots & s_{n-1}^{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n, \\quad\n\\mathbf{w} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nw_0 \\\\\nw_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nw_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n, \\quad\n\\mathbf{b} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\np! \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is a Vandermonde matrix. Its determinant is non-zero if and only if all the nodes $s_j$ are distinct. The problem statement guarantees this for valid inputs, ensuring a unique solution for the weights $\\mathbf{w}$. The vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is a zero vector except for the entry at index $p$ (the $(p+1)$-th row), which is $p!$.\n\nThe problem states that the input stencil nodes are integers. To obtain exact weights, the linear system must be solved using rational arithmetic. This involves constructing the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ with rational numbers and using an algorithm like Gaussian elimination that operates on the field of rational numbers. Python's `fractions` module provides the necessary tools for this.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a primary routine that validates the inputs, constructs the linear system, and solves it.\nInput validation must ensure two conditions:\n1. All stencil nodes $s_j$ must be distinct. If `len(set(s))` is not equal to `len(s)`, the Vandermonde matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is singular, and a unique solution does not exist.\n2. The order of the derivative $p$ must be in the range $0 \\leq p < n$, where $n$ is the number of stencil points. This is because $n$ points can uniquely define a polynomial of degree up to $n-1$, and these $n$ constraints are used to determine the $n$ weights. It is not possible to satisfy the moment conditions for a derivative order $p \\geq n$.\n\nFor valid inputs, the procedure is as follows:\n1. Define $n$ as the number of nodes in the stencil $s$.\n2. Construct the $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ where $A_{kj} = s_j^k$ for $k, j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Each element is represented as a rational number.\n3. Construct the $n \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{b}$ where $b_k = 0$ for $k \\neq p$ and $b_p = p!$. Each element is also a rational number.\n4. Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{b}$ for $\\mathbf{w}$ using a rational arithmetic-based linear solver, such as Gaussian elimination with back substitution.\nThe resulting vector $\\mathbf{w}$ will contain the exact rational weights for the specified finite difference scheme. These weights are then used to perform the calculations required by the test suite.",
