The goal is to leverage array operations to advance thousands of independent initial value problems simultaneously without writing per-equation loops.\n\nThe fundamental base is the definition of an initial value problem and the derivative. An initial value problem specifies a function $y(t)$ satisfying a differential equation and an initial condition: $y'(t) = f(t,y(t))$ with $y(0) = y_0$. The derivative is defined as $y'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}$.

All concepts are fundamental to calculus and numerical analysis.\n- **Well-Posed**: Each initial value problem specified has a unique solution. The parameters and initial conditions for all test cases are clearly defined, ensuring a unique and computable result. The problem of evaluating a numerical method (including in regimes of instability, as in case 3) is a standard and well-posed task in scientific computing.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and definitions. The requirements are quantitative and verifiable. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally specified, and objective. The test cases are well-designed to verify different aspects of the implementation, such as handling of parameter variations, the special case $a_i=0$, and numerical stability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of a vectorized explicit Euler solver for a system of $N$ independent linear ordinary differential equations. The core principle is to replace loops over individual equations with array operations, which is significantly more efficient in computational environments like `NumPy`.\n\nThe family of ODEs is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d y_i}{d t} = a_i y_i + b_i, \\quad y_i(0) = y_{0,i}\n$$\nIn vector notation, where $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [y_0(t), y_1(t), \\dots, y_{N-1}(t)]^T$ and similarly for $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{y}_0$, the system can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{y}}{d t} = \\mathbf{a} \\odot \\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{b}\n$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product.\n\nThe explicit Euler method approximates the solution at the next time step, $t_{k+1} = t_k + h$, using a first-order Taylor expansion around the current time $t_k$:\n$$\ny(t_{k+1}) \\approx y(t_k) + h \\frac{d y}{d t}\\bigg|_{t_k}\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{y}^k$ be the numerical approximation of $\\mathbf{y}(t_k)$. Substituting the ODE system into the Taylor approximation gives the update rule for the entire vector of solutions:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^{k+1} = \\mathbf{y}^k + h (\\mathbf{a} \\odot \\mathbf{y}^k + \\mathbf{b})\n$$\nThis update is performed in a loop for $M = T/h$ time steps, starting from the initial condition vector $\\mathbf{y}^0 = \\mathbf{y}_0$. This approach is fully vectorized and avoids any explicit loops over the index $i$.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the numerical solution, we compare it against the exact analytical solution at the final time $T$. The problem provides the closed-form solutions, which depend on whether $a_i$ is zero.\nFor $a_i \\neq 0$:\n$$\ny_i^{\\ast}(T) = \\left(y_{0,i} + \\frac{b_i}{a_i}\\right) e^{a_i T} - \\frac{b_i}{a_i}\n$$\nFor $a_i = 0$, the ODE simplifies to $\\frac{d y_i}{d t} = b_i$, which integrates to:\n$$\ny_i^{\\ast}(T) = y_{0,i} + b_i T\n$$\nIn a vectorized implementation, these two cases must be handled correctly without disrupting the array-based computation. This is efficiently achieved using conditional array operations, such as `numpy.where`, which selects elements from two arrays based on a boolean condition, thereby avoiding division by zero where $a_i=0$.\n\nThe final step for each test case is to compute the absolute error vector, $\\mathbf{e} = |\\mathbf{y}^{E}(T) - \\mathbf{y}^{\\ast}(T)|$, and then aggregate its components as specified, either by taking the maximum value or the mean value.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a main function that iterates through the four test cases. A helper function will be designed to perform the computation for a single case, which involves:\n1.  Generating the parameter vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{y}_0$ based on the case-specific rules.\n2.  Initializing the solution vector $\\mathbf{y}$ with $\\mathbf{y}_0$.\n3.  Iterating $M$ times, applying the vectorized Euler update at each step.\n4.  Computing the exact solution vector $\\mathbf{y}^{\\ast}(T)$ using conditional logic for the $a_i=0$ case.\n5.  Calculating the error vector and the required aggregate metric.\n\nA notable aspect is Test Case 3, where $a_i = -10$ and $h = 0.25$. For the explicit Euler method, the stability condition for an equation $y' = \\lambda y$ with $\\lambda < 0$ is $|1 + h\\lambda| \\le 1$, which simplifies to $h\\lambda \\ge -2$. In this case, $h a_i = 0.25 \\times (-10) = -2.5$, which violates the stability condition. We expect the numerical solution to exhibit large, oscillating errors, a correct and important observation about the limitations of the method. The algorithm must still compute this unstable result as requested.",
