The goal is to demonstrate, through computation, that high-degree polynomial interpolation at equally spaced nodes can fail not only for the classical example $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+25x^2}$ but across a range of $\\alpha$ values, and to contrast this with the behavior at Chebyshev nodes. The investigation must start from fundamental definitions of polynomial interpolation and the sup norm of the interpolation error and must avoid any pre-specified shortcut formulas.\n\nDefinitions and setup:\n- Let $n$ denote the polynomial degree. For a given $n$, define $n+1$ interpolation nodes $x_k$.\n- For equispaced nodes, set $x_k=-1+\\frac{2k}{n}$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,n$.\n- For Chebyshev nodes of the first kind on $[-1,1]$, set $x_k=\\cos\\left(\\frac{2k+1}{2(n+1)}\\pi\\right)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,n$.\n- Given nodes $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^n$ and samples $y_k=f_{\\alpha}(x_k)$, let $p_{n,\\alpha}(x)$ denote the unique polynomial of degree at most $n$ that interpolates $f_{\\alpha}(x)$ at these nodes, meaning $p_{n,\\alpha}(x_k)=y_k$ for all $k$.\n- For a fixed $\\alpha$ and $n$, define the maximum absolute interpolation error on a dense grid $G$ of $1001$ points in $[-1,1]$ as $E_{n,\\alpha}=\\max_{x \\in G}\\left|p_{n,\\alpha}(x)-f_{\\alpha}(x)\\right|$, where $G=\\left\\{-1+\\frac{2j}{1000}\\mid j=0,1,\\dots,1000\\right\\}$.\n\nYour tasks:\n1.

Using the failure threshold $\\tau=0.05$, define, for each $\\alpha$, the smallest degree $n \\in S$ such that $E_{n,\\alpha}>\\tau$. If no degree in $S$ yields $E_{n,\\alpha}>\\tau$, report $-1$ for that $\\alpha$. This produces six integers corresponding to the six values of $\\alpha$ in the order given.\n2. Chebyshev comparison at high degree.

            "solution": "The user requests an investigation of Runge's phenomenon for a family of functions, $f_{\\alpha}(x) = \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha x^2}$, by computing polynomial interpolation errors and comparing the performance of equispaced nodes versus Chebyshev nodes.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical analysis, specifically polynomial interpolation theory. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and the tasks are verifiable computational procedures.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\nFirst, we establish the method for constructing and evaluating the interpolating polynomial. Given a set of $n+1$ distinct nodes $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^n$ and corresponding function values $\\{y_k = f_{\\alpha}(x_k)\\}_{k=0}^n$, there exists a unique interpolating polynomial $p_{n,\\alpha}(x)$ of degree at most $n$. While this can be expressed using the Lagrange basis, $p_{n,\\alpha}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n y_k L_k(x)$, direct evaluation is often inefficient and numerically unstable. A superior method for evaluation is the second barycentric interpolation formula:\n$$\np_{n,\\alpha}(x) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{w_k}{x-x_k} y_k}{\\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{w_k}{x-x_k}}\n$$\nThis formula holds for any $x$ that is not an interpolation node. If $x = x_j$ for some node $j$, the value of the polynomial is simply $y_j$. The barycentric weights, $w_k$, depend only on the set of nodes and are defined as:\n$$\nw_k = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{j=0, j \\neq k}^n (x_k - x_j)}\n$$\nAny constant multiple of these weights can also be used, as the formula is homogeneous in $w_k$.\n\nThe choice of interpolation nodes is critical. Runge's phenomenon describes the failure of convergence for high-degree polynomial interpolation, particularly when using equispaced nodes on a fixed interval for certain analytic functions. The error tends to grow unboundedly near the endpoints of the interval. Using nodes clustered near the endpoints, such as Chebyshev nodes, can mitigate or eliminate this phenomenon. The problem requires a comparison between these two node distributions:\n1.  **Equispaced nodes**: $x_k = -1 + \\frac{2k}{n}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n$.\n2.  **Chebyshev nodes**: $x_k = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2k+1}{2(n+1)}\\pi\\right)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n$.\n\nFor the algorithmic implementation, we will compute the barycentric weights for each set of nodes. For equispaced nodes, we will use the definitional product formula directly, as it is a fundamental definition. For Chebyshev nodes, a well-known simplified formula for the weights exists, which is both computationally efficient and numerically stable: $w_k = (-1)^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{2k+1}{2(n+1)}\\pi\\right)$, assuming the nodes are ordered in descending value, which they are by the given cosine definition.\n\nThe core of the algorithm involves a function that, for a given degree $n$, parameter $\\alpha$, and node type, performs the following steps:\n1.  Generate the $n+1$ interpolation nodes $\\{x_k\\}$.\n2.  Compute the corresponding function values $y_k = f_{\\alpha}(x_k)$.\n3.  Calculate the barycentric weights $\\{w_k\\}$.\n4.  Define the dense evaluation grid $G$ with $1001$ points from $-1$ to $1$.\n5.  Evaluate the interpolating polynomial $p_{n,\\alpha}(x)$ for each $x \\in G$ using the barycentric formula, carefully handling cases where $x$ is close to a node to ensure numerical stability.\n6.  Evaluate the true function $f_{\\alpha}(x)$ for each $x \\in G$.\n7.  Compute the maximum absolute error $E_{n,\\alpha} = \\max_{x \\in G} |p_{n,\\alpha}(x) - f_{\\alpha}(x)|$.\n\nThis error computation function is then applied to solve the two tasks specified:\n- **Task 1**: For each $\\alpha \\in \\{0, 0.1, 1, 5, 25, 100\\}$, we iterate through the degrees $n \\in \\{5, 10, \\dots, 40\\}$ using equispaced nodes. We find the smallest degree $n$ for which the error $E_{n,\\alpha}$ exceeds the threshold $\\tau=0.05$. If the error never exceeds the threshold for any $n$ in the set, we report $-1$. For $\\alpha=0$, the function is $f_0(x)=1$, a polynomial of degree $0$. The interpolation will be exact, yielding an error of $0$. Thus, the expected result for $\\alpha=0$ is $-1$.\n- **Task 2**: We fix $n=40$ and $\\alpha=25$ (the classic Runge function parameter). We compute the error for both equispaced nodes ($E_{40,25}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$) and Chebyshev nodes ($E_{40,25}^{\\mathrm{ch}}$). We then determine the boolean value of the condition $E_{40,25}^{\\mathrm{ch}} \\le \\frac{1}{10} E_{40,25}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nThe final output is an aggregation of the results from these two tasks into a single formatted string.",
