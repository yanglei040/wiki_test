            "introduction": "We begin our hands-on exploration with the most famous cellular automaton: John Conway's Game of Life. This exercise invites you to simulate a small system governed by its four simple rules of birth, survival, and death. By manually calculating the fate of each cell on a toroidal (wrap-around) grid, you will gain a tangible understanding of how complex, dynamic patterns can emerge from purely local interactions, a core principle of complex systems. This practice is fundamental to appreciating the surprising behaviors that can arise from a simple initial state and a few deterministic rules .",

            "problem": "Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which can be in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n\n1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nConsider a system governed by these rules on a small $3 \\times 3$ grid. The grid has toroidal boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around itself such that the rightmost column is adjacent to the leftmost column, and the top row is adjacent to the bottom row. For example, the cell in the top-left corner has neighbors that include cells from the bottom row and the rightmost column.\n\nThe initial state of the system at generation 0 consists of three live cells forming a horizontal line in the central row of the grid. All other cells are dead.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of live cells the grid ever contains at any single generation during its entire evolution, starting from and including generation 0?",
            "solution": "Let the grid be indexed by $(i,j)$ with $i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and toroidal boundary conditions, so indices are taken modulo $3$. The initial live set at generation $0$ is\n$$\nS_{0}=\\{(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)\\},\n$$\nthe full middle row.\n\nFor any cell $(i,j)$, let $N_{0}(i,j)$ be its number of live neighbors at generation $0$. We compute $N_{0}(i,j)$ case by case.\n\n1) For live cells in the middle row, $(i,j)=(1,j)$ with $j\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$, their neighbors that can be live must lie in the same row because rows $0$ and $2$ are dead at generation $0$. Due to wrapping, the horizontal neighbors are $(1,j-1)$ and $(1,j+1)$ (indices modulo $3$), both in $S_{0}$. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{0}(1,j)=2.\n$$\nBy rule 2, each such live cell survives to the next generation.\n\n2) For cells in the top row, $(i,j)=(0,j)$, the only possible live neighbors are in row $1$. The neighbors in row $1$ are $(1,j-1)$, $(1,j)$, and $(1,j+1)$, all of which lie in $S_{0}$. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{0}(0,j)=3.\n$$\nBy rule 4, each such dead cell becomes live at the next generation.\n\n3) By the same symmetry for the bottom row, $(i,j)=(2,j)$, its neighbors in row $1$ are also $(1,j-1)$, $(1,j)$, and $(1,j+1)$, so\n$$\nN_{0}(2,j)=3,\n$$\nand each such dead cell becomes live at the next generation.\n\nCombining these, every cell in the $3\\times 3$ grid is live at generation $1$, so\n$$\n|S_{1}|=9.\n$$\n\nNow consider generation $1$, where $S_{1}$ is the full $3\\times 3$ grid. For any cell, all of its $8$ neighbors are live, so each cell has $8$ live neighbors. Since $8>3$, rule 3 applies and every live cell dies. Hence,\n$$\nS_{2}=\\varnothing,\n$$\nand all subsequent generations remain empty.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of live cell counts by generation is $3$ (generation $0$), $9$ (generation $1$), $0$ (generation $2$), and then $0$ thereafter. The maximum number of live cells attained at any generation, starting from and including generation 0, is\n$$\n9.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Next, we simplify the spatial dimension but not the potential for complexity by exploring a one-dimensional cellular automaton. This problem focuses on the celebrated Rule 90, where a cell's next state is determined by the exclusive OR (XOR) of its two neighbors' states. Starting from a single active cell, you will trace the generation of a pattern that reveals a deep connection between simple computation and mathematical fractals. This exercise powerfully illustrates the concept of emergent order and self-organization, showing how intricate global structures can be generated from one of the simplest possible local rules .",

            "problem": "In a simplified model of pattern formation in a linear chain of biological cells, each cell can be in one of two states: 'active' (represented by 1) or 'inactive' (represented by 0). The state of the cells evolves in discrete time steps (generations). The state of a cell at position $i$ and time $t+1$, denoted $c_i(t+1)$, is determined by the states of its immediate left and right neighbors at time $t$. The update rule is given by the exclusive OR (XOR) operation:\n$$c_i(t+1) = c_{i-1}(t) \\oplus c_{i+1}(t)$$\nwhere $a \\oplus b$ represents $(a+b) \\pmod 2$. This means a cell becomes active if and only if exactly one of its two neighbors was active in the previous generation.\n\nConsider a system that starts at generation $t=0$ with a single active cell at position $i=0$ on an infinitely long chain of otherwise inactive cells. All cells for $i \\neq 0$ are inactive at $t=0$.\n\nCalculate the cumulative total number of active cells from generation $t=0$ to $t=7$, inclusive. This is the sum of the number of active cells in each generation from $t=0$ through $t=7$.",
            "solution": "We work over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$ so that XOR is addition modulo $2$. The update rule is linear:\n$$\nc_{i}(t+1)=c_{i-1}(t)+c_{i+1}(t)\\quad\\text{in }\\mathbb{F}_{2}.\n$$\nWith the initial condition $c_{0}(0)=1$ and $c_{i}(0)=0$ for $i\\neq 0$, one can prove by induction on $t$ that\n$$\nc_{i}(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{t}\\binom{t}{k}\\,c_{i+t-2k}(0)\\quad\\text{in }\\mathbb{F}_{2}.\n$$\nThe base case $t=0$ is immediate.

This exercise moves beyond simple binary states, using a four-state system to model cell differentiation based on more complex, conditional rules that depend on the neighboring cell types.

            "problem": "A developmental biologist is creating a simplified model to study patterns of cell differentiation using a two-dimensional cellular automaton. The model is simulated on a 3x3 grid of cells with periodic boundary conditions. This means the grid wraps around, so the right neighbor of a cell in the rightmost column is the corresponding cell in the leftmost column, and the top neighbor of a cell in the top row is the corresponding cell in the bottom row, and so on.\n\nEach cell in the grid can exist in one of four possible integer states:\n- `0`: Empty Space\n- `1`: Stem Cell\n- `2`: Differentiated Cell Type A\n- `3`: Differentiated Cell Type B\n\nThe state of every cell in the grid is updated simultaneously at each discrete time step. The state of a given cell at time $t+1$ is determined by its own state and the states of its eight immediate neighbors (the Moore neighborhood) at time $t$. The update rules are applied as follows:\n\n1.  **Empty Space (`0`):** An Empty Space becomes a Stem Cell (`1`) if it has exactly three Stem Cell (`1`) neighbors. Otherwise, it remains an Empty Space.\n2.  **Stem Cell (`1`):** Its fate is determined by the following ordered checks:\n    a. If it has one or more Type A (`2`) neighbors, it becomes a Type A (`2`).\n    b. If rule 2a does not apply, and the sum of the states of its eight neighbors is strictly greater than 5, it becomes a Type B (`3`).\n    c. If neither rule 2a nor 2b applies, it remains a Stem Cell (`1`).\n3.  **Differentiated Cells (`2` or `3`):** These cells are terminally differentiated and remain in their current state for all subsequent time steps.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the grid is initialized with a horizontal line of three Stem Cells in the middle row, with all other cells being Empty Spaces, as represented by the following matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nBased on this initial configuration and the rules provided, simulate the evolution of the grid.

            "solution": "At time $t=0$, the states are $1$ in the entire middle row and $0$ elsewhere. With periodic (toroidal) boundaries, for any cell, its eight neighbors consist of three cells in the row above, two in the same row (left and right), and three in the row below.\n\nFrom $t=0$ to $t=1$:\n- For any cell in the top or bottom row (state $0$ at $t=0$), its three neighbors in the middle row are all state $1$, while its other five neighbors are state $0$. Thus each such cell has exactly $3$ neighbors with state $1$, so by rule 1 it becomes state $1$.\n- For any cell in the middle row (state $1$ at $t=0$), its two same-row neighbors are state $1$, and the other six neighbors (in the rows above and below) are state $0$, so the sum of neighbor states is $2$, which is not greater than $5$. There are no neighbors in state $2$, so rule 2a does not apply. Hence by rule 2c it remains state $1$.\n\nTherefore, at $t=1$, all nine cells are state $1$.\n\nFrom $t=1$ to $t=2$:\n- There are no cells in state $2$, so rule 2a never applies.\n- Every cell is state $1$ and all eight neighbors of any cell are also state $1$, so the sum of the neighbor states is $8$, which satisfies $8>5$. Hence by rule 2b, every cell becomes state $3$.\n\nThus, at $t=2$, all nine cells are state $3$.\n\nFrom $t=2$ to $t=3$:\n- By rule 3, differentiated cells in states $2$ or $3$ remain unchanged. Therefore, all cells stay in state $3$.\n\nThe sum of the states at $t=3$ is\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{9} 3 = 9 \\cdot 3 = 27.\n$$",
