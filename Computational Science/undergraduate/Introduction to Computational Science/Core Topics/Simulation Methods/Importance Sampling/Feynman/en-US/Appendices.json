            "problem": "Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo methods to estimate properties of a particular distribution, while drawing samples from a different distribution. Suppose we wish to estimate the expectation $I = E_p[f(X)] = \\int f(x) p(x) dx$, where $p(x)$ is the target probability density function. Instead of sampling from $p(x)$, we can draw samples $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ from a proposal distribution $q(x)$ and construct the estimator:\n$$ \\hat{I}_N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i) w(X_i) $$\nwhere $w(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ are the importance weights. This estimator is unbiased, i.e., $E_q[\\hat{I}_N] = I$. The efficiency of this method depends on the variance of the estimator, which is given by $\\text{Var}_q(\\hat{I}_N) = \\frac{1}{N} \\text{Var}_q(f(X)w(X))$. To minimize the variance of the estimator for a fixed sample size $N$, one must minimize $\\text{Var}_q(f(X)w(X))$. Since $\\text{Var}_q(Y) = E_q[Y^2] - (E_q[Y])^2$ and $E_q[f(X)w(X)] = I$ is a constant with respect to the choice of $q(x)$, minimizing the variance is equivalent to minimizing the second moment, $E_q[(f(X)w(X))^2]$.\n\nConsider a scenario where the target distribution $p(x)$ is a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter $\\sigma_p$. The probability density function of a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$ g(x; \\sigma) = \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2} e^{-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2)} \\quad \\text{for } x \\ge 0 $$\nWe wish to estimate the mean of this target distribution, so $f(x)=x$.

            "introduction": "While a well-chosen proposal distribution can dramatically improve an estimate, a poorly chosen one can be disastrous, leading to biased or even infinitely wrong results. This problem tackles the most critical pitfall in importance sampling: ensuring the support of the proposal distribution $q(x)$ covers the entire support of the target distribution $p(x)$. This conceptual exercise will sharpen your understanding of why this condition is non-negotiable and how to remedy the situation when it is violated. ",

            "problem": "You are tasked with estimating the quantity $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}_{p}[g(X)]$ for a bounded measurable function $g$, where $X$ is a real-valued random variable with probability density function $p$. Consider the following scientifically plausible setting: the target density $p$ is uniform on the interval $[0, 2]$, and the proposal density $q$ used for importance sampling is uniform on the interval $[0, 1.5]$. Concretely,\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[0, 2]}(x), \\qquad q(x) = \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1.5]}(x),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{A}(x)$ is the indicator function of the set $A$. The standard importance sampling method uses samples $X_{1}, \\dots, X_{n} \\overset{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} q$ and weights $w(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ to form an estimator of $\\mu$. In this setting, the interval $[1.5, 2]$ has positive mass under $p$ but zero mass under $q$, creating a gap in proposal support.\n\nTo remedy support gaps, one common strategy is to replace $q$ with a mixture proposal that guarantees support coverage. Let $r$ be the uniform density on $[0, 2]$, i.e.,\n$$\nr(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[0, 2]}(x),\n$$\nand consider the mixture proposal\n$$\nq_{\\varepsilon}(x) = (1 - \\varepsilon)\\,q(x) + \\varepsilon\\,r(x),\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct in this setting.\n\nA. For $g(x) = 1$, the standard importance sampling estimator using $q$ is unbiased for $\\mu$.\n\nB. The condition that $p$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $q$ (i.e., $p \\ll q$) fails here. Consequently, the standard importance sampling estimator using $q$ is biased unless $g(x) = 0$ on $[1.5, 2]$.\n\nC. Using the mixture proposal $q_{\\varepsilon}$ restores unbiasedness for any bounded $g$ and yields a finite variance importance sampling estimator; however, as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the variance can become arbitrarily large.\n\nD. Multiplying the weights $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ by a fixed constant to cap their magnitude prevents bias and ensures finite variance even when $q$ has zero density on parts of the support of $p$.\n\nE. Switching to the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) estimator removes the need for support coverage; unbiasedness holds even if $q$ assigns zero density where $p(x) > 0$.",
            "solution": "The fundamental requirement for an unbiased importance sampling estimator is that the support of the proposal distribution $q$ must contain the support of the target distribution $p$. This is written as $p \\ll q$ ($p$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $q$). In this problem, $\\text{supp}(p) = [0, 2]$ while $\\text{supp}(q) = [0, 1.5]$, so the condition is violated. The region $(1.5, 2]$ has positive probability under $p$ but is never sampled by $q$.\n\n*   **A is incorrect:** The estimator is biased because it completely misses the contribution to the integral from the interval $(1.5, 2]$. For $g(x)=1$, the true mean is $\\mu=1$, but the estimator's expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\mu}] = \\int_{0}^{1.5} p(x)dx = \\int_{0}^{1.5} (1/2) dx = 0.75$.\n*   **B is correct:** The statement correctly identifies that the absolute continuity condition fails. As a result, the estimator is biased. The bias comes from the ignored region: $-\\int_{1.5}^{2} g(x)p(x)dx$. This bias is zero only if $g(x)$ is zero (almost everywhere) on $[1.5, 2]$.\n*   **C is correct:** The mixture proposal $q_{\\varepsilon}$ has support on $[0, 2]$, which matches the support of $p$. This restores unbiasedness. The variance involves an integral containing the term $1/q_{\\varepsilon}(x)$. On the interval $(1.5, 2]$, $q_{\\varepsilon}(x) = \\varepsilon r(x) = \\varepsilon/2$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, this term blows up, causing the variance of the estimator to become arbitrarily large.\n*   **D is incorrect:** Capping or truncating weights is a technique to reduce variance at the cost of introducing bias. It does not prevent or fix the bias caused by a support mismatch.\n*   **E is incorrect:** The self-normalized (SNIS) estimator is also inconsistent if the support condition is violated. It will converge to the expectation over a truncated version of the distribution, not the true expectation.\n\nTherefore, statements B and C are the correct ones.",
