If $T/\\Delta t$ is not an integer, take any sequence of time steps whose total equals exactly $T$ and whose individual steps respect the same first-order upwind update with the appropriate $\\nu$ for each step. After reaching time $T$, quantify the smearing of the square wave by the numerical diffusion index\n$$\nD = 1 - \\frac{TV(u^N)}{2}, \\quad TV(u^N) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\big|u_{j+1}^N - u_j^N\\big|,\n$$\nwith periodic indexing $u_N^N \\equiv u_0^N$. For an ideal, perfectly sharp, unit-height square wave on a periodic domain, $TV = 2$ and hence $D=0$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a unique and meaningful solution. The problem requires the simulation of the linear advection equation using a first-order upwind finite difference scheme and the quantification of numerical diffusion.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation is the linear advection equation:\n$$ u_t + c\\,u_x = 0 $$\non a periodic spatial domain $x \\in [0,1)$ with a constant wave speed $c > 0$. The exact solution to this equation is a simple translation of the initial profile, $u(x,t) = u_0(x-ct)$, where $u_0(x)$ is the initial condition.\n\nThe solution process involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Discretization**: The spatial domain $x \\in [0,1)$ is discretized into $N$ equally spaced grid points $x_j = j\\,\\Delta x$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = 1/N$. The time domain is discretized into steps of size $\\Delta t$, such that $t^n = n\\,\\Delta t$. The numerical solution at grid point $x_j$ and time $t^n$ is denoted by $u_j^n$.\n\n2.  **Initial Condition**: The initial condition is a square wave:\n    $$\n    u(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n    1, & x \\in [0.4, 0.6) \\\\\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    This is translated into discrete initial data $u_j^0$ by setting $u_j^0 = 1$ for all indices $j$ where the grid point $x_j = j/N$ falls within the interval $[0.4, 0.6)$, i.e., for all integers $j$ satisfying $0.4 \\le j/N < 0.6$, which is equivalent to $0.4N \\le j < 0.6N$. For all other indices, $u_j^0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Scheme**: The time evolution is governed by the first-order upwind finite difference scheme. For a positive wave speed $c > 0$, the scheme is:\n    $$\n    u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\nu \\left(u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n\\right)\n    $$\n    Here, $\\nu = \\frac{c\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ is the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number. This explicit scheme is stable for $\\nu \\in [0, 1]$. All test cases use $\\nu$ values within this stable range. The periodic boundary condition $u_{-1}^n \\equiv u_{N-1}^n$ is applied. In a vectorized implementation, this is handled efficiently by treating the solution array $u^n$ as a periodic sequence. The term $u_{j-1}^n$ for all $j$ corresponds to a circular shift of the vector $u^n$. The update can be written as $u^{n+1} = u^n - \\nu(u^n - \\text{roll}(u^n, 1))$.\n\n4.  **Time Integration**: We must integrate the solution up to a final time $T$. The time step $\\Delta t$ is determined by the given parameters: $\\Delta t = \\nu \\Delta x / c = \\nu / (Nc)$. The total number of steps, $T/\\Delta t$, may not be an integer. The specified procedure is to perform $N_{\\text{steps}} = \\lfloor T/\\Delta t \\rfloor$ full steps using the Courant number $\\nu$. If there is a remaining time $T_{\\text{rem}} = T - N_{\\text{steps}}\\Delta t > 0$, a final, smaller time step of duration $\\Delta t_{\\text{rem}} = T_{\\text{rem}}$ is taken. For this final step, the corresponding Courant number is $\\nu_{\\text{rem}} = c \\Delta t_{\\text{rem}} / \\Delta x$, and the upwind update rule is applied with this value. This ensures the simulation ends precisely at time $T$.\n\n5.  **Quantification of Numerical Diffusion**: After evolving the solution to time $T$, we compute the numerical diffusion index $D$. This requires calculating the total variation (TV) of the final numerical solution, let's call it $u^{\\text{final}}$:\n    $$\n    TV(u^{\\text{final}}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |u_{j+1}^{\\text{final}} - u_j^{\\text{final}}|\n    $$\n    where periodic indexing $u_N^{\\text{final}} \\equiv u_0^{\\text{final}}$ is used. The diffusion index $D$ is then defined as:\n    $$\n    D = 1 - \\frac{TV(u^{\\text{final}})}{2}\n    $$\n    For an ideal, non-diffused square wave of unit height on a periodic domain, there are two jumps of magnitude $1$, one up and one down, so its total variation is $TV=2$. This results in $D=0$. Numerical diffusion smears these sharp jumps, reducing the total variation ($TV < 2$) and thus increasing the diffusion index $D > 0$. A completely smeared-out constant solution would have $TV=0$ and $D=1$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure. For each test case, it sets up the grid and initial condition, performs the time evolution according to the specified stepping logic, calculates the total variation of the final state, computes the diffusion index $D$, and collects the results for final output.",

            "solution": "We begin from the heat equation $\\partial_t u = \\alpha \\partial_{xx} u$ on $[0,1]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and a discontinuous step initial condition confined to $[0.45,0.55]$. The maximum principle for the continuous problem implies that, for $t>0$, the solution remains between $0$ and $1$. However, certain time discretizations, while stable in a norm, are not monotone and can produce nonphysical oscillations such as undershoot (values below $0$) or overshoot (values above $1$) when the initial data has sharp discontinuities. The Crank–Nicolson scheme is a second-order accurate, implicit, unconditionally stable method in the $\\ell^2$ sense, but it is not total variation diminishing nor monotonicity preserving, and can produce such oscillations for sufficiently large time steps.\n\nWe discretize the spatial domain with $N=201$ uniformly spaced nodes, including boundaries, so that $\\Delta x = 1/(N-1)$. We index interior nodes by $i=1,2,\\dots,N-2$ and denote by $u_i^n$ the numerical approximation at $x_i=i\\Delta x$ and time $t_n=n\\Delta t$.

For the heat equation with nonnegative, bounded initial data, the exact solution remains in $[0,1]$, so any positive $A(\\Delta t)$ indicates an unphysical oscillation caused by the discrete scheme.\n\nWe now discuss why large $r$ leads to oscillations. The discrete Laplacian $L$ on a uniform grid has eigenmodes resembling discrete sines. For a Fourier component with wavenumber $\\theta$, the discrete Laplacian has eigenvalue $\\lambda_d(\\theta) = -4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$. The Crank–Nicolson amplification factor for this mode is\n$$\ng(\\theta; r) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{r}{2}\\lambda_d(\\theta)}{1 - \\frac{r}{2}\\lambda_d(\\theta)}\n= \\frac{1 - 2 r \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{1 + 2 r \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}.\n$$\nFor any $r>0$, we have $|g(\\theta;r)|<1$, ensuring unconditional stability in $\\ell^2$. However, if $2 r \\sin^2(\\theta/2) > 1$, then $g(\\theta;r) < 0$, which flips the sign of those Fourier components in a single time step, generating oscillations near sharp discontinuities where high-frequency content is present. The largest $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ is $1$, hence for $r > 1/2$, the highest frequency modes are inverted in sign after one step. Therefore we anticipate negligible oscillations for $r=0.2$, increasing oscillatory undershoot/overshoot for $r=1$, and more pronounced oscillations for $r=5$ and $r=25$.\n\nAlgorithmically, for each specified $\\Delta t_k$ (equivalently $r_k$), we:\n1. Construct $u^0$ from the step initial condition on the interior grid.\n2. Form the tridiagonal system with subdiagonal entries $-r_k/2$, diagonal entries $1+r_k$, and superdiagonal entries $-r_k/2$.\n3. Assemble the right-hand side $(I + \\frac{r_k}{2} L) u^0$ using interior values and $0$ at the boundaries.\n4. Solve the tridiagonal system to obtain $u^1$.\n5. Compute $A(\\Delta t_k)$ as defined above from the interior values of $u^1$.\n6. Repeat for the four test values of $\\Delta t_k$ in the suite.\n\nFinally, we output the list $[A(\\Delta t_1), A(\\Delta t_2), A(\\Delta t_3), A(\\Delta t_4)]$, each rounded to six decimal places, as a single line, comma-separated within brackets.

            "introduction": "Elliptic PDEs, exemplified by the Poisson equation $-\\nabla^2 u = f$, describe steady-state systems and are fundamental in physics and engineering. A cornerstone of computational science is not just implementing a numerical method, but also verifying that it works correctly. This exercise guides you through this vital process by comparing a standard second-order 5-point stencil with a higher, fourth-order 9-point stencil, allowing you to numerically measure and confirm their theoretical rates of convergence as the grid is refined.",

Construct the full grid function by setting boundary values to the exact $u(x_i,y_j)$ and interior values to the corresponding numerical solution. Define the discrete root-mean-square error (a discrete $L^2$ approximation) for a grid function $w$ relative to the exact $u$ by\n$$E(h; w) = \\left(h^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\left(w_{i,j} - u(x_i,y_j)\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}.$$\nLet $E^{(5)}(h)$ and $E^{(9)}(h)$ denote these errors for the $5$-point and $9$-point solutions, respectively.\n\nd) For each consecutive pair of grid spacings $(h, h/2)$, define the observed base-$2$ convergence rates by\n$$p^{(5)}(h\\to h/2) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E^{(5)}(h)}{E^{(5)}(h/2)}\\right),\\qquad p^{(9)}(h\\to h/2) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E^{(9)}(h)}{E^{(9)}(h/2)}\\right).$$\n\nUse the following test suite of subdivision counts: $m\\in\\{2,4,8,16\\}$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part a) Derivation of the Source Term $f(x,y)$**\n\nThe source term $f(x,y)$ is determined by the relation $f = -\\Delta u = -(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2})$. We compute the second partial derivatives of the exact solution $u(x,y) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) \\right) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\pi \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) $$\nThe second partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\sin(\\pi x) + \\pi\\cos(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) \\right) \\\\ = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\sin(\\pi x) + \\pi\\cos(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) + \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\pi\\cos(\\pi x) - \\pi^2\\sin(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) \\\\ = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi y) \\left[ (1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi x) + 2\\pi\\cos(\\pi x) \\right] $$\nDue to the symmetry of $u(x,y)$ with respect to interchange of $x$ and $y$, the second partial derivative with respect to $y$ is analogous:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x) \\left[ (1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi y) + 2\\pi\\cos(\\pi y) \\right] $$\nThe Laplacian $\\Delta u$ is the sum of these second derivatives:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y} \\left[ 2(1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + 2\\pi(\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)) \\right] $$\nFinally, the source term is $f(x,y) = -\\Delta u$:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y} \\left[ 2(\\pi^2-1)\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) - 2\\pi(\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)) \\right] $$\nThis is the closed-form expression required.\n\n**Part b, c, d) Numerical Solution and Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires solving the linear system $A \\mathbf{u}_h = \\mathbf{b}$ for the unknown values of the numerical solution at the $(m-1)^2$ interior grid points. The vector $\\mathbf{u}_h$ contains the values $u_{i,j}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m-1\\}$, arranged in lexicographical (column-major) order. The matrix $A$ represents the discrete negative Laplacian operator, and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ contains the values of the source term $f(x_i, y_j)$ at the interior points.\n\nFor the $5$-point stencil, the matrix $A_5$ corresponding to $(-\\Delta_h^{(5)})$ can be constructed using Kronecker products. Let $T_{1D}$ be the $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ matrix for the one-dimensional second derivative operator $-\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, given by $T_{1D} = \\frac{1}{h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-1, 2, -1)$. Let $I$ be the $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ identity matrix. Then, the matrix for the two-dimensional operator is:\n$$ A_5 = I \\otimes T_{1D} + T_{1D} \\otimes I $$\n\nFor the $9$-point stencil, the matrix $A_9$ corresponding to $(-\\Delta_h^{(9)})$ has a block-tridiagonal structure $A_9 = \\text{block_tridiag}(B, D, B)$, where the blocks $D$ and $B$ are $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ matrices:\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{6h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-4, 20, -4) $$\n$$ B = \\frac{1}{6h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-1, -4, -1) $$\nThis structure arises from the coefficients of the stencil coupling nodes within the same grid row (matrix $D$) and between adjacent grid rows (matrix $B$).\n\nThe numerical procedure for each $m \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16\\}$ is as follows:\n1.  Set the grid spacing $h=1/m$ and define the grid coordinates.\n2.  Construct the sparse matrices $A_5$ and $A_9$ of size $(m-1)^2 \\times (m-1)^2$.\n3.  Construct the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ by evaluating $f(x_i, y_j)$ at the $(m-1)^2$ interior grid points.\n4.  Solve the two linear systems $A_5 \\mathbf{u}_h^{(5)} = \\mathbf{b}$ and $A_9 \\mathbf{u}_h^{(9)} = \\mathbf{b}$ to obtain the numerical solutions at the interior points.\n5.  Form the full $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ grid solutions $u_h^{(5)}$ and $u_h^{(9)}$ by embedding the interior solutions into a grid of zeros, which correctly represents the homogeneous boundary conditions.\n6.  Evaluate the exact solution $u(x,y)$ on the full grid.\n7.  Compute the discrete RMS errors $E^{(5)}(h)$ and $E^{(9)}(h)$ using the specified formula. These errors are stored for each value of $m$.\n8.  After computing errors for all $m$, the observed convergence rates $p^{(5)}$ and $p^{(9)}$ are calculated for each refinement level using the given logarithmic formula.\n\nThe expected convergence rates are $p \\approx 2$ for the second-order $5$-point stencil and $p \\approx 4$ for the fourth-order $9$-point stencil, as these are the theoretical orders of accuracy for the respective discretizations. The numerical experiment serves to verify this theoretical behavior.",
