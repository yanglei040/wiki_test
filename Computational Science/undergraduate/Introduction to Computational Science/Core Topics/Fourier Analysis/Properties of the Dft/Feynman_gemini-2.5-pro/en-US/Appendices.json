This practice focuses on directly calculating the DC component ($k=0$) and the Nyquist component ($k=N/2$), two of the most significant points in the spectrum. By analyzing a simple alternating sequence, you will see how fundamental signal characteristics are captured at these key frequencies without needing a full transform .",
