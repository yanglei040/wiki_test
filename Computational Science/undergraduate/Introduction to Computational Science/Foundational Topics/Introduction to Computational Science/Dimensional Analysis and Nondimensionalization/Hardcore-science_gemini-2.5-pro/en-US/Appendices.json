            "problem": "A cohort of athletes is assumed to be geometrically similar in their anthropometry across sizes.

The assumptions of geometric similarity, constant body density, and constant muscle stress are standard idealizations used in this field to establish fundamental scaling laws. The problem is well-posed, as it seeks a specific exponent based on a defined set of physical principles and variables. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a classic problem in dimensional analysis and scaling. The potential complication of the athlete lifting their own body weight is implicitly simplified by the assertion that a simple power law $W_{\\max} \\propto m^{\\alpha}$ exists, directing the analysis toward the dominant scaling relationship between strength and mass, which is the core of the question.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided physical principles.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe solution is found by applying the principle of geometric similarity to the physical quantities that determine an athlete's strength and mass.\n\n1.  The athletes are assumed to be geometrically similar. This implies that all linear dimensions of an athlete's body, such as height or bone length, can be characterized by a single characteristic length, $L$. All areas scale with $L^2$, and all volumes scale with $L^3$.\n\n2.  The body mass $m$ of an athlete is the product of their bulk body density $\\rho_{b}$ and their body volume $V$.\n    $$m = \\rho_{b} V$$\n    Since $\\rho_{b}$ is constant across the cohort and volume scales with the cube of the characteristic length ($V \\propto L^3$), the body mass scales as:\n    $$m \\propto L^3$$\n    This establishes a fundamental relationship between the characteristic length and mass:\n    $$L \\propto m^{1/3}$$\n\n3.  The strength of an athlete is determined by the maximum force their muscles can generate. The maximum isometric stress $\\sigma_{\\ast}$ (force per unit area) is given as a constant for all athletes. The maximum force $F_{\\text{muscle}}$ that a muscle can produce is therefore directly proportional to its physiological cross-sectional area, $A_{\\text{muscle}}$.\n    $$F_{\\text{muscle}} = \\sigma_{\\ast} A_{\\text{muscle}}$$\n    Since $\\sigma_{\\ast}$ is constant, we have:\n    $$F_{\\text{muscle}} \\propto A_{\\text{muscle}}$$\n\n4.  Due to geometric similarity, any cross-sectional area within the body, including that of the muscles, must scale with the square of the characteristic length $L$.\n    $$A_{\\text{muscle}} \\propto L^2$$\n\n5.  By combining the relations from steps 3 and 4, we find how maximum muscle force scales with the characteristic length:\n    $$F_{\\text{muscle}} \\propto L^2$$\n\n6.  The problem asks for the scaling of the maximum liftable external weight, $W_{\\max}$. The problem states that the lift is quasi-static and standardized, such that all biomechanical factors (e.g., lever arms) are size-invariant. This is a critical simplification which implies that the maximum external force an athlete can support, $W_{\\max}$, is directly proportional to the maximum internal force their muscles can generate, $F_{\\text{muscle}}$.\n    $$W_{\\max} \\propto F_{\\text{muscle}}$$\n\n7.  We can now establish the scaling of $W_{\\max}$ with body mass $m$. We combine the chain of proportionalities: $W_{\\max} \\propto F_{\\text{muscle}}$, $F_{\\text{muscle}} \\propto L^2$, and $L \\propto m^{1/3}$.\n    $$W_{\\max} \\propto L^2 \\propto \\left(m^{1/3}\\right)^2$$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$W_{\\max} \\propto m^{2/3}$$\n\n8.  The problem defines the scaling relation as $W_{\\max} \\propto m^{\\alpha}$. By comparing our derived relation with the given form, we can identify the exponent $\\alpha$.\n    $$\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThis result is an embodiment of the square-cube law: strength, which is related to area, scales as $L^2$, while mass, which is related to volume, scales as $L^3$. Therefore, strength scales with mass to the power of $2/3$. The other given parameters, $\\rho_{b}$, $\\sigma_{\\ast}$, and $g$, are absorbed into the constant of proportionality but do not affect the exponent of mass in this idealized model.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in computational science concerning the stability of a finite difference scheme for the heat equation. The tasks are clearly articulated and lead to a verifiable result based on established mathematical techniques. No flaws are identified. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem.\n\nPart 1: Dimensional Analysis\n\nWe are asked to find the unique dimensionless group formed from the thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$, the time step $\\Delta t$, and the spatial grid spacing $\\Delta x$. The physical dimensions of these quantities are given or can be inferred as:\n$[\\kappa] = L^2 T^{-1}$ (length squared per time)\n$[\\Delta t] = T$ (time)\n$[\\Delta x] = L$ (length)\n\nWe seek a dimensionless product $\\Pi$ of the form:\n$$ \\Pi = \\kappa^{a} (\\Delta t)^{b} (\\Delta x)^{c} $$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are exponents to be determined. For $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, its dimensions must be $M^0 L^0 T^0$. Substituting the dimensions of each quantity:\n$$ [\\Pi] = (L^2 T^{-1})^{a} (T)^{b} (L)^{c} = L^{2a} T^{-a} T^{b} L^{c} = L^{2a+c} T^{-a+b} $$\nTo make this dimensionless, the exponents of the fundamental dimensions $L$ (length) and $T$ (time) must be zero. This yields a system of two linear equations for the three exponents:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Exponent of $L$: $2a + c = 0 \\implies c = -2a$\n    \\item Exponent of $T$: $-a + b = 0 \\implies b = a$\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe can express $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$. Substituting these back into the expression for $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\kappa^{a} (\\Delta t)^{a} (\\Delta x)^{-2a} = \\left( \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)^{a} $$\nAny non-zero choice of the exponent $a$ will yield a dimensionless group. By convention, we select the simplest case, $a=1$. This gives the dimensionless group referred to as the Fourier number, $Fo$:\n$$ Fo = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\nThis group is unique up to an arbitrary power $a$ and a multiplicative constant. The Buckingham Pi theorem states that the number of independent dimensionless groups is equal to the number of variables minus the number of fundamental dimensions. Here, we have $3$ variables ($\\kappa$, $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta x$) and $2$ fundamental dimensions ($L$, $T$). Thus, we expect $3 - 2 = 1$ independent dimensionless group, which confirms the uniqueness of our result. All other dimensionless combinations of these variables must be a function (e.g., a power) of this single group.\n\nPart 2: Von Neumann Stability Analysis\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nWe use the specified finite-difference approximations. The time derivative is approximated by a forward difference:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{j,n} \\approx \\frac{u_{j}^{n+1} - u_{j}^{n}}{\\Delta t} $$\nThe second spatial derivative is approximated by a centered difference:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{j,n} \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\nSubstituting these approximations into the PDE gives the discrete equation:\n$$ \\frac{u_{j}^{n+1} - u_{j}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\kappa \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) $$\nTo derive the explicit update relation for $u_{j}^{n+1}$, we solve for this term:\n$$ u_{j}^{n+1} = u_{j}^{n} + \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (u_{j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}) $$\nUsing the Fourier number $Fo = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ from Part 1, we can write the update relation more compactly:\n$$ u_{j}^{n+1} = u_{j}^{n} + Fo (u_{j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}) $$\n$$ u_{j}^{n+1} = Fo \\, u_{j+1}^{n} + (1 - 2Fo) u_{j}^{n} + Fo \\, u_{j-1}^{n} $$\nThis is the explicit update relation. For the von Neumann stability analysis, we substitute the trial solution $u_{j}^{n} = A^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k j \\Delta x)$, where $A$ is the amplification factor and $k$ is the wavenumber.\n$$ A^{n+1} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k j \\Delta x) = Fo [A^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k (j+1) \\Delta x)] + (1 - 2Fo) [A^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k j \\Delta x)] + Fo [A^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k (j-1) \\Delta x)] $$\nDividing by $A^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k j \\Delta x)$:\n$$ A = Fo \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x) + (1 - 2Fo) + Fo \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x) $$\n$$ A = 1 - 2Fo + Fo (\\exp(\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x)) $$\nUsing Euler's identity $\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we find the amplification factor:\n$$ A = 1 - 2Fo + 2Fo \\cos(k \\Delta x) = 1 - 2Fo(1 - \\cos(k \\Delta x)) $$\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$ A = 1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\nFor the scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any wavenumber $k$, i.e., $|A| \\leq 1$. Since $A$ is real, this condition is equivalent to $-1 \\leq A \\leq 1$.\nThe first inequality is $A \\leq 1$:\n$$ 1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\leq 1 \\implies -4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\leq 0 $$\nSince $Fo = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ is positive (as $\\kappa0, \\Delta t0$) and $\\sin^2(\\cdot) \\geq 0$, this inequality is always satisfied.\nThe second inequality is $A \\geq -1$:\n$$ 1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\geq -1 \\implies 2 \\geq 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ Fo \\leq \\frac{2}{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)} $$\nThis condition must hold for all possible wavenumbers $k$. The stability is thus limited by the \"worst-case\" scenario, which occurs when the right-hand side is at its minimum. The minimum of the right-hand side occurs when the denominator is at its maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$ is $1$, which corresponds to the highest frequency modes resolvable on the grid (e.g., when $k \\Delta x = \\pi$).\nSubstituting this maximum value, the stability condition becomes:\n$$ Fo \\leq \\frac{1}{2(1)} \\implies Fo \\leq \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis is the stability constraint on the Fourier number.\n\nPart 3: Nondimensionalization of the Continuous Equation\n\nWe start with the continuous PDE $u_{t} = \\kappa u_{xx}$. The scaling variables are introduced as $x^{\\ast} = x/\\Delta x$, $t^{\\ast} = t/\\Delta t$, and $u^{\\ast} = u/U$. We express the original variables and their derivatives in terms of the new dimensionless variables using the chain rule.\nOriginal variables: $x = x^{\\ast} \\Delta x$, $t = t^{\\ast} \\Delta t$, $u = u^{\\ast} U$.\nDerivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (u^{\\ast} U)}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} \\frac{\\partial t^{\\ast}}{\\partial t} = U \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{U}{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (u^{\\ast} U)}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial x} = U \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{U}{\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{U}{\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\frac{U}{\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{U}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\ast}}{\\partial (x^{\\ast})^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the original PDE:\n$$ \\frac{U}{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\kappa \\left( \\frac{U}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\ast}}{\\partial (x^{\\ast})^2} \\right) $$\nDividing through by the constant factor $U/\\Delta t$ (assuming $U \\neq 0, \\Delta t \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\ast}}{\\partial (x^{\\ast})^2} $$\nAs shown, the dimensionless group $Fo = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ emerges naturally as the single coefficient in the nondimensionalized equation. The resulting equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = Fo \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\ast}}{\\partial (x^{\\ast})^2} $$\nStability is a mathematical property of the discretized version of this equation. The nondimensionalization process shows that the dynamics of any system governed by the heat equation, when viewed in terms of these scaled variables, depend only on the single parameter $Fo$. The specific values of $\\kappa$, $\\Delta t$, and $\\Delta x$ are collapsed into this one number. Since the behavior of the dimensionless solution $u^{\\ast}(x^{\\ast}, t^{\\ast})$ depends only on $Fo$, any property derived from the governing equation, such as the stability of a numerical scheme for it, must also depend solely on $Fo$.\n\nThe largest admissible value of this parameter, as determined in Part 2, is $\\frac{1}{2}$.",
