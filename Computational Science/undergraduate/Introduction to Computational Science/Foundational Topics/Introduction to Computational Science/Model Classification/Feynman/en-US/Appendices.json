            "problem": "A single pixel in a fluorescence microscope records photon arrivals over an exposure window $\\left[0, T\\right]$. The discrete random variable $N$ counting the number of detected photons is modeled as a Poisson random variable with parameter $\\lambda(T)$, where the Poisson parameter is the expected number of arrivals in the window. The instrument is illuminated by a light source with deterministic, continuous photon flux (intensity) $I(t)$ (photons per second arriving at the pixel), and the detector has quantum efficiency $\\eta$ (the probability that an arriving photon is detected). The instantaneous arrival rate is therefore $r(t) = \\eta I(t)$, and the expected count over an exposure is $\\lambda(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} r(t)\\, dt = \\eta \\int_{0}^{T} I(t)\\, dt$. The microscope vendor suggests using a continuous deterministic model for the signal when the coefficient of variation (CV), defined as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(N)}/\\mathbb{E}[N]$, is below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n\nClassify the model for $N$ and the model for $I(t)$ according to the categories discrete versus continuous and deterministic versus stochastic. Then, starting only from the foundational properties of the Poisson process that $\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\lambda(T)$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(N) = \\lambda(T)$, and the given definition of the coefficient of variation, derive a criterion on the exposure time $T$ under which the continuous deterministic approximation is acceptable, and compute the minimal exposure time $T_{\\min}$ that meets this criterion for the following operating point:\n- The flux is constant over the exposure, $I(t) = I_{0}$ with $I_{0} = 8.0 \\times 10^{4}$ photons per second.\n- The detector efficiency is $\\eta = 0.60$.\n- The tolerance is $\\varepsilon = 0.020$.\nRound your final numerical answer for $T_{\\min}$ to three significant figures. Express the final time in seconds.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the criterion and compute the final value. The language is objective and unambiguous. The provided numerical values are physically plausible. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Part 1: Model Classification**\nThe problem statement provides the classifications directly.\n- The model for the number of detected photons, $N$, is described as a \"discrete random variable\". This means the state space of $N$ is discrete (the non-negative integers $\\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$) and its evolution is stochastic (governed by a probability distribution, specifically Poisson). Therefore, the model for $N$ is **discrete and stochastic**.\n- The model for the photon flux, $I(t)$, is described as a \"deterministic, continuous photon flux\". This means its state space is continuous (the non-negative real numbers) and its evolution is deterministic (its value is known with certainty at any time $t$). Therefore, the model for $I(t)$ is **continuous and deterministic**.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Minimal Exposure Time**\nThe condition for the continuous deterministic approximation to be acceptable is that the coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV}$, is below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} < \\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\mathrm{CV}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(N)}}{\\mathbb{E}[N]} < \\varepsilon\n$$\nThe problem states that $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda(T)$.

This exercise presents a fascinating case where a simple, deterministic update rule, when implemented on a computer, generates an output whose deviation from the ideal path grows like a random walk .

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the variance of a computationally implemented state after $N$ steps, relative to its ideal deterministic value. The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness and well-posed nature.\n\nLet us define the ideal, unrounded deterministic state at step $n$ as $y_n$. According to the problem, this state evolves as $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\alpha$ with $y_0 = x_0$. Unrolling this recursion gives the explicit form for the ideal state at step $N$:\n$$y_N = x_0 + N\\alpha$$\nThe computationally implemented state, denoted by $x_n$, evolves according to the rule involving a rounding operator $Q(z)$:\n$$x_{n+1} = Q(x_n + \\alpha)$$\nThe problem defines the rounding error at step $n$ as the random variable $r_n$:\n$$r_n = Q(x_n + \\alpha) - (x_n + \\alpha)$$\nUsing this definition, we can rewrite the update rule for the implemented state as:\n$$x_{n+1} = (x_n + \\alpha) + r_n$$\nWe can now express the state $x_N$ after $N$ steps by unrolling this recursion, starting from the initial condition $x_0$, which is assumed to be exactly representable and thus free of initial rounding error.\nFor $n=0$:\n$$x_1 = (x_0 + \\alpha) + r_0$$\nFor $n=1$:\n$$x_2 = (x_1 + \\alpha) + r_1 = ((x_0 + \\alpha) + r_0 + \\alpha) + r_1 = (x_0 + 2\\alpha) + r_0 + r_1$$\nFor $n=2$:\n$$x_3 = (x_2 + \\alpha) + r_2 = ((x_0 + 2\\alpha) + r_0 + r_1 + \\alpha) + r_2 = (x_0 + 3\\alpha) + r_0 + r_1 + r_2$$\nBy induction, the general form for the state $x_N$ after $N$ steps is:\n$$x_N = (x_0 + N\\alpha) + \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r_n$$\nThe problem asks for the variance of $x_N$ relative to its unrounded deterministic value, $y_N = x_0 + N\\alpha$. Let us define this difference as the total error, $E_N$:\n$$E_N = x_N - y_N = x_N - (x_0 + N\\alpha)$$\nSubstituting our expression for $x_N$:\n$$E_N = \\left( (x_0 + N\\alpha) + \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r_n \\right) - (x_0 + N\\alpha) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r_n$$\nThe quantity to be derived is the variance of this total error, $\\mathrm{Var}(E_N)$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E_N) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r_n\\right)$$\nThe problem statement provides a crucial modeling assumption: the rounding errors $\\{r_n\\}$ are to be treated as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. A fundamental property of variance states that for a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E_N) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\mathrm{Var}(r_n)$$\nSince the variables are also identically distributed, they all have the same variance.

According to the problem, $r_n$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[-\\epsilon/2, \\epsilon/2]$. The probability density function (PDF) for a random variable $r$ uniformly distributed on an interval $[a, b]$ is $f(r) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $r \\in [a, b]$ and $f(r)=0$ otherwise. For our case, $a = -\\epsilon/2$ and $b = \\epsilon/2$, so the PDF is:\n$$f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon/2 - (-\\epsilon/2)} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}, \\quad \\text{for } r \\in [-\\epsilon/2, \\epsilon/2]$$\nThe variance of $r$ is defined as $\\mathrm{Var}(r) = E[r^2] - (E[r])^2$. We calculate the expected value, $E[r]$, first:\n$$E[r] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} r f(r) dr = \\int_{-\\epsilon/2}^{\\epsilon/2} r \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} dr = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_{-\\epsilon/2}^{\\epsilon/2}$$\n$$E[r] = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4} - \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4} \\right) = 0$$\nThe expected value of the rounding error is $0$. Now we calculate the expected value of the square of the rounding error, $E[r^2]$:\n$$E[r^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} r^2 f(r) dr = \\int_{-\\epsilon/2}^{\\epsilon/2} r^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} dr = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{-\\epsilon/2}^{\\epsilon/2}$$\n$$E[r^2] = \\frac{1}{3\\epsilon} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{8} - \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{8}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\epsilon} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\epsilon} \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{4} = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{12}$$\nNow we can compute the variance of a single rounding error:\n$$\\sigma_r^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(r) = E[r^2] - (E[r])^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{12} - 0^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{12}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into our expression for the variance of the total error after $N$ steps:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E_N) = N \\sigma_r^2 = N \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{12}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the variance of the implemented state $x_N$ relative to its ideal deterministic value $x_0 + N\\alpha$.",

The selection rule is:\n- If $AIC_c < AIC_a - 10^{-6}$, select the continuous-time ODE model (output $0$).\n- Otherwise, including the case of a tie (where $|AIC_c - AIC_a| < 10^{-6}$), select the discrete-time AR(1) model (output $1$).\n\nThis procedure provides a quantitative and objective method for discriminating between the two proposed model structures based on the provided time series data.",
