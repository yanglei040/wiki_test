            "introduction": "The first step toward mastering eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to become proficient in the fundamental algebraic calculations. This practice focuses on the core definition: for a given eigenvalue $\\lambda$, its corresponding eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}$ are the non-zero vectors that satisfy the equation $A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$. By rearranging this into $(A - \\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$, we can find the entire subspace of these eigenvectors—the eigenspace—by solving a system of linear equations. This exercise  will guide you through finding a basis for the eigenspace associated with a specific eigenvalue, a foundational skill for all applications that follow.",
