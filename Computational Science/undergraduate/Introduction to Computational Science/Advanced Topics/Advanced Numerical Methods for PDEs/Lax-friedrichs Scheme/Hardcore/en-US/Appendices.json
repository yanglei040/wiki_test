            "problem": "You are to write a complete and runnable program that empirically maps the stability region of the Lax–Friedrichs scheme applied to the constant-coefficient linear advection equation $u_t + a\\,u_x = 0$, and then compares this empirical region to the theoretical bound given by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. Work from first principles by using the standard Fourier stability (von Neumann) reasoning: on a uniform grid, linear, translation-invariant schemes admit plane-wave modes $e^{\\mathrm{i}(j\\theta - n\\omega)}$ and thus a one-step amplification factor $g(\\theta,\\lambda)$, where $\\theta$ is the nondimensional wavenumber and $\\lambda$ is the nondimensional time-step parameter. For the Lax–Friedrichs scheme constructed via two-point averaging in space combined with a centered difference for the flux and explicit forward Euler in time, this amplification factor can be derived from the scheme definition and used to test stability by verifying whether $\\lvert g(\\theta,\\lambda)\\rvert \\le 1$ for all $\\theta$.\n\nYour program must implement the following tasks purely numerically:\n- Sweep a set of nondimensional time-step parameters $\\lambda = a\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ across a specified interval, and for each $\\lambda$ sweep the nondimensional wavenumber $\\theta$ over the interval $[0,\\pi]$ (angles in radians). For each pair $(\\lambda,\\theta)$ compute the magnitude of the one-step amplification factor $\\lvert g(\\theta,\\lambda)\\rvert$ that is implied by the Lax–Friedrichs scheme and Fourier mode analysis.

            "solution": "The problem requires an empirical validation of the stability region for the Lax-Friedrichs numerical scheme applied to the one-dimensional linear advection equation, $u_t + a u_x = 0$. The analysis is to be performed from first principles using Fourier (von Neumann) stability analysis and compared against the theoretical Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit form of the Lax-Friedrichs scheme and its amplification factor. The scheme is constructed on a uniform grid with spatial step $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$. Let $u_j^n$ denote the numerical approximation of the solution $u(x_j, t_n)$ at grid point $x_j = j\\Delta x$ and time level $t_n = n\\Delta t$. The scheme is defined by a forward Euler step in time, where the value $u_j^n$ is replaced by a spatial average, and the spatial derivative $u_x$ is approximated by a centered difference. The equation $u_t = -a u_x$ is thus discretized as:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - \\frac{1}{2}(u_{j+1}^n + u_{j-1}^n)}{\\Delta t} = -a \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n}{2\\Delta x} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $u_j^{n+1}$ yields:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{j+1}^n + u_{j-1}^n) - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{2\\Delta x}(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nBy defining the nondimensional Courant number $\\lambda = a \\Delta t / \\Delta x$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{j+1}^n + u_{j-1}^n) - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nGrouping terms by their spatial indices gives the final form of the scheme:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\lambda}{2}\\right) u_{j+1}^n + \\left(\\frac{1 + \\lambda}{2}\\right) u_{j-1}^n\n$$\nFor von Neumann stability analysis, we substitute a single Fourier mode, $u_j^n = g^n(\\theta, \\lambda) e^{\\mathrm{i} j \\theta}$, into the scheme. Here, $\\theta$ is the nondimensional wavenumber and $g(\\theta, \\lambda)$ is the one-step amplification factor.\n$$\ng^{n+1} e^{\\mathrm{i} j \\theta} = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\lambda}{2}\\right) g^n e^{\\mathrm{i} (j+1) \\theta} + \\left(\\frac{1 + \\lambda}{2}\\right) g^n e^{\\mathrm{i} (j-1) \\theta}\n$$\nDividing by $g^n e^{\\mathrm{i} j \\theta}$, we obtain the expression for the amplification factor $g \\equiv g(\\theta, \\lambda)$:\n$$\ng = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\lambda}{2}\\right) e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta} + \\left(\\frac{1 + \\lambda}{2}\\right) e^{-\\mathrm{i} \\theta}\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{\\pm \\mathrm{i} \\theta} = \\cos\\theta \\pm \\mathrm{i}\\sin\\theta$, we can separate the real and imaginary parts of $g$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} (e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta} + e^{-\\mathrm{i} \\theta}) - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta} - e^{-\\mathrm{i} \\theta}) = \\cos\\theta - \\lambda (\\mathrm{i}\\sin\\theta)\n$$\nSo, the amplification factor is $g(\\theta, \\lambda) = \\cos\\theta - \\mathrm{i}\\lambda\\sin\\theta$.\n\nFor the scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed $1$ for any wavenumber $\\theta$, i.e., $\\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert \\le 1$. The magnitude is computed as:\n$$\n\\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert = \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{Re}(g))^2 + (\\mathrm{Im}(g))^2} = \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + (-\\lambda\\sin\\theta)^2} = \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + \\lambda^2\\sin^2\\theta}\n$$\nThe stability condition is therefore $\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + \\lambda^2\\sin^2\\theta} \\le 1$. Since both sides are non-negative, we can square them:\n$$\n\\cos^2\\theta + \\lambda^2\\sin^2\\theta \\le 1\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2\\theta = 1 - \\sin^2\\theta$, we get:\n$$\n1 - \\sin^2\\theta + \\lambda^2\\sin^2\\theta \\le 1 \\implies (\\lambda^2 - 1)\\sin^2\\theta \\le 0\n$$\nSince $\\sin^2\\theta \\ge 0$ for all real $\\theta$, this inequality holds for all $\\theta$ if and only if the coefficient $(\\lambda^2 - 1)$ is non-positive:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 1 \\le 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 \\le 1 \\implies \\lvert\\lambda\\rvert \\le 1\n$$\nThis is the theoretical CFL stability condition for the Lax-Friedrichs scheme. The program will empirically test this condition. The maximum value of $\\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert$ is found at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$ (where $\\lvert g \\rvert = 1$) or at $\\theta = \\pi/2$ (where $\\lvert g \\rvert = \\lvert\\lambda\\rvert$). Thus, $\\max_\\theta \\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert = \\max(1, \\lvert\\lambda\\rvert)$. The empirical stability test, $\\max_\\theta \\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert \\le 1$, is therefore analytically equivalent to the theoretical condition $\\lvert\\lambda\\rvert \\le 1$.\n\nThe program implements the following three tests:\nTest A: This test performs a fine-grained sweep of $\\lambda$ from $-1.5$ to $1.5$ with a step of $0.01$, and for each $\\lambda$, it samples $\\theta$ across $[0, \\pi]$ with $2049$ points. It compares the empirical stability indicator, `max_g <= 1 + 1e-12`, with the theoretical indicator, `abs(lambda) <= 1`. The result is `True` if they match for all $\\lambda$, and `False` otherwise.\n\nTest B: This test checks the stability boundary. For $\\lambda = -1$ and $\\lambda = 1$, the analytical result is $\\max_\\theta \\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert = 1$. The test computes the numerical value of $\\max_\\theta \\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert - 1$ for these two $\\lambda$ values using a dense sampling of $\\theta$ ($10001$ points) and reports the maximum absolute deviation, which quantifies the numerical precision.\n\nTest C: This test confirms that the scheme is unstable outside the CFL limit. It sweeps $\\lambda$ from $-2$ to $2$ with a step of $0.5$. For each $\\lambda$ where $\\lvert\\lambda\\rvert > 1$, it verifies that the computed $\\max_\\theta \\lvert g(\\theta, \\lambda) \\rvert$ is greater than $1$ by at least $10^{-9}$. A coarse grid of $33$ points for $\\theta$ is used, which is sufficient because it includes the critical point $\\theta = \\pi/2$ where the maximum amplification occurs for unstable $\\lambda$. The result is `True` if all checked $\\lambda$ values are confirmed to be unstable.",

            "introduction": "With stability confirmed, the next step is to observe a scheme's behavior in practice. This exercise places the Lax-Friedrichs scheme in a side-by-side comparison with two other foundational methods—the upwind and Lax-Wendroff schemes—to solve the classic linear advection problem. By tracking quantities like the $L^1$ norm and total variation, you will gain a firsthand understanding of numerical artifacts like dissipation and dispersion, revealing the distinct 'personality' and trade-offs of each algorithm.

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional linear advection (transport) equation $u_t + a u_x = 0$ posed on a periodic domain $x \\in [0,1]$ with constant advection speed $a$. The initial condition is a square pulse defined by $u(x,0) = 1$ for $x \\in [0.2,0.4)$ and $u(x,0) = 0$ elsewhere. The exact solution translates the pulse without distortion at speed $a$ and conserves the $L^1$ norm and the Total Variation (TV). In numerical computation, different explicit schemes introduce dissipation and dispersion that can change these quantities.\n\nStarting only from the partial differential equation $u_t + a u_x = 0$, the concept of numerical flux, and cell-average discretization on a uniform grid, derive and implement three explicit schemes: the Lax-Friedrichs scheme, the upwind (Godunov) scheme, and the Lax-Wendroff scheme. Use periodic boundary conditions. Define the uniform mesh with $N$ cells, grid spacing $\\Delta x = 1/N$, and time step $\\Delta t$ chosen by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition with $\\nu = a \\Delta t / \\Delta x$, where the CFL number is set to $\\nu = 0.9$ unless reduced to make the final time exact. Evolve the solution until final time $T = 0.5$.\n\nFor a discrete function $u_i$ on a periodic grid, define the $L^1$ norm by $\\|u\\|_1 = \\sum_i |u_i| \\Delta x$ and the Total Variation (TV) by $\\mathrm{TV}(u) = \\sum_i |u_{i+1} - u_i|$ with periodic indexing. For each scheme and grid resolution, compute the decays\n$\\Delta \\|u\\|_1 = \\|u(\\cdot,0)\\|_1 - \\|u(\\cdot,T)\\|_1$\nand\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{TV} = \\mathrm{TV}(u(\\cdot,0)) - \\mathrm{TV}(u(\\cdot,T))$.\nA positive decay indicates dissipation. Negative values indicate growth due to numerical oscillations.\n\nImplement a single program that, for each specified test case, computes these decays for the Lax-Friedrichs, upwind, and Lax-Wendroff schemes, in that order. The program must use periodic boundary conditions, choose $\\Delta t$ to satisfy the stated CFL and end exactly at $T$, and report results rounded to six decimal places.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter values to assess grid refinement, stability limits, and directionality:\n- Case $1$: $N = 40$, $a = 1.0$.\n- Case $2$: $N = 80$, $a = 1.0$.\n- Case $3$: $N = 160$, $a = 1.0$.\n- Case $4$: $N = 80$, $a = -1.0$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each case, output six numbers in the fixed order: $\\Delta \\|u\\|_1$ for Lax-Friedrichs, $\\Delta \\mathrm{TV}$ for Lax-Friedrichs, $\\Delta \\|u\\|_1$ for upwind, $\\Delta \\mathrm{TV}$ for upwind, $\\Delta \\|u\\|_1$ for Lax-Wendroff, $\\Delta \\mathrm{TV}$ for Lax-Wendroff. Concatenate these six numbers for Case $1$, then for Case $2$, Case $3$, and Case $4$. The final output thus contains twenty-four numbers formatted as described, for example:\n$[\\Delta\\|u\\|_1^{\\mathrm{LF},1},\\Delta\\mathrm{TV}^{\\mathrm{LF},1},\\Delta\\|u\\|_1^{\\mathrm{UP},1},\\Delta\\mathrm{TV}^{\\mathrm{UP},1},\\Delta\\|u\\|_1^{\\mathrm{LW},1},\\Delta\\mathrm{TV}^{\\mathrm{LW},1},\\ldots,\\Delta\\|u\\|_1^{\\mathrm{LW},4},\\Delta\\mathrm{TV}^{\\mathrm{LW},4}]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of three finite volume schemes for the linear advection equation, $u_t + a u_x = 0$. We start with the integral form of the conservation law over a grid cell $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ of width $\\Delta x$, which leads to the semi-discrete update for the cell-average $u_i(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_i}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\left(F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nwhere $F_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux at the interface between cells $i$ and $i+1$. For linear advection, the physical flux is $f(u) = au$. Using a forward Euler time step $\\Delta t$, the fully discrete scheme is:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}\\right)\n$$\nThe schemes differ in their definition of the numerical flux $F_{i+1/2}$, which is a function of the states $u_i^n$ and $u_{i+1}^n$. We define the Courant number $\\nu = a \\Delta t / \\Delta x$.\n\n### 1. Lax-Friedrichs Scheme\nThe Lax-Friedrichs flux is an average of the physical fluxes at the left and right states, plus a maximal dissipation term:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2}^{\\text{LF}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(au_i^n + au_{i+1}^n\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the update formula gives:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{a}{2}(u_i^n+u_{i+1}^n) - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\Delta t}(u_{i+1}^n-u_i^n)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{2}(u_{i-1}^n+u_i^n) - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\Delta t}(u_i^n-u_{i-1}^n)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis can be simplified to the more familiar two-step interpretation: a spatial average followed by a centered difference step. Rearranging terms leads to the stencil implemented in the code:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n + u_{i-1}^n\\right) - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\n\n### 2. Upwind (Godunov) Scheme\nThe upwind scheme uses information from the direction of wave propagation. For linear advection, this means the flux is simply the physical flux evaluated at the \"upwind\" state.\n- If $a > 0$, the information travels from left to right, so we take the left state: $F_{i+1/2}^{\\text{Upwind}} = f(u_i^n) = au_i^n$.\n- If $a  0$, the information travels from right to left, so we take the right state: $F_{i+1/2}^{\\text{Upwind}} = f(u_{i+1}^n) = au_{i+1}^n$.\n\nFor $a > 0$, the update becomes:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(au_i^n - au_{i-1}^n\\right) = u_i^n - \\nu\\left(u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\nFor $a  0$, the update becomes:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(au_{i+1}^n - au_i^n\\right) = u_i^n - \\nu\\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n\\right)\n$$\nThis scheme is first-order and known for being very dissipative, but it is also monotone.\n\n### 3. Lax-Wendroff Scheme\nThe Lax-Wendroff scheme is a second-order method in both space and time. It can be derived using a Taylor expansion in time or, more formally, via a two-step predictor-corrector method (the Richtmyer method). Its numerical flux is:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2}^{\\text{LW}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(f(u_i^n) + f(u_{i+1}^n)\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\frac{a^2}{\\Delta x} \\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n\\right) = \\frac{a}{2}\\left(u_i^n + u_{i+1}^n\\right) - \\frac{a \\nu}{2} \\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the finite volume update formula yields the single-step stencil:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n\\right) + \\frac{\\nu^2}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\nThis scheme is less dissipative than the first-order schemes but is not monotone and can introduce spurious oscillations (dispersion errors) near sharp features.\n\nThe implementation calculates the decay in the $L^1$ norm and Total Variation (TV) for each scheme. The $L^1$ norm measures total mass, which should be conserved. The TV measures the \"spikiness\" of the solution; a decay in TV indicates dissipation (smoothing), while a growth indicates oscillations.",

            "problem": "You are asked to construct and analyze a numerical experiment in the setting of one-dimensional nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that demonstrates a failure mode of the Lax–Friedrichs (LF) scheme when its single-speed dissipation parameter underestimates true local wave speeds, and then to implement a remedy. The fundamental base for the derivation must begin from the conservation law $U_t + F(U)_x = 0$, where $U$ is the vector of conserved variables and $F(U)$ is the flux, evolved by a finite volume method on a uniform grid. The test model must be scientifically realistic and self-consistent, explicitly state physical units where relevant, and be solved with programmatic logic that is applicable in any modern programming language.\n\nScenario:\n- Consider the one-dimensional shallow water equations on a periodic domain, a nonlinear system of conservation laws for water depth and momentum:\n  - Conserved variables: $U = \\begin{bmatrix} h \\\\ q \\end{bmatrix}$, where $h$ is water depth (in $\\mathrm{m}$) and $q = h u$ is discharge (in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$), with velocity $u$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$).\n  - Physical flux: $F(U) = \\begin{bmatrix} q \\\\ \\dfrac{q^2}{h} + \\dfrac{1}{2} g h^2 \\end{bmatrix}$, with gravitational acceleration $g$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s^2}$).\n  - Characteristic wave speeds: $\\lambda_{\\pm} = u \\pm \\sqrt{g h}$, hence any stable LF dissipation parameter must satisfy $\\alpha \\ge \\max(|u| + \\sqrt{g h})$ in the region of interest.\n\nTask:\n- Implement a first-order explicit finite volume method using the Lax–Friedrichs interface flux on a uniform grid over the periodic interval $[0, L]$ with $L$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), and evolve to a final time $T$ (in $\\mathrm{s}$).\n- Design initial conditions with a localized depth bump that increases the local wave speeds relative to a far-field reference. Specifically, use\n  - Base depth $h_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$).\n  - A Gaussian bump of amplitude $A$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) centered at $x_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) with width parameter $\\sigma$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), superimposed on $h_0$.\n  - Initial discharge $q(x, 0) = 0$ (i.e., $u(x, 0) = 0$).\n- Compare two LF dissipation strategies:\n  1. A single-speed estimate: $\\alpha_{\\text{single}} = \\beta \\left(|u_{\\infty}| + \\sqrt{g h_{\\infty}}\\right)$, where $h_{\\infty} = h_0$ and $u_{\\infty} = 0$ represent far-field reference values. The scaling factor $\\beta$ is chosen to be less than $1$ in some tests to intentionally underestimate local speeds; the time step is selected as $\\Delta t_{\\text{single}} = \\mathrm{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / \\alpha_{\\text{single}}$.\n  2. A local-speed remedy: for each interface, use $\\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\max\\!\\left(|u_i| + \\sqrt{g h_i},\\,|u_{i+1}| + \\sqrt{g h_{i+1}}\\right)$ and select the time step as $\\Delta t_{\\text{local}} = \\mathrm{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / \\max_i \\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, ensuring global compliance with the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.\n- Use periodic boundary conditions and a positivity check: declare instability if any $h$ becomes nonpositive at any time or if any value becomes nonfinite (not a number or infinite).\n\nAlgorithmic specification:\n- Uniform grid with $N$ cells, grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, and explicit update using the Lax–Friedrichs numerical flux at interfaces. You must implement both the naive single-speed scheme and the local-speed remedy within the same program and evaluate their stability on the defined test suite.\n\nNumerical and physical parameters:\n- Domain length $L$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), gravitational acceleration $g$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s^2}$), base depth $h_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), bump center $x_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), bump width $\\sigma$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), final time $T$ (in $\\mathrm{s}$), number of cells $N$ (unitless), and Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number (unitless).\n\nTest suite:\n- You must run the program for the following parameter sets, each given as a tuple $(A,\\beta)$:\n  - Case $1$ (happy path, no underestimation): $(A = 0.05,\\, \\beta = 1.0)$.\n  - Case $2$ (underestimation causing instability): $(A = 0.8,\\, \\beta = 0.7)$.\n  - Case $3$ (strong underestimation causing instability): $(A = 1.5,\\, \\beta = 0.6)$.\n- Fixed parameters for all cases:\n  - $L = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $h_0 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $x_0 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $T = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $N = 200$, $\\mathrm{CFL} = 0.9$ for the local-speed remedy, and $\\mathrm{CFL} = 0.95$ for the single-speed estimate.\n\nQuantifiable outputs:\n- For each case, compute a pair of booleans $[\\text{stable}_{\\text{single}}, \\text{stable}_{\\text{local}}]$ indicating whether the single-speed LF scheme and the local-speed LF remedy scheme remain numerically stable up to time $T$ under the stated positivity and finiteness criteria.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where the list has one element per test case, and each element is itself a list of two booleans $[\\text{stable}_{\\text{single}}, \\text{stable}_{\\text{local}}]$. For example, the format must look like $[[\\text{True},\\text{False}],[\\text{True},\\text{True}],[\\text{False},\\text{True}]]$ (this is only an illustrative format, not the expected numerical answers).",

Combined with a time step based on $\\alpha_{\\text{single}}$, the update can violate the positivity of $h$ or produce nonphysical oscillations leading to nonfinite values.\n- A scientifically plausible way to produce this underestimation is to initialize a localized bump in depth $h(x,0)$ on top of a far-field constant $h_0$, which increases $\\sqrt{g h}$ locally. If $\\alpha_{\\text{single}}$ is computed from far-field values $h_0$ and $u_{\\infty} = 0$ (and then scaled by $\\beta  1$), the true local speeds near the bump are larger than $\\alpha_{\\text{single}}$, breaking the underlying assumption for LF stability.\n\nRemedy:\n- Use a local Lax–Friedrichs dissipation parameter at each interface,\n$$\n\\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n = \\max\\!\\left(|u_i^n| + \\sqrt{g h_i^n},\\,|u_{i+1}^n| + \\sqrt{g h_{i+1}^n}\\right),\n$$\nand select a time step via the global maximum of these local values,\n$$\n\\Delta t^n = \\mathrm{CFL} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\max\\limits_{i}\\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n}.\n$$\nThis design respects the requirement that the numerical dissipation bound the local spectral radius of the flux Jacobian and ensures compliance with the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.\n\nAlgorithmic steps integrated with principles:\n- Initialize the grid over $[0, L]$ with $N$ cells and periodic boundary conditions.\n- Set physical parameters $g$, $h_0$ and the Gaussian bump for $h(x,0) = h_0 + A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$, with $q(x,0) = 0$ so that $u(x,0) = 0$.\n- For the single-speed LF scheme:\n  - Set $\\alpha_{\\text{single}} = \\beta\\left(|u_{\\infty}| + \\sqrt{g h_{\\infty}}\\right)$ with $u_{\\infty} = 0$ and $h_{\\infty} = h_0$.\n  - Use a fixed time step $\\Delta t_{\\text{single}} = \\mathrm{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / \\alpha_{\\text{single}}$ and update via the LF flux with constant $\\alpha_{\\text{single}}$ at all interfaces.\n- For the local-speed remedy:\n  - At each step, compute $\\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n = \\max\\!\\left(|u_i^n| + \\sqrt{g h_i^n},\\,|u_{i+1}^n| + \\sqrt{g h_{i+1}^n}\\right)$ at all interfaces.\n  - Select $\\Delta t^n = \\mathrm{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / \\max_i \\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n$ and update via the LF flux using the per-interface $\\alpha_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n$.\n- At each step for both schemes, check positivity $h_i^n  0$ and finiteness; if violated, declare instability and stop.\n\nTest suite and expected behavior:\n- Case $1$: $(A = 0.05, \\beta = 1.0)$ produces local speeds close to far-field values, so both schemes are expected to be stable.\n- Case $2$: $(A = 0.8, \\beta = 0.7)$ produces local speeds substantially larger than $\\alpha_{\\text{single}}$, likely destabilizing the single-speed scheme, while the local-speed remedy remains stable.\n- Case $3$: $(A = 1.5, \\beta = 0.6)$ produces even larger local speeds, strongly destabilizing the single-speed scheme, while the local-speed remedy remains stable.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each case, return a pair of booleans $[\\text{stable}_{\\text{single}}, \\text{stable}_{\\text{local}}]$.\n- Aggregate the three case results into a single line as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $[[\\text{True},\\text{False}],[\\text{True},\\text{True}],[\\text{False},\\text{True}]]$.\n\nThis experiment directly connects the principle that the Lax–Friedrichs dissipation must bound the local spectral radius of the flux Jacobian to practical algorithmic design: underestimation of $\\alpha$ in a nonlinear system leads to instability, while computing a local $\\alpha$ at interfaces and selecting $\\Delta t$ by the global maximum of local speeds remedies the issue by enforcing sufficient numerical viscosity and the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.",
