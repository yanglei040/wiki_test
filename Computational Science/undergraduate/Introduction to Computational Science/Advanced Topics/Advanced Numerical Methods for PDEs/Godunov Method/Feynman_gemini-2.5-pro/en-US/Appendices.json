This problem requires you to perform a single time-step update for a specific cell using the finite volume formulation. By manually calculating the numerical fluxes from the solutions to local Riemann problems for the Burgers' equation, you will see directly how information about waves (in this case, shocks) at cell interfaces determines the evolution of the solution. This practice  is essential for grasping the fundamental \"building block\" of the entire scheme.",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation, which serves as a prototype for equations with shocks:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^2 \\right) = 0 $$\nThis equation is a conservation law of the form $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} = 0$, with flux $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^2$.\n\nWe wish to solve this equation numerically using the Godunov method, which is a finite volume scheme. The spatial domain is divided into cells of uniform width $\\Delta x$, centered at $x_i = i \\Delta x$. The value $U_i^n$ represents the average value of the solution $u(x, t)$ over cell $i$ at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$.\n\nThe update formula for the cell average in one time step is given by:\n$$ U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2} \\right) $$\nwhere $F_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$.\n\nIn the Godunov method, the flux $F_{i+1/2}$ is determined by solving the Riemann problem at the interface $x_{i+1/2}$ with initial data $u(x,t_n) = U_i^n$ for $x  x_{i+1/2}$ and $u(x,t_n) = U_{i+1}^n$ for $x > x_{i+1/2}$. Let us denote the left and right states as $u_L=U_i^n$ and $u_R=U_{i+1}^n$. The Godunov flux is $F_{i+1/2} = f(u_{RP}(0))$, where $u_{RP}(0)$ is the value of the Riemann problem solution along the line $x-x_{i+1/2}=0$. The rules for finding $u_{RP}(0)$ for the Burgers' equation are as follows:\n1.  If $u_L > u_R$, the solution is a shock wave. The shock speed is given by the Rankine-Hugoniot condition $s = \\frac{f(u_R)-f(u_L)}{u_R-u_L} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_L+u_R)$. If the shock moves to the right ($s > 0$), the state at the interface is $u_L$. If it moves to the left ($s  0$), the state is $u_R$. If $s=0$, the flux is $f(u_L)=f(u_R)$.\n2.  If $u_L  u_R$, the solution is a rarefaction wave. The value at the interface is $u_{RP}(0) = 0$ if $u_L \\le 0 \\le u_R$. If $u_L$ and $u_R$ have the same sign, then $u_{RP}(0) = u_L$ if $u_L > 0$, and $u_{RP}(0) = u_R$ if $u_R  0$.\n\nConsider the following piecewise constant initial state for the cell averages at time $t=0$:\n$$ U_i^0 = \\begin{cases} 3V  \\text{for } i \\le -1 \\\\ V  \\text{for } i = 0 \\\\ -2V  \\text{for } i \\ge 1 \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $V$ is a positive constant.

Let $U_i(t)$ be the cell average of the solution in cell $i$ at time $t$. The semi-discrete finite volume formulation of the conservation law is\n$$\n\\frac{dU_i}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\hat{F}_{i+1/2} - \\hat{F}_{i-1/2} \\right) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{F}_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$. A forward Euler time discretization gives the fully discrete update formula:\n$$\nU_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\hat{F}_{i+1/2}^n - \\hat{F}_{i-1/2}^n \\right),\n$$\nwhere $U_i^n$ is the approximation of the cell average at time $t^n = n\\Delta t$, and $\\hat{F}_{i+1/2}^n$ is the flux computed from the solution at time $t^n$. The physical flux for this equation is $F(u) = a\\,u$.\n\nThe problem specifies two methods, which differ in their definition of the numerical flux.\n\n**Godunov's Method**\nGodunov's method defines the numerical flux by solving the exact Riemann problem at each cell interface. The Riemann problem at interface $x_{i+1/2}$ has the initial condition\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases} U_i^n,  x  x_{i+1/2} \\\\ U_{i+1}^n,  x  x_{i+1/2}. \\end{cases}\n$$\nFor the linear advection equation $u_t + a u_x = 0$, the characteristics are straight lines with slope $1/a$. The solution to the Riemann problem is constant along these characteristics. The value at the interface $x=x_{i+1/2}$ is determined by the characteristic that passes through it. Since the problem specifies $a=1>0$, the information travels from left to right. Therefore, the solution at the interface is the value from the left state, $U_i^n$.\nThe numerical flux is then the physical flux evaluated at this interface value:\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+1/2}^n = F(U_i^n) = a\\,U_i^n.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the finite volume update formula gives:\n$$\nU_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( a\\,U_i^n - a\\,U_{i-1}^n \\right).\n$$\nThis is the first-order upwind scheme, which is appropriate for $a>0$.\n\n**Lax-Friedrichs Method**\nThe Lax-Friedrichs method is another first-order scheme. Its numerical flux can be derived from a staggered grid formulation or defined directly. A common form for its numerical flux is\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+1/2}^n = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( F(U_i^n) + F(U_{i+1}^n) \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\left( U_{i+1}^n - U_i^n \\right).\n$$\nThe first term is a simple average of the fluxes from the left and right states, which corresponds to a central difference scheme. The second term is a numerical diffusion term, proportional to $\\Delta x / \\Delta t$, which is necessary for stability. Substituting $F(u)=a\\,u$ gives\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+1/2}^n = \\frac{a}{2}\\left( U_i^n + U_{i+1}^n \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\left( U_{i+1}^n - U_i^n \\right).\n$$\nSubstituting this flux into the conservation law update yields a direct update formula. This form simplifies to:\n$$\nU_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( U_{i+1}^n + U_{i-1}^n \\right) - \\frac{a\\,\\Delta t}{2\\,\\Delta x}\\left( U_{i+1}^n - U_{i-1}^n \\right).\n$$\nThis form is computationally convenient. Both Godunov's and Lax-Friedrichs' methods are first-order accurate in space and time. They are known to be dissipative, which tends to smear out sharp features like the discontinuities in the square wave initial condition. The Lax-Friedrichs method is generally more diffusive than the upwind (Godunov) method.\n\n**Implementation Details**\nThe simulation proceeds as follows for each value of $N \\in \\{100, 200, 400\\}$ and each method:\n\n1.  **Grid and Initialization**: A uniform grid with $N$ cells is defined. The spatial step is $\\Delta x = 1/N$. An array $U$ of size $N$ stores the cell averages. The initial state $U^0$ is populated by evaluating the initial condition $u_0(x)$ at the cell centers $x_i = (i+0.5)\\Delta x$.\n    $$\n    U_i^0 = u_0(x_i).\n    $$\n\n2.  **Time Stepping**: The time step $\\Delta t$ is determined by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. With a given CFL number of $0.9$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t = \\text{CFL} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|} = 0.9 \\Delta x.\n    $$\n    The solution is advanced in time from $t=0$ to the final time $T=0.2$. A loop is used which continues as long as the current time $t$ is less than $T$. On the final step, if $t + \\Delta t  T$, the time step is adjusted to $\\Delta t' = T - t$ to ensure the simulation terminates exactly at $T$.\n\n3.  **Boundary Conditions**: The problem specifies periodic boundary conditions on the domain $[0,1)$. For a cell $i=0$, the left neighbor is cell $N-1$. For a cell $i=N-1$, the right neighbor is cell $0$. In the implementation, this is handled using array manipulations, such as `numpy.roll`, to access the states $U_{i-1}$ and $U_{i+1}$ for all $i$ simultaneously.\n\n4.  **Error Calculation**: After the simulation reaches $T=0.2$, the numerical solution is an array $U^N_{final}$. The discrete $L^1$-error is computed by comparing this numerical solution to the exact solution evaluated at the cell centers $x_i$. The exact solution at time $T$ is $u(x_i, T) = u_0((x_i - aT)\\pmod 1)$. The error is\n    $$\n    E_{L^1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left| U_{i,final}^N - u(x_i, T) \\right| \\Delta x.\n    $$\n    This value quantifies the total absolute difference between the numerical and exact solutions, integrated over the domain. It is a measure of the numerical scheme's accuracy and, in this case, primarily its numerical diffusion.\n\nThe procedure is repeated for each configuration (Lax-Friedrichs for $N=100, 200, 400$ and Godunov for $N=100, 200, 400$), and the six resulting $E_{L^1}$ error values are reported.",

We will employ a finite volume method on a uniform grid over the domain $[0,1]$ with $N=200$ cells of width $\\Delta x = 1/200$.\n\nA finite volume scheme evolves the cell averages, $u_i(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u(x,t) dx$, over time. The semi-discrete form of the conservation law is:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_i}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left( F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $F_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$.\n\nTo achieve second-order accuracy in space, we use the Monotonic Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) approach. This involves reconstructing a piecewise-linear representation of the solution within each cell at the beginning of each time step. Within cell $i$, the solution is approximated as:\n$$\nu(x, t^n) = u_i^n + \\frac{\\sigma_i}{\\Delta x}(x-x_i)\n$$\nwhere $u_i^n$ is the cell average at time $t^n$, $x_i$ is the center of cell $i$, and $\\sigma_i$ is a limited slope. The slope must be limited to prevent the generation of new extrema and ensure the scheme is Total Variation Diminishing (TVD). The slope $\\sigma_i$ is computed based on the adjacent cell averages. Let $\\Delta_i^- = u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n$ and $\\Delta_i^+ = u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n$. The limited slope $\\sigma_i$ is a function of these differences, $\\sigma_i = \\text{limiter}(\\Delta_i^-, \\Delta_i^+)$. We will implement three standard limiters:\n\n1.  **Minmod Limiter:** This is the most dissipative TVD limiter.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_i = \\text{minmod}(\\Delta_i^-, \\Delta_i^+) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{sgn}(\\Delta_i^-) + \\text{sgn}(\\Delta_i^+)) \\min(|\\Delta_i^-|, |\\Delta_i^+|)\n    $$\n    It returns the argument with the smallest magnitude if both have the same sign, and zero otherwise.\n\n2.  **Monotonized Central (MC) Limiter:** A more accurate limiter that aims to be as close to a central difference as possible without violating monotonicity.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_i = \\text{minmod}\\left(2\\Delta_i^-, \\frac{\\Delta_i^- + \\Delta_i^+}{2}, 2\\Delta_i^+\\right)\n    $$\n    Here, the `minmod` function is extended to multiple arguments: it returns the argument with the smallest magnitude if all arguments have the same sign, and zero otherwise.\n\n3.  **Superbee Limiter:** A highly compressive limiter, which produces sharp profiles for discontinuities but is more prone to overshoots.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_i = \\text{sgn}(\\Delta_i^-) \\max\\left( |\\text{minmod}(\\Delta_i^-, 2\\Delta_i^+)|, |\\text{minmod}(2\\Delta_i^-, \\Delta_i^+)| \\right)\n    $$\n    This selects the steeper of two minmod-limited slopes.\n\nWith the limited slopes, we reconstruct the solution values at the left and right sides of each interface $x_{i+1/2}$:\n$$\nu_{L, i+1/2} = u_i^n + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_i\n$$\n$$\nu_{R, i+1/2} = u_{i+1}^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{i+1}\n$$\nThese values serve as the initial data for a Riemann problem at each interface. Periodic boundary conditions are enforced by treating cell $N-1$ as the neighbor of cell $0$, and vice-versa, when computing slopes and fluxes at the domain boundaries.\n\nThe numerical flux $F_{i+1/2}$ is given by the Godunov flux, which is derived from the exact solution of the Riemann problem with initial states $(u_L, u_R) = (u_{L, i+1/2}, u_{R, i+1/2})$. For the convex flux $f(u)=u^2/2$, the solution depends on the relative values of $u_L$ and $u_R$:\n\n-   If $u_L > u_R$, the solution is a shock wave traveling at speed $s = (f(u_R) - f(u_L))/(u_R - u_L) = (u_L + u_R)/2$. The state at the interface ($x/t=0$) is $u_L$ if $s > 0$ and $u_R$ if $s  0$. The flux is $f(u_L)$ or $f(u_R)$ accordingly. We use the convention that for $s=0$, the flux is $f(u_L)$.\n-   If $u_L \\leq u_R$, the solution is a rarefaction wave. The state at the interface is determined by the characteristic speed $f'(u) = u$. If the range $[u_L, u_R]$ contains $u=0$, the state at the interface is $u=0$ and the flux is $f(0)=0$. Otherwise, if $u_L>0$, the state is $u_L$; if $u_R0$, the state is $u_R$.\n\nThe time integration is performed using a simple forward Euler method, $u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\Delta t \\frac{du_i}{dt}$. The time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen adaptively to satisfy the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\min\\left( \\nu \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\max_i |u_i^n|}, T - t^n \\right)\n$$\nwith a Courant number $\\nu = 0.9$. A small tolerance $\\epsilon$ is added to the denominator to prevent division by zero if all cell averages are zero.\n\nThe complete algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Initialize cell averages $u_i^0$ based on the given step function.\n2.  Start the time loop, continuing until $t=T$.\n3.  Calculate the stable time step $\\Delta t$.\n4.  Compute the limited slope $\\sigma_i$ for each cell $i$, handling periodic boundaries.\n5.  Reconstruct the interface states $u_{L, i+1/2}$ and $u_{R, i+1/2}$ for all interfaces.\n6.  Calculate the Godunov flux $F_{i+1/2}$ at each interface.\n7.  Update all cell averages $u_i$ using the conservative finite volume formula.\n8.  Increment time $t = t + \\Delta t$.\n9.  After the final time step, compute the overshoot and undershoot metrics from the final solution profile.",
