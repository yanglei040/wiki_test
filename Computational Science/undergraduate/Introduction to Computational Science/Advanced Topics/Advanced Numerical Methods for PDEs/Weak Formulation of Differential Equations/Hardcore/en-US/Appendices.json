            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the weak formulation for the one-dimensional Poisson equation, the identification of the associated functional-analytic objects, and the computation of the squared energy norm of the exact solution for a specific source term.\n\nFirst, we derive the weak formulation. The strong form of the boundary value problem is given by:\nFind a function $u$ such that\n$$-u''(x) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1)$$\nwith homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$.\n\nFollowing the prescribed method, we multiply the differential equation by an arbitrary test function $v(x)$ and integrate over the domain $\\Omega = (0,1)$:\n$$-\\int_{0}^{1} u''(x) v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) v(x) \\, dx$$\nTo move the derivative from $u$ to $v$, we apply integration by parts to the left-hand side. The integration by parts formula, $\\int_{a}^{b} g(x)h'(x) \\, dx = [g(x)h(x)]_{a}^{b} - \\int_{a}^{b} g'(x)h(x) \\, dx$, is a consequence of integrating the product rule for derivatives. Let $h'(x) = u''(x)$ and $g(x) = v(x)$. Then $h(x) = u'(x)$ and $g'(x) = v'(x)$. The left-hand side becomes:\n$$-\\int_{0}^{1} v(x) u''(x) \\, dx = - \\left( [v(x)u'(x)]_{0}^{1} - \\int_{0}^{1} v'(x)u'(x) \\, dx \\right)$$\n$$= \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx - [v(1)u'(1) - v(0)u'(0)]$$\nThe solution $u$ must satisfy the essential boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. To ensure the boundary term $[v(x)u'(x)]_{0}^{1}$ vanishes for any such $u$, we require the test function $v$ to also satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, i.e., $v(0)=0$ and $v(1)=0$. With this constraint on $v$, the boundary term is identically zero.\n\nThe original integrated equation simplifies to what is known as the weak or variational formulation:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)v(x) \\, dx$$\nThis equation must hold for all valid test functions $v$.\n\nNext, we identify the appropriate function spaces. The weak formulation involves integrals of functions and their first derivatives. For these integrals to be finite (well-defined), the functions and their derivatives must be at least square-integrable over the domain $(0,1)$. The space of functions $w$ for which both $w \\in L^2(0,1)$ and its weak derivative $w' \\in L^2(0,1)$ is the Sobolev space $H^1(0,1)$, as defined in the problem. Both the solution $u$ (the trial function) and the test function $v$ must belong to $H^1(0,1)$.\n\nFurthermore, both $u$ and $v$ must satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The subspace of $H^1(0,1)$ containing functions that vanish at the boundary is denoted $H_0^1(0,1)$. This is the correct space for both the trial and test functions.\nSo, the trial space is $V = H_0^1(0,1)$ and the test space is also $V = H_0^1(0,1)$.\nThe weak problem is: Find $u \\in H_0^1(0,1)$ such that $\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)v(x) \\, dx$ for all $v \\in H_0^1(0,1)$.\n\nThis problem is in the abstract form required by the Lax-Milgram theorem: find $u \\in V$ such that $a(u,v) = L(v)$ for all $v \\in V$. By comparing our weak formulation to this abstract form, we identify:\nThe bilinear form: $a(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx$.\nThe linear functional: $L(v) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)v(x) \\, dx$.\nThe function space $V=H_0^1(0,1)$ is a Hilbert space, and for a source term $f \\in L^2(0,1)$, the bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is continuous and coercive (by the Poincaré-Friedrichs inequality) and the linear functional $L(\\cdot)$ is continuous. This guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the weak problem.\n\nFinally, we specialize to the case $f(x)=1$ and compute the squared energy norm of the exact solution, defined by $\\|u\\|_{E}^{2} = a(u,u)$.\nFirst, we find the exact solution to the strong form: $-u''(x) = 1$ with $u(0)=u(1)=0$.\nIntegrating once with respect to $x$ yields:\n$-u'(x) = x + C_1$\nIntegrating a second time yields:\n$-u(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C_1x + C_2 \\implies u(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - C_1x - C_2$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$u(0) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 - C_1(0) - C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$.\n$u(1) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 - C_1(1) - 0 = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2} - C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting the constants, the exact solution is:\n$u(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - (-\\frac{1}{2})x = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x(1-x)$.\n\nThe squared energy norm is $\\|u\\|_{E}^{2}=a(u,u) = \\int_{0}^{1} (u'(x))^2 \\, dx$.\nThe derivative of the solution is $u'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - x$.\nWe compute the integral:\n$$\\|u\\|_{E}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\right)^2 \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - x + x^2\\right) \\, dx$$\n$$= \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x^3 \\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{1}{4}(1) - \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(1)^3\\right) - (0) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}$$\nUsing a common denominator of $12$:\n$$\\|u\\|_{E}^{2} = \\frac{3}{12} - \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nAlternatively, since $u$ is the solution, it satisfies $a(u,v) = L(v)$ for all $v \\in H_0^1(0,1)$. Choosing $v=u$ (which is a valid choice as $u \\in H_0^1(0,1)$), we have $a(u,u) = L(u)$.\n$$\\|u\\|_{E}^{2} = a(u,u) = L(u) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)u(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right) \\, dx$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (x - x^2) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x^3 \\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - (0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3-2}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nBoth methods confirm the result.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a four-step analysis of the function $u(x)=|x|$ on the interval $(-1,1)$ in the context of weak derivatives and weak formulations of boundary value problems.\n\n**1. Determination of the Weak First Derivative**\n\nThe weak derivative of a function $u \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(-1,1)$ is a function $w \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(-1,1)$ that satisfies the following relation for all smooth test functions $\\phi$ with compact support in $(-1,1)$, denoted $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(-1,1)$:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} u(x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx = - \\int_{-1}^{1} w(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nFor the given function $u(x) = |x|$, the integral on the left-hand side is separated at $x=0$, where the definition of $|x|$ changes:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} |x| \\phi'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} (-x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} x \\phi'(x) \\, dx $$\nWe apply integration by parts to each term. For the first integral:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{0} (-x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx = [-x \\phi(x)]_{-1}^{0} - \\int_{-1}^{0} (-1) \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nSince $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(-1,1)$, it vanishes at the boundaries of its support, so $\\phi(-1)=0$. The boundary term evaluates to $-0 \\cdot \\phi(0) - (-(-1)\\phi(-1)) = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{0} (-x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nFor the second integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} x \\phi'(x) \\, dx = [x \\phi(x)]_{0}^{1} - \\int_{0}^{1} (1) \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nSimilarly, $\\phi(1)=0$, so the boundary term $1 \\cdot \\phi(1) - 0 \\cdot \\phi(0) = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} x \\phi'(x) \\, dx = - \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nCombining these results gives the total value of the left-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} |x| \\phi'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} \\phi(x) \\, dx - \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi(x) \\, dx $$\nTo match this to the form $- \\int_{-1}^{1} w(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx$, we can write:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{0} (1) \\phi(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} (-1) \\phi(x) \\, dx = - \\left( \\int_{-1}^{0} (-1) \\phi(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} (1) \\phi(x) \\, dx \\right) $$\nThis implies that the weak derivative $w(x)$ is the function that takes the value $-1$ on $(-1,0)$ and $1$ on $(0,1)$.

Determination of the Distribution $f$**\n\nThe second weak derivative of $u$, denoted $u''$, is the weak derivative of its first weak derivative, $w(x)$. As $w(x)$ is discontinuous, its derivative must be understood in the sense of distributions. The distributional derivative $w'$ is a distribution $T_{w'}$ whose action on a test function $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(-1,1)$ is given by:\n$$ \\langle w', \\phi \\rangle = - \\int_{-1}^{1} w(x) \\phi'(x) \\, dx $$\nWe substitute the expression for $w(x)$:\n$$ \\langle w', \\phi \\rangle = - \\left( \\int_{-1}^{0} (-1) \\phi'(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} (1) \\phi'(x) \\, dx \\right) = \\int_{-1}^{0} \\phi'(x) \\, dx - \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi'(x) \\, dx $$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{0} \\phi'(x) \\, dx = \\phi(0) - \\phi(-1) $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi'(x) \\, dx = \\phi(1) - \\phi(0) $$\nSince $\\phi$ has compact support within $(-1,1)$, we have $\\phi(-1)=0$ and $\\phi(1)=0$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\langle w', \\phi \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle w', \\phi \\rangle = (\\phi(0) - 0) - (0 - \\phi(0)) = 2\\phi(0) $$\nThe action of this distribution on $\\phi$ is to multiply the value of $\\phi$ at $x=0$ by $2$. This is, by definition, the action of $2$ times the Dirac delta distribution centered at $x=0$, denoted $\\delta_0$. Thus, $u'' = w' = 2\\delta_0$.\nThe problem states that $-u''=f$. Therefore, the distribution $f$ is:\n$$ f = -2\\delta_0 $$\n\n**3. Weak Formulation of the Boundary Value Problem**\n\nWe are asked to propose a weak formulation for the problem $-u''=f$ on $(-1,1)$ with essential boundary conditions $u(-1)=1$ and $u(1)=1$, which admits $u(x)=|x|$ as a solution.\nTo derive the weak form, we multiply the differential equation $-u''=f$ by a suitable test function $v$ and integrate over the domain $(-1,1)$. In the distributional sense, this is expressed as $\\langle -u'', v \\rangle = \\langle f, v \\rangle$.\nThe term $\\langle -u'', v \\rangle$ is equivalent to $\\langle u', v' \\rangle$ after integration by parts, provided the boundary terms vanish. The formal integration by parts gives:\n$$ -\\int_{-1}^{1} u''(x)v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx - [u'(x)v(x)]_{-1}^{1} $$\nTo ensure the boundary term $[u'(x)v(x)]_{-1}^{1}$ vanishes, we require the test functions $v$ to be zero at the boundaries where essential conditions are specified, i.e., $v(-1)=0$ and $v(1)=0$.\nThis leads to the weak formulation: Find $u$ satisfying the essential boundary conditions such that for all test functions $v$ with $v(-1)=v(1)=0$:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx = \\langle f, v \\rangle $$\nWe now specify the components of this formulation:\n- **Function Spaces**: The natural setting for this problem is the Sobolev space $H^1(-1,1)$, which consists of functions in $L^2(-1,1)$ whose weak derivatives are also in $L^2(-1,1)$. The given solution $u(x)=|x|$ is in $H^1(-1,1)$ because $\\int_{-1}^1 |x|^2 dx = 2/3  \\infty$ and $\\int_{-1}^1 (u'(x))^2 dx = \\int_{-1}^1 (\\text{sgn}(x))^2 dx = \\int_{-1}^1 1 \\, dx = 2  \\infty$.\n  - **Trial Space**: The space of candidate solutions, which must satisfy the essential boundary conditions. This is the affine space $V = \\{ \\psi \\in H^1(-1,1) \\mid \\psi(-1)=1, \\psi(1)=1 \\}$.\n  - **Test Space**: The space of test functions, which must satisfy the homogeneous version of the essential boundary conditions. This is the vector space $V_0 = H_0^1(-1,1) = \\{ v \\in H^1(-1,1) \\mid v(-1)=0, v(1)=0 \\}$.\n- **Bilinear Form**: The left-hand side of the weak formulation, denoted $a(u,v)$.\n  $$ a(u,v) = \\int_{-1}^{1} u'(x) v'(x) \\, dx $$\n- **Linear Functional**: The right-hand side of the weak formulation, denoted $L(v)$.\n  $$ L(v) = \\langle f, v \\rangle = \\langle -2\\delta_0, v \\rangle = -2v(0) $$\n- **Compatibility**: The formulation is consistent because $f=-2\\delta_0$ is a valid member of the dual space of $H_0^1(-1,1)$, denoted $H^{-1}(-1,1)$. By the Sobolev embedding theorem for one dimension ($n=1$), the space $H^1(-1,1)$ embeds continuously into the space of continuous functions $C([-1,1])$. This means that for any $v \\in H^1(-1,1)$, the point evaluation $v(0)$ is well-defined and continuous. Consequently, the Dirac delta $\\delta_0$ is a continuous linear functional on $H_0^1(-1,1)$, making $L(v) = -2v(0)$ a valid linear functional for this weak formulation.\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Linear Functional**\n\nWe must evaluate the linear functional $L(v)$ for the specific function $v(x) = 1-x^2$.\nFirst, we verify that $v(x)$ is a valid test function, i.e., $v \\in H_0^1(-1,1)$.\n- As a polynomial, $v(x)$ is smooth ($C^\\infty([-1,1])$), so it and its derivatives of all orders are in $L^2(-1,1)$. Thus, $v \\in H^1(-1,1)$.\n- We check the boundary conditions:\n  - $v(-1) = 1 - (-1)^2 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n  - $v(1) = 1 - (1)^2 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nSince the boundary conditions are met, $v(x)=1-x^2$ is a valid test function in $H_0^1(-1,1)$.\nNow, we evaluate the linear functional $L(v) = -2v(0)$:\n$$ v(0) = 1 - 0^2 = 1 $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $L(v)$:\n$$ L(v) = -2 \\times v(0) = -2 \\times 1 = -2 $$\nThe numerical value of the evaluation is $-2$.",

This is the weak formulation of the problem.\n\nWe can now identify the components of the abstract variational problem:\n- **Hilbert Space**: The appropriate function space for both the solution $u$ and the test functions $v$ is $V = H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$.\n- **Bilinear Form**: The bilinear form $a(\\cdot, \\cdot): V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as:\n$$a(w, v) := \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla v \\,d\\mathbf{x}$$\n- **Linear Form**: The linear functional $l(\\cdot): V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as:\n$$l(v) := \\int_{\\Omega} f v \\,d\\mathbf{x}$$\nThe weak problem is stated as: Find $u \\in V$ such that\n$$a(u, v) = l(v) \\quad \\forall v \\in V$$\nFor $f \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$, the Lax-Milgram theorem guarantees the existence of a unique solution $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ to this weak problem.\n\nPart 2: Convergence Rates\n\nWe are asked to find the convergence rates $\\beta_{H^{1}}$ and $\\beta_{L^{2}}$ for the Galerkin approximation $u_{h} \\in V_{h} \\subset H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ using piecewise linear elements ($p=1$).\n\nFirst, we determine the convergence rate in the $H^{1}$-seminorm, $\\beta_{H^{1}}$.\nThe starting point is Céa's lemma (quasi-optimality), given as:\n$$|u - u_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\le C \\inf_{v_{h}\\in V_{h}} |u - v_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}$$\nThe infimum over the finite element space $V_{h}$ is bounded by the error of any particular choice of function in $V_{h}$. A standard choice is the nodal interpolant of the true solution, $I_{h}u \\in V_{h}$. Thus:\n$$\\inf_{v_{h}\\in V_{h}} |u - v_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\le |u - I_{h}u|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}$$\nNext, we use the provided interpolation estimate. For a function $w \\in H^{1+s}(\\Omega)$ with $s \\in (0,1]$, we have:\n$$|w - I_{h}w|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{s} \\|w\\|_{H^{1+s}(\\Omega)}$$\nTo apply this to our solution $u$, we need to know its Sobolev regularity. The problem states that for a reentrant corner with interior angle $\\omega = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, the regularity index is $\\lambda = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2} = \\frac{2}{3}$. The solution $u$ satisfies $u \\in H^{1+\\lambda-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)$ for any $\\epsilon  0$, i.e., $u \\in H^{1+2/3-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)$.\nWe can match this regularity with the requirement $u \\in H^{1+s}(\\Omega)$ of the interpolation estimate by setting $s = \\frac{2}{3} - \\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon  0$ can be arbitrarily small, this value of $s$ lies in the interval $(0,1]$.\nApplying the interpolation estimate with $s = \\frac{2}{3} - \\epsilon$:\n$$|u - I_{h}u|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{2/3-\\epsilon} \\|u\\|_{H^{1+2/3-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)}$$\nCombining these inequalities, we get the error estimate for the Galerkin solution:\n$$|u - u_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{2/3-\\epsilon} \\|u\\|_{H^{1+2/3-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)}$$\nSince $\\|u\\|_{H^{1+2/3-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)}$ is a constant (independent of $h$), the error is of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^{2/3-\\epsilon})$. As this holds for any $\\epsilon  0$, the leading-order convergence rate is determined by the supremum of the exponent, which is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore,\n$$\\beta_{H^{1}} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the convergence rate in the $L^{2}$-norm, $\\beta_{L^{2}}$.\nWe use the provided Aubin-Nitsche duality argument:\n$$\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{s_{d}} |u - u_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}$$\nwhere $s_{d} \\in (0,1]$ is determined by the regularity of the solution to the dual problem. The dual problem associated with the $L^2$-error is to find $z \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ such that $-\\Delta z = e$ in $\\Omega$, where $e = u - u_h \\in L^2(\\Omega)$.\nThis dual problem involves the same operator ($-\\Delta$) on the same domain ($\\Omega$) with the same boundary conditions ($z=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$). Therefore, its solution $z$ is subject to the same regularity limitation as the primal solution $u$. According to the given regularity fact, the dual solution $z$ satisfies $z \\in H^{1+\\lambda-\\epsilon}(\\Omega) = H^{1+2/3-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)$ for any $\\epsilon  0$.\nThe Aubin-Nitsche estimate holds with $s_{d} = \\lambda - \\epsilon = \\frac{2}{3} - \\epsilon$, which is in the required range $(0,1]$. Thus, the estimate becomes:\n$$\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{2/3-\\epsilon} |u - u_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}$$\nNow, we substitute the already established convergence result for the $H^{1}$-seminorm error:\n$$|u - u_{h}|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{\\beta_{H^{1}}}) = \\mathcal{O}(h^{2/3})$$\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le C h^{2/3-\\epsilon} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(h^{2/3}) = \\mathcal{O}(h^{4/3-\\epsilon})$$\nAs this holds for any $\\epsilon  0$, the leading-order convergence rate is governed by the exponent $\\frac{4}{3}$. Therefore,\n$$\\beta_{L^{2}} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThe pair of convergence rates is $(\\beta_{H^{1}}, \\beta_{L^{2}}) = (\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{4}{3})$.",
