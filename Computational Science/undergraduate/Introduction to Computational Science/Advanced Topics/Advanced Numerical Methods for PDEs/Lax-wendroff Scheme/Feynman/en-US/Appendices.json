A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\n\n**1. Derivation of the Lax-Wendroff Scheme**\n\nThe objective is to derive a discrete update rule for $u_j^{n+1}$ that approximates the solution to the advection equation $u_t + a\\,u_x = 0$. The derivation starts from a second-order Taylor expansion in time:\n$$\nu(x,t+\\Delta t) = u(x,t) + \\Delta t\\,u_t(x,t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t^2\\,u_{tt}(x,t) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nThe core idea of the Lax-Wendroff method is to replace the time derivatives $u_t$ and $u_{tt}$ with spatial derivatives using the governing PDE itself.\n\nFrom the PDE, we have the first time derivative:\n$$\nu_t = -a\\,u_x\n$$\nTo find the second time derivative, we differentiate the above expression with respect to time:\n$$\nu_{tt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(-a\\,u_x) = -a\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(u_x)\n$$\nAssuming sufficient smoothness, we can commute the partial derivatives:\n$$\nu_{tt} = -a\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(u_t)\n$$\nNow, we substitute $u_t = -a\\,u_x$ again:\n$$\nu_{tt} = -a\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-a\\,u_x) = a^2\\,u_{xx}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $u_t$ and $u_{tt}$ back into the Taylor expansion yields a semi-discrete scheme (continuous in space, discrete in time):\n$$\nu(x,t+\\Delta t) = u(x,t) - a\\,\\Delta t\\,u_x(x,t) + \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,\\Delta t)^2\\,u_{xx}(x,t) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nTo obtain a fully discrete scheme, we evaluate this equation on the grid points $x_j$ and replace the spatial derivatives with their second-order centered finite difference approximations. Let $u_j^n = u(x_j, n\\Delta t)$:\n$$\nu_x(x_j, t_n) \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n}{2\\,\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\nu_{xx}(x_j, t_n) \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the semi-discrete equation gives the update rule for $u_j^{n+1}$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - a\\,\\Delta t \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,\\Delta t)^2 \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation can be simplified by introducing the dimensionless CFL number, $\\lambda = a\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}(u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nThis is the explicit, fully discrete Lax-Wendroff scheme. It is second-order accurate in both space and time, $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2, \\Delta t^2)$, and is stable for $|\\lambda| \\le 1$.\n\n**2. Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe scheme will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient array operations.\n\n- **Initialization**: For each test case, the parameters $L, a, N, \\lambda, T, w$ are set. The computational grid `x`, grid spacing $\\Delta x$, time step $\\Delta t$, and number of time steps $N_t$ are calculated.\n- **Initial Conditions**: Two initial condition arrays, `u_aligned` and `u_half_shift`, are created. The square wave is defined by setting elements to $1.0$ where $x_j \\in [x_0, x_0+w)$. For the given parameters where $x_0+w < L$, this can be implemented with boolean indexing: `u[(x >= x0) & (x < x0 + w)] = 1.0`.\n    - For `u_aligned`, $x_0 = 0$.\n    - For `u_half_shift`, $x_0 = 0.5\\,\\Delta x$.\n- **Time Stepping**: A loop runs for $N_t$ steps to advance the solution in time. The update rule is applied to the entire spatial grid simultaneously using vectorized operations. Periodic boundary conditions are handled using `numpy.roll()`, which efficiently shifts array elements with wrap-around.\n    - `u_jp1 = np.roll(u, -1)` provides the array of $u_{j+1}$ values.\n    - `u_jm1 = np.roll(u, 1)` provides the array of $u_{j-1}$ values.\n- **Analysis**: After the final time step, the oscillation amplitude $A(u)$ is calculated for both the aligned and half-shifted solutions. The final metric, $\\Delta A = A(u^{\\text{half-shift}}) - A(u^{\\text{aligned}})$, is computed and stored for each test case.\n- **Output**: The collected $\\Delta A$ values are formatted to six decimal places and printed in the required list format.\n\nA special case occurs for $\\lambda=1$. The update formula simplifies to $u_j^{n+1} = u_{j-1}^n$, which corresponds to an exact translation of the discrete solution by one grid cell per time step, assuming $a>0$. For an initial condition consisting only of values $0$ and $1$, the solution will maintain these values exactly, resulting in zero dispersive oscillations. Therefore, for Test 3, we expect $A(u^{\\text{aligned}}) = 0$ and $A(u^{\\text{half-shift}}) = 0$, leading to $\\Delta A = 0$. This provides a useful validation check for the implementation. For $|\\lambda| < 1$, the scheme is dispersive, and we expect oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon) near the discontinuities, with their amplitude influenced by the grid alignment.",

The primary objective is to quantify the numerical artifacts, specifically the Gibbs-like oscillations, that arise when applying this second-order, non-monotonic scheme to a discontinuous initial profile.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation is the linear advection equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u(x, t)$ is the conserved quantity, $x \\in [0, 1)$ is the spatial coordinate with periodic boundary conditions, $t$ is time, and $a$ is the constant advection speed, given as $a=1$. The analytical solution to this equation is a simple translation of the initial profile, $u(x,t) = u_0(x-at)$, where $u_0(x) = u(x,0)$. For the given step-function initial condition:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & x \\ge 0.5 \\\\\n0, & x < 0.5\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nthe discontinuity initially at $x=0.5$ advects with speed $a=1$, and its theoretical location at time $t$ is $x_d(t) = \\mathrm{mod}(0.5 + at, 1)$.\n\nThe computational domain is discretized into $N$ uniform cell-centered grid points $x_j = (j + 0.5)\\Delta x$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, with a spatial step size of $\\Delta x = 1/N$. Periodicity implies that the indices are treated modulo $N$, so that $x_{j+N} = x_j$.\n\nThe time evolution is governed by the explicit Lax-Wendroff scheme, which is second-order accurate in both space and time. The discrete update formula for the solution $u_j^n \\approx u(x_j, t_n)$ is given by:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma = a\\Delta t / \\Delta x$ is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number, which relates the time step $\\Delta t$, the spatial step $\\Delta x$, and the advection speed $a$.

The simulation runs for the largest integer number of steps, $n_{\\text{steps}}$, such that the total evolution time $t_n = n_{\\text{steps}} \\Delta t$ does not exceed a given terminal time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$.\n\nThe Lax-Wendroff scheme achieves second-order accuracy by incorporating a term proportional to the second spatial derivative, which counteracts the numerical diffusion of a first-order upwind scheme. However, this introduces numerical dispersion, causing non-physical oscillations (overshoots and undershoots) near sharp gradients or discontinuities, a phenomenon related to the Gibbs effect.\n\nTo quantify these oscillations, we analyze the numerical solution $u_j^{n}$ at the final time $t_n$. A spatial window of half-width $w_x = 0.1$ is defined around the theoretical location of the advected discontinuity, $x_d(t_n)$. This window contains all grid points $x_j$ such that the shortest periodic distance to $x_d(t_n)$, given by $\\min(|x_j - x_d(t_n)|, 1 - |x_j - x_d(t_n)|)$, is no more than $w_x$. Within this window, we compute:\n1.  The overshoot amplitude $O = \\max\\{0, \\max_{\\text{window}} u - 1\\}$. This measures the maximum value of the solution in the window that exceeds the initial maximum of $1$.\n2.  The undershoot amplitude $U = \\max\\{0, 0 - \\min_{\\text{window}} u\\}$. This measures the maximum value by which the solution in the window drops below the initial minimum of $0$.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluate the growth of oscillations by computing the ratio of the total variation (TV) at time $t_n$ to the initial total variation. The discrete total variation of a grid function $v$ is defined as $\\mathrm{TV}(v) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |v_{j+1} - v_j|$, with periodic indexing $v_N = v_0$. The initial condition is a step function on a periodic domain, which has two jumps (from $0$ to $1$ and from $1$ back to $0$), so its theoretical total variation is $\\mathrm{TV}(u(\\cdot,0)) = 2$. The ratio is $R = \\mathrm{TV}(u(\\cdot,t_n)) / \\mathrm{TV}(u(\\cdot,0))$. For a scheme that is not total variation diminishing (TVD), like Lax-Wendroff, this ratio is expected to be greater than $1$, indicating the creation of new extrema, i.e., oscillations.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Initialize parameters: $N, \\sigma, t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, with $a=1$ and $w_x=0.1$.\n2.  Calculate simulation parameters: $\\Delta x = 1/N$, $\\Delta t = \\sigma \\Delta x / a$, and $n_{\\text{steps}} = \\lfloor t_{\\mathrm{end}} / \\Delta t \\rfloor$. The final time is $t_n = n_{\\text{steps}} \\Delta t$.\n3.  Set up the grid $x_j$ and the initial condition $u^0$, where $u_j^0 = 1$ if $x_j \\ge 0.5$ and $u_j^0 = 0$ otherwise.\n4.  Calculate the initial total variation, $\\mathrm{TV}(u^0)$.\n5.  Iteratively apply the Lax-Wendroff update formula for $n_{\\text{steps}}$ to obtain the final numerical solution $u^{n_{\\text{steps}}}$. Vectorized array operations are used for efficiency, employing circular shifts to handle periodic boundary conditions.\n6.  Determine the theoretical discontinuity location $x_d(t_n) = (0.5 + a t_n) \\pmod 1$.\n7.  Identify the grid points lying within the analysis window of half-width $w_x$ around $x_d(t_n)$.\n8.  Compute the maximum and minimum of the solution within this window to find the overshoot $O$ and undershoot $U$.\n9.  Compute the total variation of the final solution, $\\mathrm{TV}(u^{n_{\\text{steps}}})$, and the ratio $R$.\n10. Store the computed triplet $(O, U, R)$ for the case.\nThis process is repeated for all five specified test cases.",

This exercise tackles this problem head-on by simulating a quantity, such as particle density, that must remain non-negative.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed exercise in computational physics. It asks for the implementation of a specific class of numerical methods to solve the one-dimensional linear advection equation and to test a fundamental property of the numerical solution: the preservation of non-negativity.\n\nThe governing equation is the linear advection equation for a scalar density $n(x,t)$ with a constant, positive wave speed $a$:\n$$\n\\partial_t n + a\\,\\partial_x n = 0\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical scheme that is explicit and second-order accurate in both time and space. The canonical method satisfying these properties for this equation is the Lax-Wendroff scheme. We will derive this scheme and use it to solve the problem.\n\nWe begin with a Taylor series expansion of the solution $n(x, t+\\Delta t)$ in time around $t$:\n$$\nn(x, t+\\Delta t) = n(x,t) + \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial t^2} + O((\\Delta t)^3)\n$$\nTo achieve second-order accuracy in time, we must approximate the time derivatives using the governing PDE. The first time derivative is given directly by the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = -a \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe second time derivative is found by differentiating the PDE with respect to time and substituting back:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(-a \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\\right) = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}\\right) = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-a \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\\right) = a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the Taylor expansion yields a semi-discretized equation, accurate to second order in $\\Delta t$:\n$$\nn(x, t+\\Delta t) = n(x,t) - a \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} + \\frac{(a \\Delta t)^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + O((\\Delta t)^3)\n$$\nTo create a fully discrete scheme, we discretize the spatial domain with grid points $x_j = j\\Delta x$ and approximate the solution at these points at time $t^m=m\\Delta t$ by $n_j^m \\approx n(x_j, t^m)$. We replace the spatial derivatives with second-order accurate central finite differences:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x_j} \\approx \\frac{n_{j+1}^m - n_{j-1}^m}{2\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2}\\right|_{x_j} \\approx \\frac{n_{j+1}^m - 2n_j^m + n_{j-1}^m}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these finite differences into the semi-discretized equation gives the explicit update rule for $n_j^{m+1}$:\n$$\nn_j^{m+1} = n_j^m - a \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{n_{j+1}^m - n_{j-1}^m}{2\\Delta x} \\right) + \\frac{(a \\Delta t)^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{n_{j+1}^m - 2n_j^m + n_{j-1}^m}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nIntroducing the non-dimensional Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number, $c = a\\Delta t/\\Delta x$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\nn_j^{m+1} = n_j^m - \\frac{c}{2} (n_{j+1}^m - n_{j-1}^m) + \\frac{c^2}{2} (n_{j+1}^m - 2n_j^m + n_{j-1}^m)\n$$\nGrouping terms by their spatial index at the current time level $m$:\n$$\nn_j^{m+1} = \\left( \\frac{c^2}{2} + \\frac{c}{2} \\right) n_{j-1}^m + (1 - c^2) n_j^m + \\left( \\frac{c^2}{2} - \\frac{c}{2} \\right) n_{j+1}^m\n$$\nThis is the Lax-Wendroff scheme. For the scheme to be positivity-preserving (i.e., guarantee $n_j^{m+1} \\ge 0$ if all $n_k^m \\ge 0$), all coefficients in the stencil must be non-negative. We analyze the coefficients for the stability range $c \\in (0,1]$:\n- Coefficient of $n_{j-1}^m$: $\\frac{c(c+1)}{2}$. This is non-negative for $c \\ge 0$.\n- Coefficient of $n_j^m$: $1 - c^2$. This is non-negative for $c \\le 1$.\n- Coefficient of $n_{j+1}^m$: $\\frac{c(c-1)}{2}$. This is non-positive for $c \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe coefficient of $n_{j+1}^m$ is negative for any $c \\in (0,1)$. This means the Lax-Wendroff scheme is not positivity-preserving in general. It is a non-monotone scheme that can introduce spurious oscillations (undershoots and overshoots) around sharp gradients or discontinuities in the solution. This is a manifestation of Godunov's theorem, which states that no linear numerical scheme for conservation laws with order of accuracy greater than one can be monotonicity-preserving. We therefore expect to observe negative values when the initial condition contains discontinuities, as in Cases B and C. For a smooth initial condition like the Gaussian in Case A, any oscillations should be much smaller, and may not fall below the specified negative threshold $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1. For each test case, define parameters $L, a, N, c, T$.\n2. Compute the grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, the time step $\\Delta t = c \\Delta x / a$, and the total number of time steps $K = \\lfloor T/\\Delta t \\rfloor$.\n3. Create a uniform spatial grid $x_j = j\\Delta x$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$.\n4. Initialize the discrete solution array $n^0$ according to the specified initial condition for the case.\n5. Set a flag `negative_detected = 0`.\n6. Iterate from time step $m=0$ to $K-1$:\n   a. Compute the solution at the next time step, $n^{m+1}$, using the Lax-Wendroff formula. Periodic boundary conditions are enforced by treating the grid indices cyclically (e.g., $n_{-1}^m \\equiv n_{N-1}^m$ and $n_N^m \\equiv n_0^m$).\n   b. After computing the new array $n^{m+1}$, find its minimum value, $\\min_j n_j^{m+1}$.\n   c. If this minimum is less than $-\\varepsilon = -10^{-12}$, set `negative_detected = 1` and terminate the time-stepping for this case.\n   d. Update the solution array for the next iteration.\n7. Record the final value of `negative_detected` for the case.\n8. After processing all cases, report the results as a list of these flags.",
