The specific forcing function for this problem is given by $f(x) = \\sin(8\\pi x)$.\n\nThe analyst chooses to use a spectral Galerkin method. They propose an approximate solution $u_N(x)$ as a finite linear combination of basis functions:\n$$u_N(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k \\phi_k(x)$$\nThe chosen basis functions are the sine eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on this domain, $\\phi_k(x) = \\sin(k\\pi x)$, which automatically satisfy the boundary conditions. For this particular attempt, the analyst sets the number of basis functions to $N=7$.\n\nThe core principle of the Galerkin method is to enforce that the residual of the equation, $R(x) = u_{N,xx}(x) - f(x)$, is orthogonal to every basis function in the chosen set. That is, $\\int_0^1 R(x) \\phi_j(x) dx = 0$ for all $j=1, 2, \\dots, N$. This procedure yields a system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients $c_k$.\n\nWhen the analyst implements this method with $N=7$, the computation returns a solution of $u_7(x) = 0$ for all $x$. This is clearly incorrect, as substituting $u(x)=0$ into the original differential equation yields $0 = \\sin(8\\pi x)$, which is not true.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for the failure of this specific numerical implementation?\n\nA. The forcing function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to every basis function in the set $\\{\\sin(k\\pi x)\\}_{k=1}^{7}$. Consequently, the projection of $f(x)$ onto the space spanned by these basis functions is zero, resulting in a computed trivial solution $u_7(x)=0$.\n\nB. The system of linear equations for the coefficients $c_k$ becomes singular because the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, indicating that the basis functions are not linearly independent.\n\nC. The sine basis is only appropriate for problems with even-indexed forcing functions, like $\\sin(2n\\pi x)$. The odd-indexed forcing function $\\sin(8\\pi x)$ (as $k=8$ is not a power of 2) requires a cosine basis.\n\nD. The chosen number of basis functions, $N=7$, is too small to resolve the oscillations of the forcing term. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, at least $2 \\times 8 = 16$ basis functions are required for a stable solution.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in computational science, focusing on the numerical solution of a reaction-diffusion PDE using spectral methods and operator splitting. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided. It requires the implementation and comparison of different numerical schemes to analyze their accuracy. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Design\n\nThe partial differential equation (PDE) under consideration is the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\nu_t = D \\,\\Delta u + R(u), \\quad x \\in [0, 2\\pi)\n$$\nwhere $u_t = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ and the Laplacian is $\\Delta u = u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$. The reaction term is given by the logistic function $R(u) = \\alpha u(1-u)$. The problem is defined on a periodic domain with a given initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$.\n\nThe core idea of operator splitting is to decompose the full problem, which is difficult to solve analytically, into simpler subproblems that can be solved exactly or with high accuracy. The full evolution operator $\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Full}}$ that advances the solution by a time step $\\Delta t$ is approximated by composing the evolution operators of the subsystems. Let the full operator be $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_D + \\mathcal{L}_R$, where $\\mathcal{L}_D = D \\Delta$ is the diffusion operator and $\\mathcal{L}_R(u) = \\alpha u(1-u)$ is the reaction operator.\n\n#### 1. Discretization and Subsystem Flows\n\nWe discretize the spatial domain $[0, 2\\pi)$ using $N$ equispaced grid points $x_j = j \\frac{2\\pi}{N}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. A function $u(x,t)$ is represented by its values $u_j(t) = u(x_j, t)$ on this grid.\n\n**Diffusion Subsystem: $u_t = D u_{xx}$**\nThis linear PDE is most effectively solved in Fourier space. A function $u(x)$ on the periodic domain can be represented by its Fourier series. On the discrete grid, this corresponds to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which can be computed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The solution vector $u = (u_0, \\dots, u_{N-1})$ is transformed to its spectral representation $\\hat{u} = \\mathcal{F}(u)$.\n\nThe second spatial derivative $u_{xx}$ is transformed to multiplication by $(i k)^2 = -k^2$ in Fourier space, where $k$ represents the wavenumber. For a domain of length $L=2\\pi$ and $N$ points, the integer wavenumbers are given by $k = N \\times \\texttt{scipy.fft.fftfreq}(N)$. The diffusion equation in Fourier space becomes a set of uncoupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each Fourier mode $\\hat{u}_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{u}_k}{dt} = -D k^2 \\hat{u}_k\n$$\nThis ODE has an exact solution over a time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\hat{u}_k(t+\\Delta t) = \\hat{u}_k(t) \\, e^{-D k^2 \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe diffusion subflow, $\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Diffusion}}$, is therefore implemented as a three-step process:\n1.  Transform the solution $u$ to spectral space: $\\hat{u} = \\text{FFT}(u)$.\n2.  Multiply each mode $\\hat{u}_k$ by the factor $e^{-D k^2 \\Delta t}$.\n3.  Transform back to physical space: $u_{\\text{new}} = \\text{IFFT}(\\hat{u}_{\\text{new}})$.\nSince this flow is based on the analytical solution, it is exact for the diffusion-only subsystem and is unconditionally stable.\n\n**Reaction Subsystem: $u_t = \\alpha u(1-u)$**\nThis subsystem consists of $N$ uncoupled logistic ODEs, one for each grid point $u_j$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_j}{dt} = \\alpha u_j(1-u_j)\n$$\nThis ODE is separable and has a known analytical solution. Given $u(t)$, the solution at $t+\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nu(t+\\Delta t) = \\frac{u(t)\\, e^{\\alpha \\Delta t}}{1 + u(t)\\, (e^{\\alpha \\Delta t}-1)}\n$$\nThe exact reaction subflow, $\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Reaction}}$, applies this update element-wise to the solution vector $u$. For one of the test cases, this exact flow is replaced by a single step of the explicit forward Euler method:\n$$\nu(t+\\Delta t) = u(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot (\\alpha u(t)(1 - u(t)))\n$$\n\n#### 2. Operator Splitting Schemes\n\nOperator splitting methods approximate the flow of the combined system $\\exp((\\mathcal{L}_D + \\mathcal{L}_R)\\Delta t)$ by a composition of the individual subflows.\n\n**First-Order Lie Splitting:**\nThis is the simplest splitting scheme, where the subflows are applied sequentially:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Lie}}(u) = \\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Reaction}} \\circ \\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Diffusion}}(u)\n$$\nBy comparing the Taylor series expansion of this composition with the exact solution operator, we find that they match up to the $O(\\Delta t)$ term. The local truncation error is $O(\\Delta t^2)$, which results in a global error of $O(\\Delta t)$ over a fixed time interval $T$. Thus, the method is first-order accurate.\n\n**Second-Order Strang Splitting:**\nA more accurate, symmetric composition is given by Strang splitting:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Strang}}(u) = \\Phi_{\\Delta t/2}^{\\text{Reaction}} \\circ \\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Diffusion}} \\circ \\Phi_{\\Delta t/2}^{\\text{Reaction}}(u)\n$$\nThis symmetric composition cancels the leading error term of the Lie splitting. The local truncation error is $O(\\Delta t^3)$, leading to a global error of $O(\\Delta t^2)$. This scheme is second-order accurate, provided the subflows are computed exactly.\n\n**Strang Splitting with Euler Integrator (Strang-Euler):**\nIn this case, the exact reaction subflow $\\Phi_{\\Delta t/2}^{\\text{Reaction}}$ is replaced by a one-step forward Euler approximation, which has a local error of $O((\\Delta t/2)^2) = O(\\Delta t^2)$. This error introduced by the numerical integration of the reaction term is larger than the $O(\\Delta t^3)$ splitting error. The dominant local error becomes $O(\\Delta t^2)$, which degrades the global accuracy of the overall scheme to first order, $O(\\Delta t)$. Comparing the accuracy of this scheme to the standard Strang splitting allows us to isolate the error contribution from the inexact time integration of the nonlinear part.\n\n#### 3. Error Analysis\n\nTo quantify the accuracy of these schemes, we compute an empirical order of convergence, $p$. We run simulations for a set of decreasing time steps $\\Delta t_i$ and compute the error $\\|e_i\\|_{L^2}$ against a high-accuracy reference solution. The error is expected to follow the power law $\\|e\\| \\approx C (\\Delta t)^p$. Taking the logarithm gives a linear relationship:\n$$\n\\log(\\|e\\|) \\approx \\log(C) + p \\log(\\Delta t)\n$$\nThe order $p$ is the slope of this line, which can be estimated via a linear least-squares fit to the data points $(\\log(\\Delta t_i), \\log(\\|e_i\\|_{L^2}))$. The discrete $L^2$ error is computed as specified:\n$$\n\\|e\\|_{L^2} = \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left(u_j^{\\text{approx}} - u_j^{\\text{ref}}\\right)^2 \\,\\Delta x \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n\n#### 4. Test Case Execution\n\n-   **Tests 1-3:** A high-accuracy reference solution is generated using Strang splitting with exact subflows and a very small time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}}=0.001$. For each of the three schemes (Lie, Strang, Strang-Euler), simulations are run for a series of time steps $\\Delta t$. The $L^2$ error is computed at the final time $T=0.5$ for each $\\Delta t$. The empirical order of accuracy is then calculated from these results. We expect $p_{\\text{Lie}} \\approx 1$, $p_{\\text{Strang}} \\approx 2$, and $p_{\\text{Strang-Euler}} \\approx 1$.\n-   **Test 4:** This case sets the diffusion coefficient $D=0$, effectively turning off the diffusion operator. The diffusion subflow becomes the identity operator. The Strang splitting scheme $\\Phi_{\\Delta t/2}^{\\text{Reaction}} \\circ I \\circ \\Phi_{\\Delta t/2}^{\\text{Reaction}}$ simplifies to $\\Phi_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Reaction}}$ due to the group property of the exact flow. This means that advancing the solution over any number of steps using this \"splitting\" scheme is equivalent to applying a single exact reaction flow over the total time. Consequently, the solution computed with a large step $\\Delta t$ should be identical (to machine precision) to the reference solution computed with many small steps $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}}$.
