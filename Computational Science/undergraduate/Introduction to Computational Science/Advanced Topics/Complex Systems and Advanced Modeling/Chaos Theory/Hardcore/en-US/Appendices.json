            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical estimation of the largest Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, for the Lorenz system. The method specified is the standard algorithm based on integrating the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) augmented with its corresponding variational equations, followed by a periodic re-normalization of the perturbation vector.\n\nFirst, we define the augmented state vector $\\mathbf{Y}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$. This vector combines the original state vector $\\mathbf{x}(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)]^T$ and the infinitesimal perturbation vector $\\delta\\mathbf{x}(t) = [\\delta x(t), \\delta y(t), \\delta z(t)]^T$. Thus, $\\mathbf{Y}(t) = [\\mathbf{x}(t)^T, \\delta\\mathbf{x}(t)^T]^T$. The time evolution of this augmented state is governed by a system of six coupled first-order ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{Y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{Y}(t)) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\delta\\mathbf{x}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\nJ(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\delta\\mathbf{x}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the vector field of the Lorenz system and $J(\\mathbf{x})$ is its Jacobian matrix.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\sigma (y - x) \\\\\n\\dot{y} = x (\\rho - z) - y \\\\\n\\dot{z} = x y - \\beta z\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ is:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{x}) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\sigma  \\sigma  0 \\\\\n\\rho - z  -1  -x \\\\\ny  x  -\\beta\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe parameters are specified as $\\sigma = 10$, $\\rho = 28$, and $\\beta = 8/3$.\n\nThe largest Lyapunov exponent is defined by the long-term average exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\ln \\frac{\\|\\delta \\mathbf{x}(t)\\|}{\\|\\delta \\mathbf{x}(0)\\|}\n$$\nDirect numerical integration of the variational equation leads to overflow as $\\|\\delta \\mathbf{x}(t)\\|$ grows exponentially. To circumvent this, we use a re-normalization procedure. The total integration time $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is divided into $N = T_{\\mathrm{tot}} / \\tau_R$ intervals of length $\\tau_R$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the state at $t=0$: $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (1, 1, 1)$ and $\\delta\\mathbf{x}(0) = (\\delta_0, 0, 0)$, where $\\delta_0 = 10^{-8}$. This sets the initial augmented state $\\mathbf{Y}(0)$.\n2.  For each interval $k=1, \\dots, N$, integrate the 6D system $\\dot{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{Y})$ over the time span $[(k-1)\\tau_R, k\\tau_R]$.\n3.  Let the perturbation vector at the end of the interval be $\\delta\\mathbf{x}_k^{\\text{pre}}$. Calculate its norm, $d_k = \\|\\delta\\mathbf{x}_k^{\\text{pre}}\\|$.\n4.  If the current time $t_k = k\\tau_R$ is greater than the transient time $T_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, accumulate the value $\\ln(d_k / \\delta_0)$ into a running sum. The term $d_k/\\delta_0$ represents the growth factor of the perturbation over the interval of length $\\tau_R$.\n5.  Re-normalize the perturbation vector to have norm $\\delta_0$: $\\delta\\mathbf{x}_k^{\\text{post}} = (\\delta_0 / d_k) \\delta\\mathbf{x}_k^{\\text{pre}}$. This new vector is used as the initial condition for the perturbation part of $\\mathbf{Y}$ for the next integration interval. The state part $\\mathbf{x}$ continues its evolution without modification.\n6.  After integrating for the total time $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, the estimate for the largest Lyapunov exponent is calculated as the time-average of the accumulated log-growth factors over the non-transient period:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - T_{\\mathrm{trans}}} \\sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } k\\tau_R  T_{\\mathrm{trans}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_k}{\\delta_0}\\right)\n$$\nThe simulation parameters are $T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 20$, $T_{\\mathrm{trans}} = 5$, and $\\tau_R = 0.1$.\n\nWe implement three numerical integration schemes for this procedure:\n\n**1.

Adaptive Runge-Kutta Method (RK45):**\nThis method uses an embedded pair of fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta formulas to estimate the local truncation error at each step.

This exercise uses the deceptively simple logistic map to explore this fascinating landscape. You will develop an algorithm to scan a range of parameter values, computationally identifying the \"windows of periodicity\"—islands of stable, predictable behavior that exist within the larger sea of chaos—and measuring their extent .",
            "id": "3105341",
            "problem": "You will write a complete, runnable program that investigates periodic windows inside chaotic parameter regimes of the logistic map using computational methods. Start from core definitions of discrete dynamical systems and limit-based quantities, and derive an algorithm that uses these foundations without shortcut formulas.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Consider the logistic map defined by the iteration $x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n)$ with $f_r(x) = r x (1 - x)$ for control parameter $r \\in [0,4]$ and state $x_n \\in [0,1]$.\n- An orbit $(x_n)$ has (least) period $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ if there exists a minimal $p$ such that $x_{n+p} = x_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$. If no such finite $p$ exists, the orbit is aperiodic.\n- The Lyapunov exponent (LE) $\\lambda$ for the map at parameter $r$ along an orbit $(x_n)$ is defined by $\\lambda = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\ln |f_r'(x_n)|$, where $f_r'(x) = r (1 - 2x)$. A negative Lyapunov exponent indicates exponential stability of the orbit, while a positive Lyapunov exponent indicates exponential divergence of nearby trajectories.\n- In computation, approximate the Lyapunov exponent by a finite-time average after discarding an initial transient to mitigate sensitivity to initial conditions.\n\nProblem requirements:\n- Implement an algorithm that, for a given parameter $r$, detects whether the post-transient orbit is periodic with some period $p \\leq p_{\\max}$ by testing the recurrence condition $x_{n+p} \\approx x_n$ in the sense of a small tolerance. Use a minimal period criterion (no smaller $q  p$ satisfies the condition) and check that distinct phases are not numerically collapsed (for $p  1$, ensure the $p$ phase values are separated by a threshold). Accept a period classification only if the finite-time Lyapunov exponent is negative.\n- Implement a parameter scan over a closed interval $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$ with a uniform grid of step size $\\Delta r$, classify each grid point $r$ as belonging to a specified target period-$p$ window if the orbit has least period $p$ and the Lyapunov exponent is negative, and compute the measure of the window as the Riemann sum $\\sum \\Delta r$ over all classified grid points. Also compute the count of contiguous window segments detected on the grid.\n\nTest suite and answer specification:\n- Use the logistic map $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$ as defined above.\n- Use fixed initial conditions and iteration counts specified in each test case. Do not introduce randomness.\n- For all angles (none in this problem), if any appear, use radians. For all numerical outputs in this problem, no physical units are involved.\n- Your program must implement the following test cases exactly:\n\n1. Period detection at a known region where period-$3$ exists:\n   - Parameters: $r = 3.82842712$, $x_0 = 0.2$, $N_{\\text{transient}} = 2000$, $N_{\\text{sample}} = 1500$, $p_{\\max} = 10$, tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$.\n   - Output for this case: the detected least period $p$ as an integer in $\\{0,1,2,\\dots,p_{\\max}\\}$. Use $p = 0$ if no period $\\leq p_{\\max}$ is detected.\n\n2. Period detection in a chaotic region:\n   - Parameters: $r = 3.57$, $x_0 = 0.5$, $N_{\\text{transient}} = 2000$, $N_{\\text{sample}} = 1500$, $p_{\\max} = 10$, tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$.\n   - Output for this case: the detected least period $p$ (use $p = 0$ if none).\n\n3. Measure of the period-$3$ window in a local interval:\n   - Parameters: $r_{\\min} = 3.82$, $r_{\\max} = 3.86$, $\\Delta r = 10^{-4}$, target period $p = 3$, $x_0 = 0.5$, $N_{\\text{transient}} = 2000$, $N_{\\text{sample}} = 1000$, $p_{\\max} = 10$, tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$.\n   - Output for this case: the total measure of the detected period-$3$ window(s) on this grid, expressed as a float rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\n4. Count of contiguous period-$3$ window segments in the same local interval:\n   - Use the same parameters as in Case $3$.\n   - Output for this case: the number of contiguous segments, as an integer.\n\n5. Measure of the period-$3$ windows over a wider chaotic interval:\n   - Parameters: $r_{\\min} = 3.5$, $r_{\\max} = 4.0$, $\\Delta r = 10^{-3}$, target period $p = 3$, $x_0 = 0.5$, $N_{\\text{transient}} = 2000$, $N_{\\text{sample}} = 1000$, $p_{\\max} = 10$, tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$.\n   - Output for this case: the total measure, expressed as a float rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the five test cases above. For example, the output should look like $[p_1,p_2,m_3,c_4,m_5]$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are integers, $m_3$ and $m_5$ are floats rounded to $6$ decimal places, and $c_4$ is an integer.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-defined computational task grounded in the established principles of chaos theory and discrete dynamical systems. The definitions of the logistic map, periodicity, and the Lyapunov exponent are standard. The problem requires the implementation of numerical algorithms to approximate these quantities, which is a standard approach in computational science. All parameters for the test cases are explicitly provided.\n\nA minor ambiguity exists in the requirement to \"ensure the $p$ phase values are separated by a threshold\" for the distinct phase check, as no specific value for this threshold is given. A reasonable and consistent interpretation, which will be adopted here, is to use the same tolerance $\\varepsilon$ specified for the recurrence check. That is, for a candidate period-$p$ cycle with points $\\{c_1, \\dots, c_p\\}$, it is required that $|c_i - c_j| \\ge \\varepsilon$ for all $i \\neq j$. This interpretation makes the problem fully specified and solvable.\n\nThe solution is designed based on fundamental principles, starting with the core definitions and building the required algorithms step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Logistic Map and Orbit Generation**\n\nThe dynamical system under consideration is the logistic map, a function $f_r: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ defined by the iterative formula:\n$$x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n) = r x_n (1 - x_n)$$\nHere, $x_n$ is the state of the system at step $n$, and $r \\in [0,4]$ is a control parameter. An orbit is the sequence of states $(x_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ generated from an initial condition $x_0$. To analyze the long-term (asymptotic) behavior, we first iterate the map for $N_{\\text{transient}}$ steps to let the orbit settle onto its attractor. We then record the subsequent $N_{\\text{sample}}$ points for analysis.\n\n**2. Lyapunov Exponent for Stability Analysis**\n\nThe stability of an orbit is quantified by the Lyapunov exponent (LE), $\\lambda$. For a given orbit $(x_n)$, it is defined as the average rate of exponential divergence of infinitesimally close trajectories:\n$$\\lambda = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\ln |f_r'(x_n)|$$\nThe derivative of the logistic map is $f_r'(x) = r (1 - 2x)$. A negative LE ($\\lambda  0$) indicates that nearby trajectories converge, characteristic of a stable orbit (like a fixed point or a periodic cycle). A positive LE ($\\lambda  0$) indicates exponential divergence, a hallmark of chaos.\n\nIn our computational approach, we approximate the LE with a finite-time average over the $N_{\\text{sample}}$ post-transient points of the orbit:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{sample}}} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\\text{sample}}-1} \\ln|f_r'(x_{N_{\\text{transient}}+i})|$$\n\n**3. Algorithm for Orbit Classification**\n\nTo determine the nature of an orbit for a given $r$, we implement a function that performs the following steps:\n\n1.  **Generate Orbit and Compute LE**: Generate the orbit for $N_{\\text{transient}} + N_{\\text{sample}}$ iterations from $x_0$. Store the last $N_{\\text{sample}}$ points. Concurrently, compute the sum for the LE, $\\sum \\ln|f_r'(x_n)|$, over the sampling phase to find $\\hat{\\lambda}$.\n\n2.  **Search for Minimal Period**: We search for the smallest integer period $p$ (where $1 \\le p \\le p_{\\max}$) that characterizes the orbit. This is done by iterating $p$ from $1$ to $p_{\\max}$. The first value of $p$ that satisfies the following conditions is considered the minimal period, $p_{\\text{candidate}}$.\n    *   **Recurrence Condition**: The orbit must repeat every $p$ steps. Numerically, we test if the last $p$ points of the sequence match the $p$ points preceding them, within a small tolerance $\\varepsilon$. That is, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$, we check if $|x_{N-1-k} - x_{N-1-k-p}|  \\varepsilon$, where $N = N_{\\text{transient}} + N_{\\text{sample}}$.\n    *   **Distinct Phase Condition**: For a period $p  1$ to be valid, its constituent points must be numerically distinct. We verify this by checking that for any two points $c_i, c_j$ in the final cycle of $p$ points, $|c_i - c_j| \\ge \\varepsilon$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\n3.  **Final Classification**: An orbit is classified as a stable period-$p$ cycle only if a minimal period $p_{\\text{candidate}}  0$ is found **and** its corresponding finite-time Lyapunov exponent is negative ($\\hat{\\lambda}  0$). If $p_{\\text{candidate}}0$ but $\\hat{\\lambda} \\ge 0$, the orbit is periodic but unstable, so we classify it as aperiodic (period $0$) per the problem's stability requirement. If no period $p \\le p_{\\max}$ is found, the orbit is also classified as aperiodic (period $0$).\n\n**4. Parameter Scan Algorithm**\n\nTo analyze properties over an interval of the parameter $r$, we employ a scanning algorithm:\n1.  **Discretize Parameter Space**: A uniform grid of $r$ values is created over the interval $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$ with a step size of $\\Delta r$.\n\n2.  **Classify Each Point**: For each $r_i$ on the grid, the orbit classification algorithm described above is executed to determine its period.\n\n3.  **Compute Window Measure**: The measure (or total width) of a target period-$p$ window is approximated by a Riemann sum. We sum the step size $\\Delta r$ for every $r_i$ on the grid that was classified as having the target period $p$:\n    $$M_p = \\sum_{r_i \\text{ where period is } p} \\Delta r$$\n\n4.  **Count Contiguous Segments**: To count the number of separate, contiguous segments of a target period, we iterate through the sequence of classifications for each $r_i$. A counter is incremented only when we encounter a point with the target period that was preceded by a point with a different period, thus marking the start of a new segment.",
