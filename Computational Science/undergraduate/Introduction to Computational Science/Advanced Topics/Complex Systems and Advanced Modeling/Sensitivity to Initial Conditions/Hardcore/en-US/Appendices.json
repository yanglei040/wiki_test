            "introduction": "The essence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that a small change in the starting state can lead to drastically different outcomes. This exercise provides a simple, yet powerful, illustration of this principle using the map $x_{n+1} = x_n^2$. By tracking two points starting infinitesimally on either side of the critical value $x=1$, we can see firsthand how their fates diverge in a dramatic and predictable way, one heading towards stability and the other towards infinity.

            "problem": "A simple one-dimensional discrete dynamical system, often used to model population dynamics in a constrained environment, is described by the iterative map $x_{n+1} = k x_n (1 - x_n)$. The logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior for certain values of the parameter $k$. However, to understand the fundamental concept of sensitivity to initial conditions, we can study an even simpler, non-linear map given by:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n^2$$\nConsider two nearby initial states, $x_0 = 0.999$ and $y_0 = 1.001$. Due to the nature of the map, one of these trajectories will converge towards zero, while the other will diverge towards infinity. We can declare that the two trajectories have become \"qualitatively distinct\" at the first iteration step $N$ for which the state of the convergent trajectory is less than a lower threshold $L = 0.1$ and the state of the divergent trajectory is greater than an upper threshold $U = 100$.\n\nDetermine the minimum integer number of iterations, $N$, required for the two trajectories to become qualitatively distinct.",
            "solution": "We study the map $x_{n+1}=x_{n}^{2}$ with $x_{0}=0.999$ and $y_{0}=1.001$. By iterating, one obtains by induction\n$$\nx_{n}=(x_{0})^{2^{n}},\\qquad y_{n}=(y_{0})^{2^{n}}.\n$$\nWe require the smallest integer $N$ such that the convergent trajectory satisfies $x_{N}0.1$ and the divergent trajectory satisfies $y_{N}100$. Using $\\ln$, which is strictly increasing on $(0,\\infty)$, these become\n$$\n2^{N}\\ln(0.999)\\ln(0.1),\\qquad 2^{N}\\ln(1.001)\\ln(100).\n$$\nSince $\\ln(0.999)0$ and $\\ln(0.1)0$, dividing the first inequality by $\\ln(0.999)$ reverses the inequality, while for the second, $\\ln(1.001)0$ preserves it.

            "introduction": "While the previous example showed qualitative divergence, many chaotic systems exhibit a quantifiable, exponential rate of separation. The famous Lorenz system, a simplified model of atmospheric convection, is a prime example.
