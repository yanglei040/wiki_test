            "problem": "Consider two search tasks over a set of $n$ distinct keys in the Quantum Query Model (QQM), where a query is the application of a unitary oracle on a quantum register and the cost measure is the number of oracle applications.\n\nTask 1 (Uniform Unsorted Array with a Single Marked Item): The keys are stored in an array in arbitrary order, and there is exactly one marked index $i^\\star \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ such that a Boolean predicate $f(i^\\star) = 1$ and $f(i) = 0$ for all $i \\neq i^\\star$. Access is via the standard membership oracle $O_f$ that acts as $O_f\\colon \\lvert i\\rangle \\lvert b\\rangle \\mapsto \\lvert i\\rangle \\lvert b \\oplus f(i)\\rangle$, with unit cost per query.\n\nTask 2 (Ordered Search via a Balanced Binary Search Tree): The keys are maintained in a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST), which is a binary tree whose in-order traversal yields the keys in strictly increasing order and whose height is $\\Theta(\\log n)$ in the worst case. The unknown target key $x^\\star$ is known to be one of the stored keys. Access is via a comparison oracle $O_{\\leq}$ that implements $O_{\\leq}\\colon \\lvert y\\rangle \\lvert b\\rangle \\mapsto \\lvert y\\rangle \\lvert b \\oplus \\mathbf{1}[x^\\star \\leq y]\\rangle$, where $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$ is the indicator function, with unit cost per query.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts:\n- A Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) supports comparisons that deterministically partition the set of possible ranks of $x^\\star$ into two halves per comparison, and classical binary search isolates $x^\\star$ by halving the candidate set at each step.\n- Grover’s algorithm is the canonical amplitude-amplification procedure for searching a single marked item in an unstructured domain using a membership oracle.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct about the optimal quantum query complexities in these two tasks and about how order information constrains potential quantum speedups.\n\nA. In Task $1$, with a single marked index and access only to $O_f$, the optimal quantum query complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, achieved by Grover’s algorithm, whereas any classical algorithm requires $\\Theta(n)$ queries in the worst case.\n\nB. In Task $2$, by leveraging superposition over comparisons in the BST, a quantum algorithm can locate $x^\\star$ using only $\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ comparison queries.\n\nC. In Task $2$, the presence of total order information induces an $\\Omega(\\log n)$ quantum query lower bound for ordered search, so the best quantum algorithms still use $\\Theta(\\log n)$ queries up to constant factors, rather than $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$.\n\nD. If the keys are sorted but the oracle access is restricted to equality testing $O_{=}\\colon \\lvert y\\rangle \\lvert b\\rangle \\mapsto \\lvert y\\rangle \\lvert b \\oplus \\mathbf{1}[y = x^\\star]\\rangle$, without exposing order information, the optimal quantum query complexity to find $x^\\star$ remains $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, matching the unstructured case.",
            "solution": "This problem tests the understanding of how problem structure affects quantum speedups, specifically comparing unstructured search (Grover's algorithm) with structured search (ordered search).\n\n**Analysis of Task 1: Unstructured Search**\n- **Classical Complexity:** In an unsorted array of size $n$, finding a single marked item without any precomputation requires, in the worst case, checking all $n$ items. On average, it takes $O(n)$ queries.\n- **Quantum Complexity:** This is the canonical problem for Grover's algorithm. It finds the marked item with high probability using $O(\\sqrt{n})$ oracle queries. A known lower bound proves that any quantum algorithm for this problem requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. Thus, the optimal quantum query complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$.\n\n**Analysis of Task 2: Ordered Search**\n- **Classical Complexity:** The data is sorted, which allows the use of binary search. Each query to the comparison oracle halves the search space. This requires $O(\\log n)$ queries to find the target.\n- **Quantum Complexity:** A common misconception is to apply Grover's algorithm to the $\\log n$ steps of binary search, which would suggest a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ complexity. This is incorrect because the queries in binary search are dependent on previous results. The problem of searching a sorted list has a quantum query lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$. Since a quantum computer can simply execute the classical binary search algorithm in $O(\\log n)$ time, the optimal quantum query complexity is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. The structure of the problem (total order) limits the potential for quantum speedup.\n\n**Option Evaluation**\n*   **A. Correct.** It accurately states the $\\Theta(n)$ classical and $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ quantum complexities for unstructured search.\n*   **B. Incorrect.** It presents the common fallacy of a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ complexity for ordered search, which violates the $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound.\n*   **C. Correct.** It correctly states the $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound for ordered search and that the optimal complexity is $\\Theta(\\log n)$, offering no asymptotic speedup over classical binary search.\n*   **D. Correct.** If the oracle only allows equality testing, it cannot leverage the sorted order of the data. The problem becomes equivalent to an unstructured search, for which the complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$.",

In the real world, we must weigh a quantum algorithm's performance against the best available classical techniques, which often leverage preprocessing and sophisticated data structures. This practice challenges you to perform such a comparative analysis, pitting Grover's algorithm against classical hashing for a batch of search queries . You will analyze the asymptotic time complexities, factoring in crucial elements like one-time preprocessing costs and memory usage, to determine the threshold beyond which the classical approach becomes more efficient.",

            "problem": "You are given a static set of $N$ distinct keys drawn from a large universe, stored in arbitrary order in classical memory. You will receive a batch of $Q$ membership queries, each query asking whether a presented key is in the set. Assume the following computational models.\n\n- Classical, unstructured search with no precomputation uses only $O(1)$ extra memory and may sequentially inspect the stored keys.\n- Classical hashing with precomputation may preprocess the keys into a hash table using $O(N)$ extra memory and $O(N)$ preprocessing time; lookups in the resulting table have expected time $O(1)$ under standard hashing assumptions.\n- Grover’s algorithm for unstructured search runs in $O(\\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries per successful search using only $O(1)$ extra memory, and there is no assumed quantum random-access memory structure.\n\nYou should compare total time across the $Q$ queries and account for the one-time classical preprocessing cost when applicable. In addition, consider the effect of a memory budget $M$ when $M < N$ for classical hashing if relevant. Ignore constant factors and lower-order terms, and suppose that the hashing model uses separate chaining with table size proportional to the allocated memory so that load factor is $\\alpha = N/M$.\n\nWhich of the following statements are true?\n\nA. With no precomputation beyond $O(1)$ extra memory, Grover’s algorithm answers a single successful membership query in expected $O(\\sqrt{N})$ time, whereas the best classical method requires expected $O(N)$ time; thus Grover provides a quadratic advantage in $N$ in this regime.\n\nB. If a classical algorithm is allowed to build a hash table in $O(N)$ time using $O(N)$ memory, then for a batch of $Q$ queries the classical total time is $O(N + Q)$ while a straightforward application of Grover’s algorithm uses $O(Q\\sqrt{N})$ time. Consequently, there is a threshold $Q = \\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ beyond which the classical approach is asymptotically faster in total time.\n\nC. With $O(N)$ precomputation memory, a quantum algorithm can combine Grover’s algorithm with hashing to achieve worst-case $O(1)$ query time while using only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ preprocessing time.\n\nD. Even when restricted to a precomputation memory budget $M = o(N)$, a classical algorithm can guarantee expected $O(1)$ lookup time for arbitrary adversarial queries by using a carefully chosen hash function.\n\nE. Under separate chaining with a table of $M$ slots built in $O(N)$ time, the classical expected lookup time per query is $O(1 + N/M)$; hence a simple time–memory tradeoff is that expected per-query time scales as $O(N/M)$ when $M \\ll N$.",
            "solution": "This problem compares the total time complexity of classical and quantum search algorithms for a batch of $Q$ queries on a static dataset of size $N$, accounting for preprocessing.\n\n*   **A. Correct.** With no precomputation ($O(1)$ memory), a classical search is a linear scan, requiring expected $O(N)$ time. Grover's algorithm requires $O(\\sqrt{N})$ time (assuming oracle calls are $O(1)$). The speedup is quadratic since $(O(\\sqrt{N}))^2 = O(N)$.\n*   **B. Correct.** With precomputation, the classical algorithm pays a one-time cost of $O(N)$ to build a hash table, then each of the $Q$ queries takes $O(1)$ time. Total classical time: $O(N + Q)$. The quantum approach, running Grover for each query, takes $O(Q\\sqrt{N})$. To find the crossover point, we set $N + Q \\approx Q\\sqrt{N}$, which gives $Q \\approx N/(\\sqrt{N}-1) = \\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$. For $Q$ asymptotically larger than $\\sqrt{N}$, the classical approach is faster.\n*   **C. Incorrect.** Building any data structure (like a hash table) that depends on all $N$ items requires at least $\\Omega(N)$ time just to read the input data. A preprocessing time of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ is not possible.\n*   **D. Incorrect.** If the memory $M$ is sublinear in $N$ ($M=o(N)$), the hash table's load factor $\\alpha = N/M$ will grow without bound.

The expected lookup time is $O(1+\\alpha) = O(1+N/M)$. When $M \\ll N$, the $N/M$ term dominates, so the time scales as $O(N/M)$, demonstrating a clear time-memory tradeoff.",

            "problem": "Consider building a Grover oracle for a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with $n$ input bits and $m$ clauses, where each clause is the disjunction of exactly three literals (three-satisfiability, also called $3$-SAT). The oracle should flip the phase of computational basis states $|x\\rangle$ that satisfy all clauses. Assume the standard reversible compute–phase–uncompute pattern, and that the circuit is compiled into the Clifford plus $T$ (Clifford+$T$) gate set. Use the following modeling assumptions that are common in fault-tolerant resource estimation:\n\n- Each literal is either a variable $x_{j}$ or its negation $\\neg x_{j}$, and negations are implemented by Pauli-$X$ gates, which are Clifford gates.\n- A two-input disjunction $a \\lor b$ is implemented reversibly via De Morgan’s law as $a \\lor b = \\neg(\\neg a \\land \\neg b)$, so its non-Clifford cost is that of one two-input conjunction.\n- A two-input conjunction is implemented by a controlled-controlled-NOT (Toffoli) using clean ancillae.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the total $T$-count of a single Grover oracle application for a $3$-SAT problem with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses. The solution is derived based on the provided modeling assumptions for a circuit compiled into the Clifford+$T$ gate set.\n\nThe oracle implementation follows the standard compute-phase-uncompute pattern. The total $T$-count, denoted as $T_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the $T$-counts for these three stages:\n$$T_{\\text{total}} = T_{\\text{compute}} + T_{\\text{phase}} + T_{\\text{uncompute}}$$\n\nLet us analyze the $T$-count for each stage.\n\n1.  **Phase Stage ($T_{\\text{phase}}$):**\n    As per assumption 6, the conditional phase flip, which is applied to the final output bit of the computation, is implemented by a Clifford gate (such as a controlled-$Z$ gate). By definition, Clifford gates have a $T$-count of zero. Therefore,\n    $$T_{\\text{phase}} = 0$$\n\n2.  **Uncomputation Stage ($T_{\\text{uncompute}}$):**\n    Assumption 7 states that all intermediate values are uncomputed to restore ancilla qubits to their initial $|0\\rangle$ state. This is achieved by running the computation circuit in reverse. The inverse of a circuit composed of Clifford and $T$ gates has the same $T$-count as the original circuit because the inverse of a $T$ gate, $T^\\dagger$, has the same implementation cost. Thus, the $T$-count for the uncomputation stage is equal to the $T$-count for the computation stage:\n    $$T_{\\text{uncompute}} = T_{\\text{compute}}$$\n\n3.  **Total $T$-Count Expression:**\n    Substituting these into the initial equation, the total $T$-count for the oracle is:\n    $$T_{\\text{total}} = T_{\\text{compute}} + 0 + T_{\\text{compute}} = 2 \\times T_{\\text{compute}}$$\n    Our task reduces to finding the $T$-count for the computation stage, $T_{\\text{compute}}$.\n\n4.  **Computation Stage ($T_{\\text{compute}}$):**\n    The computation stage evaluates the entire Boolean formula for a given input $|x\\rangle$. This process can be divided into two main parts:\n    -   Part A: Evaluating each of the $m$ clauses of the $3$-SAT formula.\n    -   Part B: Computing the logical AND (conjunction) of the results of all $m$ clauses to get a single final bit indicating whether the input $|x\\rangle$ is a satisfying assignment.\n\n    Let's calculate the $T$-count for each part.\n\n    **Part A: Cost of Evaluating $m$ Clauses**\n    Each clause is a disjunction of three literals, e.g., $l_1 \\lor l_2 \\lor l_3$.\n    -   According to assumption 4, this is implemented by composing two $2$-input disjunctions, for example, as $(l_1 \\lor l_2) \\lor l_3$. This requires two $2$-input disjunction operations.\n    -   According to assumption 2, the non-Clifford cost of one $2$-input disjunction ($a \\lor b$) is that of one $2$-input conjunction.\n    -   According to assumption 3, a $2$-input conjunction is implemented using a Toffoli gate, which costs $7$ $T$ gates.\n    -   Thus, evaluating one clause requires $2$ Toffoli gates, for a $T$-count of $T_{\\text{clause}} = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n    -   Since there are $m$ clauses, the total $T$-count for Part A is:\n        $$T_{\\text{Part A}} = m \\times T_{\\text{clause}} = 14m$$\n\n    **Part B: Cost of the Global Conjunction**\n    This part takes the $m$ output bits from the clause evaluations and computes their logical AND.\n    -   According to assumption 5, this global conjunction is formed as a binary tree of $2$-input conjunctions.\n    -   To compute the conjunction of $m$ bits, $m-1$ applications of a $2$-input conjunction are required.\n    -   Each $2$-input conjunction is a Toffoli gate.\n    -   Therefore, this part requires $m-1$ Toffoli gates.\n    -   With each Toffoli gate costing $7$ $T$ gates, the total $T$-count for Part B is:\n        $$T_{\\text{Part B}} = (m-1) \\times 7 = 7m - 7$$\n\n    **Total Computation $T$-Count ($T_{\\text{compute}}$)**\n    The total $T$-count for the computation stage is the sum of the counts for Part A and Part B:\n    $$T_{\\text{compute}} = T_{\\text{Part A}} + T_{\\text{Part B}} = 14m + (7m - 7) = 21m - 7$$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Finally, we substitute the expression for $T_{\\text{compute}}$ back into the equation for the total oracle cost:\n    $$T_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times T_{\\text{compute}} = 2 \\times (21m - 7)$$\n    $$T_{\\text{total}} = 42m - 14$$\n\n    The result is a function of $m$ only.
