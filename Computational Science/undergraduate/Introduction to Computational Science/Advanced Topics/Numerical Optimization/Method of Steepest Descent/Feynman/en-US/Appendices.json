The core idea is that the value of the integral is overwhelmingly determined by the contributions from points where the exponent reaches its minimum. This first exercise  provides a clean, foundational example of applying this principle, guiding you through the process of identifying these critical points and summing their contributions to find the integral's leading-order behavior.",

The evaluation of such integrals in the limit of large $\\lambda$ is a common task in various fields of physics and engineering, often solvable using the method of steepest descent (also known as the saddle-point method).\n\nYour task is to find the leading-order asymptotic expression for $I(\\lambda)$ as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$.",
            "solution": "The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of the integral $I(\\lambda) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left[-\\lambda(t^2-a^2)^2\\right] dt$ for $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. This integral is in the standard form for the method of steepest descent, $\\int e^{-\\lambda \\phi(t)} dt$, where the phase function is $\\phi(t) = (t^2-a^2)^2$.\n\nThe method of steepest descent approximates the integral by contributions from the saddle points of the integrand, which correspond to the minima of the phase function $\\phi(t)$.\n\n1.  **Find the saddle points:**\n    The saddle points are the stationary points of $\\phi(t)$, found by setting its first derivative to zero.\n    $$\\phi'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2-a^2)^2 = 2(t^2-a^2)(2t) = 4t(t^2-a^2)$$\n    Setting $\\phi'(t) = 0$ gives $4t(t-a)(t+a) = 0$. The saddle points are located at $t_1 = 0$, $t_2 = a$, and $t_3 = -a$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the phase function at the saddle points:**\n    To determine which saddle points give the dominant contribution, we evaluate $\\phi(t)$ at each point. The integral is dominated by the points where $\\phi(t)$ is at its minimum value, since the exponential term $e^{-\\lambda \\phi(t)}$ will be largest there.\n    $$\\phi(t_1) = \\phi(0) = (0^2 - a^2)^2 = a^4$$\n    $$\\phi(t_2) = \\phi(a) = (a^2 - a^2)^2 = 0$$\n    $$\\phi(t_3) = \\phi(-a) = ((-a)^2 - a^2)^2 = 0$$\n    Since $a$ is a positive constant, $a^4 > 0$. The minimum value of $\\phi(t)$ is $0$, which occurs at the two saddle points $t = a$ and $t = -a$. Therefore, the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the integral is given by the sum of the contributions from the neighborhoods of these two points. The contribution from $t=0$ will be suppressed by a factor of $e^{-\\lambda a^4}$ and is thus negligible for large $\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the behavior near the dominant saddle points:**\n    The contribution of a saddle point $t_k$ to the integral is given by the Gaussian integral approximation in its vicinity. The standard formula for the leading-order contribution from a simple saddle point $t_k$ is:\n    $$I_k(\\lambda) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda \\phi''(t_k)}} e^{-\\lambda \\phi(t_k)}$$\n    We need the second derivative of $\\phi(t)$:\n    $$\\phi''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^3 - 4a^2t) = 12t^2 - 4a^2$$\n    Now, we evaluate $\\phi''(t)$ at the two dominant saddle points:\n    For $t=a$:\n    $$\\phi''(a) = 12a^2 - 4a^2 = 8a^2$$\n    For $t=-a$:\n    $$\\phi''(-a) = 12(-a)^2 - 4a^2 = 12a^2 - 4a^2 = 8a^2$$\n    Since $\\phi''(a)$ and $\\phi''(-a)$ are positive, these points are indeed minima along the real axis, and the path of integration (the real line) is a path of steepest descent through these saddles.\n\n4.  **Calculate the contributions and sum them:**\n    The contribution from the saddle point at $t=a$ is:\n    $$I_a(\\lambda) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda \\phi''(a)}} e^{-\\lambda \\phi(a)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda (8a^2)}} e^{-\\lambda(0)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\lambda a^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2a\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$$\n    The contribution from the saddle point at $t=-a$ is:\n    $$I_{-a}(\\lambda) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda \\phi''(-a)}} e^{-\\lambda \\phi(-a)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda (8a^2)}} e^{-\\lambda(0)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2a\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$$\n    The total leading-order asymptotic approximation for the integral is the sum of these two contributions:\n    $$I(\\lambda) \\sim I_a(\\lambda) + I_{-a}(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2a\\sqrt{\\lambda}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2a\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2a\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{a\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$$",

The target function is the two-dimensional real-valued function defined by $f(\\mathbf{x}) = f(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{4}$. The aim is to demonstrate, by explicit computation, both the underlying principles and the numerical behavior of the methods, including a case where Newton’s method fails because the Hessian matrix is not positive definite in the sense of symmetric positive definiteness (Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)).\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n- Use only the base definitions from multivariable calculus: differentiability, directional derivative, gradient as the direction of steepest ascent in the Euclidean norm, and the second-order Taylor approximation to derive the search directions chosen by the method of steepest descent and by Newton’s method. Do not assume any prepackaged iteration formula.\n- Implement the method of steepest descent with a backtracking line search that enforces a standard sufficient decrease condition based on a first-order model. The method must be stable and produce a monotonically decreasing sequence of function values for this problem when started from any of the provided initial points.\n- Implement Newton’s method as the minimization of the quadratic model obtained from the second-order Taylor expansion; at each iteration, compute the step by solving a linear system. Declare Newton’s method as failed at an iterate if the Hessian is not invertible (for example, not SPD in a way that prevents solving the linear system), making the Newton step undefined.\n- Use the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Use the following generic stopping criterion for both methods: stop successfully when $\\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_{k}) \\rVert_{2} \\le \\varepsilon$ with tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$. Use a maximum of $50$ iterations for Newton’s method and a maximum of $10000$ iterations for steepest descent. For the backtracking line search in steepest descent, use an initial step length $\\alpha_{0} = 1$, a sufficient decrease parameter $c_{1} = 10^{-4}$, and a contraction factor $\\tau = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. If the step length falls below $10^{-16}$ without satisfying the sufficient decrease condition, declare the steepest descent method as failed at that iteration.\n- The program must treat the Hessian singularity explicitly: if the linear system for Newton’s step cannot be solved because the Hessian is singular (or otherwise prevents a unique solution), report a failure for that test case in Newton’s method.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your program to run the following initial points $(x_{0},y_{0})$:\n- Case A (general “happy path”): $(x_{0},y_{0}) = (1,1)$.\n- Case B (Hessian singular along one axis): $(x_{0},y_{0}) = (1,0)$.\n- Case C (stationary optimum already at start): $(x_{0},y_{0}) = (0,0)$.\n- Case D (negative coordinate, quartic asymmetry test): $(x_{0},y_{0}) = (5,-1)$.\n\nQuantifiable outputs:\nFor each test case $i$ in the order A, B, C, D, compute and report the following six values in order:\n- $n\\_status\\_i$: an integer where $1$ means Newton’s method converged within the iteration limit, and $0$ means it failed to converge or could not compute a step due to a non-invertible Hessian.\n- $n\\_iters\\_i$: the integer number of iterations actually performed by Newton’s method when it stopped (either by convergence or by failure).\n- $n\\_f\\_i$: the final function value $f$ at termination of Newton’s method as a floating-point number.\n- $sd\\_status\\_i$: an integer where $1$ means the method of steepest descent converged within the iteration limit, and $0$ means it failed to converge under the given line search rules.\n- $sd\\_iters\\_i$: the integer number of iterations actually performed by the method of steepest descent when it stopped.\n- $sd\\_f\\_i$: the final function value $f$ at termination of the method of steepest descent as a floating-point number.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the concatenated results for all four cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and comparative analysis of two fundamental iterative optimization algorithms, the method of steepest descent and Newton's method, applied to the minimization of the multivariate function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^4$. The derivation of the iterative steps must be performed from first principles of multivariable calculus, and the implementation must adhere to specified parameters and handle a specific failure case for Newton's method involving a singular Hessian matrix.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary mathematical objects for the function $f(\\mathbf{x})$ where $\\mathbf{x} = [x, y]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The function is $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^4$.\nThe gradient of $f$, which is a vector of its partial derivatives, is required for both methods. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest local ascent.\n$$\n\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x \\\\ 4y^3 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA necessary condition for a point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ to be a minimizer is that the gradient vanishes, $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\mathbf{0}$. For the given function, this condition is $2x = 0$ and $4y^3 = 0$, which uniquely yields the point $(0, 0)$. Thus, $\\mathbf{x}^* = (0, 0)^T$ is the only stationary point, and since $f(\\mathbf{x}) > 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ and $f(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$, it is the global minimum.\n\nFor Newton's method, the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives, is also required.\n$$\nH_f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12y^2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix describes the local curvature of the function.\n\n**Method of Steepest Descent**\n\nThe method of steepest descent is an iterative algorithm that moves in the direction opposite to the gradient at each step. This direction, $-\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$, is the direction of steepest local descent.\nThe derivation begins with the first-order Taylor approximation of $f$ around a point $\\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\mathbf{p}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^T \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nTo achieve the most significant decrease in $f$ for a step $\\mathbf{p}$ of a fixed small length, say $\\lVert \\mathbf{p} \\rVert_2 = \\delta$, we must minimize $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^T \\mathbf{p}$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, this dot product is minimized when $\\mathbf{p}$ is antiparallel to $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$. Thus, the search direction $\\mathbf{p}_k$ is chosen as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_k = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nThe iterative update rule is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k = \\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_k > 0$ is the step length. An appropriate value for $\\alpha_k$ is crucial for convergence. A backtracking line search is employed to find a suitable $\\alpha_k$. Starting with an initial guess, $\\alpha = \\alpha_0$, the step length is repeatedly reduced by a contraction factor $\\tau$ until the Armijo sufficient decrease condition is met:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha \\mathbf{p}_k) \\le f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^T \\mathbf{p}_k\n$$\nFor our choice of $\\mathbf{p}_k = - \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)) \\le f(\\mathbf{x}_k) - c_1 \\alpha \\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThe parameters for the line search are specified as $\\alpha_0 = 1$, $c_1 = 10^{-4}$, and $\\tau = 1/2$. The method terminates when $\\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ or if the maximum number of iterations, $10000$, is reached. A failure is declared if the step length $\\alpha$ becomes smaller than $10^{-16}$ during the line search without satisfying the condition.\n\n**Newton's Method**\n\nNewton's method uses a more sophisticated model of the function by employing the second-order Taylor expansion around the current iterate $\\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\mathbf{p}) \\approx m_k(\\mathbf{p}) = f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^T \\mathbf{p} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{p}^T H_f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nThe method determines the next step $\\mathbf{p}_k$ by finding the minimizer of this quadratic model $m_k(\\mathbf{p})$. A necessary condition for $\\mathbf{p}_k$ to minimize $m_k(\\mathbf{p})$ is that the gradient of the model with respect to $\\mathbf{p}$ is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla m_k(\\mathbf{p}) = \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + H_f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis yields the Newton system, a system of linear equations for the step $\\mathbf{p}_k$:\n$$\nH_f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\mathbf{p}_k = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nThe next iterate is then $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\mathbf{p}_k$. No line search is required in this pure form of the method (step length $\\alpha_k = 1$ is always used).\n\nA unique solution for $\\mathbf{p}_k$ exists if and only if the Hessian matrix $H_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ is invertible. If $H_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ is singular (not invertible), the Newton step is not well-defined, and the method fails. For the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^4$, the Hessian $H_f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{diag}(2, 12y^2)$ has determinant $\\det(H_f(\\mathbf{x})) = 24y^2$. The Hessian is singular if and only if $y=0$. Therefore, Newton's method will fail if an iterate $\\mathbf{x}_k$ has its y-component equal to zero, unless the gradient is already zero at that point.\n\nThe method terminates when $\\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ or if the maximum number of iterations, $50$, is reached. Failure is reported if the Newton system cannot be solved due to a singular Hessian.\n\n**Analysis of Test Cases**\n\n- **Case A: $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (1, 1)^T$.** Here, $y_0 \\ne 0$, so the initial Hessian $H_f(1, 1) = \\text{diag}(2, 12)$ is positive-definite. Both methods are expected to converge to the minimum at $(0, 0)^T$. Newton's method is expected to exhibit quadratic convergence and be significantly faster.\n\n- **Case B: $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (1, 0)^T$.** At this point, $y_0 = 0$. The gradient is $\\nabla f(1, 0) = [2, 0]^T \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, so we are not at the minimum. The Hessian is $H_f(1, 0) = \\text{diag}(2, 0)$, which is singular. The Newton system $H_f(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\mathbf{p}_0 = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is inconsistent and does not have a unique solution. Therefore, Newton's method is expected to fail at the first iteration. Steepest descent will proceed with search direction $\\mathbf{p}_0 = -[2, 0]^T$, moving along the x-axis towards the origin, and is expected to converge.\n\n- **Case C: $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (0, 0)^T$.** This is the optimal solution. The initial gradient is $\\nabla f(0, 0) = [0, 0]^T$, and its norm is $0$, which satisfies the stopping criterion. Both methods should terminate immediately with $0$ iterations.\n\n- **Case D: $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (5, -1)^T$.** Similar to Case A, $y_0 \\ne 0$, so the initial Hessian is positive-definite. Both methods are expected to converge, with Newton's method being much faster. The negative y-coordinate has no qualitative effect since the function depends on $y^4$.",
