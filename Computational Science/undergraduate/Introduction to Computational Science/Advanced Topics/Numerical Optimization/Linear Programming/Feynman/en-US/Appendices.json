            "solution": "The problem requires solving a linear programming (LP) model for several instances, each defined by a different cost coefficient $c_A$ for the variable $x_A$. This is a sensitivity analysis on an objective function coefficient.\n\nThe LP model can be expressed in matrix form. Let the vector of decision variables be $\\mathbf{x} = [x_{A}, x_{C}, x_{B}, x_{R}, x_{Br}]^T$. The objective is to minimize the total cost $z = \\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$, where the cost vector is $\\mathbf{c} = [c_{A}, 2.5, 1.2, 0.6, 0.8]^T$.\n\nThe constraints are of the form $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}$, where the constraint matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the requirements vector $\\mathbf{b}$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n240 & 200 & 180 & 220 & 55 \\\\\n3 & 35 & 12 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n22 & 5 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n10 & 0 & 12 & 1 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2000 \\\\\n50 \\\\\n44 \\\\\n30\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe decision variables must also satisfy the non-negativity constraint $\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nTo solve this problem computationally, we use a standard LP solver. Many software libraries, such as `scipy.optimize.linprog` in Python, can solve such problems. These functions are typically designed to solve minimization problems of the form:\nMinimize $\\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$ subject to $\\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{eq} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}_{eq}$, with bounds on $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nOur problem's constraints are of the \"greater than or equal to\" type, $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}$. These must be converted to the \"less than or equal to\" form required by the solver. This is achieved by multiplying the inequality by $-1$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b} \\iff -\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\le -\\mathbf{b}\n$$\nTherefore, we would pass $\\mathbf{A}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{b}$ to the solver. The non-negativity constraint $x_i \\ge 0$ is handled by setting the `bounds` for each variable to $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe solution algorithm is as follows:\n1. Define the constant matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n2. Define the list of test values for the avocado price $c_A$: $\\{1.00, 0.50, 10.00, 12.00, 25.00\\}$.\n3. Iterate through each value of $c_A$ in the test suite.\n4. In each iteration, construct the corresponding cost vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n5. Call an LP solver with the cost vector $\\mathbf{c}$, the transformed constraint matrix $-\\mathbf{A}$, the transformed requirements vector $-\\mathbf{b}$, and the non-negativity bounds.\n6.

Store the pair $[x_A^\\star, z^\\star]$.\n8.

            "solution": "The problem asks to diagnose whether the basic feasible solution (BFS) associated with the given basis $B$ certifies unboundedness and to compute the rate of increase of the objective function along the corresponding ray.\n\nFirst, we partition the matrix $A$ and vectors $x$ and $c$ according to the basic and nonbasic indices. The basic indices are $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 2\\}$ and nonbasic indices are $\\mathcal{N} = \\{3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe basis matrix $A_B$ consists of the first two columns of $A$, and the nonbasic matrix $A_N$ consists of the last two columns:\n$$\nA_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A_N = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 \\\\ 2 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe variables and objective coefficients are partitioned similarly:\n$$\nx_B = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad x_N = \\begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nc_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c_N = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first step is to find the basic solution corresponding to the basis $B$. This is done by setting the nonbasic variables to zero, $x_N = 0$, and solving for the basic variables $x_B$ from the equation $A_B x_B = b$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the first row, $2x_1 = 8$, which gives $x_1 = 4$.\nSubstituting into the second row, $4 + x_2 = 7$, which gives $x_2 = 3$.\nThe basic solution is $x_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since both components are non-negative ($4 \\ge 0$ and $3 \\ge 0$), this is a basic feasible solution (BFS). The full solution vector is $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$.\n\nNext, we check for unboundedness. According to the fundamental principles of the simplex method, the primal LP is unbounded if there exists a nonbasic variable $x_j$ (where $j \\in \\mathcal{N}$) such that:\n1.  Increasing $x_j$ from $0$ increases the objective function. For a maximization problem, this means its reduced cost $\\bar{c}_j$ must be positive.\n2.  As $x_j$ increases, the solution remains feasible. This means that all current basic variables $x_B$ remain non-negative.\n\nThe reduced cost for a nonbasic variable $x_j$ is given by the formula $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - c_B^T A_B^{-1} a_j$, where $a_j$ is the $j$-th column of $A$. Let's first compute the inverse of the basis matrix $A_B$:\n$$\n\\det(A_B) = (2)(1) - (0)(1) = 2\n$$\n$$\nA_B^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the reduced costs for the nonbasic variables $x_3$ and $x_4$. It is efficient to first compute the vector $y^T = c_B^T A_B^{-1}$:\n$$\ny^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/2 + 1/2 & 0 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced costs are $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - y^T a_j$:\nFor $j=3$: $a_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_3 = c_3 - y^T a_3 = 0 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 - (2 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 2) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nFor $j=4$: $a_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_4 = c_4 - y^T a_4 = 2 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 - (2 \\cdot (-4) - 1 \\cdot (-3)) = 2 - (-8 + 3) = 2 - (-5) = 7\n$$\nSince $\\bar{c}_4 = 7 > 0$, increasing $x_4$ will increase the objective function. So, $j=4$ is our candidate nonbasic index.\n\nNow we check the second condition. We consider a move from the current BFS $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ in a direction where $x_4$ increases by a parameter $t \\ge 0$, i.e., $x_4(t) = t$. The other nonbasic variable $x_3$ remains $0$. The basic variables $x_B(t)$ adjust to maintain feasibility:\n$A_B x_B(t) + a_4 x_4(t) = b \\implies A_B x_B(t) = b - a_4 t$.\n$x_B(t) = A_B^{-1}(b - a_4 t) = A_B^{-1}b - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nSince $x_B = A_B^{-1}b$ is our current basic feasible solution, we have $x_B(t) = x_B - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nFor the solution to remain feasible for all $t > 0$, we must have $x_B(t) \\ge 0$. As $x_B > 0$, this condition is guaranteed if all components of the vector update $-A_B^{-1}a_4$ are non-negative, which is equivalent to every component of the vector $d_j = A_B^{-1}a_j$ being non-positive. Let's calculate $d_4 = A_B^{-1} a_4$:\n$$\nd_4 = A_B^{-1} a_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 2 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince all components of $d_4$ are negative (and thus non-positive), the condition is met. The basic variables evolve as:\n$$\nx_B(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - t \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 + 2t \\\\ 3 + t \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor any $t \\ge 0$, both $x_1(t) = 4+2t$ and $x_2(t) = 3+t$ are non-negative.\nThe full solution vector along the ray is $x(t) = (4+2t, 3+t, 0, t)^T$. This path is feasible for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe problem is unbounded. The ray of unboundedness starts at $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ and extends in the direction $d = (2, 1, 0, 1)^T$.\nThe final step is to compute the rate of increase in the objective function $z = c^T x$ along this ray. The objective value as a function of the parameter $t$ is $z(t) = c^T x(t)$:\n$$\nz(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4+2t \\\\ 3+t \\\\ 0 \\\\ t \\end{pmatrix} = 3(4+2t) - 1(3+t) + 2t\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = 12 + 6t - 3 - t + 2t = (12-3) + (6-1+2)t = 9 + 7t\n$$\nThe value of the objective at the BFS is $z(0) = 9$. The objective increases linearly with $t$. The rate of increase of the objective per unit parameter $t$ (which corresponds to a unit increase in $x_4$) is the derivative of $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 7\n$$\nAs established by the theory, this rate of increase is precisely the reduced cost of the entering variable, $\\bar{c}_4$.\n\nThe exact scalar rate of increase is $7$.",
