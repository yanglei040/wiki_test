            "problem": "A Resistor–Inductor–Capacitor (RLC) series circuit is driven in sinusoidal steady state by a source at angular frequency $\\omega$. The impedance of the inductor is $j \\omega L$, the impedance of the capacitor is $\\frac{1}{j \\omega C}$, and the impedance of the resistor is $R$, where $j$ denotes the imaginary unit, $L$ is the inductance, $C$ is the capacitance, and $R$ is the resistance. In the usual engineering sense of resonance for a series RLC network, the resonance angular frequency $\\omega_{0}$ is defined as the frequency at which the net reactance is zero, so that the impedance is purely real. \n\nManufacturing tolerance in the capacitor means that the realized capacitance is $C + \\delta C$ with $|\\delta C| \\ll C$. Using first principles (the impedance definition and the resonance condition), derive the resonance angular frequency $\\omega_{0}$ as a function of $L$ and $C$, and then from the total differential define the normalized sensitivity of $\\omega_{0}$ with respect to $C$ as\n$$\nS_{C} \\equiv \\frac{C}{\\omega_{0}} \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{0}}{\\partial C}.\n$$\nCompute $S_{C}$, expressing your final answer as a single real number.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in circuit analysis and sensitivity theory. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total impedance $Z$ of a series RLC circuit is the sum of the individual impedances of the resistor ($R$), inductor ($L$), and capacitor ($C$). The impedances are given as $Z_R = R$, $Z_L = j \\omega L$, and $Z_C = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C}$, where $j$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $j^2 = -1$.\n\nThe total impedance as a function of angular frequency $\\omega$ is:\n$$\nZ(\\omega) = Z_R + Z_L + Z_C = R + j \\omega L + \\frac{1}{j \\omega C}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\frac{1}{j} = -j$, we can rewrite the impedance as:\n$$\nZ(\\omega) = R + j \\omega L - \\frac{j}{\\omega C} = R + j \\left(\\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)\n$$\nThe impedance $Z(\\omega)$ is a complex number with a real part (resistance) and an imaginary part (reactance). The real part is $\\text{Re}(Z) = R$, and the imaginary part, or net reactance, is $\\text{Im}(Z) = X(\\omega) = \\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C}$.\n\nThe problem defines the resonance angular frequency, $\\omega_0$, as the frequency at which the net reactance is zero. This condition implies that the imaginary part of the total impedance vanishes:\n$$\n\\text{Im}(Z(\\omega_0)) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the reactance, we get:\n$$\n\\omega_0 L - \\frac{1}{\\omega_0 C} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $\\omega_0$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\omega_0 L = \\frac{1}{\\omega_0 C}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{LC}\n$$\nSince angular frequency must be a positive quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$\n\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} = (LC)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the resonance angular frequency as a function of inductance $L$ and capacitance $C$.\n\nNext, we must compute the normalized sensitivity of $\\omega_0$ with respect to $C$, which is defined as:\n$$\nS_{C} \\equiv \\frac{C}{\\omega_{0}} \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{0}}{\\partial C}\n$$\nTo compute this, we first need to find the partial derivative of $\\omega_0$ with respect to $C$. We treat $L$ as a constant.\n$$\n\\omega_0(C) = L^{-1/2} C^{-1/2}\n$$\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega_0}{\\partial C} = L^{-1/2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} C^{-1/2 - 1}\\right) = L^{-1/2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} C^{-3/2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega_0}{\\partial C} = -\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1/2} C^{-3/2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\omega_0$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\omega_0}{\\partial C}$ into the sensitivity formula:\n$$\nS_C = \\frac{C}{\\omega_0} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1/2} C^{-3/2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstitute $\\omega_0 = (LC)^{-1/2} = L^{-1/2}C^{-1/2}$:\n$$\nS_C = \\frac{C}{L^{-1/2}C^{-1/2}} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1/2} C^{-3/2} \\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the terms:\n$$\nS_C = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{C}{L^{-1/2}C^{-1/2}} \\cdot L^{-1/2} C^{-3/2}\n$$\nThe terms involving $L$ cancel out: $L^{-1/2}$ in the numerator and $L^{-1/2}$ in the denominator.\n$$\nS_C = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{C}{C^{-1/2}} \\cdot C^{-3/2}\n$$\nNow, combine the powers of $C$:\n$$\nS_C = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot C^{1 - (-1/2) - 3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot C^{1 + 1/2 - 3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot C^{3/2 - 3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot C^0\n$$\nSince any non-zero quantity raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, we have:\n$$\nS_C = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe normalized sensitivity of the resonance angular frequency with respect to the capacitance is a constant value of $-\\frac{1}{2}$.

The Principle of Superposition and the Difference Field**\nThe governing PDE is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-\\,k\\,\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + c\\,u = f \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,L)\n$$\nLet us denote the linear differential operator as $\\mathcal{L}u = -k\\,u'' + c\\,u$.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nWe analyze the two types of sensitivity for both simple and double roots. This requires the use of Taylor series expansions for the function $f(x)$ around the root $x=r$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis for a Simple Root**\nA simple root $x=r$ is characterized by $f(r)=0$ and $f'(r)\\neq 0$.\n\n**1.1. Sensitivity of the Solution**\nWe analyze the perturbed equation $f(x) + \\varepsilon = 0$. Let the new root be $x(\\varepsilon) = r + \\delta r$. We assume $\\delta r$ is small for small $\\varepsilon$.\nWe substitute $x=r+\\delta r$ into the equation:\n$$f(r+\\delta r) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nWe perform a Taylor expansion of $f(r+\\delta r)$ around $r$:\n$$f(r) + f'(r)\\delta r + \\mathcal{O}((\\delta r)^2) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nSince $f(r)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$f'(r)\\delta r + \\mathcal{O}((\\delta r)^2) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nFor small $\\varepsilon$, $\\delta r$ is also small, so we can neglect the higher-order terms:\n$$f'(r)\\delta r \\approx -\\varepsilon$$\nSolving for the root perturbation $\\delta r$:\n$$\\delta r \\approx -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{f'(r)}$$\nSince $f'(r)$ is a non-zero constant, the perturbation in the root, $\\delta r$, is directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$. Thus, the root shift is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. This indicates the problem is well-conditioned.\n\n**1.2. Sensitivity of Newton's Method (One-Step Error)**\nLet the initial guess be $x_0 = r + e_0$, where $e_0$ is the initial error. The first iteration gives $x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$. The new error is $e_1 = x_1 - r$.\n$$e_1 = (x_0 - r) - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = e_0 - \\frac{f(r+e_0)}{f'(r+e_0)}$$\nWe use Taylor expansions for the numerator and denominator around $r$:\n$$f(r+e_0) = f(r) + f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{f''(r)}{2!}e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3) = f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{f''(r)}{2}e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3)$$\n$$f'(r+e_0) = f'(r) + f''(r)e_0 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $e_1$:\n$$e_1 = e_0 - \\frac{f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3)}{f'(r) + f''(r)e_0 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)}$$\nFactor out $f'(r)$ from the denominator:\n$$e_1 = e_0 - \\frac{f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2 + \\dots}{f'(r) \\left(1 + \\frac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}e_0 + \\dots\\right)}$$\nUsing the geometric series approximation $\\frac{1}{1+z} \\approx 1-z$ for small $z = \\frac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}e_0$:\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\frac{1}{f'(r)} \\left(f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}e_0\\right)$$\nExpanding and keeping terms up to order $e_0^2$:\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\frac{1}{f'(r)} \\left(f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2 - f'(r)\\frac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}e_0^2\\right)$$\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\frac{1}{f'(r)} \\left(f'(r)e_0 - \\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2\\right)$$\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\left(e_0 - \\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}e_0^2\\right) = \\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}e_0^2$$\nThe error $e_1$ is proportional to the square of the previous error $e_0$. Therefore, $e_1 = \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$, which is the signature of quadratic convergence.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis for a Double Root**\nA double root $x=r$ is characterized by $f(r)=0$, $f'(r)=0$, and $f''(r)\\neq 0$.\n\n**2.1. Sensitivity of the Solution**\nWe again analyze the perturbed equation $f(x) + \\varepsilon = 0$ with $x(\\varepsilon) = r + \\delta r$.\n$$f(r+\\delta r) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nThe Taylor expansion of $f(r+\\delta r)$ around $r$ is:\n$$f(r) + f'(r)\\delta r + \\frac{f''(r)}{2!}(\\delta r)^2 + \\mathcal{O}((\\delta r)^3) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nUsing the conditions for a double root, this becomes:\n$$0 + 0 \\cdot \\delta r + \\frac{f''(r)}{2}(\\delta r)^2 + \\mathcal{O}((\\delta r)^3) + \\varepsilon = 0$$\nFor small $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta r$, we neglect the higher-order term:\n$$\\frac{f''(r)}{2}(\\delta r)^2 \\approx -\\varepsilon$$\nSolving for $\\delta r$:\n$$(\\delta r)^2 \\approx -\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{f''(r)} \\implies |\\delta r| \\approx \\sqrt{\\left|-\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{f''(r)}\\right|}$$\nThe magnitude of the root perturbation $|\\delta r|$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|}$. Thus, the root shift is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|})$. The square root dependence indicates that the problem of finding a double root is ill-conditioned.\n\n**2.2. Sensitivity of Newton's Method (One-Step Error)**\nAs before, $e_1 = e_0 - \\frac{f(r+e_0)}{f'(r+e_0)}$. We use Taylor expansions appropriate for a double root:\n$$f(r+e_0) = f(r) + f'(r)e_0 + \\frac{f''(r)}{2}e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3) = \\frac{f''(r)}{2}e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3)$$\n$$f'(r+e_0) = f'(r) + f''(r)e_0 + \\frac{f'''(r)}{2}e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3) = f''(r)e_0 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$$\nSubstitute these into the expression for $e_1$:\n$$e_1 = e_0 - \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^3)}{f''(r)e_0 + \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)}$$\nTo find the dominant behavior for small $e_0$, we consider the ratio of the leading terms:\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}f''(r)e_0^2}{f''(r)e_0}$$\nSince $f''(r)\\neq 0$ and we assume $e_0\\neq 0$, we can simplify:\n$$e_1 \\approx e_0 - \\frac{1}{2}e_0 = \\frac{1}{2}e_0$$\nThe error $e_1$ is linearly proportional to the previous error $e_0$, with a constant factor of approximately $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $e_1 = \\mathcal{O}(e_0)$, which indicates linear convergence.\n\n### Summary of Results and Option Evaluation\n- **Simple Root**:\n    - Solution sensitivity: $\\delta r = \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$.\n    - Method sensitivity: $e_1 = \\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$.\n- **Double Root**:\n    - Solution sensitivity: $|\\delta r| = \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|})$.\n    - Method sensitivity: $e_1 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e_0$, so $e_1 = \\mathcal{O}(e_0)$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this summary.\n\n**A. Near a simple root, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$, and Newton’s one-step error satisfies $e_1=\\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$; near a double root, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|})$, and Newton’s one-step error satisfies $e_1=\\mathcal{O}(e_0)$ (specifically, $e_1\\approx \\dfrac{1}{2}e_0$).**\nThis option perfectly matches all four parts of our derived results.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Near a simple root, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|})$, and Newton’s one-step error satisfies $e_1=\\mathcal{O}(e_0)$; near a double root, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$, and Newton’s one-step error satisfies $e_1=\\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$.**\nThis option swaps the results for simple and double roots.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In both the simple root and double root cases, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$, and Newton’s one-step error satisfies $e_1=\\mathcal{O}(e_0^2)$.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that the behavior for a double root is the same as for a simple root. Our derivation shows significant differences in both solution sensitivity and method convergence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Near a double root, the solution to $f(x)+\\varepsilon=0$ has a root shift of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$, and Newton’s method removes the initial error exactly in one step, i.e., $e_1=0$ for all sufficiently small $e_0$.**\nThis option makes two incorrect claims about the double root case. The root shift is $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\varepsilon|})$, not $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. Newton's method converges linearly ($e_1 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e_0$), it does not converge in one step ($e_1=0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
