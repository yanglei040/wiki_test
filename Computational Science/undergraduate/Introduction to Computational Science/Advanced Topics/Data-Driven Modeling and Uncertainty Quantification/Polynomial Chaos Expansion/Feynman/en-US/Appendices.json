            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the function $f(\\xi) = \\sin(a\\,\\xi)$ where $\\xi$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$. The probability density function (PDF) for $\\xi$ is thus $p_{\\xi}(x) = 1$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ and $p_{\\xi}(x) = 0$ otherwise. We are using a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) with a basis of orthonormal shifted Legendre polynomials $\\{\\phi_n(x)\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nThe inner product with respect to the weighting function $w(x) = p_{\\xi}(x) = 1$ is defined as:\n$$ \\langle g, h \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x) h(x) w(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x) h(x) \\,dx $$\nThe orthonormality of the basis functions implies $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\delta_{nm}$, where $\\delta_{nm}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe PCE of the function $f(\\xi)$ is given by the series expansion:\n$$ f(\\xi) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n \\phi_n(\\xi) $$\nwhere the coefficients $c_n$ are determined by projecting the function $f$ onto the basis functions:\n$$ c_n = \\langle f, \\phi_n \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_n(x) \\,dx $$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Zero-Order Coefficient ($c_0$)**\n\nThe first task is to find the expression for the coefficient $c_0$, which corresponds to the zero-order basis function $\\phi_0(x)$. The zeroth-order shifted Legendre polynomial is a constant, let's denote the standard (non-normalized) polynomial as $P_0^*(x) = 1$. To find the orthonormal basis function $\\phi_0(x)$, we must normalize $P_0^*(x)$. Let $\\phi_0(x) = k$ for some constant $k$. The normalization condition is $\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_0 \\rangle = 1$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} (k)^2 \\,dx = 1 $$\n$$ k^2 \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\,dx = 1 $$\n$$ k^2 [x]_{0}^{1} = 1 \\implies k^2 (1 - 0) = 1 \\implies k^2 = 1 $$\nWe choose the positive root, so $k=1$. Thus, the zero-order orthonormal basis function is $\\phi_0(x) = 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the coefficient $c_0$ using its definition:\n$$ c_0 = \\langle f, \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_0(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(a\\,x) \\cdot 1 \\,dx $$\nThis integral is evaluated as:\n$$ c_0 = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{a} \\cos(a\\,x) \\right]_{0}^{1} = -\\frac{1}{a} (\\cos(a \\cdot 1) - \\cos(a \\cdot 0)) $$\nSince $\\cos(0) = 1$, we get:\n$$ c_0 = -\\frac{1}{a} (\\cos(a) - 1) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{a} $$\nThis is the expression for the zero-order coefficient.\n\n**2. PCE Approximation of the Expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\sin(a\\,\\xi)]$**\n\nThe PCE truncated at a polynomial degree $P$ provides an approximation of the function $f(\\xi)$, denoted as $f_P(\\xi)$:\n$$ f_P(\\xi) = \\sum_{n=0}^{P} c_n \\phi_n(\\xi) $$\nThe expectation of this approximation is given by:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[f_P(\\xi)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{P} c_n \\phi_n(\\xi)\\right] $$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[f_P(\\xi)] = \\sum_{n=0}^{P} c_n \\mathbb{E}[\\phi_n(\\xi)] $$\nThe expectation of a basis function $\\phi_n(\\xi)$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\phi_n(\\xi)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi_n(x) p_{\\xi}(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_n(x) \\cdot 1 \\,dx $$\nRecalling that $\\phi_0(x) = 1$, we can write this integral as an inner product:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\phi_n(\\xi)] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_n(x) \\phi_0(x) \\,dx = \\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_0 \\rangle $$\nDue to the orthonormality of the basis, $\\langle \\phi_n, \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\delta_{n0}$. This means $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi_0(\\xi)] = 1$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi_n(\\xi)] = 0$ for all $n > 0$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the expectation of the PCE:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[f_P(\\xi)] = c_0 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\phi_0(\\xi)] + \\sum_{n=1}^{P} c_n \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\phi_n(\\xi)] = c_0 \\cdot 1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{P} c_n \\cdot 0 = c_0 $$\nThis demonstrates a fundamental property of PCE: the expectation of the PCE approximation of any order $P \\ge 0$ is exactly equal to the zero-order coefficient $c_0$. The specification of truncation at polynomial degree $3$ is therefore immaterial for the calculation of the mean.\nThe PCE approximation for the expectation is thus:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sin(a\\,\\xi)] \\approx c_0 = \\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{a} $$\n\n**3. Exact Analytic Expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\sin(a\\,\\xi)]$.**\n\nWe can derive the exact expectation from first principles using the definition of expectation for a function of a continuous random variable:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[g(\\xi)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x) p_{\\xi}(x) \\,dx $$\nFor our problem, $g(\\xi) = \\sin(a\\,\\xi)$ and $p_{\\xi}(x) = 1$ on $[0,1]$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sin(a\\,\\xi)] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(a\\,x) \\cdot 1 \\,dx $$\nThis is precisely the same integral we evaluated for $c_0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sin(a\\,\\xi)] = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{a} \\cos(a\\,x) \\right]_{0}^{1} = -\\frac{1}{a} (\\cos(a) - \\cos(0)) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{a} $$\nAs established in Part 2, the zero-order PCE coefficient is not an approximation but is identical to the exact mean of the random quantity.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation for $a = \\pi$.**\n\nFinally, we evaluate the derived expression for the expectation when $a=\\pi$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sin(\\pi\\,\\xi)] = \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi)}{\\pi} $$\nUsing the fact that $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, we have:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\sin(\\pi\\,\\xi)] = \\frac{1 - (-1)}{\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} $$\nTo provide the numerical value, we compute this quantity:\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 0.63661977... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.6366$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansions, a standard method in uncertainty quantification. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, distributions, and response functions explicitly defined. The objective is clear and falsifiable: to verify the correctness of a numerical implementation against analytical results. The underlying mathematical assumptions, such as the exactness of a degree-$2$ gPC expansion for a quadratic response and the sufficiency of $3$-point Gaussian quadrature, are correct.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we define the necessary orthonormal polynomial bases for the standard normal and uniform distributions. Second, we derive the analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the quadratic response functions. Third, we express the response function in the gPC basis to find the theoretical coefficients and the corresponding mean and variance. The results are shown to be identical to the analytical ones. Fourth, we describe the numerical procedure for extracting the gPC coefficients using orthonormal projection, evaluated via exact numerical quadrature. Finally, we implement this procedure for each test case and verify that the numerically obtained mean and variance match the analytical values within the specified tolerance.\n\nThe gPC expansion of a response function $f(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ with random inputs $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is given by\n$$f(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^d} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}} \\Psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$$\nwhere $\\{\\Psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\}$ is a basis of polynomials orthonormal with respect to the probability measure of $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, and $c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ are the gPC coefficients.

This advanced practice investigates a common and subtle pitfall in applying PCE: the orthogonality weight mismatch. You will empirically demonstrate the systematic bias that arises when using a standard polynomial basis (e.g., Legendre polynomials) with a regression-based approach on data that does not follow the corresponding canonical distribution (e.g., uniform). This exercise highlights the critical importance of the 'orthogonality' in Polynomial Chaos and provides insight into the behavior of non-intrusive PCE methods in real-world scenarios.",

            "problem": "You will write a complete program to empirically demonstrate how an orthogonality weight mismatch affects the coefficients of a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). Consider the Legendre polynomial basis, which is orthogonal on the interval $[-1,1]$ with respect to the uniform weight. You will compare two coefficient vectors for a truncated expansion of order $p$: one obtained by orthogonal projection under the uniform weight and one obtained by unweighted least squares regression using samples drawn from a non-uniform input distribution.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- The Legendre polynomials $\\{P_n(x)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ are orthogonal on $[-1,1]$ with respect to the inner product $\\langle f,g\\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) g(x)\\,dx$, that is,\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} P_m(x)\\,P_n(x)\\,dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1}\\,\\delta_{mn}.$$\n- A truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) of order $p$ approximates a scalar response $y(x)$ as\n$$y(x)\\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{p} c_n\\,P_n(x),$$\nwhere the coefficients $\\{c_n\\}_{n=0}^{p}$ are determined by an appropriate optimality criterion.\n\nThe task is to quantify the systematic coefficient bias introduced when the data are generated from a non-uniform input distribution but the Legendre basis (appropriate for the uniform weight) is still used with unweighted least squares. The program must implement the following steps for each test case:\n1. Define the function $y(x)$ as specified by the test case.\n2. Compute the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star} = (c_0^{\\star},\\ldots,c_p^{\\star})$ corresponding to the orthogonal projection of $y(x)$ onto $\\{P_n(x)\\}_{n=0}^{p}$ under the uniform weight on $[-1,1]$. To do this, approximate the required integrals numerically using Gaussian–Legendre quadrature with at least $M=500$ nodes over $[-1,1]$.\n3. Independently, generate $N$ independent and identically distributed samples from a Beta distribution on $[0,1]$ with shape parameters $(a,b)$, then transform them to $[-1,1]$ via $X = 2U - 1$. Use these inputs to compute output samples $Y = y(X)$, form the design matrix with columns $P_n(X)$ for $n=0,\\ldots,p$, and compute the unweighted least squares estimate $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ solving the normal equations implicitly via a numerically stable solver. Use a fixed random seed $s=12345$ for reproducibility.\n4. Report the scalar bias magnitude defined as the Euclidean norm\n$$\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}\\|_2 = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{p} \\left(\\widehat{c}_n - c_n^{\\star}\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}.$$\n\nImplement the following test suite of parameter values to cover different facets:\n- Case $1$ (happy path, pronounced mismatch): $y(x)=\\exp(x)$, $p=3$, $N=400$, $(a,b)=(2,5)$.\n- Case $2$ (no mismatch in distribution): $y(x)=\\exp(x)$, $p=3$, $N=400$, $(a,b)=(1,1)$ (uniform on $[-1,1]$ after transformation).\n- Case $3$ (different nonlinearity and mismatch): $y(x)=\\sin(x)$ with $x$ in radians, $p=5$, $N=800$, $(a,b)=(5,2)$.\n- Case $4$ (model well-specified within span): $y(x)=1 + 0.2\\,x + 0.3\\,x^2$, $p=5$, $N=200$, $(a,b)=(2,5)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the bias magnitudes for the four cases as a comma-separated list of floats rounded to six decimal places, enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as above, for example\n$[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3,\\text{result}_4]$.\nNo user input is required.

            "solution": "The problem requires an empirical investigation into the bias of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) coefficients that arises when the sampling distribution of the input data does not match the orthogonality weight function of the chosen polynomial basis. We will compare coefficients derived from two distinct methods: a theoretically optimal orthogonal projection and a data-driven least squares regression.\n\nThe basis functions are the Legendre polynomials $\\{P_n(x)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$, which are orthogonal on the interval $[-1, 1]$ with respect to the uniform weight function, $w(x) = 1$. The orthogonality condition is given by:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_m(x) P_n(x) \\,dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1}\\delta_{mn}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nA function $y(x)$ can be approximated by a truncated PCE of order $p$:\n$$\ny(x) \\approx y_p(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{p} c_n P_n(x)\n$$\n\nWe will compute two sets of coefficients for this expansion, $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$.\n\n**1. Orthogonal Projection Coefficients ($\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}$)**\n\nThe coefficients $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star} = (c_0^{\\star}, \\dots, c_p^{\\star})$ are determined by projecting the function $y(x)$ onto the basis $\\{P_n(x)\\}_{n=0}^{p}$ in the function space $L^2([-1,1])$. The coefficients that minimize the weighted squared error $\\int_{-1}^{1} [y(x) - y_p(x)]^2 w(x) \\,dx$ with $w(x)=1$ are given by the orthogonal projection formula:\n$$\nc_n^{\\star} = \\frac{\\langle y, P_n \\rangle}{\\langle P_n, P_n \\rangle} = \\frac{\\int_{-1}^{1} y(x) P_n(x) \\,dx}{\\int_{-1}^{1} P_n(x)^2 \\,dx}\n$$\nSubstituting the known value of the inner product $\\langle P_n, P_n \\rangle = \\frac{2}{2n+1}$, we obtain the precise formula for each coefficient:\n$$\nc_n^{\\star} = \\frac{2n+1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} y(x) P_n(x) \\,dx\n$$\nTo compute these coefficients, we must numerically approximate the integral. The problem specifies using Gaussian-Legendre quadrature with $M \\geq 500$ nodes. Let $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^M$ be the quadrature nodes and $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^M$ be the corresponding weights on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The integral is then approximated as a weighted sum:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \\,dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i f(x_i)\n$$\nApplying this to our coefficient formula, we get the numerical estimate:\n$$\nc_n^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{2n+1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i y(x_i) P_n(x_i)\n$$\nThese coefficients serve as the \"true\" or ideal coefficients for a PCE based on Legendre polynomials.\n\n**2. Least Squares Regression Coefficients ($\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$)**\n\nThe second set of coefficients, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} = (\\widehat{c}_0, \\dots, \\widehat{c}_p)$, is estimated from a finite set of $N$ input-output samples, $\\{(X_j, Y_j)\\}_{j=1}^N$. The input samples $X_j$ are not drawn from a uniform distribution on $[-1, 1]$. Instead, they are generated by drawing $U_j$ from a Beta distribution with parameters $(a,b)$ on $[0,1]$ and then applying an affine transformation $X_j = 2U_j - 1$. The output samples are $Y_j = y(X_j)$.\n\nThe coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ are found by solving an unweighted linear least squares problem. We seek to minimize the sum of squared residuals:\n$$\n\\min_{\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( Y_j - \\sum_{n=0}^{p} \\widehat{c}_n P_n(X_j) \\right)^2\n$$\nThis can be expressed in matrix form as minimizing $\\|\\boldsymbol{Y} - \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}\\|_2^2$, where:\n- $\\boldsymbol{Y} = [Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_N]^T$ is the vector of output samples.\n- $\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}$ is the $N \\times (p+1)$ design matrix with entries $\\Psi_{jn} = P_n(X_j)$.\n- $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} = [\\widehat{c}_0, \\widehat{c}_1, \\dots, \\widehat{c}_p]^T$ is the vector of coefficients to be determined.\n\nThe solution is found by solving the normal equations, $(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}) \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^T \\boldsymbol{Y}$. For numerical stability, this is best solved using methods based on QR decomposition or singular value decomposition, as implemented in standard numerical libraries.\n\n**3. The Source of Bias**\n\nThe least squares estimate $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ converges to the coefficients that are optimal with respect to the actual sampling distribution of $X$. If the probability density function of $X$ is $f_X(x)$, the least squares procedure is a discrete approximation of minimizing the error in a weighted $L^2$-norm with weight $f_X(x)$.\n\nA systematic bias $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}$ arises precisely because the weight function of the sampling distribution, $f_X(x)$, does not match the weight function for which the Legendre basis is orthogonal, $w(x) = 1$. The only exception is Case $2$, where the Beta distribution parameters are $(a,b)=(1,1)$, which corresponds to a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. After transformation, this yields a uniform distribution on $[-1,1]$, so $f_X(x) \\propto w(x)$, and the bias is expected to be minimal, attributable only to finite sample variance. For other cases where $(a,b) \\neq (1,1)$, a non-uniform sampling density $f_X(x)$ is produced, leading to a demonstrable systematic bias.\n\nThe magnitude of this bias is quantified by the Euclidean norm of the difference vector:\n$$\n\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{n=0}^{p} (\\widehat{c}_n - c_n^{\\star})^2}\n$$\n\n**Algorithm Summary**\nThe program will execute the following steps for each of the four test cases:\n1.  Define the target function $y(x)$ and parameters $p, N, a, b$.\n2.  Compute the vector $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}$ by applying the Gaussian-Legendre quadrature formula with $M=500$ nodes.\n3.  Set the random seed to $s=12345$ for reproducibility.\n4.  Generate $N$ samples from the Beta$(a,b)$ distribution, transform them to the interval $[-1,1]$, and evaluate $y(x)$ to get the sample pairs.\n5.  Construct the design matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}$ using the generated input samples and evaluations of Legendre polynomials up to order $p$.\n6.  Solve the linear least squares problem $\\boldsymbol{Y} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ to find the coefficient vector $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}}$.\n7.  Calculate the Euclidean norm $\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{c}} - \\boldsymbol{c}^{\\star}\\|_2$.\n8.  Collect the results and format the output as specified.",
