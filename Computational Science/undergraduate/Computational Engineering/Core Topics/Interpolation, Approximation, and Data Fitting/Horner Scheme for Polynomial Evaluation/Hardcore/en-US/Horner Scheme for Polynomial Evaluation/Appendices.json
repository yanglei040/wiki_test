Any algorithm that computes a polynomial, starting with the set of initial values $\\{1, x\\}$, constructs expressions of progressively higher degree. A single multiplication operation between two polynomials of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ can produce a polynomial of at most degree $d_1 + d_2$. The maximum possible degree of a polynomial that can be computed using $k$ multiplications is $2^k$. This is achieved by a sequence of squarings starting from $x$: $x \\rightarrow x^2 \\rightarrow x^4 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow x^{2^k}$.\n\nThe degree of the given polynomial $p(x)$ is $d=2048$.
