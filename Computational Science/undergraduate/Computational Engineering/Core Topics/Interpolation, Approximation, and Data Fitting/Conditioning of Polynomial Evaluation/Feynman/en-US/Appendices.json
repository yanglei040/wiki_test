            "problem": "You are asked to analyze the conditioning of polynomial evaluation with respect to perturbations in the polynomial’s coefficients, a situation frequently arising in computational engineering when coefficients come from measurement or modeling uncertainties. Let the data be the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k}$, and let the evaluation point $x$ be exact. Consider small, componentwise relative perturbations to the coefficients of the form $\\tilde{a}_{k} = a_{k} (1 + \\delta_{k})$ with $|\\delta_{k}| \\ll 1$, and let $\\tilde{p}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\tilde{a}_{k} x^{k}$ denote the perturbed value at the same $x$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of forward error and condition number, and using first-order (linearized) perturbation analysis, derive an expression for the coefficientwise relative condition number of the evaluation map $a \\mapsto p(x)$ at a fixed $x$. Use this expression to design a concrete polynomial $p(x)$ such that evaluation is well-conditioned at $x = 0$ but catastrophically ill-conditioned at $x = 1$ under these coefficientwise relative perturbations. Your design must be justified from first principles and should use the smallest possible degree that satisfies the stated properties.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a condition number for polynomial evaluation and the design of a specific polynomial based on this analysis. The process must be validated and executed with scientific rigor.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I shall validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  A polynomial $p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k}$.\n2.  The data are the coefficients $a = (a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$.\n3.  The evaluation point $x$ is exact.\n4.  Perturbations are componentwise relative on the coefficients: $\\tilde{a}_{k} = a_{k} (1 + \\delta_{k})$ with $|\\delta_{k}| \\ll 1$.\n5.  The perturbed polynomial is $\\tilde{p}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\tilde{a}_{k} x^{k}$.\n6.  The objective is twofold:\n    a. Derive the coefficientwise relative condition number for the map $a \\mapsto p(x)$.\n    b. Design a polynomial $p(x)$ of smallest possible degree that is well-conditioned at $x = 0$ and catastrophically ill-conditioned at $x = 1$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the standard theory of numerical analysis and perturbation theory. It is well-posed, with clear objectives and formalizable definitions. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims. The problem is valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Condition Number**\n\nThe evaluation of the polynomial $p(x)$ at a fixed point $x$ can be viewed as a function $f$ that maps the vector of coefficients $a = (a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n)^T$ to a scalar value $y = p(x)$.\nThe problem states that the coefficients $a_k$ are perturbed to $\\tilde{a}_k = a_k(1+\\delta_k)$, where $\\delta_k$ are small relative changes. This constitutes a backward error. The resulting change in the output, $\\tilde{p}(x) - p(x)$, leads to the forward error.\n\nThe absolute forward error is $\\Delta p(x) = \\tilde{p}(x) - p(x)$.\n$$ \\Delta p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\tilde{a}_{k} x^{k} - \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (\\tilde{a}_{k} - a_{k}) x^{k} $$\nSubstituting the perturbation model $\\tilde{a}_{k} = a_{k}(1 + \\delta_{k})$, we get $\\tilde{a}_{k} - a_{k} = a_{k} \\delta_{k}$.\n$$ \\Delta p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} \\delta_{k} x^{k} $$\nThis is an exact expression for the change in $p(x)$. Since we are performing a first-order analysis, higher-order terms in $\\delta_k$ are ignored, but here no such terms appear, so the expression is exact.\n\nThe relative forward error is $\\frac{|\\Delta p(x)|}{|p(x)|}$. The size of the input perturbation (the backward error) is defined componentwise. A natural measure for its magnitude is $\\epsilon = \\max_{k} |\\delta_k|$.\n\nThe condition number $\\kappa$ is defined as the maximum ratio of the relative forward error to the relative backward error, in the limit of infinitesimal perturbations:\n$$ \\kappa = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\sup_{\\max_k|\\delta_k| \\le \\epsilon} \\frac{ \\frac{|\\Delta p(x)|}{|p(x)|} }{ \\epsilon } $$\nLet us find the supremum of $|\\Delta p(x)|$ for a given $\\epsilon$. Using the triangle inequality:\n$$ |\\Delta p(x)| = \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} \\delta_{k} x^{k} \\right| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |\\delta_{k}| |x|^{k} $$\nSince $|\\delta_k| \\le \\epsilon$ for all $k$, we can write:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |\\delta_{k}| |x|^{k} \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| \\epsilon |x|^{k} = \\epsilon \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |x|^{k} $$\nThis upper bound is attainable. We can choose $\\delta_k = \\epsilon \\cdot \\text{sign}(a_k x^k)$, which satisfies $|\\delta_k| \\le \\epsilon$. With this choice, all terms in the sum $\\sum a_k \\delta_k x^k$ become non-negative, and the inequality becomes an equality.\nTherefore, the supremum is:\n$$ \\sup_{\\max_k|\\delta_k| \\le \\epsilon} |\\Delta p(x)| = \\epsilon \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |x|^{k} $$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the condition number:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{1}{|p(x)|} \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{\\epsilon \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |x|^{k}}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |x|^{k}}{|p(x)|} $$\nRecognizing that $p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^k$, we arrive at the final expression for the coefficientwise relative condition number:\n$$ \\kappa(x) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |x|^{k}}{\\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k} \\right|} $$\n\n**Part 2: Design of the Polynomial**\n\nWe must design a polynomial $p(x)$ of minimal degree such that its evaluation is well-conditioned at $x=0$ and catastrophically ill-conditioned at $x=1$. A condition number $\\kappa \\approx 1$ signifies a well-conditioned problem, while $\\kappa \\to \\infty$ signifies an ill-conditioned one.\n\n**Condition at $x=0$:**\nFor $x=0$, the condition number is (using the convention $0^0=1$):\n$$ \\kappa(0) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |0|^{k}}{\\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} 0^{k} \\right|} = \\frac{|a_{0}|}{|a_{0}|} $$\nFor $\\kappa(0)$ to be defined and equal to $1$, we must have $a_0 \\neq 0$. With this simple constraint, evaluation at $x=0$ is always optimally well-conditioned.\n\n**Condition at $x=1$:**\nFor $x=1$, the condition number is:\n$$ \\kappa(1) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}| |1|^{k}}{\\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} 1^{k} \\right|} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_{k}|}{\\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} \\right|} $$\nTo make this problem catastrophically ill-conditioned, we need $\\kappa(1)$ to be extremely large, ideally infinite. This occurs when the denominator is zero while the numerator is non-zero. The denominator is the absolute value of the sum of the coefficients, whereas the numerator is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. Ill-conditioning arises from subtractive cancellation, where $\\sum a_k$ is close to zero but some individual $|a_k|$ are large.\n\nWe seek the polynomial of the smallest degree that satisfies these properties.\n- **Degree $n=0$**: $p(x) = a_0$. We must have $a_0 \\neq 0$.\n  Then $\\kappa(1) = \\frac{|a_0|}{|a_0|} = 1$. The problem is well-conditioned. This degree is not sufficient.\n\n- **Degree $n=1$**: $p(x) = a_1 x + a_0$.\n  For well-conditioning at $x=0$, we require $a_0 \\neq 0$.\n  For catastrophic ill-conditioning at $x=1$, we require the denominator of $\\kappa(1)$ to be zero:\n  $$ \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{1} a_k \\right| = |a_1 + a_0| = 0 \\implies a_1 = -a_0 $$\n  The numerator of $\\kappa(1)$ is $\\sum_{k=0}^{1} |a_k| = |a_1| + |a_0| = |-a_0| + |a_0| = 2|a_0|$. Since $a_0 \\neq 0$, the numerator is strictly positive.\n  With $a_1 = -a_0$ and $a_0 \\neq 0$, the condition number $\\kappa(1)$ becomes infinite.\n  We can choose the simplest non-zero value for $a_0$. Let $a_0 = 1$. This implies $a_1 = -1$.\n  The resulting polynomial is:\n  $$ p(x) = (-1)x + 1 = 1 - x $$\nThis is a polynomial of degree $1$, which is the minimum possible, as shown above.\nLet us verify the properties for $p(x) = 1-x$:\n- The coefficients are $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = -1$.\n- At $x=0$: $p(0) = 1$. The condition number is $\\kappa(0) = \\frac{|a_1|\\cdot|0| + |a_0|}{|p(0)|} = \\frac{|1|}{|1|} = 1$. This is well-conditioned.\n- At $x=1$: $p(1) = 1-1 = 0$. The condition number is $\\kappa(1) = \\frac{|a_1| + |a_0|}{|p(1)|} = \\frac{|-1| + |1|}{|0|} = \\frac{2}{0}$, which is infinite. This is catastrophically ill-conditioned.\n\nThe polynomial $p(x) = 1-x$ satisfies all requirements of the problem. It is of minimal degree and is presented in expanded standard form.",

            "solution": "The relative condition number, $\\kappa_f(x)$, for the evaluation of a differentiable function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ with respect to perturbations in $x$ is defined from first principles as the magnitude of the ratio of the relative error in the output to the relative error in the input for an infinitesimal perturbation. The formal expression is:\n$$ \\kappa_f(x) = \\left| \\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)} \\right| $$\nThe problem concerns a real polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $n=37$. Let the roots of this polynomial be the set $\\{r_k\\}_{k=1}^{37}$, which are all real and lie in the interval $[0,1]$. The polynomial can be represented in its factored form using these roots:\n$$ p(x) = c \\prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - r_k) $$\nwhere $c$ is an arbitrary non-zero real constant representing the leading coefficient, and the degree is $n=37$.\n\nTo find the derivative $p'(x)$ required for the condition number, we employ logarithmic differentiation, which is a standard property derived from the rules of calculus. For any $x$ that is not a root of $p(x)$, we take the natural logarithm of the absolute value of $p(x)$:\n$$ \\ln|p(x)| = \\ln\\left|c \\prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - r_k)\\right| = \\ln|c| + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\ln|x - r_k| $$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to $x$ yields the ratio $\\frac{p'(x)}{p(x)}$:\n$$ \\frac{p'(x)}{p(x)} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\ln|c| + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\ln|x - r_k| \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{x - r_k} $$\nThis expression for the logarithmic derivative of a polynomial is independent of the leading coefficient $c$.\n\nBy substituting this result into the fundamental definition of the relative condition number, we obtain the specific expression for the polynomial $p(x)$:\n$$ \\kappa_p(x) = \\left| x \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{x - r_k} \\right| $$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nWe are tasked with evaluating this condition number at the point $x^{\\ast} = 150$. The degree is $n=37$, and all roots $r_k$ are constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. At $x^{\\ast}=150$, the condition number is:\n$$ \\kappa_p(x^{\\ast}) = \\left| 150 \\sum_{k=1}^{37} \\frac{1}{150 - r_k} \\right| $$\nThe problem specifies that $r_k \\in [0, 1]$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 37\\}$. Thus, for any root $r_k$, the term $150 - r_k$ is strictly positive, with values in the range $[149, 150]$. Consequently, each term $\\frac{1}{150 - r_k}$ in the sum is positive. The sum itself must be positive. Since the multiplier $x^{\\ast}=150$ is also positive, the entire expression within the absolute value signs is positive. We can therefore remove the absolute value:\n$$ \\kappa_p(x^{\\ast}) = 150 \\sum_{k=1}^{37} \\frac{1}{150 - r_k} $$\nTo find the maximal possible value of $\\kappa_p(x^{\\ast})$, we must maximize this expression over all valid choices of the roots $\\{r_k\\}_{k=1}^{37}$. This is equivalent to maximizing the sum:\n$$ S = \\sum_{k=1}^{37} \\frac{1}{150 - r_k} $$\nLet us analyze the behavior of an individual term of this sum, defined by the function $g(r) = \\frac{1}{150 - r}$, for $r \\in [0, 1]$. To determine the monotonicity of $g(r)$, we calculate its first derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$ g'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} (150 - r)^{-1} = (-1)(150 - r)^{-2}(-1) = \\frac{1}{(150 - r)^2} $$\nSince the square of any non-zero real number is positive, $g'(r) > 0$ for all $r$ in the domain, including the interval $[0, 1]$. This shows that $g(r)$ is a strictly increasing function on its domain.\n\nThe sum $S$ is a sum of $37$ independent terms, $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{37} g(r_k)$. To maximize $S$, we must maximize each term $g(r_k)$ individually. Because $g(r)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $[0, 1]$, its maximum value is attained at the right endpoint of the interval, which is $r=1$.\nTherefore, the sum $S$ is maximized when all roots are chosen to be as large as possible, i.e., $r_k = 1$ for all $k=1, \\dots, 37$. This corresponds to a polynomial of the form $p(x) = c(x-1)^{37}$.\n\nSubstituting $r_k = 1$ for all $k$ into the expression for the sum gives the maximum value, $S_{\\max}$:\n$$ S_{\\max} = \\sum_{k=1}^{37} \\frac{1}{150 - 1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{37} \\frac{1}{149} = 37 \\times \\frac{1}{149} = \\frac{37}{149} $$\nFinally, the maximal possible value of the relative condition number at $x^{\\ast}=150$ is obtained by substituting $S_{\\max}$ back into the expression for $\\kappa_p(x^{\\ast})$:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\max} = 150 \\times S_{\\max} = 150 \\times \\frac{37}{149} = \\frac{5550}{149} $$\nThis fraction is irreducible, as $149$ is a prime number and it does not divide $5550$.

Its norm is\n$$\\|\\phi_{\\text{monomial}}(x^{\\ast})\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{1^{2} + (11.5)^{2} + (132.25)^{2} + (1520.875)^{2}}$$\n$$\\|\\phi_{\\text{monomial}}(x^{\\ast})\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{1 + 132.25 + 17490.0625 + 2313063.4765625} = \\sqrt{2330686.7890625}.$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\sqrt{1603950} \\cdot \\sqrt{2330686.7890625}}{2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3.953125}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1603950 \\cdot 2330686.7890625}{3.953125}}$$\n$$R \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{3.7383907 \\times 10^{12}}{3.953125}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{9.456813 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (972461.49)$$\n$$R \\approx 486230.745.$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $4.862 \\times 10^{5}$.",
