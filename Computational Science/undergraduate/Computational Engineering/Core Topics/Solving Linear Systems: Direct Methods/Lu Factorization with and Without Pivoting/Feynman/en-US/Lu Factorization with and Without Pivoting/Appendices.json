            "introduction": "While powerful, the basic LU factorization algorithm has a critical weakness that pivoting is designed to solve. This problem explores a specific scenario where the naive algorithm fails, not because the matrix is singular, but due to a zero in a pivot position.

Then, using only fundamental properties of determinants and elimination, determine the exact value of $\\det(A)$. Express your final answer in exact form with no rounding.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two things: first, an explanation for the failure of a naive Lower-Upper ($LU$) decomposition for the given matrix $A$, and second, the calculation of the determinant of $A$ using fundamental principles.\n\nThe matrix in question is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Failure of Naive LU Decomposition without Pivoting**\n\nThe $LU$ decomposition of a matrix $A$ is the process of finding a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$ such that $A = LU$. Typically, $L$ is constrained to be unit lower triangular, meaning its diagonal elements are all $1$. The matrix $U$ is found through the process of Gaussian elimination, and the matrix $L$ stores the multipliers used to create zeros in the lower part of $A$.\n\nThe Gaussian elimination algorithm proceeds by using the diagonal elements, called pivots, to eliminate the non-zero entries below them in each column. Let us attempt this for matrix $A$.\n\nThe first step is to use the pivot element $a_{11}$ to eliminate the elements $a_{21}$ and $a_{31}$. The standard row operations are:\n$R_2 \\rightarrow R_2 - l_{21} R_1$\n$R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 - l_{31} R_1$\nwhere the multipliers are $l_{21} = \\frac{a_{21}}{a_{11}}$ and $l_{31} = \\frac{a_{31}}{a_{11}}$.\n\nIn our matrix $A$, the first pivot element is $a_{11} = 0$. The calculation of the first multiplier, $l_{21}$, requires the operation:\n$$\nl_{21} = \\frac{a_{21}}{a_{11}} = \\frac{1}{0}\n$$\nThis operation constitutes division by zero, which is an undefined mathematical operation. Consequently, the standard Gaussian elimination algorithm cannot proceed past the first step. Since the naive $LU$ factorization algorithm is a direct implementation of this elimination process, it fails at the outset. This failure occurs precisely because the pivot element is zero. A remedy for this issue in practice is pivoting, which involves row interchanges to place a non-zero element in the pivot position. The problem specifies a \"naive\" factorization, which by definition excludes such pivoting strategies.\n\nThus, even though the system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ is well-posed (which we will confirm by showing $\\det(A) \\neq 0$), the naive computational algorithm for $LU$ decomposition fails due to the presence of a zero on the diagonal in a pivot position.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $\\det(A)$ using Fundamental Properties**\n\nThe problem requires a determination of $\\det(A)$ using the properties of determinants under elementary row operations. The key properties are:\n1.  Swapping two rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by $-1$.\n2.  Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant.\n3.  The determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.\n\nWe will transform $A$ into an upper triangular form, keeping track of how the determinant changes.\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAs established, the pivot $a_{11} = 0$ is problematic. We perform a row swap, for instance $R_1 \\leftrightarrow R_2$. According to property $1$, this introduces a factor of $-1$.\n$$\n\\det(A) = - \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe new pivot is $1$, which is non-zero. The element $a_{21}$ is already $0$. We proceed to eliminate $a_{31} = 1$ by performing the row operation $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 - R_1$. According to property $2$, this operation does not change the determinant.\n$$\n\\det(A) = - \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1-1 & 1-0 & 0-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= - \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we use the second pivot, $a_{22} = 1$, to eliminate the element $a_{32} = 1$. We perform the row operation $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 - R_2$. Again, this does not alter the determinant.\n$$\n\\det(A) = - \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0-0 & 1-1 & -1-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= - \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting matrix is an upper triangular matrix, let us call it $U$. According to property $3$, its determinant is the product of its diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\det(U) = (1)(1)(-2) = -2\n$$\nTherefore, the determinant of the original matrix $A$ is:\n$$\n\\det(A) = - \\det(U) = -(-2) = 2\n$$\nSince $\\det(A) = 2 \\neq 0$, the matrix $A$ is invertible, and the linear system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for any vector $\\mathbf{b}$. This confirms the problem's own assertion that the underlying system is well-posed, despite the failure of the naive factorization algorithm.",

            "solution": "**Derivation of the Algorithm**\nThe objective is to solve the linear system $A^{\\top} x = b$ for the unknown vector $x$. The starting point is the given factorization $P A = L U$.\n\nFirst, we must express $A^{\\top}$ in terms of the given factors $P$, $L$, and $U$. From the initial equation, we isolate $A$:\n$$ P A = L U $$\nSince $P$ is a permutation matrix, its inverse is equal to its transpose, $P^{-1} = P^{\\top}$. Left-multiplying by $P^{\\top}$ yields:\n$$ P^{\\top} P A = P^{\\top} L U $$\n$$ I A = P^{\\top} L U $$\n$$ A = P^{\\top} L U $$\nNow, we take the transpose of this expression for $A$. Using the property $(XYZ)^{\\top} = Z^{\\top}Y^{\\top}X^{\\top}$, we obtain:\n$$ A^{\\top} = (P^{\\top} L U)^{\\top} = U^{\\top} L^{\\top} (P^{\\top})^{\\top} $$\nSince $(P^{\\top})^{\\top} = P$, the expression for $A^{\\top}$ simplifies to:\n$$ A^{\\top} = U^{\\top} L^{\\top} P $$\nSubstitute this into the system $A^{\\top} x = b$:\n$$ (U^{\\top} L^{\\top} P) x = b $$\nTo solve this system for $x$, we proceed by introducing intermediate vectors. This avoids matrix-matrix multiplications and allows us to solve a sequence of simpler systems. Let us define a vector $y$ as:\n$$ y = P x $$\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ U^{\\top} L^{\\top} y = b $$\nNext, let us define a vector $z$ as:\n$$ z = L^{\\top} y $$\nSubstituting this gives:\n$$ U^{\\top} z = b $$\nThis sequence of substitutions defines a three-step algorithm for finding $x$:\n\n1.  **Solve for $z$**: Solve the system $U^{\\top} z = b$. Since $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix, its transpose $U^{\\top}$ is a lower-triangular matrix. This system is therefore solved efficiently using **forward substitution**.\n2.  **Solve for $y$**: Solve the system $L^{\\top} y = z$. Since $L$ is a unit lower-triangular matrix, its transpose $L^{\\top}$ is a unit upper-triangular matrix. This system is solved efficiently using **backward substitution**.\n3.  **Solve for $x$**: From the definition $y = P x$, we find $x$ by applying the inverse of $P$: $x = P^{-1} y$. Using the property $P^{-1} = P^{\\top}$, we get $x = P^{\\top} y$.
