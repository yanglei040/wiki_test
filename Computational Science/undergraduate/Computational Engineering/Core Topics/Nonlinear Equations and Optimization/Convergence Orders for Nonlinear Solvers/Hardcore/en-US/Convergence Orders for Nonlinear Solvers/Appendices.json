As the $e_k^2$ term is shown to vanish for any function $f$ (with $f'(\\alpha)\\neq 0$) and any $\\beta$, the order is at least $3$.\nThus, the order of convergence of the method for an arbitrary real parameter $\\beta$ is $3$.",

The notation $u^{\\circ 2}$ signifies the componentwise square.\n-   **Jacobian Matrix**: The Jacobian of $F$ at a vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is $J(w) \\equiv I - \\Delta t \\left(L + 2\\,\\mathrm{diag}(w)\\right)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n-   **Iterative Solver**: A \"frozen\" Jacobian Newton method where the Jacobian is fixed at $J(w_{\\mathrm{freeze}})$ with $w_{\\mathrm{freeze}} = u^n$. The initial guess for the iterations is $u^{(0)} = u^n$. The iterative update is $u^{(k+1)} = u^{(k)} + s^{(k)}$, where $s^{(k)}$ is the solution to the linear system $J(w_{\\mathrm{freeze}})\\, s^{(k)} = -F\\!\\left(u^{(k)}\\right)$.\n-   **Convergence Order Estimation**: The asymptotic order $p$ is estimated by $\\widehat{p}_k \\equiv \\frac{\\log\\left(\\delta_{k}/\\delta_{k-1}\\right)}{\\log\\left(\\delta_{k-1}/\\delta_{k-2}\\right)}$ for $k \\ge 2$. The step differences are $\\delta_k \\equiv \\lVert u^{(k+1)} - u^{(k)} \\rVert_2 = \\lVert s^{(k)} \\rVert_2$. If fewer than three step differences are available, the result is a Not-a-Number (NaN) indicator.\n-   **Initial Data**: For the single time step under consideration, the state $u^n$ is given by $u^n_i = A \\sin(\\pi x_i)$ at grid points $x_i = i h$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, m$.\n-   **Solver Parameters**: The stopping criterion is $\\lVert s^{(k)} \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$ or a maximum of $k_{\\max}$ iterations.\n-   **Test Cases**:\n    1.  $m = 100$, $\\Delta t = 10^{-3}$, $A = 1.0$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$, $k_{\\max} = 100$.\n    2.  $m = 100$, $\\Delta t = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$, $A = 2.0$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$, $k_{\\max} = 100$.\n    3.  $m = 50$, $\\Delta t = 10^{-3}$, $A = 0.1$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$, $k_{\\max} = 100$.\n\n#### Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the criteria of scientific validity and well-posedness.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem addresses the numerical solution of a reaction-diffusion equation, a fundamental topic in computational science. The chosen numerical methods—finite differences for space, backward Euler for time, and a frozen Jacobian Newton solver for the resulting nonlinear system—are standard and rigorously established in the field of numerical analysis.\n-   **Well-Posedness and Objectivity**: The problem is formulated with mathematical precision. All quantities, operators, and algorithms are explicitly defined. The task is to implement a specified computational procedure and calculate a well-defined metric. The frozen Jacobian Newton method is a form of fixed-point iteration, whose convergence properties are well-understood. It is expected to exhibit linear convergence (order $p=1$), and the problem asks for a numerical estimation of this order. The question is unambiguous and possesses a unique, meaningful procedure for its solution.\n-   **Completeness**: All necessary parameters ($m, \\Delta t, A, \\varepsilon, k_{\\max}$), definitions, and initial conditions are provided for each test case. The problem is self-contained.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, mathematically well-posed, and complete. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires the implementation of a numerical algorithm for a single backward Euler time step. The algorithm is a frozen Jacobian Newton method. For each specified test case, the convergence order of this method is to be estimated.\n\nFirst, the discrete problem is set up. For a given number of interior grid points $m$, the spatial step size is $h = \\frac{1}{m+1}$. The vector of spatial coordinates for the interior points is $x$, with components $x_i = i \\cdot h$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$.\n\nThe discrete Laplacian $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix defined by its non-zero elements:\n$$\nL_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{h^2} \\begin{cases}\n-2 & \\text{if } i=j \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } |i-j|=1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe initial vector for the time step, $u^n \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, is constructed using the given amplitude $A$ and the spatial coordinates:\n$$\nu^n_i = A \\sin(\\pi x_i)\n$$\n\nThe core of the solver is the frozen Jacobian Newton iteration. The Jacobian is evaluated only once, using the state $u^n$ as the freezing point $w_{\\text{freeze}}$. This yields the constant iteration matrix:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{freeze}} = J(u^n) = I - \\Delta t \\left(L + 2\\,\\mathrm{diag}(u^n)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix and $\\mathrm{diag}(u^n)$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the elements of the vector $u^n$.\n\nThe iterative process to find $u^{n+1}$ begins with the initial guess $u^{(0)} = u^n$. In each iteration $k$, one performs the following steps:\n1.  Evaluate the residual function $F$ at the current iterate $u^{(k)}$:\n    $$\n    F(u^{(k)}) = u^{(k)} - \\Delta t (L u^{(k)} + (u^{(k)})^{\\circ 2}) - u^n\n    $$\n2.  Solve the linear system for the Newton update step $s^{(k)}$:\n    $$\n    J_{\\text{freeze}} s^{(k)} = -F(u^{(k)})\n    $$\n3.  Update the solution vector: $u^{(k+1)} = u^{(k)} + s^{(k)}$.\n4.  Compute the Euclidean norm of the update, $\\delta_k = \\lVert s^{(k)} \\rVert_2$, and store it.\nThe process is terminated when either $\\delta_k \\le \\varepsilon$ or $k = k_{\\max}$.\n\nUpon termination of the loop after $N$ iterations (producing step norms $\\delta_0, \\dots, \\delta_{N-1}$), the convergence order is estimated. If $N < 3$, there are insufficient data points to apply the three-point formula, and the result is NaN. Otherwise, the estimate $\\widehat{p}$ is calculated using the final three available step norms:\n$$\n\\widehat{p} = \\frac{\\log(\\delta_{N-1}/\\delta_{N-2})}{\\log(\\delta_{N-2}/\\delta_{N-3})}\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each test case. The expected theoretical convergence order for this method is $p=1$ (linear convergence), so the numerical estimate $\\widehat{p}$ should be close to $1$.\n\nThe implementation will utilize the `numpy` library for all array, vector, and matrix operations, including `np.linalg.solve` for the linear system solution.",
