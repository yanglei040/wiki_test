            "problem": "You are given a city with a finite set of buildings and a finite set of candidate locations where a fire station may be placed. For each candidate location and building, a travel time in minutes is provided. A building is said to be covered by a station if the station’s travel time to that building is less than or equal to a strictly enforced response-time threshold of $5$ minutes. The goal is to decide where to place stations so that every building is covered while using the minimum possible number of stations. All angles are irrelevant to this problem. All time quantities are in minutes and must be treated exactly as given.\n\nFormulate this as a mathematical optimization problem. Let the set of buildings be indexed by $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ and the set of candidate station locations be indexed by $j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$. Let $t_{ij}$ denote the travel time (in minutes) from candidate station $j$ to building $i$. Define a binary coverage parameter\n$$\na_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } t_{ij} \\le 5 \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } t_{ij} > 5\n\\end{cases}.\n$$\nDefine decision variables $x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all $j$, where $x_j = 1$ indicates a station is placed at candidate location $j$, and $x_j = 0$ otherwise. The optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\min \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} x_j\n$$\nsubject to\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} a_{ij} x_j \\ge 1, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\},\n$$\n$$\nx_j \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}.\n$$\n\nImplement a complete, runnable program that, for each test case below, determines:\n- the minimum number of stations needed, and\n- one optimal set of station indices (using $0$-based indices) that achieves this minimum; if multiple optimal sets exist, return the lexicographically smallest sorted index set, where lexicographic order compares sorted index lists as tuples,\n- or determines that no feasible solution exists.\n\nIf no feasible solution exists (that is, at least one building is not within $5$ minutes of any candidate station), your program must output the integer $-1$ for that test case. Otherwise, for a feasible test case, your program must output a list of the form $[k,[j_1,j_2,\\dots,j_k]]$ where $k$ is the minimum number of stations and $[j_1,\\dots,j_k]$ is the strictly increasing list of chosen station indices.\n\nTest suite (each $T^{(c)}$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix; row $j$ and column $i$ give $t_{ij}$ in minutes):\n\n- Test case $1$: $m=n=5$,\n$$\nT^{(1)}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.0 & 5.0 & 6.0 & 6.0 & 6.2 \\\\\n6.1 & 3.5 & 4.0 & 5.0 & 6.5 \\\\\n3.0 & 6.0 & 6.0 & 6.0 & 4.5 \\\\\n7.0 & 6.8 & 2.5 & 3.5 & 5.5 \\\\\n8.0 & 7.5 & 6.2 & 6.1 & 1.5\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Test case $2$: $m=n=3$ (boundary coverage at exactly $5$ minutes),\n$$\nT^{(2)}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\\\\n5.0 & 6.0 & 6.0 \\\\\n6.0 & 5.0 & 6.0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Test case $3$: $m=n=2$ (infeasible),\n$$\nT^{(3)}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.0 & 6.0 \\\\\n6.0 & 6.1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Test case $4$: $m=n=4$ (multiple optimal solutions; lexicographically smallest must be chosen),\n$$\nT^{(4)}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.0 & 6.0 & 5.0 & 6.0 \\\\\n5.0 & 6.0 & 6.0 & 4.0 \\\\\n6.0 & 3.0 & 4.5 & 6.0 \\\\\n6.0 & 4.0 & 6.0 & 3.0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the test cases $1$ through $4$. For each test case, output either $-1$ if infeasible, or a list of the form $[k,[j_1,\\dots,j_k]]$ as defined above. The final printed line must contain no spaces.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a classic integer linear programming formulation of the Set Cover problem, a fundamental topic in computational engineering and operations research. The objective is to find the minimum number of fire stations required to ensure every building in a city is covered, where coverage is defined by a maximum response time.\n\nA validation of the problem statement confirms that it is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It is well-posed, providing a clear objective function, a complete set of constraints, and explicit data for all test cases. The mathematical formulation,\n$$\n\\min \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} x_j\n$$\nsubject to\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} a_{ij} x_j \\ge 1, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\},\n$$\n$$\nx_j \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\},\n$$\nis a standard and correct representation of the Set Cover problem. The symbols are clearly defined: $x_j$ are the binary decision variables for placing a station at candidate location $j$, and $a_{ij}$ is a binary parameter indicating if station $j$ can cover building $i$ within the specified time threshold of $5$ minutes. The problem lacks any scientific fallacies, ambiguities, or contradictions, and is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to select a minimum-size subset of candidate station locations such that every building is covered. In the language of the Set Cover problem, the set of buildings $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ constitutes the universe of elements to be covered. For each candidate station location $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$, we can define a set $S_j$ containing the indices of all buildings that station $j$ can cover. The problem is then to find the smallest sub-collection of these sets $\\{S_j\\}$ whose union covers the entire universe of buildings.\n\nThe Set Cover problem is known to be NP-hard. For large-scale instances, one would typically employ approximation algorithms or sophisticated solvers for integer linear programs. However, given the small dimensions of the provided test cases (e.g., $m, n \\le 5$), a direct, exact solution via an exhaustive search is computationally feasible and guarantees optimality. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we preprocess the input data. For each test case, given the $m \\times n$ travel time matrix $T^{(c)}$ where the entry at row $j$ and column $i$ is $t_{ij}$, we construct an $n \\times m$ binary coverage matrix $A$. The entry $a_{ij}$ of this matrix is $1$ if $t_{ij} \\le 5$, and $0$ otherwise. This matrix directly represents the coverage relationship: $a_{ij}=1$ signifies that station $j$ covers building $i$.\n\nSecond, we perform an infeasibility check. A necessary prerequisite for a feasible solution is that every building must be coverable by at least one candidate station. This is verified by checking that for each building $i$, the corresponding row in the coverage matrix $A$ contains at least one non-zero entry, i.e., $\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} a_{ij} \\ge 1$. If this condition is violated for any building, no combination of stations can cover all buildings, and the problem is declared infeasible.\n\nThird, if the problem is feasible, we search for the optimal solution by iterating on the number of stations, $k$, from $k=1$ up to $m$. For each value of $k$, we generate all unique combinations of $k$ station locations from the $m$ available candidates. The problem requires the lexicographically smallest set of station indices among all optimal solutions. This is naturally handled by generating the combinations of station indices in lexicographical order. The first valid covering set found for the smallest $k$ is, by construction, the required optimal solution.\n\nFinally, for each generated combination of $k$ stations, we verify if it constitutes a valid cover. A combination is a valid cover if, for every building $i$, at least one of the selected $k$ stations covers it. The first combination that satisfies this condition is the solution. The search terminates, and we report the current value of $k$ and the corresponding set of station indices. If the loop completes without finding a solution for any $k \\le m$, it would imply infeasibility, which is already handled by our initial check. Because a feasible problem will always have a solution with $k \\le m$ (in the worst case, using all stations that contribute to covering at least one unique, otherwise uncovered building), the search is guaranteed to find a solution.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a resource allocation problem, which is a classic example of convex optimization. The goal is to maximize a total objective function, which is the sum of individual concave functions, subject to a linear budget constraint and box constraints on the variables.\n\nThe optimization problem is formally stated as:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad & Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i) \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\le B \\\\\n& 0 \\le x_i \\le u_i, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHere, $x_i$ is the spend on channel $i$, $B$ is the total budget, and $u_i$ is the upper bound on spend for channel $i$. The functions $f_i(x_i)$ represent the conversions from channel $i$ for a spend of $x_i$. The problem states that each $f_i$ is concave, increasing, and twice continuously differentiable. The sum of concave functions is also concave. Maximizing a concave function over a convex feasible set (defined by linear inequalities) is a convex optimization problem.\n\nWe can solve this using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The Lagrangian for this problem is:\n$$ L(x, \\lambda, \\mu, \\nu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i) - \\lambda \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - B \\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu_i (x_i - u_i) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\nu_i x_i $$\nwhere $\\lambda, \\mu_i, \\nu_i \\ge 0$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the budget constraint, upper bounds, and non-negativity constraints, respectively.\n\nThe KKT stationarity condition is $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i} = 0$ for each $i$:\n$$ f'_i(x_i) - \\lambda - \\mu_i + \\nu_i = 0 $$\nwhere $f'_i(x_i)$ is the first derivative of $f_i$ with respect to $x_i$, representing the marginal conversion rate.\n\nThe complementary slackness conditions provide the following relationships for the optimal solution:\n1.  If $0 < x_i < u_i$, then $\\nu_i=0$ and $\\mu_i=0$, which implies $f'_i(x_i) = \\lambda$.\n2.  If $x_i = 0$, then $\\nu_i \\ge 0$ and $\\mu_i=0$, which implies $f'_i(0) \\le \\lambda$.\n3.  If $x_i = u_i$, then $\\nu_i = 0$ and $\\mu_i \\ge 0$, which implies $f'_i(u_i) \\ge \\lambda$.\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ can be interpreted as the marginal return (conversions per unit of spend) of the last dollar spent. At optimality, all channels that receive a non-zero spend (and are not at their upper cap) must have the same marginal return $\\lambda$.\n\nThis insight provides a method for finding the optimal allocation $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. For a given value of $\\lambda$, the optimal spend $x_i(\\lambda)$ for each channel is determined. Since $f_i$ is concave, $f'_i$ is a decreasing function. Therefore, its inverse, $(f'_i)^{-1}$, is also a decreasing function. The optimal spend $x_i$ for a given $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ x_i(\\lambda) = \\min(u_i, \\max(0, (f'_i)^{-1}(\\lambda))) $$\n\nThe total spend is a monotonically non-increasing function of $\\lambda$: $X(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(\\lambda)$.\nOur task is to find a $\\lambda^* \\ge 0$ such that the total budget is utilized, i.e., $X(\\lambda^*) = B$, provided the total unconstrained spend would exceed $B$.\n\nThe derivatives $f'_i$ and their inverses $(f'_i)^{-1}$ for the given function families are:\n- **Logarithmic (L):** $f_i(x) = a_i \\log(1 + b_i x)$\n  - $f'_i(x) = \\frac{a_i b_i}{1 + b_i x}$\n  - $(f'_i)^{-1}(\\lambda) = \\frac{a_i}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{b_i}$\n- **Square-root (S):** $f_i(x) = c_i \\sqrt{x}$\n  - $f'_i(x) = \\frac{c_i}{2\\sqrt{x}}$\n  - $(f'_i)^{-1}(\\lambda) = \\left(\\frac{c_i}{2\\lambda}\\right)^2$\n- **Exponential saturation (E):** $f_i(x) = d_i (1 - \\exp(-e_i x))$\n  - $f'_i(x) = d_i e_i \\exp(-e_i x)$\n  - $(f'_i)^{-1}(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{e_i} \\log\\left(\\frac{d_i e_i}{\\lambda}\\right)$\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Handle trivial cases. If $B=0$, all $x_i=0$ and total conversion is $0$.\n2.  Calculate the sum of all finite upper bounds, $U_{total} = \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } u_i<\\infty} u_i$. If the problem has any channel with $u_i = \\infty$, then the total capacity is infinite. If all $u_i$ are finite and $B \\ge U_{total}$, the budget constraint is not binding. The optimal solution is to spend up to the cap on every channel, $x_i = u_i$. The total conversion is $\\sum_i f_i(u_i)$.\n3.  If $0 < B < U_{total}$ (or $U_{total}=\\infty$), the budget constraint is active. We need to find the unique $\\lambda > 0$ that satisfies $\\sum_i x_i(\\lambda) = B$. Since $X(\\lambda)$ is monotonic, we can efficiently find this $\\lambda$ using a numerical root-finding algorithm like the bisection method. We search for a $\\lambda$ in a range, say $[\\lambda_{low}, \\lambda_{high}]$, that solves the equation $g(\\lambda) = X(\\lambda) - B = 0$.\n4.  The bisection search proceeds by repeatedly narrowing the search interval. In each step, we pick the midpoint $\\lambda_{mid}$ of the current interval, calculate the total spend $X(\\lambda_{mid})$, and update either the lower or upper bound of the interval based on whether $X(\\lambda_{mid})$ is greater or less than $B$.\n5.  After a sufficient number of iterations, the interval becomes small enough, and we can take its midpoint as the optimal $\\lambda^*$.\n6.  With the optimal $\\lambda^*$, we compute the final spend allocation $x_i^* = x_i(\\lambda^*)$ for each channel.\n7.  The maximum total conversion is then calculated by summing the conversions from the optimal spends: $Z^* = \\sum_i f_i(x_i^*)$.\n\nA special case is a channel with a zero-valued primary parameter (e.g., $a_i=0$ for type L), which results in $f_i(x) \\equiv 0$ and $f'_i(x) \\equiv 0$.

Unlike the previous problems, the decision to place a turbine at one location directly impacts the performance of others due to aerodynamic wake effects . This exercise demonstrates how to formulate problems with non-linear, interacting components, forcing you to model system-level effects to maximize the total power output of the entire farm.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with formulating and solving a facility placement optimization problem in which wind turbines are placed at candidate sites within a rectangular wind farm to maximize total electrical power output. The wind direction is fixed and aligned with the positive $x$-axis. The wake effect is modeled using a simplified Jensen (also known as Park) wake model: each upwind turbine reduces the wind speed available to downwind turbines if the downwind turbine lies within the expanding conical wake of the upwind turbine.\n\nFormulation requirements:\n- Decision variable: for each candidate site index $n$, define a binary variable $z_n \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether a turbine is installed at that site.\n- Exactly $T$ turbines must be installed: $\\sum_n z_n = T$.\n- A minimum spacing constraint must hold for any selected pair of sites $n \\neq m$: if $z_n = 1$ and $z_m = 1$, then the Euclidean distance between the sites must be at least $s_{\\min}$.\n- Let each candidate site have coordinates $(x_n,y_n)$ in meters. The wind speed is uniform and equal to $V_0$ meters per second at the upwind boundary.\n- Let rotor diameter be $D$ meters, rotor swept area be $A = \\pi (D/2)^2$ square meters, air density be $\\rho$ kilograms per cubic meter, and power coefficient be $C_p$ (dimensionless).\n- Let the axial induction factor be $a$ (dimensionless) and the wake decay constant be $k$ (dimensionless). For two selected turbines $j$ and $i$ with $x_j < x_i$, define the streamwise separation $d_{ji} = x_i - x_j$ and lateral separation $s_{ji} = |y_i - y_j|$. The wake radius at $x_i$ due to turbine $j$ is $r_{ji} = D/2 + k\\, d_{ji}$. Turbine $j$ influences turbine $i$ only if $s_{ji} \\le r_{ji}$, in which case the single-wake velocity deficit contributed by $j$ at $i$ is\n$$\n\\delta_{j\\to i} \\;=\\; \\frac{2a}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2k\\, d_{ji}}{D}\\right)^2}.\n$$\nMultiple wake deficits combine via the root-sum-square superposition.

The power equation is fundamental physics. All models and parameters are physically meaningful and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a combinatorial optimization task. The search space consists of all possible placements of $T$ turbines on $M$ discrete sites. This space is finite. The objective function (total power) is well-defined for any given placement. Therefore, a maximum value is guaranteed to exist. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is specified using precise mathematical equations and unambiguous physical parameters. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary data and models for calculating the objective function are provided for each test case. The constraints are clearly stated. A careful analysis of the minimum spacing constraint reveals it is non-restrictive for test cases $1$ and $3$, as the minimum distance between any two distinct sites is $300$ m, which equals $s_{\\min}$. For test case $2$, the constraint is non-trivial for pairs, but vacuously satisfied since only $T=1$ turbine is placed. This does not represent a contradiction but rather a specific setup for the test cases. The problem is self-contained and consistent.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is one of facility location, a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The goal is to select a subset of $T$ sites from a total of $M$ candidate sites to maximize an objective function, subject to certain constraints. Given the small number of candidate sites ($M=12$ for cases $1$ and $3$, $M=9$ for case $2$) and the small number of turbines to be placed ($T \\in \\{1, 4, 5\\}$), an exhaustive search of all possible valid layouts is a feasible and correct solution strategy.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, generate the set of $M$ candidate site coordinates $(x_n, y_n)$ from the specified grids.\n$2$. Generate all possible combinations of placing $T$ turbines among the $M$ sites. The number of such combinations is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{M}{T}$.\n$3$. For each combination (representing a potential wind farm layout), verify that it satisfies the minimum spacing constraint. A layout is valid if for every pair of selected turbine sites $i$ and $j$, their Euclidean distance $\\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2}$ is greater than or equal to $s_{\\min}$. As noted, for the provided test cases, this constraint does not eliminate any combinations.\n$4$. For each valid layout, calculate the total power output. This is the evaluation of the objective function. This calculation itself involves several steps:\n    a. For each turbine $i$ in the layout, its power output $P_i$ is determined by the effective wind speed $V_i$ at its location.\n    b. To find $V_i$, one must first account for the wake effects from all upwind turbines. A turbine $j$ is upwind of $i$ if $x_j < x_i$.\n    c. For each upwind turbine $j$, we check if turbine $i$ lies within its wake. This is true if the lateral separation $s_{ji} = |y_i - y_j|$ is no more than the wake radius at that downwind distance, $r_{ji} = D/2 + k(x_i - x_j)$.\n    d. If turbine $i$ is in the wake of one or more upwind turbines $j \\in \\mathcal{U}(i)$, the individual velocity deficits $\\delta_{j\\to i} = \\frac{2a}{(1 + 2k(x_i - x_j)/D)^2}$ are computed.\n    e. These deficits are combined using the root-sum-square method to find the total fractional velocity loss: $\\sqrt{\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{U}(i)} \\delta_{j\\to i}^2}$.\n    f. The effective wind speed is then $V_i = V_0 \\max(0, 1 - \\sqrt{\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{U}(i)} \\delta_{j\\to i}^2})$. If there are no upwind turbines affecting $i$, then $V_i = V_0$.\n    g. The power from turbine $i$ is calculated using the standard formula $P_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A C_p V_i^3$, where $A = \\pi(D/2)^2$.\n    h. The total power for the layout is the sum of the power from all turbines: $P_{total} = \\sum_i P_i$.\n$5$. The maximum total power found across all valid layouts is the optimal solution for the test case. This final value is then rounded to the nearest integer, as required.\n\nThis brute-force enumeration guarantees finding the global maximum because it exhaustively checks every single possibility in the finite solution space. The computation is executed for each of the three test cases to find their respective optimal power outputs.",
