Report only the maximal value of $r(x,y)$ as your final answer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The planar profile is an astroid curve defined by the equation $x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}$.\n- The constant $a$ is positive, $a0$.\n- The domain is restricted to the first quadrant, including the axes: $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n- The function to be maximized is the Euclidean distance from the origin, $r(x,y)=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.\n- The task is to find the maximal value of $r(x,y)$ as a function of $a$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is a standard exercise in multivariable calculus, specifically constrained optimization. The astroid curve and Euclidean distance are well-defined mathematical concepts. The problem is free from scientific falsehoods.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to maximize a continuous function, $r(x,y)$, over a compact set (the portion of the astroid in the first quadrant is a closed and bounded curve). The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that a maximum and minimum exist. The problem is structured to find a unique maximum value.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is mathematically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem is to find the maximum value of the function $r(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y) = x^{2/3}+y^{2/3} - a^{2/3} = 0$, with the additional constraints $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\nMaximizing the distance $r(x,y)$ is equivalent to maximizing its square, $f(x,y) = r(x,y)^2 = x^2+y^2$, because the square root function is strictly monotonically increasing for non-negative arguments. This simplifies the differentiation required.\n\nThe constraint defines a compact set in the plane. A robust method for solving this problem is to parametrize the curve. The astroid $x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}$ has a standard parametrization given by:\n$$x(t) = a \\cos^3(t)$$\n$$y(t) = a \\sin^3(t)$$\nThe part of the curve in the first quadrant, where $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, corresponds to the parameter interval $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\n\nWe can now express the function $f(x,y)$ as a function of a single variable $t$:\n$$f(t) = (x(t))^2 + (y(t))^2 = (a \\cos^3(t))^2 + (a \\sin^3(t))^2 = a^2(\\cos^6(t) + \\sin^6(t))$$\nTo find the maximum value of $f(t)$ on the closed interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, we must find the critical points by taking the derivative with respect to $t$ and setting it to zero. We must also evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval, $t=0$ and $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(t)$ is:\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = a^2 \\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos^6(t) + \\sin^6(t)) = a^2 [6\\cos^5(t)(-\\sin(t)) + 6\\sin^5(t)(\\cos(t))]$$\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = 6a^2\\sin(t)\\cos(t)(\\sin^4(t) - \\cos^4(t))$$\nWe can factor the difference of squares:\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = 6a^2\\sin(t)\\cos(t)(\\sin^2(t) - \\cos^2(t))(\\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t))$$\nUsing the identities $\\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t)=1$ and $\\cos^2(t) - \\sin^2(t) = \\cos(2t)$:\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = -6a^2\\sin(t)\\cos(t)\\cos(2t)$$\nUsing the double angle identity $2\\sin(t)\\cos(t) = \\sin(2t)$:\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = -3a^2\\sin(2t)\\cos(2t)$$\nUsing the double angle identity again for $\\sin(4t) = 2\\sin(2t)\\cos(2t)$:\n$$\\frac{df}{dt} = -\\frac{3}{2}a^2\\sin(4t)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find critical points in the open interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$:\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a^2\\sin(4t) = 0 \\implies \\sin(4t) = 0$$\nFor $t \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, the range of $4t$ is $(0, 2\\pi)$. The only solution in this range is $4t = \\pi$, which gives $t = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the function $r(x,y)$ (or its square $f(t)$) at the critical point $t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and at the endpoints $t=0$ and $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $t=0$ (endpoint)\n$x = a \\cos^3(0) = a$\n$y = a \\sin^3(0) = 0$\nThe point is $(a, 0)$. The distance is $r = \\sqrt{a^2 + 0^2} = a$.\n\nCase 2: $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (endpoint)\n$x = a \\cos^3(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$\n$y = a \\sin^3(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = a$\nThe point is $(0, a)$. The distance is $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + a^2} = a$.\n\nCase 3: $t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ (critical point)\n$x = a \\cos^3(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = a \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}$\n$y = a \\sin^3(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = a \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}$\nThe point is $(\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}})$. The squared distance is:\n$f(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2}{8} + \\frac{a^2}{8} = \\frac{2a^2}{8} = \\frac{a^2}{4}$.\nThe distance is $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nComparing the values of $r$ at the candidate points: $a$, $a$, and $\\frac{a}{2}$. Since $a0$, the maximum value is $a$. This maximal distance occurs at the intersection of the astroid with the coordinate axes in the first quadrant, i.e., at points $(a,0)$ and $(0,a)$.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a constrained optimization problem, which is a standard task in computational engineering and operations research. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. I will now proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost function $C(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + \\frac{1}{2}xy$ subject to a set of linear inequality constraints.\nThe constraints are:\n$1.$ Production requirement: $x+y \\ge 10$\n$2.$ Emission cap: $x+2y \\le 14$\n$3.$ Non-negativity of production on line $1$: $x \\ge 0$\n$4.$ Non-negativity of production on line $2$: $y \\ge 0$\n\nFirst, let us characterize the feasible region defined by these inequalities. This region is a convex polygon in the $xy$-plane. The vertices of this polygon are found by the intersection of the boundary lines.\nThe boundary lines are $x+y=10$, $x+2y=14$, $x=0$, and $y=0$.\n- Intersection of $y=0$ and $x+y=10$: This gives the point $(10, 0)$. We verify feasibility: $10+2(0)=10 \\le 14$. This point is feasible. Let us call it $V_1 = (10, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $y=0$ and $x+2y=14$: This gives the point $(14, 0)$. We verify feasibility: $14+0=14 \\ge 10$. This point is feasible. Let us call it $V_2 = (14, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $x+y=10$ and $x+2y=14$: Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $(x+2y)-(x+y) = 14-10$, which simplifies to $y=4$. Substituting $y=4$ into the first equation gives $x+4=10$, so $x=6$. This gives the point $(6, 4)$. We verify feasibility: $x=6 \\ge 0$ and $y=4 \\ge 0$. This point is feasible. Let us call it $V_3 = (6, 4)$.\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices $V_1(10,0)$, $V_2(14,0)$, and $V_3(6,4)$.\n\nThe objective function is $C(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + \\frac{1}{2}xy$. To determine if this function is convex, we examine its Hessian matrix, $H$:\n$$ H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}  \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y \\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe first principal minor is $2  0$. The second principal minor is the determinant, $\\det(H) = (2)(2) - (\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = 4 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{15}{4}  0$. Since the Hessian is positive-definite for all $(x,y)$, the function $C(x,y)$ is strictly convex.\n\nThe minimum of a strictly convex function over a compact convex set (our triangular feasible region) is unique and occurs at a point satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. This point can be in the interior of the region or on its boundary.\n\nLet us rewrite the constraints in the standard form $g_i(x,y) \\le 0$:\n$g_1(x,y) = 10 - x - y \\le 0$\n$g_2(x,y) = x + 2y - 14 \\le 0$\n$g_3(x,y) = -x \\le 0$\n$g_4(x,y) = -y \\le 0$\n\nThe Lagrangian function is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\mu_1, \\mu_2) = x^2 + y^2 + \\frac{1}{2}xy + \\lambda_1(10-x-y) + \\lambda_2(x+2y-14) - \\mu_1 x - \\mu_2 y $$\nwhere $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\mu_1, \\mu_2$ are non-negative Lagrange multipliers.\n\nThe KKT stationarity conditions are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 2x + \\frac{1}{2}y - \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\mu_1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = 2y + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 - \\mu_2 = 0 $$\n\nCase 1: The minimum is in the interior of the feasible region.\nIn this case, all inequality constraints are inactive, so $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = 0$. The stationarity conditions become:\n$2x + \\frac{1}{2}y = 0$\n$2y + \\frac{1}{2}x = 0$\nThe only real solution is $(x,y)=(0,0)$. However, this point is not in the feasible region, as it violates the constraint $x+y \\ge 10$. Thus, the minimum must lie on the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nSince the minimum of a convex function over a convex polygon must occur at one of its vertices if the unconstrained minimum is outside the region, we can evaluate the cost function $C(x,y)$ at each vertex of the feasible region.\n\n- At $V_1(10,0)$:\n$C(10,0) = 10^2 + 0^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(10)(0) = 100$.\n\n- At $V_2(14,0)$:\n$C(14,0) = 14^2 + 0^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(14)(0) = 196$.\n\n- At $V_3(6,4)$:\n$C(6,4) = 6^2 + 4^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(6)(4) = 36 + 16 + 12 = 64$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum cost is $64$, which occurs at the point $(x,y)=(6,4)$.\n\nTo be rigorous, we verify that the point $(6,4)$ satisfies the KKT conditions.\nAt $(x,y)=(6,4)$, the constraints $x+y \\ge 10$ and $x+2y \\le 14$ are active, meaning $g_1(6,4)=0$ and $g_2(6,4)=0$. The non-negativity constraints are inactive, so their corresponding multipliers are zero: $\\mu_1 = 0$ and $\\mu_2 = 0$.\nThe stationarity conditions become:\n$2(6) + \\frac{1}{2}(4) - \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies 14 - \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 = 14$.\n$2(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(6) - \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies 11 - \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 - 2\\lambda_2 = 11$.\n\nWe solve this system for $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. Subtracting the second equation from the first yields:\n$(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2) - (\\lambda_1 - 2\\lambda_2) = 14 - 11 \\implies \\lambda_2 = 3$.\nSubstituting $\\lambda_2=3$ into the first equation: $\\lambda_1 - 3 = 14 \\implies \\lambda_1 = 17$.\n\nWe have found the multipliers $\\lambda_1=17$, $\\lambda_2=3$, $\\mu_1=0$, $\\mu_2=0$.\nAll multipliers are non-negative, satisfying the dual feasibility condition. The primal feasibility and complementary slackness conditions are satisfied by construction.\nSince $(x,y)=(6,4)$ satisfies the KKT conditions for a convex optimization problem, it is the global minimum.\n\nThe minimum achievable total cost is $C_{\\min} = C(6,4) = 64$.",

No point on the circle can satisfy equality of distances while reducing $\\;s\\;$; the nearest point on the circle to $\\;(0,0)\\;$ is $\\;(17,0)\\;$, giving distances $\\;17\\;$ and $\\;7\\;$, so the maximum is minimized there. Thus $\\;(x^\\star,y^\\star)=(17,0)\\;$, i.e., $\\;[17.000000,0.000000]\\;$.\n\n- Test $\\;3$: $\\;(A_x,A_y)=(0,0),\\;(U_x,U_y)=(10,0),\\;(O_x,O_y)=(5,0),\\;L=5\\;$. The perpendicular bisector is $\\;x=5\\;$. Intersection with the circle $\\;(x-5)^2+y^2=25\\;$ yields $\\;(5,5)\\;$ and $\\;(5,-5)\\;$, both equidistant to the endpoints, with equal objective value. The tie-breaking rule selects the smaller $\\;x\\;$ (both equal) and then the smaller $\\;y\\;$, which is $\\;-5\\;$. Hence $\\;[5.000000,-5.000000]\\;$.\n\n- Test $\\;4$: $\\;(A_x,A_y)=(-2,1),\\;(U_x,U_y)=(4,7),\\;(O_x,O_y)=(4,1),\\;L=2\\;$. The perpendicular bisector of the segment between the access point and the user is the line $\\;x+y=5\\;$, which passes through the outlet. Moving from the outlet toward the segment midpoint along this bisector reduces the common distance until the circle boundary is reached. The unit direction from the outlet to the midpoint is proportional to $\\;(-1,1)\\;$, so the optimal point is\n$$\n(x^\\star,y^\\star) \\;=\\; (4,1)\\;+\\;2\\;\\frac{(-1,1)}{\\sqrt{2}} \\;=\\; \\big(4-\\sqrt{2},\\;1+\\sqrt{2}\\big),\n$$\nwhich rounds to $\\;[2.585786,2.414214]\\;$.\n\nThese placements are independent of the path-loss exponent $\\;\\alpha\\;$ because maximizing $\\;\\min\\{\\|R-A\\|^{-\\alpha},\\|R-U\\|^{-\\alpha}\\}\\;$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\;\\max\\{\\|R-A\\|,\\|R-U\\|\\;\\}$ for any fixed $\\;\\alphagt;0\\;$.\n\nThe accompanying program solves the stated convex problem for each test case and applies the tie-breaking rule, returning the coordinates rounded to six decimals in the required output format.",
