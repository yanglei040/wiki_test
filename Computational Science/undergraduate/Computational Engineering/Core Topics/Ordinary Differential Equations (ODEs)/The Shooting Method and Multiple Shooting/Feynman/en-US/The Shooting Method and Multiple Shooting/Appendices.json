            "solution": "**Derivation of the Correct Formulation**\n\n**Part (i): Single Shooting Method**\n\n1.  **First-Order System:**\n    Let $z_1(x) = y(x)$ and $z_2(x) = y'(x)$. Then the derivatives are:\n    $z_1'(x) = y'(x) = z_2(x)$\n    $z_2'(x) = y''(x) = -y(x) + \\sin(x) = -z_1(x) + \\sin(x)$\n    This can be written as a vector-valued initial value problem (IVP):\n    $$z'(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} z_1'(x) \\\\ z_2'(x) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} z_2(x) \\\\ -z_1(x) + \\sin(x) \\end{bmatrix} = f(x, z(x))$$\n    where $f(x,z) = \\begin{bmatrix} z_2 \\\\ -z_1 + \\sin(x) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Initial Conditions and Residual:**\n    The BC at $x=0$ is $y(0)=0$. The value of $y'(0)$ is unknown and is designated as the shooting parameter, $s$. Thus, the initial condition for the IVP is:\n    $$z(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} y(0) \\\\ y'(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    We solve this IVP from $x=0$ to $x=1$. The solution, which depends on $s$, is denoted $z(x;s)$.\n    The shooting method seeks a value of $s$ such that the second BC, $y(1) + (y'(1))^2 = 1$, is satisfied. This BC translates to $z_1(1;s) + (z_2(1;s))^2 = 1$.\n    The scalar residual function $R(s)$ is defined such that its root, $R(s)=0$, satisfies this condition:\n    $$R(s) = z_1(1;s) + (z_2(1;s))^2 - 1$$\n\n3.  **Sensitivity Analysis:**\n    To solve $R(s)=0$ with a Newton-Raphson method, we need the derivative $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$.\n    Let $w(x) = \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial z_1(x;s)/\\partial s \\\\ \\partial z_2(x;s)/\\partial s \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1(x) \\\\ w_2(x) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    Applying the chain rule to $R(s)$:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\frac{\\partial z_1(1;s)}{\\partial s} + 2 z_2(1;s) \\frac{\\partial z_2(1;s)}{\\partial s} = w_1(1) + 2 z_2(1;s) w_2(1)$$\n    The sensitivity vector $w(x)$ is found by differentiating the ODE system $z'(x;s) = f(x, z(x;s))$ with respect to $s$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( z'(x;s) \\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} \\right) = w'(x)$$\n    $$w'(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} f(x, z(x;s)) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}(x, z(x;s)) \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}(x, z(x;s)) w(x)$$\n    The Jacobian matrix $\\partial f / \\partial z$ is:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z_2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    The initial condition for $w(x)$ is found by differentiating the initial condition for $z(x;s)$:\n    $$w(0) = \\frac{\\partial z(0;s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    Thus, the sensitivity IVP is $w'(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} w(x)$ with $w(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Part (ii): Two-Segment Multiple Shooting Method**\n\n1.  **Unknowns:**\n    The domain $[0,1]$ is split into $[0,c]$ and $[c,1]$.\n    - For the first segment $[0,c]$, we have the IVP $z'(x) = f(x,z)$ with $z(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix}$. The unknown is $s$.\n    - For the second segment $[c,1]$, we define a new initial state at the interface $x=c$, which is unknown. Let this state be $q = \\begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix}$. This gives two more unknowns, $q_1$ and $q_2$.\n    The total vector of unknowns is $u = \\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\ q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is a vector of size $3$.\n\n2.  **Residuals:**\n    We need $3$ equations to solve for the $3$ unknowns.\n    - **Continuity at $x=c$:** The solution from the first segment at $x=c$, denoted $z(c;s)$, must be equal to the initial state of the second segment, $q$. This provides two equations:\n        $F_1(u) = z_1(c;s) - q_1 = 0$\n        $F_2(u) = z_2(c;s) - q_2 = 0$\n    - **Terminal Condition at $x=1$:** The solution of the second segment, denoted $\\tilde{z}(x;q)$, which solves $\\tilde{z}'=f(x,\\tilde{z})$ with $\\tilde{z}(c)=q$, must satisfy the terminal BC.\n        $\\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 = 0$\n        This gives the third equation: $F_3(u) = \\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 = 0$.\n    The complete residual vector is:\n    $$F(u) = \\begin{bmatrix} z_1(c;s) - q_1 \\\\ z_2(c;s) - q_2 \\\\ \\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s)$, the ODE system function $f(x,z)$, the sensitivity IVP (equation, Jacobian, and initial condition), and the expression for $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$ all match the derivation exactly.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u$ and the residual vector $F(u)$ also match the derivation perfectly.\n    - **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s) = z_1(1;s) - 1$ is incorrect; it corresponds to a different BC, $y(1)=1$. The sensitivity initial condition $w(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ is incorrect; it would correspond to shooting on $y(0)$, but the parameter is $s=y'(0)$.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u = \\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\ q_1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is incomplete. It arbitrarily fixes the second state variable at the interface, $z_2(c)=0$, which is unjustified. The system is ill-posed as it has fewer unknowns and equations than required.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s) = z_1(1;s) + z_2(1;s) - 1$ is incorrect; it corresponds to a linear BC $y(1)+y'(1)=1$. The sensitivity ODE is given as non-homogeneous, which is fundamentally wrong. The sensitivity ODE for a parameter-independent $f$ must be linear and homogeneous, $w'=Jw$.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The residual vector uses a squared norm for continuity, $(\\dots)^2+(\\dots)^2=0$, which reduces two required equations to one, making the system underdetermined. It also includes an arbitrary condition $q_2=0$. The formulation is entirely flawed.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The Jacobian matrix for the sensitivity equation is given as $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is incorrect. The correct Jacobian is $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The sensitivity initial condition $w(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is also incorrect due to the wrong sign.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u$ incorrectly includes $y_0=y(0)$ as a variable. Since $y(0)=0$ is a given fixed value, it should not be part of the unknown vector in a standard formulation.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, only Option A provides a completely correct and consistent formulation for both the single and multiple shooting methods as applied to the given boundary value problem.",

            "solution": "The solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, a theoretical justification from first principles, and second, a description of the numerical shooting method designed to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Theoretical Justification and Qualitative Analysis**\n\nThe problem concerns the motion of a particle of unit mass, $m=1$, under the influence of a force $F(y)$ derived from a potential energy function $V(y)$. Newton's second law states that $ma = F$, where the acceleration is $a = y''(x)$, with $x$ representing time. The force is conservative, given by $F(y) = -V'(y)$. For the given potential $V(y) = \\frac{1}{4}y^4$, the corresponding force is $F(y) = -\\frac{d}{dy}(\\frac{1}{4}y^4) = -y^3$. Substituting these into Newton's law for $m=1$ gives:\n$$\n(1) y''(x) = -y(x)^3\n$$\nwhich rearranges to the specified ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\ny''(x) + y(x)^3 = 0.\n$$\nThis confirms the physical origin of the governing equation.\n\nTo demonstrate the conservation of mechanical energy, we multiply the ODE by the velocity, $y'(x)$:\n$$\ny''(x) y'(x) + y(x)^3 y'(x) = 0.\n$$\nThis expression is equivalent to the total time derivative of the energy. Recognizing that $y'' y' = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2)$ and $y^3 y' = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4)$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4 \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity within the parentheses, which is the total mechanical energy $E$, is a constant of motion:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4 = \\text{constant}.\n$$\nThe energy $E$ is determined by the initial conditions. For the initial value problem (IVP) with $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=s$, the energy is:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}[y'(0)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(0)]^4 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2.\n$$\nFor any $s > 0$, the energy $E > 0$. The particle's motion is confined by the potential. The turning points of the oscillation, denoted $\\pm A$, occur where the velocity $y'(x)$ is zero. At these points, the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential: $E = V(A) = \\frac{1}{4}A^4$. Equating the two expressions for energy gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}A^4 \\implies A = (2s^2)^{1/4}.\n$$\nThe particle starts at $y(0)=0$ with positive velocity $s$, moves towards the positive turning point $+A$, reverses direction, passes through $y=0$ with velocity $-s$, reaches the negative turning point $-A$, and returns to $y=0$. This cycle constitutes a periodic motion.\n\nThe non-uniqueness of solutions for the BVP arises from the periodic nature of the IVP solutions. The boundary condition $y(L)=0$ requires the particle to be at the origin at time $x=L$. Starting from $y(0)=0$, the particle reaches $y=0$ again after one half-period, two half-periods (a full period), three half-periods, and so on. Let $T_{1/2}(s)$ denote the half-period of the oscillation corresponding to the initial slope $s$. The boundary condition $y(L)=0$ is satisfied if the interval length $L$ is an integer multiple of the half-period:\n$$\nL = k \\cdot T_{1/2}(s) \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe period of this anharmonic oscillator depends on its energy, and therefore on $s$. By changing $s$, we change the period. For a fixed length $L$, the above equation becomes an implicit equation for $s$. It is plausible that this equation can be solved for different values of $s$, each corresponding to a different integer $k$. For $k=1$, we seek an initial slope $s_1$ such that the particle just completes its first half-oscillation in the interval $[0, L]$. This yields the fundamental solution, a single arch. For $k=2$, we seek a different slope $s_2$ such that the particle completes two half-oscillations (one full wave) in $[0, L]$. These distinct values $s_1, s_2, \\dots$ all produce solutions $y(x; s_k)$ that satisfy both boundary conditions, $y(0)=0$ and $y(L)=0$, thus explaining the existence of multiple, non-trivial solutions to the BVP.\n\n**2. Numerical Design: The Shooting Method**\n\nTo find these distinct initial slopes numerically, we employ the shooting method. This method reframes the BVP as a root-finding problem.\n\nThe shooting parameter is the unknown initial slope, $s = y'(0)$.\nThe IVP is defined as:\n$$\ny''(x) + y(x)^3 = 0, \\quad y(0)=0, \\quad y'(0)=s.\n$$\nTo solve this numerically, we convert the second-order ODE into an equivalent first-order system. Let $y_1(x) = y(x)$ and $y_2(x) = y'(x)$. The system is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny_1'(x) = y_2(x) \\\\\ny_2'(x) = -y_1(x)^3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith initial conditions at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1(0) \\\\ y_2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nWe integrate this system from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The solution at $x=L$, which we denote $y(L;s)$, depends on the choice of $s$. The second boundary condition $y(L)=0$ (or $y_1(L)=0$) is satisfied only for specific values of $s$. We define a residual function $R(s;L)$ which measures the mismatch at the final boundary:\n$$\nR(s;L) = y_1(L;s).\n$$\nThe problem is now to find the roots of the equation $R(s;L) = 0$.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Residual Function**: Create a function that, for a given $s$ and $L$, numerically solves the IVP from $x=0$ to $x=L$ using a high-precision, adaptive-step ODE integrator (such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with absolute and relative tolerances set to $10^{-10}$). This function returns the value of $y_1(L)$.\n2.  **Bracket the Roots**: As argued qualitatively, the residual $R(s;L)$ will be an oscillatory function of $s$. To find its roots, we first need to isolate them in intervals. We achieve this by evaluating $R(s;L)$ over a grid of $s$ values and identifying pairs of adjacent points, $(s_a, s_b)$, where $R(s_a;L)$ and $R(s_b;L)$ have opposite signs. Each such interval $[s_a, s_b]$ is guaranteed to contain at least one root.\n3.  **Solve for the Roots**: For each bracket $[s_a, s_b]$ found, a robust one-dimensional bracketing root-finder (such as Brent's method, `scipy.optimize.brentq`) is used to locate the root $s_k$ to a high degree of accuracy (tolerance on $s$ set to $10^{-11}$).\n4.  **Collect and Report**: We apply this procedure for each given length $L_i$ to find the two smallest distinct positive roots, $s_{1}(L_i)$ and $s_{2}(L_i)$, round them to the specified precision, and format the output as required. The trivial solution $s=0$ is explicitly excluded.\n\nThis combination of a high-fidelity ODE solver and a reliable root-finding algorithm provides a robust and accurate method for determining the non-unique solutions of the nonlinear BVP.",
