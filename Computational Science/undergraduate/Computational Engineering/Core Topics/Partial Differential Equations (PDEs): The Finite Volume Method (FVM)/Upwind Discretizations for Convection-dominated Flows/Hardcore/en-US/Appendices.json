Assume a uniform spatial grid with spacing $\\Delta x$ and an explicit forward-Euler time discretization with time step $\\Delta t$. Use the first-order upwind spatial discretization of the convective term selected by the sign of $a$ (upwind to the left if $a \\ge 0$ and upwind to the right if $a  0$), and treat the sink term explicitly.

The one-step update formula is:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - a\\,\\Delta t\\,(u_x)_i^n - \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t\\,u_i^n\n$$\nNext, we discretize the spatial derivative $(u_x)_i^n$ using the first-order upwind scheme, which depends on the sign of the advection speed $a$.\n\n**Case 1: Advection speed $a \\ge 0$**\nThe upwind direction is to the left (against the flow), so we use a backward difference:\n$$\n(u_x)_i^n \\approx \\frac{u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the update formula yields:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - a\\,\\Delta t\\,\\left(\\frac{u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x}\\right) - \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t\\,u_i^n\n$$\nLet us define the non-dimensional parameters: the Courant number $\\sigma = \\frac{|a|\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ and the reaction number $r = \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t$. Since $a \\ge 0$, $|a|=a$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\sigma(u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n) - r\\,u_i^n = (1 - \\sigma - r)u_i^n + \\sigma u_{i-1}^n\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Advection speed $a  0$**\nThe upwind direction is to the right, so we use a forward difference:\n$$\n(u_x)_i^n \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the update formula:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - a\\,\\Delta t\\,\\left(\\frac{u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n}{\\Delta x}\\right) - \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t\\,u_i^n\n$$\nWith $\\sigma = \\frac{|a|\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-a\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, we have $a\\,\\Delta t = -\\sigma\\,\\Delta x$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - (-\\sigma\\,\\Delta x)\\,\\left(\\frac{u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n}{\\Delta x}\\right) - r\\,u_i^n = u_i^n + \\sigma(u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n) - r\\,u_i^n\n$$\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = (1 - \\sigma - r)u_i^n + \\sigma u_{i+1}^n\n$$\n\n**Fourier (von Neumann) Stability Analysis**\nWe postulate a single Fourier mode solution of the form $u_i^n = G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k x_i}$, where $x_i = i\\,\\Delta x$, $k$ is the wavenumber, $\\mathrm{i} = \\sqrt{-1}$, and $G(k)$ is the complex amplification factor per time step.\n\nFor $a \\ge 0$:\n$$\nG^{n+1} e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x} = (1 - \\sigma - r)G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x} + \\sigma G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k (i-1) \\Delta x}\n$$\nDividing by $G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x}$ gives the amplification factor $G$:\n$$\nG = (1 - \\sigma - r) + \\sigma e^{-\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x}\n$$\nFor $a  0$:\n$$\nG^{n+1} e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x} = (1 - \\sigma - r)G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x} + \\sigma G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k (i+1) \\Delta x}\n$$\nDividing by $G^n e^{\\mathrm{i} k i \\Delta x}$ gives:\n$$\nG = (1 - \\sigma - r) + \\sigma e^{\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta x}\n$$\nLet $\\theta = k\\,\\Delta x$ be the dimensionless wavenumber. The magnitude squared of $G$ is what determines stability. For both cases, $|G|^2$ has the same form:\n$$\n|G(\\theta)|^2 = |(1 - \\sigma - r) + \\sigma(\\cos\\theta \\mp \\mathrm{i}\\sin\\theta)|^2 = \\left( (1 - \\sigma - r) + \\sigma\\cos\\theta \\right)^2 + (\\mp\\sigma\\sin\\theta)^2\n$$\n$$\n|G(\\theta)|^2 = (1 - \\sigma - r)^2 + 2\\sigma(1 - \\sigma - r)\\cos\\theta + \\sigma^2\\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma^2\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\n|G(\\theta)|^2 = (1 - \\sigma - r)^2 + \\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma(1 - \\sigma - r)\\cos\\theta\n$$\nThe scheme is linearly stable if and only if $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ for all $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. This is equivalent to $|G(\\theta)|^2 \\le 1$. The expression for $|G(\\theta)|^2$ is a linear function of $\\cos\\theta$. Its extrema occur at the boundaries of the range of $\\cos\\theta$, which are $\\cos\\theta = 1$ (for $\\theta = 0$, $k=0$) and $\\cos\\theta = -1$ (for $\\theta = \\pi$, $k=\\pi/\\Delta x$).\n\n1.  **At $\\theta = 0$ ($k=0$):** $\\cos\\theta = 1$.\n    $$\n    |G(0)|^2 = (1 - \\sigma - r)^2 + \\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma(1 - \\sigma - r) = [(1 - \\sigma - r) + \\sigma]^2 = (1 - r)^2\n    $$\n    The stability condition $|G(0)|^2 \\le 1$ implies $(1-r)^2 \\le 1$, which is $-1 \\le 1-r \\le 1$.\n    Since $r = \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t \\ge 0$, the inequality $1-r \\le 1$ is always true. The other inequality, $-1 \\le 1-r$, gives $r \\le 2$.\n\n2.  **At $\\theta = \\pi$ ($k=\\pi/\\Delta x$):** $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    $$\n    |G(\\pi)|^2 = (1 - \\sigma - r)^2 + \\sigma^2 - 2\\sigma(1 - \\sigma - r) = [(1 - \\sigma - r) - \\sigma]^2 = (1 - 2\\sigma - r)^2\n    $$\n    The stability condition $|G(\\pi)|^2 \\le 1$ implies $(1 - 2\\sigma - r)^2 \\le 1$, which is $-1 \\le 1 - 2\\sigma - r \\le 1$.\n    The right inequality, $1 - 2\\sigma - r \\le 1$, gives $-2\\sigma - r \\le 0$, or $2\\sigma + r \\ge 0$. Since $\\sigma \\ge 0$ and $r \\ge 0$, this is always satisfied.\n    The left inequality, $-1 \\le 1 - 2\\sigma - r$, gives $2\\sigma + r \\le 2$.\n\n**Combined Stability Condition and Maximum Time Step**\nThe scheme is stable if both conditions, $r \\le 2$ and $2\\sigma + r \\le 2$, are met. Since $\\sigma \\ge 0$, the second condition $2\\sigma + r \\le 2$ implies $r \\le 2 - 2\\sigma \\le 2$. Thus, $2\\sigma + r \\le 2$ is the single necessary and sufficient condition for stability.\n\nWe substitute the definitions of $\\sigma$ and $r$:\n$$\n2 \\left(\\frac{|a|\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right) + \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t \\le 2\n$$\nFactoring out $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\left( \\frac{2|a|}{\\Delta x} + \\epsilon \\right) \\le 2\n$$\nFrom this, we derive the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{2|a|}{\\Delta x} + \\epsilon}\n$$\nThis formula holds for all cases, including when $a=0$ or $\\epsilon=0$.\n- If $\\epsilon=0$ (pure advection), $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{2|a|/\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}$, which corresponds to the classic CFL condition $\\sigma \\le 1$.\n- If $a=0$ (pure reaction), $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$, which is the stability limit for forward Euler on the ODE $u'=-\\epsilon u$, corresponding to $r \\le 2$.\n\n**Qualitative Explanation of Stability Interaction**\nThe stability condition can be rewritten as $\\sigma + r/2 \\le 1$.\n- The term $\\sigma = |a|\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ represents the stability requirement from the explicit upwind discretization of the convection term. By itself, stability requires $\\sigma \\le 1$.\n- The term $r/2 = \\epsilon \\Delta t / 2$ represents the stability requirement from the explicit treatment of the reaction term. By itself, stability requires $r \\le 2$.\n\nThe combined condition $\\sigma + r/2 \\le 1$ demonstrates that the time step restrictions from the two phenomena are additive. While the sink term $-\\epsilon u$ is physically dissipative and damps the solution, its *explicit* numerical treatment via the forward-Euler method introduces its own constraint on the time step. The forward-Euler method is only conditionally stable for problems with negative real eigenvalues (stiff or dissipative systems). The total \"demand\" on stability, represented by the sum of the Courant number and half the reaction number, cannot exceed unity. Consequently, the presence of an explicitly treated sink term ($\\epsilon  0$) makes the overall time step restriction *more stringent* than the CFL condition for pure advection. The time step must be small enough to stably resolve both the advective and reactive dynamics simultaneously within the limitations of the chosen explicit time integration scheme.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed exercise in computational engineering, specifically concerning the numerical solution of a linear conservation law using a first-order finite volume method. The problem is scientifically sound, fully specified, and contains no contradictions. A unique solution exists for each test case. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe governing equation is the linear conservation law given by\n$$ u_t + \\partial_x(a(x)u) = 0, $$\non a periodic domain $x \\in [0,1]$. The wave speed is non-constant: $a(x) = 2(x - \\tfrac{1}{2})$. The equation describes the transport (advection) of a quantity $u$ with a velocity that varies linearly in space. The velocity is zero at the domain center $x=0.5$, negative for $x  0.5$, and positive for $x  0.5$. This implies that the quantity $u$ is transported away from the center towards the boundaries, where it re-enters the domain due to periodic boundary conditions.\n\nThe numerical method employed is a finite volume scheme. This approach is based on the integral form of the conservation law over each control volume (cell) $C_i = [x_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}, x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}]$. The change of the average value of $u$ in a cell is balanced by the net flux across its boundaries:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}}^{x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}} u(x,t) dx + \\big(a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}})u(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}},t) - a(x_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}})u(x_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}},t)\\big) = 0. $$\nApproximating the cell average $u_i(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{C_i} u(x,t) dx$ and discretizing in time with an explicit Euler step yields the conservative update formula:\n$$ u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\big(F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^n - F_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}^n\\big). $$\nHere, $u_i^n$ is the approximation of the cell-average of $u$ in cell $i$ at time $t_n$, $\\Delta x = 1/N$ is the cell width, and $F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^n$ is the numerical flux approximating the physical flux $a(x)u$ at the cell face $x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}$.\n\nThe numerical flux is specified as a first-order upwind flux:\n$$ F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^n = \\begin{cases} a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}})u_i^n,  \\text{if } a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) \\ge 0 \\\\ a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}})u_{i+1}^n,  \\text{if } a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}})  0 \\end{cases} $$\nThe principle of upwinding dictates that the flux at an interface is determined by the state in the \"upwind\" cell, from which information is flowing. If the wave speed $a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}})$ at the face between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$ is positive, the flow is from left to right, so the flux depends on the state in cell $i$. If the wave speed is negative, the flow is from right to left, and the flux depends on the state in cell $i+1$. This is crucial for the stability of the numerical scheme for convection-dominated problems.\n\nWe now address each test case systematically.\n\n**Test case 1**\n\nParameters: $N = 20$, $\\Delta t = 0.02$, initial condition $u_0(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x) + 1$. We are asked to find $u_{10}^{1}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the discrete grid. Cell width is $\\Delta x = 1/20 = 0.05$. The cell centers are $x_i = (i+0.5)/20$ for $i=0, \\dots, 19$. The cell faces are $x_{i+1/2} = (i+1)/20$. The time step update for cell $i=10$ is\n$$ u_{10}^{1} = u_{10}^{0} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\big( F_{10+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^{0} - F_{10-\\tfrac{1}{2}}^{0} \\big). $$\nThe initial value is $u_{10}^0 = u_0(x_{10}) = u_0((10+0.5)/20) = u_0(0.525) = \\sin(2\\pi \\times 0.525) + 1 = \\sin(1.05\\pi) + 1$.\nThe ratio $\\Delta t / \\Delta x = 0.02 / 0.05 = 0.4$.\n\nWe must compute the fluxes at the faces bounding cell $10$, which are $x_{9+\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ and $x_{10+\\tfrac{1}{2}}$.\nFace $x_{10+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = x_{10.5} = (10+1)/20 = 0.55$. The wave speed here is $a(0.55) = 2(0.55 - 0.5) = 0.1$. Since $a(x_{10.5})  0$, the upwind direction is from cell $10$. Thus, the flux is $F_{10.5}^0 = a(x_{10.5}) u_{10}^0 = 0.1 \\times u_{10}^0$.\nFace $x_{9+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = x_{9.5} = (9+1)/20 = 0.5$. The wave speed is $a(0.5) = 2(0.5 - 0.5) = 0$. The condition for the flux is $a \\ge 0$, which is met. The upwind direction is from cell $9$. So, $F_{9.5}^0 = a(x_{9.5}) u_{9}^0 = 0 \\times u_{9}^0 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the fluxes into the update equation:\n$$ u_{10}^{1} = u_{10}^{0} - 0.4 \\big( (0.1 \\times u_{10}^0) - 0 \\big) = u_{10}^{0} - 0.04 u_{10}^{0} = 0.96 u_{10}^{0}. $$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ u_{10}^{1} = 0.96 \\times (\\sin(1.05\\pi) + 1) \\approx 0.96 \\times (-0.156434465 + 1) \\approx 0.809822913. $$\n\n**Test case 2**\n\nParameters: $N = 16$, $\\Delta t = 0.01$, initial condition $u_0(x) = x$. We need the absolute value of the flux, $|F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0|$, at the face where $x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = 1/2$.\n\nFirst, identify the face index $i$. $x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = (i+1)/N = (i+1)/16 = 1/2$. This yields $i+1=8$, so $i=7$. We need to compute $|F_{7+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0|$.\nThe face is $x_{7.5} = 0.5$. The wave speed at this face is $a(0.5) = 2(0.5 - 0.5) = 0$.\nAccording to the flux definition, if $a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) \\ge 0$, the flux is $F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^n = a(x_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) u_i^n$. Here, $a(x_{7.5}) = 0$, so the condition is met. The cell to the left is $i=7$.\nThe flux is $F_{7.5}^0 = a(x_{7.5}) u_7^0 = 0 \\times u_7^0 = 0$.\nThe value of $u_7^0$ is irrelevant. The flux is zero because the transport velocity at the interface is zero.\nThe requested value is $|F_{7.5}^0| = |0| = 0$.\n\n**Test case 3**\n\nParameters: $N = 10$, $\\Delta t = 0$, initial condition $u_0(x) = \\sqrt{x(1-x)}$. The output is the maximum absolute change $\\max_i |u_i^1 - u_i^0|$.\n\nThe finite volume update is $u_i^1 = u_i^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(F_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0 - F_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0)$.\nGiven $\\Delta t = 0$, the update term is zero regardless of the flux values:\n$$ u_i^1 = u_i^0 - \\frac{0}{\\Delta x}(\\dots) = u_i^0. $$\nTherefore, $u_i^1 = u_i^0$ for all $i=0, \\dots, N-1$. The change is identically zero for all cells.\nThe maximum absolute change is $\\max_i |u_i^1 - u_i^0| = \\max_i |u_i^0 - u_i^0| = \\max_i(0) = 0$.\n\n**Test case 4**\n\nParameters: $N = 4$, $\\Delta t = 0.2$, initial condition $u_0(x) = 2$ for $x \\in [3/4, 1]$ and $u_0(x) = 0$ otherwise. We need to find $u_0^1$.\n\nFirst, establish the discrete initial conditions. $\\Delta x = 1/4 = 0.25$.\nCell centers are $x_0 = 0.125$, $x_1 = 0.375$, $x_2 = 0.625$, $x_3 = 0.875$.\nEvaluating $u_0(x)$ at these centers:\n$u_0^0 = u_0(0.125) = 0$.\n$u_1^0 = u_0(0.375) = 0$.\n$u_2^0 = u_0(0.625) = 0$.\n$u_3^0 = u_0(0.875) = 2$ (since $0.75 \\le 0.875 \\le 1$).\nThe initial state vector is $u^0 = [0, 0, 0, 2]$.\n\nThe update for cell $i=0$ is\n$$ u_0^1 = u_0^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\big( F_{0+\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0 - F_{0-\\tfrac{1}{2}}^0 \\big). $$\nWith periodic indexing, the face $x_{0-\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ is the same as $x_{3+\\tfrac{1}{2}}$. So we need fluxes $F_{0.5}^0$ and $F_{3.5}^0$.\nThe ratio $\\Delta t / \\Delta x = 0.2 / 0.25 = 0.8$.\n\nWe compute the required fluxes:\nFace $x_{0.5} = (0+1)/4 = 0.25$. The wave speed is $a(0.25) = 2(0.25-0.5) = -0.5$. Since $a  0$, flow is from right to left, so the flux depends on the state in cell $i+1=1$.\n$F_{0.5}^0 = a(x_{0.5}) u_1^0 = -0.5 \\times 0 = 0$.\nFace $x_{3.5} = (3+1)/4 = 1.0$. The wave speed is $a(1.0) = 2(1.0-0.5) = 1.0$. Since $a  0$, flow is from left to right, so the flux depends on the state in cell $i=3$.\n$F_{3.5}^0 = a(x_{3.5}) u_3^0 = 1.0 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the update formula for $u_0^1$:\n$$ u_0^1 = u_0^0 - 0.8 \\big( F_{0.5}^0 - F_{3.5}^0 \\big) = 0 - 0.8 \\big( 0 - 2 \\big) = -0.8(-2) = 1.6. $$\nThe result is $u_0^1 = 1.6$. This is physically consistent: the high value in cell $3$ is advected to the right (increasing index), wrapping around the periodic domain to enter cell $0$.",

The advection-diffusion equation is the correct leading-order model for a first-order upwind scheme. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to derive a relationship between the measured profile thickness and the unknown numerical diffusivity. The data provided for each test case is internally consistent, e.g., for Case A, $a\\,\\Delta t / \\Delta x = 1 \\times 0.005 / 0.01 = 0.5$, which matches the given $\\nu = 0.5$. The problem has no identifiable flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on first principles.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the observed numerical solution at time $T$ is approximated by the analytical solution of the modified advection-diffusion equation, $u_t + a\\,u_x = \\mu_{\\text{num}}\\,u_{xx}$, with the specified step initial condition. We will derive this analytical solution, use it to express the thickness $\\delta_{10-90}$ as a function of $\\mu_{\\text{num}}$ and $T$, and then invert this relationship to find $\\mu_{\\text{num}}$.\n\nFirst, we transform the PDE into a co-moving frame of reference, $\\eta = x - a t$. The spatial and temporal derivatives transform as $\\partial/\\partial x \\to \\partial/\\partial \\eta$ and $\\partial/\\partial t \\to \\partial/\\partial t - a\\,\\partial/\\partial \\eta$. Substituting these into the modified equation yields:\n$$\n(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - a\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\eta}) + a(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\eta}) = \\mu_{\\text{num}}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\eta^2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the standard one-dimensional heat (or diffusion) equation in the moving frame:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\mu_{\\text{num}}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\eta^2}\n$$\nThe initial condition $u(x,0) = u_L$ for $x  x_0$ and $u(x,0) = u_R$ for $x  x_0$ becomes, in a shifted frame $\\eta' = x - x_0 - at$, a step at $\\eta'=0$: $u(\\eta',0) = u_L$ for $\\eta'  0$ and $u(\\eta',0) = u_R$ for $\\eta'  0$. The well-known solution to the heat equation for such initial data is given in terms of the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}(z)$:\n$$\nu(\\eta', t) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\eta'}{\\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} t}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the final observation in the coordinate $\\xi = x - (x_0 + aT)$. At the final time $t=T$, the coordinate $\\eta'$ is $\\eta' = x - x_0 - aT$, which is identical to $\\xi$. Therefore, the solution profile at time $T$ is:\n$$\nu(\\xi, T) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\xi}{\\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of $\\delta_{10-90}$. We must find the locations $\\xi_{90}$ and $\\xi_{10}$ corresponding to the solution values $u = u_R + 0.9\\,(u_L - u_R)$ and $u = u_R + 0.1\\,(u_L - u_R)$, respectively.\nFor the $90\\%$ level (at $\\xi_{90}$):\n$$\nu_R + 0.9(u_L - u_R) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\xi_{90}}{\\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0.9 = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}(z_{90}) \\implies \\text{erfc}(z_{90}) = 1.8 \\implies 1 - \\text{erf}(z_{90}) = 1.8 \\implies \\text{erf}(z_{90}) = -0.8\n$$\nwhere $z_{90} = \\xi_{90} / \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T}$. Thus, $z_{90} = \\text{erf}^{-1}(-0.8) = -\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)$.\n\nFor the $10\\%$ level (at $\\xi_{10}$):\n$$\nu_R + 0.1(u_L - u_R) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\xi_{10}}{\\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0.1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}(z_{10}) \\implies \\text{erfc}(z_{10}) = 0.2 \\implies 1 - \\text{erf}(z_{10}) = 0.2 \\implies \\text{erf}(z_{10}) = 0.8\n$$\nwhere $z_{10} = \\xi_{10} / \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T}$. Thus, $z_{10} = \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)$.\n\nFrom these, we find the locations:\n$$\n\\xi_{90} = \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot z_{90} = -\\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)\n$$\n$$\n\\xi_{10} = \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot z_{10} = \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)\n$$\nSince $u_L  u_R$, the solution profile decreases as $\\xi$ increases, so $\\xi_{10}  \\xi_{90}$. The thickness $\\delta_{10-90}$ is defined as the difference between these locations:\n$$\n\\delta_{10-90} = \\xi_{10} - \\xi_{90} = 2 \\sqrt{4 \\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8) = 4 \\sqrt{\\mu_{\\text{num}} T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)\n$$\nWe now invert this expression to solve for $\\mu_{\\text{num}}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\mu_{\\text{num}}} = \\frac{\\delta_{10-90}}{4 \\sqrt{T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{num}} = \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{10-90}}{4 \\sqrt{T} \\cdot \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\delta_{10-90}^2}{16 \\cdot T \\cdot (\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8))^2}\n$$\nThis is the final formula for estimating $\\mu_{\\text{num}}$. This formula will be applied to each test case.\nFor Case B, $\\delta_{10-90} = 0$, which immediately gives $\\mu_{\\text{num}} = 0$. This is physically correct, as a CFL number of $\\nu=1$ for the first-order upwind scheme results in exact advection with zero numerical diffusion.\nFor Cases A and C, we substitute the provided values for $\\delta_{10-90}$ and $T$ into the derived formula. The constant $\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)$ is a known numerical value.\nThe calculations proceed as follows:\n- Let $C = \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8) \\approx 0.9061938$.\n- Case A: $\\mu_{\\text{num,A}} = \\frac{(0.08105244)^2}{16 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot C^2} = 0.0025$.\n- Case B: $\\mu_{\\text{num,B}} = \\frac{0^2}{16 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot C^2} = 0$.\n- Case C: $\\mu_{\\text{num,C}} = \\frac{(0.07249550416)^2}{16 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot C^2} = 0.004$.\nThese values constitute the solution to the problem.",
