The standard Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is defined for symmetric positive definite matrices and produces search directions $p_k$ and step sizes $\\alpha_k$ that rely on the curvature quantity $p_k^\\top A p_k$. Consider the following computational task.\n\nGiven a real symmetric matrix $A$, a right-hand side $b$, an initial guess $x_0 = 0$, a tolerance $\\varepsilon$, and a maximum number of iterations $k_{\\max}$, write a program that attempts to solve $A x = b$ using the standard Conjugate Gradient method and returns a status code for each case according to the following rules:\n\n- Return $1$ if the method achieves $\\lVert r_k \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$ at some iteration $k \\le k_{\\max}$ without ever encountering a nonpositive curvature, where $r_k = b - A x_k$ is the residual and $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_2$ denotes the Euclidean norm.\n- Return $0$ if at any iteration $k$ the curvature quantity $p_k^\\top A p_k \\le 0$, which indicates a violation of the positive definiteness requirement inherent to the standard Conjugate Gradient method.\n- Return $-1$ if the method completes $k_{\\max}$ iterations without satisfying $\\lVert r_k \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$ and without encountering $p_k^\\top A p_k \\le 0$.\n\nUse the following test suite. In all cases, use the initial guess $x_0 = 0$, the tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$, and the maximum iteration count $k_{\\max} = 10$.\n\n- Test case $1$ (symmetric positive definite, expected to converge): \n  $$A_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n- Test case $2$ (symmetric positive semidefinite but singular, exhibits zero curvature): \n  $$A_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad b_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n- Test case $3$ (symmetric indefinite, exhibits negative curvature): \n  $$A_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad b_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the test cases, for example: $[s_1,s_2,s_3]$, where each $s_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ is the status code for test case $i$.",
            "solution": "The Conjugate Gradient method is an iterative algorithm for solving linear systems of the form $A x = b$, where the matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is symmetric and positive definite (SPD). The method's convergence and stability depend critically on the positive definiteness, which ensures that the curvature quantity $p_k^\\top A p_k$ is always positive. This term appears in the denominator for the step size $\\alpha_k$, and its positivity guarantees that each step moves towards the minimum of the quadratic form $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^\\top A x - b^\\top x$.\n\nThe standard CG algorithm is defined as follows. We are given the system $A x = b$, an initial guess $x_0$, a tolerance $\\varepsilon > 0$, and a maximum number of iterations $k_{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, we initialize the state variables at iteration $k=0$:\nThe initial solution is given as $x_0 = 0$.\nThe initial residual is $r_0 = b - A x_0 = b$.\nThe initial search direction is set to the residual: $p_0 = r_0$.\n\nThe algorithm then enters an iterative loop for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, k_{\\max}-1$. At each iteration $k$, the following steps are performed:\n\n1.  Calculate the matrix-vector product $v_k = A p_k$.\n2.  Compute the curvature term, which is a scalar: $d_k = p_k^\\top v_k = p_k^\\top A p_k$. The problem requires us to check if $A$ is behaving as a positive definite matrix with respect to the current search direction. If $d_k \\le 0$, the assumption of positive definiteness is violated. The algorithm cannot proceed in a meaningful way, as the step size $\\alpha_k$ would be negative, zero, or undefined, leading away from the solution. In this case, we must terminate and return the status code $0$.\n3.  If the curvature is positive, calculate the optimal step size along the direction $p_k$:\n    $$ \\alpha_k = \\frac{r_k^\\top r_k}{p_k^\\top A p_k} $$\n4.  Update the solution vector:\n    $$ x_{k+1} = x_k + \\alpha_k p_k $$\n5.  Update the residual. To avoid an expensive recomputation ($r_{k+1} = b - A x_{k+1}$), we use a recursive formula:\n    $$ r_{k+1} = r_k - \\alpha_k A p_k = r_k - \\alpha_k v_k $$\n6.  Check for convergence. We compute the Euclidean norm of the new residual, $\\lVert r_{k+1} \\rVert_2$. If $\\lVert r_{k+1} \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$, the solution is considered sufficiently accurate. We terminate and return the status code $1$.\n7.  If the method has not converged, we prepare for the next iteration by computing a new search direction $p_{k+1}$ that is A-orthogonal to the previous one, $p_k$. This is done by first computing the coefficient $\\beta_k$:\n    $$ \\beta_k = \\frac{r_{k+1}^\\top r_{k+1}}{r_k^\\top r_k} $$\n8.  Then, the new search direction is a linear combination of the new residual and the old search direction:\n    $$ p_{k+1} = r_{k+1} + \\beta_k p_k $$\n\nIf the loop completes after $k_{\\max}$ iterations without the residual norm falling below the tolerance $\\varepsilon$, and without ever encountering nonpositive curvature, the method has failed to converge within the given iteration limit. In this scenario, we return the status code $-1$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this logic. Before the main loop, it computes the initial residual $r_0$ and checks its norm $\\lVert r_0 \\rVert_2$. If it is already less than or equal to $\\varepsilon$, it immediately returns the status code $1$. Otherwise, it proceeds with the iterative process described above. Each of the three test cases provided is designed to trigger one of the three specified outcomes:\n-   Test Case $1$: $A_1$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. All its eigenvalues are positive, which guarantees that $p^\\top A_1 p > 0$ for any non-zero vector $p$. The CG method is expected to converge to the solution within a few iterations. The status code will be $1$.\n-   Test Case $2$: $A_2$ is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, as it has eigenvalues of $1$ and $0$. It is singular. The CG algorithm may generate a search direction that lies in the null space of $A_2$, which leads to a curvature term $p_k^\\top A_2 p_k = 0$. This will terminate the algorithm and yield the status code $0$.\n-   Test Case $3$: $A_3$ is a symmetric indefinite matrix, having both positive and negative eigenvalues. The CG method is not guaranteed to maintain positive curvature. A search direction $p_k$ can be generated such that $p_k^\\top A_3 p_k < 0$. This condition also invalidates the premises of the standard CG method, requiring termination with status code $0$.\n\nThe program executes this logic for each of the three test cases and reports the resulting status codes.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical comparison of the stability of two orthogonalization schemes, Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS) and Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS), within the context of the Arnoldi iteration. The stability is quantified by measuring the loss of orthogonality in the generated basis for a set of well-defined test cases. The entire computation will be performed using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n\nThe Arnoldi iteration is a fundamental algorithm in numerical linear algebra for constructing an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace $\\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0) = \\operatorname{span}\\{r_0, A r_0, \\dots, A^{k-1} r_0\\}$. For a given matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and an initial vector $r_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the process generates a sequence of orthonormal vectors $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$ whose span is $\\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0)$. These vectors form the columns of a matrix $Q_k = [q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$. The process begins by normalizing the initial vector: $q_1 = r_0 / \\|r_0\\|_2$. Subsequently, for $j=1, 2, \\dots, k-1$, the vector $q_{j+1}$ is generated by taking the matrix-vector product $v = A q_j$ and orthogonalizing it with respect to the previously computed basis vectors $\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_j\\}$. This is the Gram-Schmidt procedure. The resulting vector is then normalized.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the implementation of this orthogonalization step.\n\nThe Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS) approach computes the new vector by simultaneously subtracting all projections of $v=Aq_j$ onto the existing basis vectors. First, the projection coefficients $h_{i,j}$ are computed:\n$$\nh_{i,j} = q_i^T v \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\dots, j.\n$$\nThen, a new vector $\\hat{v}$ is formed by subtracting the linear combination of basis vectors:\n$$\n\\hat{v} = v - \\sum_{i=1}^{j} h_{i,j} q_i.\n$$\nFinally, this vector is normalized to obtain the next basis vector, $q_{j+1} = \\hat{v} / \\|\\hat{v}\\|_2$, where the norm $\\|\\hat{v}\\|_2$ corresponds to the Hessenberg matrix entry $h_{j+1,j}$.\n\nThe Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) approach performs the orthogonalization sequentially. Instead of projecting the original vector $v$ onto each basis vector, it projects an intermediate vector that has already been made orthogonal to the preceding basis vectors. Let $w^{(0)} = v = A q_j$. The process iterates for $i=1, 2, \\dots, j$:\n$$\nh_{i,j} = q_i^T w^{(i-1)},\n$$\n$$\nw^{(i)} = w^{(i-1)} - h_{i,j} q_i.\n$$\nThe resulting vector after $j$ steps is $\\hat{v} = w^{(j)}$. This vector is then normalized to get $q_{j+1} = \\hat{v} / \\|\\hat{v}\\|_2$.\n\nIn exact arithmetic, CGS and MGS are equivalent. However, in finite-precision arithmetic, their numerical properties differ significantly. Due to rounding errors, the computed basis vectors $\\{q_i\\}$ are not perfectly orthogonal, i.e., $q_i^T q_j \\neq 0$ for $i \\neq j$. In CGS, all dot products $q_i^T v$ are computed with the same vector $v$. If the basis vectors have already lost some orthogonality, errors can accumulate, leading to a phenomenon known as catastrophic cancellation. The resulting vector $\\hat{v}$ may retain significant components along the directions of $q_1, \\dots, q_j$ that should have been removed. MGS is more stable because the vector being orthogonalized is updated at each step. The computation $q_i^T w^{(i-1)}$ uses a vector that is already numerically orthogonal to $\\{q_1, \\dots, q_{i-1}\\}$, which reduces the propagation of rounding errors and maintains the orthogonality of the basis vectors to a much higher degree.\n\nWe are asked to quantify this loss of orthogonality using the metric\n$$\n\\ell(Q_m) = \\| I_m - Q_m^T Q_m \\|_F,\n$$\nwhere $Q_m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$ is the matrix of the $m$ generated Arnoldi vectors (with $m \\le k$ in case of breakdown), $I_m$ is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix, and $\\|\\cdot\\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm. For a perfectly orthonormal basis, $Q_m^T Q_m = I_m$ and $\\ell(Q_m) = 0$. Deviations from zero indicate a loss of orthogonality.\n\nThe solution strategy is as follows:\n1. For each test case, construct the specified matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and the initial vector $r_0 = b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $b_i = \\sin(i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$.\n2. Implement the Arnoldi iteration for a specified number of steps, $k$. The implementation will include variants for both CGS and MGS orthogonalization.\n3. The process must detect breakdown, which occurs if the norm of the vector to be normalized, $h_{j+1,j}$, falls below a small tolerance. If breakdown occurs at step $j$, the process terminates, yielding a basis of dimension $m=j$. The problem specifies the maximum number of steps is $k$, so the final basis will have $m \\le k$ vectors.\n4. For each case and for each method (CGS and MGS), generate the basis matrix $Q_m$.\n5. Compute the loss-of-orthonormality metric $\\ell(Q_m)$ for both $Q_m^{\\mathrm{CGS}}$ and $Q_m^{\\mathrm{MGS}}$.\n6. The final output will be a formatted list containing the pairs of computed loss values $[\\ell_{\\mathrm{CGS}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{MGS}}]$ for each test case.",
