This practice builds a crucial, foundational skill by guiding you through the derivation of a second-order accurate approximation for the second derivative, $u_{xx}$, on a non-uniform grid from first principles using Taylor series analysis . Understanding this derivation is key to appreciating how the local grid quality impacts the accuracy of a simulation and is essential for developing robust numerical solvers.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scrutinized and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical analysis, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed in objective mathematical language. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nOur objective is to determine the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a finite difference approximation of the form $L[u](x_i) = a\\,u(x_{i-1})+b\\,u(x_{i})+c\\,u(x_{i+1})$ that approximates the second derivative $u_{xx}(x_i) \\equiv u''(x_i)$. The function $u(x)$ is assumed to be at least four times continuously differentiable. We employ Taylor series expansions for $u(x_{i+1})$ and $u(x_{i-1})$ around the point $x_i$. Let $h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$ and $h_{i-1} = x_i - x_{i-1}$. For brevity in the derivation, we denote $u(x_k)$ as $u_k$ and the derivatives of $u$ at $x_i$ as $u'_i, u''_i, u'''_i, u^{(4)}_i$.\n\nThe Taylor series expansions are:\n$$u(x_{i+1}) = u_{i+1} = u_i + h_i u'_i + \\frac{h_i^2}{2} u''_i + \\frac{h_i^3}{6} u'''_i + \\frac{h_i^4}{24} u^{(4)}_i + \\mathcal{O}(h_i^5)$$\n$$u(x_{i-1}) = u_{i-1} = u_i - h_{i-1} u'_i + \\frac{h_{i-1}^2}{2} u''_i - \\frac{h_{i-1}^3}{6} u'''_i + \\frac{h_{i-1}^4}{24} u^{(4)}_i + \\mathcal{O}(h_{i-1}^5)$$\n\nWe form the linear combination and substitute these expansions:\n$$a u_{i-1} + b u_i + c u_{i+1} = a\\left(u_i - h_{i-1} u'_i + \\frac{h_{i-1}^2}{2} u''_i - \\dots\\right) + b u_i + c\\left(u_i + h_i u'_i + \\frac{h_i^2}{2} u''_i + \\dots\\right)$$\n\nGrouping terms by the derivatives of $u$ at $x_i$:\n$$a u_{i-1} + b u_i + c u_{i+1} = (a+b+c)u_i + (c h_i - a h_{i-1})u'_i + \\left(\\frac{c h_i^2}{2} + \\frac{a h_{i-1}^2}{2}\\right)u''_i + \\left(\\frac{c h_i^3}{6} - \\frac{a h_{i-1}^3}{6}\\right)u'''_i + \\left(\\frac{c h_i^4}{24} + \\frac{a h_{i-1}^4}{24}\\right)u^{(4)}_i + \\dots$$\n\nTo ensure that this expression approximates $u''_i$, we match the coefficients of the derivatives:\n$1$. Coefficient of $u_i$: $a+b+c=0$\n$2$. Coefficient of $u'_i$: $c h_i - a h_{i-1} = 0$\n$3$. Coefficient of $u''_i$: $\\frac{c h_i^2}{2} + \\frac{a h_{i-1}^2}{2} = 1$\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we find $a = c \\frac{h_i}{h_{i-1}}$. Substituting this into equation $(3)$:\n$$\\frac{c h_i^2}{2} + \\frac{(c h_i/h_{i-1}) h_{i-1}^2}{2} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{c}{2} (h_i^2 + h_i h_{i-1}) = 1$$\n$$\\frac{c h_i}{2} (h_i + h_{i-1}) = 1$$\nThis yields the coefficient $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{2}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})}$$\nNow we find $a$ using the relation from equation $(2)$:\n$$a = c \\frac{h_i}{h_{i-1}} = \\frac{2}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})} \\frac{h_i}{h_{i-1}} = \\frac{2}{h_{i-1}(h_i + h_{i-1})}$$\nFinally, we find $b$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$b = -a - c = -\\left(\\frac{2}{h_{i-1}(h_i + h_{i-1})} + \\frac{2}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})}\\right)$$\n$$b = -\\frac{2}{h_i + h_{i-1}}\\left(\\frac{1}{h_{i-1}} + \\frac{1}{h_i}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{h_i + h_{i-1}}\\left(\\frac{h_i + h_{i-1}}{h_i h_{i-1}}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{h_i h_{i-1}}$$\n\nThe finite difference approximation for $u_{xx}(x_i)$ is therefore:\n$$L[u](x_i) = \\frac{2}{h_{i-1}(h_i + h_{i-1})} u_{i-1} - \\frac{2}{h_i h_{i-1}} u_i + \\frac{2}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})} u_{i+1}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more intuitive form:\n$$L[u](x_i) = \\frac{2}{h_i + h_{i-1}} \\left[ \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{h_i} - \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}} \\right]$$\nThis shows the operator as a difference of first-order divided differences, normalized by the average spacing $\\frac{1}{2}(h_i+h_{i-1})$.\n\nThe local truncation error, $\\tau_i$, is defined by $L[u](x_i) = u''(x_i) + \\tau_i$. The leading terms of $\\tau_i$ are given by the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion that were not cancelled.\n$$\\tau_i = \\left(\\frac{c h_i^3}{6} - \\frac{a h_{i-1}^3}{6}\\right)u'''_i + \\left(\\frac{c h_i^4}{24} + \\frac{a h_{i-1}^4}{24}\\right)u^{(4)}_i + \\mathcal{O}(h^3)$$\nwhere $h = \\max\\{h_i, h_{i-1}\\}$. We compute the coefficients.\nThe coefficient of $u'''_i$ is:\n$$\\frac{1}{6}(c h_i^3 - a h_{i-1}^3) = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{2 h_i^3}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})} - \\frac{2 h_{i-1}^3}{h_{i-1}(h_i + h_{i-1})}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3(h_i + h_{i-1})}(h_i^2 - h_{i-1}^2) = \\frac{1}{3}(h_i - h_{i-1})$$\nThe coefficient of $u^{(4)}_i$ is:\n$$\\frac{1}{24}(c h_i^4 + a h_{i-1}^4) = \\frac{1}{24}\\left(\\frac{2 h_i^4}{h_i(h_i + h_{i-1})} + \\frac{2 h_{i-1}^4}{h_{i-1}(h_i + h_{i-1})}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12(h_i + h_{i-1})}(h_i^3 + h_{i-1}^3)$$\nUsing the identity $h_i^3 + h_{i-1}^3 = (h_i+h_{i-1})(h_i^2 - h_i h_{i-1} + h_{i-1}^2)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{12}(h_i^2 - h_i h_{i-1} + h_{i-1}^2)$$\nThus, the leading terms of the local truncation error are:\n$$\\tau_i = \\frac{h_i - h_{i-1}}{3} u'''(x_i) + \\frac{h_i^2 - h_i h_{i-1} + h_{i-1}^2}{12} u^{(4)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^3)$$\nThe order of consistency is determined by the lowest power of $h$ in $\\tau_i$. The first term is $\\mathcal{O}(h_i - h_{i-1})$ and the second term is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. For a general non-uniform grid, $h_i - h_{i-1} = \\mathcal{O}(h)$, so the scheme is first-order consistent.\nFor the scheme to be second-order consistent, the truncation error must be $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. This requires the coefficient of the $u'''(x_i)$ term to be of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. The condition is therefore $h_i - h_{i-1} = \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. This is precisely the smooth-grid assumption provided in the problem statement. Under this condition, the leading part of the truncation error is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, and the approximation is second-order accurate.",

A naive application of finite difference schemes can fail spectacularly at such points. This advanced practice introduces a powerful technique to circumvent this issue for the spherically symmetric wave equation by applying an analytical change of variables, $v=ru$, to transform the governing equation into a simple, singularity-free form before discretization .

            "solution": "The problem statement poses a well-defined initial-boundary value problem for the one-dimensional spherically symmetric wave equation. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective. All parameters, conditions, and requirements for verification are specified. The provided \"exact\" solution, based on d'Alembert's formula, is appropriate for the specified simulation times, as reflections from the outer boundary at $r=R$ do not have time to influence the solution domain in the test cases where error is computed. The problem is therefore valid, and I shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is\n$$\nu_{tt} = c^2\\left(u_{rr} + \\frac{2}{r}u_r\\right)\n$$\nwhere $u=u(r,t)$, and subscripts denote partial differentiation. The term $\\frac{2}{r}u_r$ presents a singularity at the origin, $r=0$, which requires special treatment in a numerical scheme.\n\nA robust and standard method to handle this singularity is to introduce a change of variable. Let $v(r,t) = r u(r,t)$. We can express the partial derivatives of $u$ in terms of $v$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{v}{r} \\implies u_r = \\frac{v_r r - v}{r^2}, \\quad u_{rr} = \\frac{(v_{rr} r) r^2 - (v_r r - v) 2r}{r^4} = \\frac{v_{rr}}{r} - \\frac{2v_r}{r^2} + \\frac{2v}{r^3}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the original PDE yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{v}{r}\\right)_{tt} = c^2\\left(\\left(\\frac{v_{rr}}{r} - \\frac{2v_r}{r^2} + \\frac{2v}{r^3}\\right) + \\frac{2}{r}\\left(\\frac{v_r r - v}{r^2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_{tt}}{r} = c^2\\left(\\frac{v_{rr}}{r} - \\frac{2v_r}{r^2} + \\frac{2v}{r^3} + \\frac{2v_r}{r^2} - \\frac{2v}{r^3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_{tt}}{r} = c^2 \\frac{v_{rr}}{r}\n$$\nFor $r>0$, this simplifies to the canonical one-dimensional wave equation for $v(r,t)$:\n$$\nv_{tt} = c^2 v_{rr}\n$$\nThis transformation has effectively removed the singularity. We can now solve for $v(r,t)$ and then recover $u(r,t)$.\n\nNext, we must transform the initial and boundary conditions from $u$ to $v$:\n1.  **Initial Displacement:** $v(r,0) = r u(r,0) = r \\left(\\frac{1}{r} f(r)\\right) = f(r)$.\n2.  **Initial Velocity:** $v_t(r,0) = r u_t(r,0) = r \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n3.  **Boundary Condition at $r=R$:** $v(R,t) = R u(R,t) = R \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n4.  **Boundary Condition at $r=0$:** The requirement that $u(r,t)$ is finite at the origin implies $v(0,t) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} r u(r,t) = 0$.\n\nWe now have a standard problem for the 1D wave equation for $v(r,t)$ on the domain $[0,R]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $v(0,t)=v(R,t)=0$. We can solve this using a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method on a uniform grid with spatial step $\\Delta r = R/N$ and time step $\\Delta t$. Let $v_i^n \\approx v(i\\Delta r, n\\Delta t)$. Using second-order central differences for the derivatives $v_{tt}$ and $v_{rr}$, we obtain the explicit leapfrog scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{v_i^{n+1} - 2v_i^n + v_i^{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} = c^2 \\frac{v_{i+1}^n - 2v_i^n + v_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta r)^2}\n$$\nSolving for $v_i^{n+1}$ gives the update rule for interior points ($i=1, \\dots, N-1$):\n$$\nv_i^{n+1} = 2v_i^n - v_i^{n-1} + \\lambda^2 (v_{i+1}^n - 2v_i^n + v_{i-1}^n)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = c \\Delta t / \\Delta r$ is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number. This scheme is stable for $\\lambda \\le 1$.\n\nTo start the simulation, we need values at two initial time levels, $n=0$ and $n=1$. We have $v_i^0 = f(r_i)$. For the first time step, we use a central difference for the initial velocity condition $v_t(r,0)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_i^1 - v_i^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} = 0 \\implies v_i^{-1} = v_i^1\n$$\nSubstituting this into the main update rule for $n=0$:\n$$\nv_i^1 = 2v_i^0 - v_i^{-1} + \\lambda^2(v_{i+1}^0 - 2v_i^0 + v_{i-1}^0) = 2v_i^0 - v_i^1 + \\lambda^2(v_{i+1}^0 - 2v_i^0 + v_{i-1}^0)\n$$\n$$\nv_i^1 = v_i^0 + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} (v_{i+1}^0 - 2v_i^0 + v_{i-1}^0)\n$$\nThis provides the values for $v_i^1$, allowing the time-stepping to proceed. The boundary conditions $v_0^n=0$ and $v_N^n=0$ are enforced at all time steps.\n\nAfter evolving $v_i^n$ up to the final time $T=M\\Delta t$, we must reconstruct the solution $u_i^M$.\n-   For interior points $r_i > 0$ (i.e., $i=1, \\dots, N$), the reconstruction is direct: $u_i^M = v_i^M / r_i = v_i^M / (i\\Delta r)$.\n-   At the origin $r_0=0$, we have $u(0,t) = \\lim_{r\\to 0} u(r,t) = \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{v(r,t)}{r}$. Since $v(0,t)=0$, this is the definition of the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $r$ at $r=0$.\n    $$\n    u(0,t) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=0, t}\n    $$\n    We can approximate this derivative using a central difference. From the d'Alembert solution structure, $v$ must be an odd function with respect to the origin. This implies $v(-\\Delta r, t) = -v(\\Delta r, t)$, so $v_{-1}^n = -v_1^n$.\n    $$\n    u_0^M = \\frac{v_1^M - v_{-1}^M}{2\\Delta r} = \\frac{v_1^M - (-v_1^M)}{2\\Delta r} = \\frac{2v_1^M}{2\\Delta r} = \\frac{v_1^M}{\\Delta r}\n    $$\nThis completes the numerical method. The implementation will follow this transformed-variable approach. For Test $3$, the CFL number $\\lambda=1.05 > 1$, which violates the stability condition; we expect the numerical solution to grow exponentially, which will be detected by checking if its magnitude exceeds a large threshold ($10^6$).",
