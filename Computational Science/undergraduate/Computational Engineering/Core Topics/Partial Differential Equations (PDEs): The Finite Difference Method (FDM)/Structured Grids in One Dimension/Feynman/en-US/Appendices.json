            "problem": "Consider a uniform, one-dimensional structured grid with nodes at positions $x_i = x_0 + i h$, where $h > 0$ is the constant grid spacing and $i$ is an integer index. Let $f(x)$ be a scalar field with continuous derivatives up to at least order $5$ in a neighborhood of $x_i$. Two discrete approximations to the first derivative $f^{\\prime}(x_i)$ are defined as follows:\n\n- The standard central-difference stencil using immediate neighbors:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{2 h}.$$\n\n- A modified stencil that enforces a connectivity \"hole\" by linking only every other node:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{hole}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{f(x_{i+2}) - f(x_{i-2})}{4 h}.$$\n\nAssuming $f$ is sufficiently smooth and ignoring round-off errors, each approximation incurs a leading truncation error term proportional to $h^2 f^{(3)}(x_i)$. Define $C_{\\mathrm{std}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{hole}}$ as the scalar coefficients multiplying $h^2 f^{(3)}(x_i)$ in the leading truncation error for $D_{\\mathrm{std}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{hole}}$, respectively, with signs included. Determine the ratio $R = \\left|\\dfrac{C_{\\mathrm{hole}}}{C_{\\mathrm{std}}}\\right|$ as a single real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in numerical analysis concerning the derivation and comparison of truncation errors for finite difference schemes. We will proceed with a rigorous solution based on Taylor series expansions.\n\nThe core of the analysis is to expand the function $f(x)$ in a Taylor series around the grid point $x_i$. The function is assumed to be sufficiently smooth, allowing for expansion up to the necessary order. The Taylor series for $f(x)$ at a point $x_i+\\delta$ is given by:\n$$f(x_i + \\delta) = f(x_i) + \\delta f'(x_i) + \\frac{\\delta^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{\\delta^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{\\delta^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\dots$$\nwhere primes and parenthetical superscripts denote derivatives with respect to $x$.\n\nFirst, we determine the coefficient $C_{\\mathrm{std}}$ for the standard central difference approximation, $D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i}$. The formula is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{2 h}$$\nWe require expansions for $f(x_{i+1}) = f(x_i+h)$ and $f(x_{i-1}) = f(x_i-h)$.\nSetting $\\delta = h$:\n$$f(x_{i+1}) = f(x_i) + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) + O(h^5)$$\nSetting $\\delta = -h$:\n$$f(x_{i-1}) = f(x_i) - h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) - \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) + O(h^5)$$\nSubtracting the second expansion from the first yields the numerator of the stencil:\n$$f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1}) = (f(x_i) - f(x_i)) + (h - (-h)) f'(x_i) + (\\frac{h^2}{2} - \\frac{h^2}{2}) f''(x_i) + (\\frac{h^3}{6} - (-\\frac{h^3}{6})) f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^5)$$\n$$f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1}) = 2 h f'(x_i) + \\frac{2 h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^5) = 2 h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{3} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^5)$$\nNow, substituting this into the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{2 h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{3} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^5)}{2 h} = f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^4)$$\nThe truncation error, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{std}}$, is the difference between the approximation and the true derivative:\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{std}} = D_{\\mathrm{std}} f\\big|_{x_i} - f'(x_i) = \\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^4)$$\nThe leading term of this error is defined as $C_{\\mathrm{std}} h^2 f^{(3)}(x_i)$. By direct comparison, we identify the coefficient:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{std}} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nNext, we perform the same analysis for the modified stencil, $D_{\\mathrm{hole}} f\\big|_{x_i}$. The formula is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{hole}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{f(x_{i+2}) - f(x_{i-2})}{4 h}$$\nThis stencil involves points $x_{i+2} = x_i+2h$ and $x_{i-2} = x_i-2h$. We can use the Taylor series expansion with a step of $2h$. Let us define an effective grid spacing $H = 2h$. The stencil can be rewritten as:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{hole}} f\\big|_{x_i} = \\frac{f(x_i+H) - f(x_i-H)}{2 H}$$\nThis is structurally identical to the standard central difference formula, but with step size $H$ instead of $h$. The leading truncation error will therefore also be structurally identical, with $h$ replaced by $H$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{hole}} = \\frac{H^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(H^4)$$\nSubstituting $H = 2h$ back into the expression:\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{hole}} = \\frac{(2h)^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O((2h)^4) = \\frac{4h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^4) = \\frac{2}{3} h^2 f^{(3)}(x_i) + O(h^4)$$\nThe leading term of this error is defined as $C_{\\mathrm{hole}} h^2 f^{(3)}(x_i)$. By comparison, we identify the coefficient:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{hole}} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nFinally, we are required to compute the ratio $R = \\left|\\dfrac{C_{\\mathrm{hole}}}{C_{\\mathrm{std}}}\\right|$. Using the derived coefficients:\n$$R = \\left|\\frac{2/3}{1/6}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{6}{1}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{12}{3}\\right| = |4|$$\nThus, the resulting ratio is:\n$$R = 4$$\nThis result demonstrates that increasing the stencil width from $2h$ to $4h$ while maintaining the structure of the central difference approximation increases the coefficient of the leading truncation error by a factor of $4$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated. It is determined to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and an unambiguous exercise in computational numerical analysis. All necessary conditions, parameters, and definitions for a unique, verifiable solution are provided. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to determine the observed order of convergence, $p(\\rho)$, for a three-point central difference scheme on a randomly perturbed one-dimensional grid. The order of convergence quantifies how the numerical error $E$ decreases as the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ is refined, typically following a power law $E \\propto (\\Delta x)^p$. By taking the natural logarithm, we obtain a linear relationship $\\log E = p \\log \\Delta x + C$, where the slope $p$ is the desired order of convergence.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for this analysis rests on the Taylor series expansion of the function $u(x)$ being approximated. For the given difference operator,\n$$\n\\left(Du\\right)\\!\\left(x_i\\right) = \\frac{u(x_{i+1}) - u(x_{i-1})}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}},\n$$\nthe local truncation error $\\tau_i = \\left(Du\\right)\\!\\left(x_i\\right) - u'(x_i)$ at an interior node $x_i$ is examined.\n\nCase 1: Uniform Grid ($\\rho = 0$).\nIn this case, the grid nodes are $x_i = i \\Delta x$. The spacing is uniform, such that $x_{i+1} - x_i = \\Delta x$ and $x_i - x_{i-1} = \\Delta x$. The operator simplifies to the standard second-order central difference formula:\n$$\n\\left(Du\\right)\\!\\left(x_i\\right) = \\frac{u(x_i + \\Delta x) - u(x_i - \\Delta x)}{2 \\Delta x}.\n$$\nTaylor series expansion of $u(x_i \\pm \\Delta x)$ around $x_i$ shows that the truncation error is\n$$\n\\tau_i = \\frac{u'''(x_i)}{6} (\\Delta x)^2 + O((\\Delta x)^4).\n$$\nThe error is proportional to $(\\Delta x)^2$. Therefore, we expect the order of convergence to be $p(0) = 2$.\n\nCase 2: Perturbed Grid ($\\rho > 0$).\nHere, the grid spacing is non-uniform. Let $h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$ and $h_{i-1} = x_i - x_{i-1}$. The truncation error is\n$$\n\\tau_i = \\frac{u''(x_i)}{2} (h_i - h_{i-1}) + O(\\max(h_i^2, h_{i-1}^2)).\n$$\nThe difference in adjacent cell sizes is given by $h_i - h_{i-1} = (\\Delta x + \\epsilon_{i+1} - \\epsilon_i) - (\\Delta x + \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_{i-1}) = (\\epsilon_{i+1} - \\epsilon_i) - (\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_{i-1})$. Since each increment $\\epsilon_{j+1} - \\epsilon_j$ is a random variable of order $O(\\rho \\Delta x)$, their difference is also of order $O(\\rho \\Delta x)$. The leading error term is thus proportional to $\\rho \\Delta x$, and the scheme's accuracy degrades to first order. We expect the order of convergence to be $p(\\rho) = 1$ for any $\\rho > 0$.\n\nThe computational procedure to verify these theoretical rates is as follows. For each specified jitter parameter $\\rho \\in \\{0, 0.25, 0.5\\}$, we perform a grid refinement study using the resolutions $N \\in \\{50, 100, 200, 400, 800\\}$. For each pair $(N, \\rho)$:\n1.  The random number generator is seeded with $s(\\rho) + N$ for reproducibility, where $s(\\rho)$ is the given base seed.\n2.  The nominal spacing is $\\Delta x = 1/N$.\n3.  The perturbations $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}_{i=0}^N$ are generated. The increments $\\Delta \\epsilon_i = \\epsilon_{i+1} - \\epsilon_i$ are sampled from $\\text{Uniform}(-\\rho \\Delta x, \\rho \\Delta x)$. The cumulative sum of these increments, starting from $\\epsilon_0 = 0$, yields the full set of perturbations.\n4.  The grid node locations $x_i = i \\Delta x + \\epsilon_i$ are computed.\n5.  The function $u(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ is evaluated at each node $x_i$.\n6.  At each interior node $i=1, \\dots, N-1$, the numerical derivative $\\left(Du\\right)\\!\\left(x_i\\right)$ is calculated using the three-point formula, and the exact derivative $u'(x_i) = 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi x)$ is calculated.\n7.  The absolute error $|\\left(Du\\right)\\!\\left(x_i\\right) - u'(x_i)|$ is computed at each interior node, and the maximum of these errors is stored as $E(N, \\rho)$.\n8.  This process generates five data points $(\\log(\\Delta x_k), \\log(E(N_k, \\rho)))$ for each $\\rho$.\n9.  A linear least-squares regression is applied to these data points to find the slope, which is our estimate for the convergence rate $p(\\rho)$.\n\nThe final result is obtained by rounding the computed rates $p(0)$, $p(0.25)$, and $p(0.5)$ to three decimal places.

From equation $(3)$:\n$B = -A \\frac{(s+t)^2}{s^2}$.\nSubstitute this expression for $B$ into equation $(2)$:\n$-A(s+t) - s \\left( -A \\frac{(s+t)^2}{s^2} \\right) = 1$\n$-A(s+t) + A \\frac{(s+t)^2}{s} = 1$\n$A \\left( \\frac{(s+t)^2 - s(s+t)}{s} \\right) = 1$\n$A \\left( \\frac{(s+t)(s+t-s)}{s} \\right) = 1$\n$A \\frac{t(s+t)}{s} = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{s}{t(s+t)}$.\n\nNow, we find $B$:\n$B = - \\frac{s}{t(s+t)} \\cdot \\frac{(s+t)^2}{s^2} = -\\frac{s+t}{st}$.\n\nFinally, from equation $(1)$, we find $C$:\n$C = -A - B = -\\frac{s}{t(s+t)} - \\left( -\\frac{s+t}{st} \\right) = \\frac{s+t}{st} - \\frac{s}{t(s+t)}$\n$C = \\frac{(s+t)^2 - s^2}{st(s+t)} = \\frac{s^2+2st+t^2-s^2}{st(s+t)} = \\frac{2st+t^2}{st(s+t)} = \\frac{t(2s+t)}{st(s+t)} = \\frac{2s+t}{s(s+t)}$.\n\nThe next step is to analyze the local truncation error, $\\tau_{N}$, defined as the difference between the finite difference approximation and the exact derivative:\n$\\tau_{N} = \\left( A u(x_{N-2}) + B u(x_{N-1}) + C u(x_{N}) \\right) - u'(x_{N})$.\nSince $u \\in C^{3}([0,L])$, we can use Taylor series expansions of $u(x_{N-2})$ and $u(x_{N-1})$ around $x_{N}$:\n$u(x_{N-1}) = u(x_N - s) = u(x_N) - s u'(x_N) + \\frac{s^2}{2} u''(x_N) - \\frac{s^3}{6} u^{(3)}(x_N) + O(s^4)$.\n$u(x_{N-2}) = u(x_N - s - t) = u(x_N) - (s+t) u'(x_N) + \\frac{(s+t)^2}{2} u''(x_N) - \\frac{(s+t)^3}{6} u^{(3)}(x_N) + O((s+t)^4)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\tau_{N}$ and collecting terms by derivatives of $u$ at $x_{N}$:\n$$\\tau_N = u(x_N) (A+B+C) + u'(x_N) (-A(s+t) - Bs - 1) + u''(x_N) \\left( A\\frac{(s+t)^2}{2} + B\\frac{s^2}{2} \\right) - u^{(3)}(x_N) \\left( A\\frac{(s+t)^3}{6} + B\\frac{s^3}{6} \\right) + \\dots$$\nBy construction, the coefficients of $u(x_N)$, $u'(x_N)$, and $u''(x_N)$ are zero.\n- $A+B+C = 0$.\n- $-A(s+t) - Bs = 1$, so the coefficient of $u'(x_N)$ is $1-1=0$.\n- $A(s+t)^2 + Bs^2 = 0$, so the coefficient of $u''(x_N)$ is $0$.\n\nThe leading term of the truncation error is determined by the $u^{(3)}(x_N)$ term:\n$\\tau_{N} = - \\left( A\\frac{(s+t)^3}{6} + B\\frac{s^3}{6} \\right) u^{(3)}(x_N) + \\dots$\nLet's evaluate the coefficient $K = - \\frac{1}{6} \\left( A(s+t)^3 + B s^3 \\right)$:\n$K = - \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ \\frac{s}{t(s+t)} (s+t)^3 - \\frac{s+t}{st} s^3 \\right]$\n$K = - \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ \\frac{s(s+t)^2}{t} - \\frac{s^2(s+t)}{t} \\right]$\nThis can be factored:\n$K = - \\frac{s(s+t)}{6t} \\left[ (s+t) - s \\right]$\n$K = - \\frac{s(s+t)}{6t} [t] = - \\frac{s(s+t)}{6}$.\n\nThus, the truncation error is $\\tau_N = -\\frac{s(s+t)}{6} u^{(3)}(x_N) + \\dots$.\nWe are required to compute the limit $C_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\tau_N}{u^{(3)}(x_N) s^2}$. Substituting the leading term of $\\tau_N$:\n$C_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{-\\frac{s(s+t)}{6} u^{(3)}(x_N)}{u^{(3)}(x_N) s^2}$.\nAssuming $u^{(3)}(x_N) \\neq 0$, we can simplify the expression:\n$C_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{s(s+t)}{6s^2} \\right) = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{s+t}{6s} \\right) = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\left(1 + \\frac{t}{s}\\right) \\right)$.\nThe problem defines the grid ratio as $r = \\frac{s}{t}$. Therefore, $\\frac{t}{s} = \\frac{1}{r}$.\nSubstituting this into the limit expression:\n$C_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\right)$.\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{r}$ approaches $0$. The limit is:\n$C_{\\infty} = -\\frac{1}{6} (1+0) = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion, when divided by $s^2$, will vanish in the limit as $s \\to 0$ and $t \\to 0$, justifying the use of the leading error term for this calculation.",
