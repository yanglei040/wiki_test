This periodicity implies that any grid function $Q_j$ that depends on the solution $u_j$ is also periodic with period $N$, so $Q_{j+N} = Q_j$. A direct consequence for sums over the grid is that for any integer shift $k$, the sum remains invariant:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j+k} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j}$$\nThis is because the set of indices $\\{k, k+1, \\dots, k+N-1\\}$ modulo $N$ is identical to the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, so the sum is merely a reordering of the same terms.\n\nCase 1: Second-order centered difference\nThe semi-discretization is given by:\n$$\\frac{d u_{j}}{dt} = -a \\frac{u_{j+1} - u_{j-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt}$:\n$$\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt} = \\Delta x \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left( -a \\frac{u_{j+1} - u_{j-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\right) = -\\frac{a}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (u_{j+1} - u_{j-1})$$\nWe can split the sum into two parts:\n$$\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt} = -\\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j+1} - \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j-1} \\right)$$\nUsing the property of sums over a periodic grid mentioned above, we have:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j+1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j-1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j}$$\nTherefore, the two sums are equal, and their difference is zero.\n$$\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt} = -\\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j} - \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{j} \\right) = -\\frac{a}{2} \\times 0 = 0$$\n\nCase 2: First-order upwind scheme (for $a0$)\nThe semi-discretization is given in conservative form:\n$$\\frac{d u_{j}}{dt} = -\\frac{F_{j+\\frac{1}{2}} - F_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{a\\,u_{j} - a\\,u_{j-1}}{\\Delta x}$$\nwhere the numerical flux is identified as $F_{j+\\frac{1}{2}} = a\\,u_{j}$.

Let us define an auxiliary grid function $G_j = F_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}$. The sum becomes $-\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (G_{j+1} - G_j)$. The sum evaluates to:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (G_{j+1} - G_j) = (G_1 - G_0) + (G_2 - G_1) + \\dots + (G_N - G_{N-1}) = G_N - G_0$$\nSubstituting back the definition of $G_j$:\n$$\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt} = -(G_N - G_0) = -(F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}} - F_{-\\frac{1}{2}})$$\nThe numerical flux $F_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is a function of $u_j$ and $u_{j+1}$, i.e., $F_{j+\\frac{1}{2}} = F(u_j, u_{j+1})$. Due to the periodicity of the solution $u_{j+N}=u_j$, the numerical flux must also be periodic in its index, i.e., $F_{j+N+\\frac{1}{2}} = F(u_{j+N}, u_{j+N+1}) = F(u_j, u_{j+1}) = F_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nWe apply this periodicity property to relate $F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $F_{-\\frac{1}{2}}$. Setting $j = -1$ in the periodicity relation gives $F_{-1+N+\\frac{1}{2}} = F_{-1+\\frac{1}{2}}$, which simplifies to $F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}} = F_{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nTherefore, the difference is zero:\n$$\\frac{d M_{h}}{dt} = -(F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}} - F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}}) = 0$$\n\nIn conclusion, for all three semi-discretization schemes on a periodic domain, the time derivative of the discrete total mass is exactly zero. This demonstrates that all three schemes are conservative in the discrete sense, mimicking the conservation property of the original partial differential equation $\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_0^L u \\, dx = 0$. The common value for $\\frac{d}{dt} M_{h}(t)$ is $0$.",

The problem provides a specific formula for a preliminary time step, $\\Delta t_{cfl}$, based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions for advection and diffusion:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{cfl} = \\min\\left( C_{\\mathrm{adv}} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}, \\; C_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\nu} \\right).\n$$\nThe terms are considered infinite if their denominators ($|a|$ or $\\nu$) are zero. To ensure the simulation ends exactly at time $T$, the number of steps is fixed as $N_t = \\lceil T/\\Delta t_{cfl} \\rceil$, and a uniform actual time step $\\Delta t = T/N_t$ is used for the integration. This ensures $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{cfl}$, preserving the stability constraints.\n\nThe stability of each simulation run is assessed quantitatively. A run is declared \"stable\" if the maximum discrete $L^2$ norm observed over the entire simulation does not exceed a certain multiple of the initial norm. The discrete $L^2$ norm at time step $n$ is:\n$$\n\\|u^n\\|_2 = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (u_j^n)^2 \\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nThe stability criterion is:\n$$\n\\max_{0 \\le n \\le N_t} \\|u^n\\|_2 \\le G_{\\max} \\|u^0\\|_2,\n$$\nwhere the growth factor is given as $G_{\\max} = 5$. The initial condition is given by $u(x,0) = \\sin(2\\pi x) + 0.1 \\sin(16\\pi x)$, which is evaluated on the grid to provide the initial vector $\\vec{u}^0$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Set parameters $(a, \\nu, N, C_{\\mathrm{adv}}, C_{\\mathrm{diff}}, T)$.\n2.  Compute grid spacing $\\Delta x = 1/N$ and create the grid points $x_j$.\n3.  Generate the initial condition vector $\\vec{u}^0$ by evaluating $u(x_j, 0)$.\n4.  Calculate the initial norm $\\|u^0\\|_2$ and the stability threshold $G_{\\max} \\|u^0\\|_2$.\n5.  Calculate $\\Delta t_{cfl}$ and then the actual time step $\\Delta t = T/\\lceil T/\\Delta t_{cfl} \\rceil$.\n6.  For each scheme (centered and upwind):\n    a. Initialize the solution vector $\\vec{u} = \\vec{u}^0$ and set $\\text{max\\_norm} = \\|u^0\\|_2$.\n    b. Loop $N_t$ times:\n        i.   Compute the right-hand side vector $\\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt}$ using the appropriate finite difference formulas.\n        ii.  Update the solution using the forward Euler step: $\\vec{u} \\leftarrow \\vec{u} + \\Delta t \\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt}$.\n        iii. Calculate the current norm $\\|\\vec{u}\\|_2$ and update $\\text{max\\_norm}$ if necessary. If the solution becomes non-finite, $\\text{max\\_norm}$ becomes infinite.\n    c. Compare the final $\\text{max\\_norm}$ to the threshold to determine stability (True/False).\n7.  Collect the boolean stability results for both schemes and append them to a global list.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for all provided test cases, and the final list of boolean results is formatted as specified. The use of vectorized operations, particularly with periodic shifts, is efficient for implementing the finite differences on the periodic grid.",
