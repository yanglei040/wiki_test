            "problem": "A bank operates $D$ business units, each holding a book of $N$ positions. For regulatory reporting, the bank computes a departmental risk metric for each unit, then aggregates these departmental metrics into a firm-wide figure. Assume the following cost model grounded in basic algorithmic operations:\n\n- For a given department, the local risk computation scans all unordered pairs of positions to evaluate interactions and then performs a constant number of additional linear-time passes for scaling and normalization. Consequently, the worst-case operation count for one department can be bounded above by $a N^{2} + b N + c$ for some positive constants $a$, $b$, and $c$, and is thus $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$.\n\n- After all $D$ departmental metrics are computed, the enterprise aggregator combines them linearly with fixed weights by reading each departmental figure once, applying a constant-time transformation, and summing.

The cost model, $a N^{2} + b N + c$, for pairwise interactions and linear passes is standard in algorithm analysis. It is entirely consistent with the principles of computer science.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary components: the cost functions for the sub-problems, the method of their composition (sequential addition), and the constraints on the variables. A unique, meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. Terminology such as \"un-ordered pairs,\" \"linear-time passes,\" and \"sequentially on a single computational thread\" is unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a straightforward, well-defined exercise in algorithmic analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $T_{dept}(N)$ denote the time taken to compute the risk metric for a single department with $N$ positions. According to the problem statement, this is bounded above by a polynomial in $N$, such that:\n$$T_{dept}(N) \\le a N^{2} + b N + c$$\nwhere $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and $c > 0$ are constants. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ for a single department.\n\nThe bank has $D$ such departments, and they are processed sequentially. The principle of sequential composition dictates that the total time for a sequence of operations is the sum of the times for each individual operation. As there is no reuse of computation across departments, the total time required to process all $D$ departments, which we will call $T_{all\\_depts}(N, D)$, is the sum of the costs for each of the $D$ identical computations.\n$$T_{all\\_depts}(N, D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} T_{dept}(N) = D \\cdot T_{dept}(N)$$\nTherefore, the upper bound for this phase of the computation is:\n$$D \\cdot (a N^{2} + b N + c)$$\n\nFollowing the departmental computations, an enterprise aggregation step is performed. Let the time for this aggregation be $T_{agg}(D)$. The problem states this is bounded above by a linear function of $D$:\n$$T_{agg}(D) \\le k D$$\nwhere $k > 0$ is a constant. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(D)$.\n\nThe overall process consists of the computation for all departments followed by the final aggregation. Applying the principle of sequential composition again, the total time for the firm-wide risk calculation, $T_{total}(N, D)$, is the sum of the times for these two stages. The upper bound on the total time is:\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le T_{all\\_depts}(N, D) + T_{agg}(D)$$\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le D(a N^{2} + b N + c) + k D$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le a D N^{2} + b D N + c D + k D$$\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D$$\n\nTo determine the overall asymptotic time complexity, we must identify the dominant term in this polynomial expression for large values of $N$ and $D$. The terms are $a D N^{2}$, $b D N$, and $(c+k)D$. According to the definition of Big-Oh notation, we need to find constants $C > 0$, $N_{0} \\ge 1$, and $D_{0} \\ge 1$ such that for all $N \\ge N_{0}$ and $D \\ge D_{0}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le C \\cdot g(N, D)$$\nwhere $g(N,D)$ is the simplest function that characterizes the growth rate.\n\nLet us choose $g(N, D) = D N^{2}$. We must demonstrate that $a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\in \\mathcal{O}(D N^{2})$.\nGiven the problem constraints, $N \\ge 1$ and $D \\ge 1$.\nFor $N \\ge 1$, we have $N \\le N^{2}$, and thus $b D N \\le b D N^{2}$.\nSimilarly, for $N \\ge 1$, we have $1 \\le N^{2}$, which implies $D \\le D N^{2}$, and so $(c+k)D \\le (c+k)D N^{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these inequalities back into the expression for the total time:\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le a D N^{2} + b D N^{2} + (c+k)D N^{2}$$\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le (a + b + c + k) D N^{2}$$\nLet $C = a + b + c + k$. Since $a, b, c, k$ are all positive constants, $C$ is also a positive constant. The inequality holds for all $N \\ge 1$ and $D \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, by the formal definition of Big-Oh notation, the total time complexity is bounded above by $C \\cdot D N^{2}$.\n\nThe overall time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(D N^{2})$.",

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the total number of primitive operations required to process a video stream. This is a problem of composing independent workloads. The total workload is the sum of the workloads for each constituent part. In this case, the constituent parts are the individual frames of the video.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of operations required to process a single frame. A single frame is an image of dimensions $W \\times H$ pixels.\nThe total number of pixels in one frame, $N_{\\text{pixels}}$, is the product of its width and height:\n$$N_{\\text{pixels}} = W \\cdot H$$\nThe problem states that for each pixel, the routine performs exactly $c$ primitive operations. Therefore, the total number of operations for a single frame, $O_{\\text{frame}}$, is the product of the number of pixels and the operations per pixel:\n$$O_{\\text{frame}} = N_{\\text{pixels}} \\cdot c = (W \\cdot H) \\cdot c$$\nThe information that the scaling is $\\mathcal{O}(W \\cdot H)$ is consistent with this linear relationship, as $c$ is a constant.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of frames in the video stream. The video duration, $T$, is given as $1$ minute. We must convert this to a consistent unit of time with the frame rate.\n$$T = 1 \\text{ minute} = 60 \\text{ seconds}$$\nThe frame rate, $f$, is given as $30$ frames per second.\n$$f = 30 \\text{ fps}$$\nThe total number of frames, $N_{\\text{frames}}$, is the product of the duration in seconds and the frame rate:\n$$N_{\\text{frames}} = T \\cdot f = 60 \\text{ s} \\cdot 30 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 1800$$\nSo, the pipeline must process $1800$ frames.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of operations for the entire video, $O_{\\text{total}}$. The problem states there is no inter-frame reuse, meaning each frame is an independent computational task. Thus, the total number of operations is the product of the operations per frame and the total number of frames:\n$$O_{\\text{total}} = O_{\\text{frame}} \\cdot N_{\\text{frames}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$O_{\\text{total}} = (W \\cdot H \\cdot c) \\cdot 1800$$\nBy convention, the numerical coefficient is written first. Therefore, the total number of primitive operations is:\n$$O_{\\text{total}} = 1800 W H c$$\nThis is the final, closed-form expression for the total operation count as a function of the given parameters $W$, $H$, and $c$.",
