            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a standard application of dimensional analysis, specifically the Buckingham Pi theorem, to a well-defined physical system. We shall proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find a single independent dimensionless parameter, denoted by $\\Pi$, which is a function of the fundamental frequency $f$, tension $T$, string length $L$, and linear mass density $\\rho_{L}$. The parameter is to be constructed in the form:\n$$ \\Pi = f^{a} T^{b} L^{c} \\rho_{L}^{d} $$\nThe problem specifies a canonical form where the exponent of frequency $f$ is unity. We can set $a=1$ without loss of generality, as any power of a dimensionless group is also dimensionless. The form is thus given as:\n$$ \\Pi = f T^{\\alpha} L^{\\beta} \\rho_{L}^{\\gamma} $$\nFor $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, its dimensional representation in terms of the base dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T_{dim}$) must be $M^{0} L^{0} T_{dim}^{0}$. Note that the symbol for the physical quantity tension is $T$, and the symbol for the dimension of time is also often denoted by $T$. To avoid confusion in the derivation, we will be explicit.\n\nFirst, we must establish the dimensions of each variable in the $M$-$L$-$T_{dim}$ system.\nThe dimension of frequency $f$ is inverse time:\n$$ [f] = T_{dim}^{-1} $$\nThe dimension of tension $T$, which is a force, is mass times acceleration:\n$$ [T] = M L T_{dim}^{-2} $$\nThe dimension of length $L$ is a base dimension:\n$$ [L] = L $$\nThe dimension of linear mass density $\\rho_{L}$ is mass per unit length:\n$$ [\\rho_{L}] = M L^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we enforce the condition that $\\Pi$ must be dimensionless.

The mode number $n$ is a dimensionless integer. Viscosity and surface tension are stated to be negligible. The functional relationship is $\\omega_n = f(L, h, g, \\rho, n)$.\n\nThe dimensions of these variables in a Mass-Length-Time ($M, L, T$) system are:\n- Angular frequency: $[\\omega_n] = T^{-1}$\n- Length: $[L] = L$\n- Depth: $[h] = L$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $[g] = LT^{-2}$\n- Density: $[\\rho] = ML^{-3}$\n- Mode number: $[n]$ is dimensionless.\n\nWe have $5$ variables and $3$ fundamental dimensions ($M, L, T$). According to the Buckingham Pi theorem, there will be $5 - 3 = 2$ dimensionless groups ($\\Pi$ groups). We select $\\{L, g\\}$ as repeating variables. Note that $\\rho$ cannot be part of a dimensionless group with only $\\{L, g\\}$ as it is the only variable with mass dimension, thus it must not influence the final relation for frequency. Let's verify this formally by including $\\rho$ in the repeating set $\\{L, g, \\rho\\}$.\n\nThe first dimensionless group, $\\Pi_1$, includes the dependent variable $\\omega_n$:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = \\omega_n L^a g^b \\rho^c $$\nIn dimensional form:\n$$ [\\Pi_1] = (T^{-1}) (L)^a (LT^{-2})^b (ML^{-3})^c = M^c L^{a+b-3c} T^{-1-2b} $$\nFor $\\Pi_1$ to be dimensionless, the exponents must be zero:\n- For $M$: $c=0$. This confirms density $\\rho$ is not a parameter in the final dimensionless relationship.\n- For $T$: $-1-2b=0 \\implies b = -1/2$.\n- For $L$: $a+b-3c=0 \\implies a - 1/2 - 0 = 0 \\implies a = 1/2$.\nThus, the first dimensionless group is $\\Pi_1 = \\omega_n L^{1/2} g^{-1/2} = \\omega_n \\sqrt{L/g}$.

For an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational flow, the velocity field $\\vec{v}$ can be described by a velocity potential $\\phi$ such that $\\vec{v} = \\nabla\\phi$. The continuity equation implies that $\\phi$ must satisfy the Laplace equation within the fluid domain:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial z^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $x$ is the horizontal coordinate ($0 \\le x \\le L$) and $z$ is the vertical coordinate ($-h \\le z \\le 0$ in the linearized approximation).\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  No flow through the rigid bottom: $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} = 0$ at $z=-h$.\n2.  No flow through the rigid sidewalls: $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} = 0$ at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n3.  Combined linearized free surface condition at $z=0$: $\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial t^2} + g \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nWe seek modal solutions of the form $\\phi(x,z,t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{\\phi}(x,z) e^{-i\\omega_n t}\\}$. Substituting this into the governing equation and boundary conditions gives a boundary value problem for the spatial potential $\\hat{\\phi}(x,z)$. The free surface condition becomes:\n$$ \\omega_n^2 \\hat{\\phi} = g \\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\phi}}{\\partial z} \\quad \\text{at} \\quad z=0 $$\n\nUsing separation of variables, let $\\hat{\\phi}(x,z) = X(x)Z(z)$. The Laplace equation separates into $X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$ and $Z''(z) - k^2 Z(z) = 0$.\n\n- The sidewall conditions $X'(0)=0$ and $X'(L)=0$ lead to solutions of the form $X(x) = A \\cos(k_n x)$ with the discrete wavenumbers $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n- The bottom boundary condition $Z'(-h)=0$ leads to the solution $Z(z) = B \\cosh(k_n(z+h))$.\n\nCombining these, the potential for the $n$-th mode is:\n$$ \\hat{\\phi}_n(x, z) = C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}(z+h)\\right) $$\nwhere $C_n$ is a constant.\n\nSubstituting this solution into the free surface condition at $z=0$:\n$$ \\omega_n^2 \\left[ C_n \\cos(k_n x) \\cosh(k_n h) \\right] = g \\left[ C_n \\cos(k_n x) k_n \\sinh(k_n h) \\right] $$\nCanceling common terms, we obtain the dispersion relation for sloshing modes:\n$$ \\omega_n^2 = g k_n \\tanh(k_n h) $$\nSubstituting $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$:\n$$ \\omega_n^2 = g \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi h}{L}\\right) $$\n\n**3. The Nondimensional Scaling Law**\n\nWe can now find the explicit form for the nondimensional frequency $\\Omega_n = \\omega_n \\sqrt{L/g}$.\n$$ \\Omega_n^2 = \\omega_n^2 \\frac{L}{g} = \\left[ g \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi h}{L}\\right) \\right] \\frac{L}{g} = n\\pi \\tanh\\left(n\\pi \\frac{h}{L}\\right) $$\nTaking the square root, we arrive at the final nondimensional scaling law:\n$$ \\Omega_n = \\sqrt{n\\pi \\tanh\\left(n\\pi \\frac{h}{L}\\right)} $$\nThis provides the explicit form of the function $F$ from our dimensional analysis. The nondimensional frequency depends only on the mode number $n$ and the aspect ratio $h/L$.\n\n**4. Computation of Test Cases**\n\nThe problem requires calculating the fundamental nondimensional frequency $\\Omega_1$, for which $n=1$. The formula is:\n$$ \\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh\\left(\\pi \\frac{h}{L}\\right)} $$\nThis confirms that $\\Omega_1$ depends only on the aspect ratio $h/L$. The specific values of $L, h, g$ are only needed to calculate this ratio or would be needed to find the dimensional frequency $\\omega_1$.\n\n- **Test Case 1:** $(L, h, g, n) = (1.0, 0.1, 9.81, 1)$\n  $h/L = 0.1 / 1.0 = 0.1$.\n  $\\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(\\pi \\times 0.1)} \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(0.314159)} \\approx 0.977573$.\n\n- **Test Case 2:** $(L, h, g, n) = (1.0, 1.0, 9.81, 1)$\n  $h/L = 1.0 / 1.0 = 1.0$.\n  $\\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(\\pi \\times 1.0)} = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(\\pi)} \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi (0.996272)} \\approx 1.769138$.\n\n- **Test Case 3:** $(L, h, g, n) = (1.0, 5.0, 9.81, 1)$\n  $h/L = 5.0 / 1.0 = 5.0$. This is the deep water limit, as $\\pi h/L \\gg 1$.\n  In this limit, $\\tanh(\\pi h/L) \\to 1$, so $\\Omega_1 \\to \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n  $\\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(5\\pi)} \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi(1.0)} \\approx 1.772454$.\n\n- **Test Case 4:** $(L, h, g, n) = (2.0, 0.2, 9.81, 1)$\n  $h/L = 0.2 / 2.0 = 0.1$.\n  This aspect ratio is identical to Test Case 1. By the principle of similarity, the nondimensional frequency must be the same.\n  $\\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(\\pi \\times 0.1)} \\approx 0.977573$.\n\n- **Test Case 5:** $(L, h, g, n) = (1.0, 0.1, 3.711, 1)$\n  $h/L = 0.1 / 1.0 = 0.1$.\n  This aspect ratio is also identical to Test Case 1. The different value of $g$ does not affect the nondimensional frequency $\\Omega_1$.\n  $\\Omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\pi \\tanh(\\pi \\times 0.1)} \\approx 0.977573$.\n\nThe calculated values are aggregated as required.",
