For a length-$N$ complex-valued sequence $x = \\{x_n\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) $X = \\{X_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ is defined by\n$$\nX_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\, e^{-2\\pi i \\, k n / N} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0,1,\\dots,N-1,\n$$\nand the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is defined by\n$$\nx_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \\, e^{+2\\pi i \\, k n / N} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0,1,\\dots,N-1,\n$$\nwhere all angles are in radians.\n\nWrite a complete program that, without calling any library Fourier transform routines, computes the DFT and IDFT for sequences of length $N = 2^m$. Your program must also verify the following fundamental properties against explicit test cases using only these definitions:\n\n- Circular convolution theorem: For sequences $a$ and $b$ of length $N$, their length-$N$ circular convolution $c$ defined by $c_n = \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} a_m \\, b_{(n-m) \\bmod N}$ satisfies $C_k = A_k B_k$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the DFTs of $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively.\n- Parseval identity (with the above normalization): $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x_n|^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_k|^2$.\n\nYour program must implement its own fast algorithm to compute the DFT and IDFT for $N = 2^m$, and must include a direct O(N^2) DFT for verification. Use a numerical tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$ where boolean validations are required. All angles must be interpreted in radians.\n\nUse the following test suite, and produce the outputs in the order given below:\n\n- Test $1$ (DFT correctness versus direct DFT, happy path): Let $N = 8$ and $x = [0,1,2,3,4,3,2,1]$. Compute $X$ using your fast implementation and $\\tilde{X}$ using the direct DFT. Output a boolean equal to $\\text{True}$ if $\\max_k |X_k - \\tilde{X}_k| \\le \\varepsilon$, otherwise $\\text{False}$.\n- Test $2$ (Inverse transform recovery): Using the same $N$ and $x$ as in Test $1$, compute $x'$ by applying your IDFT to $X$ from your fast implementation. Output a boolean equal to $\\text{True}$ if $\\max_n |x'_n - x_n| \\le \\varepsilon$, otherwise $\\text{False}$.\n- Test $3$ (Circular convolution via frequency domain): Let $N = 8$, $a = [1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]$, and $b = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]$. Compute the length-$N$ circular convolution $c$ directly from its definition. Separately, compute $\\hat{c}$ by taking the DFTs of $a$ and $b$, multiplying pointwise, and applying the IDFT.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed and scientifically sound exercise in computational physics, specifically in the area of signal processing. It requires the implementation and verification of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), its inverse (IDFT), and fundamental associated theorems. The problem is complete, objective, and its resolution is verifiable. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is the computation of the DFT, $X$, for a given discrete, complex-valued sequence, $x = \\{x_n\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$, of length $N$. The definition is given as:\n$$\nX_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\, e^{-2\\pi i \\, k n / N} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0,1,\\dots,N-1.\n$$\nA direct implementation of this formula involves two nested loops, one for each index $k$ from $0$ to $N-1$ and one for each index $n$ from $0$ to $N-1$. This leads to a computational complexity of O(N^2), which is inefficient for large $N$. For verification purposes, such a direct method will be implemented.\n\nThe problem specifies that $N$ is a power of two, i.e., $N = 2^m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. This structure is key for employing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, specifically the Cooley-Tukey decimation-in-time algorithm. This algorithm reduces the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N). The principle is one of divide and conquer. The length-$N$ DFT is recursively broken down into two length-$(N/2)$ DFTs.\n\nLet the sequence $x_n$ be split into its even-indexed elements, forming a sequence $x'_m = x_{2m}$, and its odd-indexed elements, forming a sequence $x''_m = x_{2m+1}$, each of length $N/2$. The DFT sum can be rewritten as:\n$$\nX_k = \\sum_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x_{2m} e^{-2\\pi i k (2m) / N} + \\sum_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x_{2m+1} e^{-2\\pi i k (2m+1) / N}\n$$\n$$\nX_k = \\sum_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x'_m e^{-2\\pi i k m / (N/2)} + e^{-2\\pi i k/N} \\sum_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x''_m e^{-2\\pi i k m / (N/2)}\n$$\nLet $X'_k$ and $X''_k$ be the length-$(N/2)$ DFTs of $x'_m$ and $x''_m$, respectively. The expressions above become:\n$$\nX_k = X'_{k \\bmod (N/2)} + W_N^k X''_{k \\bmod (N/2)}\n$$\nwhere $W_N^k = e^{-2\\pi i k/N}$ is the \"twiddle factor\". For $k$ in the first half of the indices, $0 \\le k < N/2$, we have:\n$$\nX_k = X'_k + W_N^k X''_k\n$$\nFor the second half, where the index is $k+N/2$ for $0 \\le k < N/2$, we use the properties $X'_{k+N/2} = X'_k$, $X''_{k+N/2} = X''_k$, and $W_N^{k+N/2} = -W_N^k$. This yields:\n$$\nX_{k+N/2} = X'_k - W_N^k X''_k\n$$\nThis recursive definition allows the construction of the full DFT. The recursion terminates at the base case $N=1$, where the DFT of a sequence $\\{x_0\\}$ is simply $\\{X_0\\} = \\{x_0\\}$. Our implementation will follow this recursive structure.\n\nThe Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is defined as:\n$$\nx_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \\, e^{+2\\pi i \\, k n / N}\n$$\nA separate implementation is not necessary. We can relate the IDFT to the forward DFT. Observe the following derivation:\n$$\nN \\cdot \\overline{x_n} = \\overline{\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k e^{+2\\pi i k n / N}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\overline{X_k} e^{-2\\pi i k n / N}\n$$\nThe right-hand side is the DFT of the complex-conjugated sequence $\\{\\overline{X_k}\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$. Therefore, we can find $x_n$ by computing the DFT of $\\overline{X}$, taking the complex conjugate of the result, and scaling by $1/N$. That is, $x = \\frac{1}{N} \\overline{\\text{DFT}(\\overline{X})}$. This allows us to use our efficient FFT implementation to compute the inverse transform (IFFT) as well.\n\nThe problem further requires verification of two fundamental theorems.\n\nFirst, the circular convolution theorem. The circular convolution $c$ of two length-$N$ sequences, $a$ and $b$, is given by $c_n = \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} a_m b_{(n-m) \\bmod N}$. The theorem states that the DFT of the convolution is the pointwise product of the individual DFTs: $C_k = A_k B_k$. Thus, one can compute $c$ via the frequency domain: $c = \\text{IDFT}(\\text{DFT}(a) \\odot \\text{DFT}(b))$, where $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. We will test this by computing $c$ both directly and via the frequency domain route and comparing the results.\n\nSecond, Parseval's identity. For the given DFT normalization, the identity is:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x_n|^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_k|^2\n$$\nThis theorem relates the total energy of a signal in the time domain to its energy in the frequency domain. We will verify this for a specific test signal.\n\nThe program will proceed by first defining the necessary functions: a direct O(N^2) DFT, a recursive O(N log N) FFT, an IFFT based on the FFT, and a direct circular convolution function. Then, it will execute the six specified test cases using these functions and a numerical tolerance of $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$ for comparisons. The results will be collected and printed in the required format.",

            "problem": "Consider the discrete-time complex sinusoid and its Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) under a rectangular time window.

We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as required: first, a theoretical derivation of the scalloping ratio, and second, an explanation of the numerical implementation to verify this theory and compute related error metrics.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Theoretical Scalloping Ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}}$**\n\nThe derivation starts from the definition of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The signal is a complex sinusoid sampled over a finite interval, which constitutes an implicit rectangular window.\n\nThe discrete-time signal is defined as $x[n] = A \\exp\\left(j \\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_0}{F_s} n + \\varphi\\right)\\right)$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nThe DFT, $X[k]$, is defined as:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\exp\\left(-j 2\\pi \\frac{kn}{N}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x[n]$:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} A e^{j\\varphi} \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\frac{f_0}{F_s} n\\right) \\exp\\left(-j 2\\pi \\frac{kn}{N}\\right)$$\nWe can factor out the constant term $A e^{j\\varphi}$ and combine the exponentials:\n$$X[k] = A e^{j\\varphi} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left[\\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_0}{F_s} - \\frac{k}{N}\\right)\\right)\\right]^n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r^n$, where the common ratio is $r = \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_0}{F_s} - \\frac{k}{N}\\right)\\right)$. Using the identity for the sum of a geometric series, $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} r^n = \\frac{1-r^N}{1-r}$, which holds for $r \\neq 1$:\n$$X[k] = A e^{j\\varphi} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_0}{F_s} - \\frac{k}{N}\\right) N\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_0}{F_s} - \\frac{k}{N}\\right)\\right)} = A e^{j\\varphi} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{Nf_0}{F_s} - k\\right)\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} \\left(\\frac{Nf_0}{F_s} - k\\right)\\right)}$$\nTo find the magnitude $|X[k]|$, we use the identity $|1 - e^{j\\theta}| = |e^{j\\theta/2}(e^{-j\\theta/2} - e^{j\\theta/2})| = |-2j e^{j\\theta/2}\\sin(\\theta/2)| = 2|\\sin(\\theta/2)|$.

Now, we specialize to the case where the frequency $f_0$ is exactly halfway between two adjacent DFT bins, $k_0$ and $k_0+1$: $f_0 = \\left(k_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{F_s}{N}$.\nThe term $\\frac{Nf_0}{F_s} - k$ becomes $k_0 + \\frac{1}{2} - k$.\nThe argument of the sine in the numerator is $\\pi \\left(k_0 - k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Since $k_0-k$ is an integer, let it be $m$. The argument is $m\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The sine of this angle is $\\sin(m\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(m\\pi) = (-1)^m$. Thus, its magnitude is always $1$.\nThe expression for the magnitude simplifies to:\n$$|X[k]| = \\frac{A}{\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N} \\left(k_0 - k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right|}$$\nThe scalloping ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}}$ compares the largest DFT magnitude at this half-bin offset to the on-bin magnitude. The on-bin magnitude is the value of $|X[k_0]|$ if the signal frequency were exactly on a bin, i.e., $f_0 = f_{k_0} = k_0\\frac{F_s}{N}$. In this on-bin case, the ratio $r$ for $k=k_0$ becomes $1$, and the geometric sum evaluates to $N$. The DFT is $X[k_0] = A e^{j\\varphi} N$, so the reference magnitude is $|X[k_0]|_{\\mathrm{on-bin}} = AN$.\n\nFor the half-bin case, the largest magnitude, $\\max_k |X[k]|$, occurs when the denominator $\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N} \\left(k_0 - k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right|$ is minimized. This happens when the argument is closest to $0$. This occurs for $k = k_0$ and $k = k_0+1$.\nFor $k=k_0$, the argument is $\\frac{\\pi}{2N}$.\nFor $k=k_0+1$, the argument is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2N}$.\nIn both cases, the denominator's magnitude is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2N}\\right)$ (assuming $N \\ge 2$, so the argument is in $(0, \\pi/2)$).\nThe largest DFT bin magnitude is therefore $\\max_k |X[k]| = \\frac{A}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2N}\\right)}$.\n\nFinally, the theoretical scalloping ratio is the ratio of these two magnitudes:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}} = \\frac{\\max_k |X[k]|_{\\mathrm{half-bin}}}{|X[k_0]|_{\\mathrm{on-bin}}} = \\frac{A / \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2N}\\right)}{AN} = \\frac{1}{N \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2N}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}}$ as a function of $N$ only. For large $N$, using the approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ for small $x$, we find $\\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}} \\approx \\frac{1}{N(\\pi/2N)} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 0.6366$, which is the classic scalloping loss figure for a rectangular window.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe provided program implements the computations specified in the problem statement for four test cases.\nFor each case $(N, F_s, k_0, A, \\varphi)$:\n$1$. The signal frequency $f_0$ is set to $f_0 = (k_0 + 0.5) \\frac{F_s}{N}$.\n$2$. The complex-valued signal $x[n]$ is generated for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n$3$. The DFT is computed using two methods:\n    a) A direct summation with $O(N^2)$ complexity, implemented via a matrix-vector product $X_{\\mathrm{direct}} = \\mathbf{W}x$, where $\\mathbf{W}$ is the $N \\times N$ DFT matrix with entries $W_{kn} = \\exp(-j2\\pi kn/N)$.\n    b) The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, using `numpy.fft.fft`, which computes the same DFT with $O(N \\log N)$ complexity.\n$4$. The following quantities are calculated:\n    a) The measured scalloping ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{\\max_k |X_{\\mathrm{FFT}}[k]|}{AN}$. We use the FFT result as it is the standard computational tool.\n    b) The absolute error $|\\rho_{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{theory}}|$, which quantifies the agreement between our derived theory and the numerical computation. This should be close to machine precision.\n    c) The two-bin symmetry error $\\left|\\frac{|X_{\\mathrm{FFT}}[k_0]|}{|X_{\\mathrm{FFT}}[k_0+1]|} - 1\\right|$. Our derivation shows these two magnitudes should be identical, so this error measures the numerical symmetry of the computed spectrum.\n    d) The normalized infinity-norm difference $\\frac{\\max_k |X_{\\mathrm{direct}}[k] - X_{\\mathrm{FFT}}[k]|}{A N}$. This metric quantifies the numerical discrepancy between the two DFT computation methods, which arises from different orderings of floating-point operations and resultant round-off error accumulation.\n\nThe program then aggregates these three scalar error metrics for each of the four test cases into a single flat list of $12$ values for the final output.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fourier analysis, mathematically well-posed, and objectively specified. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary definitions, constants, and parameters provided for a unique and verifiable solution. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the normalized Gibbs deviation, $G_K$, for a truncated Fourier series reconstruction of a periodic square wave. The procedure involves several distinct steps which will be executed for each provided test case $(N, K)$.\n\nStep 1: Signal Generation\nFirst, we construct the discrete-time signal $s[n]$ for a given length $N$, which is specified to be an even integer. The signal represents one period of a square wave. Its definition is:\n$$\ns[n] =\n\\begin{cases}\n+1, & 0 \\le n < N/2,\\\\\n-1, & N/2 \\le n < N.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis sequence is real-valued and has a length of $N$ samples, indexed from $n=0$ to $n=N-1$.\n\nStep 2: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\nNext, we compute the DFT of the signal $s[n]$ to obtain its frequency-domain representation, $X[k]$. The DFT is defined as:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} s[n] \\, e^{-i 2\\pi nk/N}\n$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. For computational efficiency, this transform will be implemented using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is appropriate as the values of $N$ in the test suite are powers of two.\n\nStep 3: Spectrum Truncation\nA truncated version of the spectrum is created according to the integer bandwidth parameter $K$. A new spectral sequence, which we can denote $X_K[k]$, is formed by preserving the coefficients of $X[k]$ for indices $k$ within the set $\\mathcal{S}_K$ and setting all other coefficients to zero. The index set $\\mathcal{S}_K$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_K = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1,2,\\dots,K\\} \\cup \\{N-K, N-K+1, \\dots, N-1\\}\n$$\nThis set includes the DC component ($k=0$), the first $K$ positive frequency components ($k=1, \\dots, K$), and the corresponding $K$ negative frequency components ($k=N-K, \\dots, N-1$), which are necessary to ensure the reconstructed signal is real-valued. Thus, $X_K[k]$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_K[k] =\n\\begin{cases}\nX[k], & k \\in \\mathcal{S}_K,\\\\\n0, & k \\notin \\mathcal{S}_K.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Signal Reconstruction\nThe truncated signal, $x_K[n]$, is synthesized by computing the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of the truncated spectrum $X_K[k]$. The IDFT formula is:\n$$\nx_K[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_K[k] \\, e^{i 2\\pi nk/N}\n$$\nSimilar to the forward transform, an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithm will be used for efficiency. Since the original signal $s[n]$ is real and the truncated spectrum $X_K[k]$ is constructed with conjugate symmetry (i.e., $X_K[k] = X_K[N-k]^*$), the resulting signal $x_K[n]$ will be real-valued, although minor imaginary components may arise from floating-point inaccuracies and should be discarded.\n\nStep 5: Gibbs Deviation Calculation\nFinally, we quantify the Gibbs phenomenon by calculating the normalized Gibbs deviation $G_K$. This requires finding the maximum and minimum values of the reconstructed signal $x_K[n]$ over one period:\n$$\nM_K = \\max_{0 \\le n \\le N-1} x_K[n]\n$$\n$$\nm_K = \\min_{0 \\le n \\le N-1} x_K[n]\n$$\nThe problem provides the high plateau level $A_{\\text{high}} = +1$, the low plateau level $A_{\\text{low}} = -1$, and the jump magnitude $J = A_{\\text{high}} - A_{\\text{low}} = 2$. The normalized Gibbs deviation $G_K$ is the maximum of the normalized overshoot and undershoot:\n$$\nG_K = \\max\\left( \\frac{\\max(0, M_K - A_{\\text{high}})}{J}, \\; \\frac{\\max(0, A_{\\text{low}} - m_K)}{J} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, this becomes:\n$$\nG_K = \\max\\left( \\frac{\\max(0, M_K - 1)}{2}, \\; \\frac{\\max(0, -1 - m_K)}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each $(N, K)$ pair specified in the test suite, and the resulting values of $G_K$ are rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.",
