A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe total computational work, $T(N)$, is the sum of the costs of the five stages of the FMM algorithm. We will analyze the cost of each stage as a function of $N$.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the hierarchical tree structure. The source and target points are distributed on line segments of length $1$. The point density is $\\rho = N/1 = N$. The domain is partitioned dyadically, meaning each box is split into $2$ child boxes. The number of boxes at level $l$ of the tree is $2^l$. The tree recursion stops at the leaf level, $L$, when the number of points in a box is approximately $n_{0}$. A box at level $l$ has length $2^{-l}$. The number of points in a box at level $L$ is $\\rho \\cdot 2^{-L} = N \\cdot 2^{-L}$. The leaf condition is $N \\cdot 2^{-L} \\lesssim n_{0}$, which implies $2^L \\gtrsim N/n_{0}$. The depth of the tree is therefore $L = \\Theta(\\log N)$.\n\nThe total number of boxes in the tree is the sum of boxes over all levels from $l=0$ to $l=L$:\n$$\n\\text{Total boxes} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L} 2^l = 2^{L+1} - 1 = \\Theta(2^L)\n$$\nSince $2^L = \\Theta(N)$, the total number of boxes in the tree is $\\Theta(N)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the cost of each FMM stage:\n\n1.  **S2M (Source-to-Multipole) Cost**: This operation is performed for each of the $N$ source points to form the multipole expansions in the leaf boxes.\n    - Cost per source is $c_{\\mathrm{S2M}}\\,p$.\n    - Total S2M cost: $T_{\\mathrm{S2M}} = N \\cdot (c_{\\mathrm{S2M}}\\,p)$.\n    - Since $c_{\\mathrm{S2M}}$ and $p$ are constants, $T_{\\mathrm{S2M}} = \\Theta(N)$.\n\n2.  **M2M (Multipole-to-Multipole) Cost**: This constitutes the upward pass of the FMM. At each level $l$ from $L-1$ down to $0$, the multipole expansion of each parent box is computed from the expansions of its children. This operation is performed once for every non-leaf box.\n    - Number of non-leaf boxes is $\\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} 2^l = 2^L-1 = \\Theta(N)$.\n    - Cost per M2M translation is $c_{\\mathrm{M2M}}\\,p^2$.\n    - Total M2M cost: $T_{\\mathrm{M2M}} = \\Theta(N) \\cdot (c_{\\mathrm{M2M}}\\,p^2) = \\Theta(N)$.\n\n3.  **M2L (Multipole-to-Local) Cost**: This is the translation of multipole expansions from well-separated source boxes to local expansions for target boxes. This occurs at every level of the tree.\n    - At any level $l$, there are $2^l$ target boxes.\n    - The problem states that the interaction list for any target box contains at most $q$ source boxes, where $q$ is a constant.\n    - The number of M2L translations at level $l$ is therefore at most $q \\cdot 2^l$.\n    - The cost per M2L translation is $c_{\\mathrm{M2L}}\\,p^2$.\n    - Total M2L cost is the sum over all levels $l=0, \\dots, L$:\n      $$\n      T_{\\mathrm{M2L}} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L} (\\text{Num. target boxes at level }l) \\cdot (\\text{Avg. interaction list size}) \\cdot (\\text{Cost per translation})\n      $$\n      $$\n      T_{\\mathrm{M2L}} \\leq \\sum_{l=0}^{L} (2^l \\cdot q \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{M2L}}\\,p^2) = (q \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{M2L}}\\,p^2) \\sum_{l=0}^{L} 2^l = (q \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{M2L}}\\,p^2) (2^{L+1}-1)\n      $$\n    - Since $p$, $q$, and $c_{\\mathrm{M2L}}$ are constants and $2^L = \\Theta(N)$, the total M2L cost is $T_{\\mathrm{M2L}} = \\Theta(N)$.\n\n4.  **L2L (Local-to-Local) Cost**: This constitutes the downward pass. At each level $l$ from $1$ to $L$, the local expansion for each box is computed from its parent's local expansion. This is performed for every non-root box.\n    - Number of non-root boxes is $\\sum_{l=1}^{L} 2^l = 2^{L+1}-2 = \\Theta(N)$.\n    - Cost per L2L translation is $c_{\\mathrm{L2L}}\\,p^2$.\n    - Total L2L cost: $T_{\\mathrm{L2L}} = \\Theta(N) \\cdot (c_{\\mathrm{L2L}}\\,p^2) = \\Theta(N)$.\n\n5.  **L2T (Local-to-Target) Cost**: This final operation evaluates the local expansion at each of the $N$ target point locations. This happens in the leaf boxes.\n    - Cost per target is $c_{\\mathrm{L2T}}\\,p$.\n    - Total L2T cost: $T_{\\mathrm{L2T}} = N \\cdot (c_{\\mathrm{L2T}}\\,p)$.\n    - As $c_{\\mathrm{L2T}}$ and $p$ are constants, $T_{\\mathrm{L2T}} = \\Theta(N)$.\n\nThe total computational work $T(N)$ is the sum of the costs of these five stages:\n$$\nT(N) = T_{\\mathrm{S2M}} + T_{\\mathrm{M2M}} + T_{\\mathrm{M2L}} + T_{\\mathrm{L2L}} + T_{\\mathrm{L2T}}\n$$\n$$\nT(N) = \\Theta(N) + \\Theta(N) + \\Theta(N) + \\Theta(N) + \\Theta(N) = \\Theta(N)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the total work scales as $T(N) = \\Theta(N^{\\alpha})$. By comparing this with our derived result, we have:\n$$\n\\Theta(N^{\\alpha}) = \\Theta(N^1)\n$$\nThis implies that the exponent $\\alpha$ must be $1$.",

            "problem": "Implement a complete program that, for several specified point sets on a line with scalar source strengths, approximates the logarithmic potential generated by these sources at the source locations themselves using a hierarchical expansion scheme based on the Taylor series of the logarithmic kernel and compares it to the direct summation. Let the potential at the target index $i$ be defined by\n$$\nS_i = \\sum_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j \\ne i}}^{N} q_j \\,\\log\\!\\left|x_i - x_j\\right|,\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of sources, $x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are source locations on the real line, and $q_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are source strengths.\n\nYour program must compute an approximation $S^{(\\mathrm{approx})}_i$ using a hierarchical partition of the bounding interval into a binary tree with box centers $c$ and half-lengths $a$, truncating the Taylor series of the kernel $\\log|x - x'|$ to order $p$ about box centers. For a box with center $c$ that is well separated from a target at position $x$, you must use the truncated multipole expansion based on the Taylor expansion of $\\log|x - x'|$:\n$$\n\\log|x - x'| = \\log|x - c| + \\log\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{x' - c}{x - c}\\right),\n$$\nwhich yields, for $\\left|x' - c\\right| < \\left|x - c\\right|$,\n$$\n\\log|x - x'| = \\log|x - c| - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\frac{(x' - c)^n}{(x - c)^n}.\n$$\nTruncate at order $p$ by defining the box moments\n$$\nM_n = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{box}} q_j (x_j - c)^n,\\quad n=0,1,\\dots,p,\n$$\nso that the contribution from that box to a target at $x$ is approximated by\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{box}}(x) \\approx M_0 \\,\\log|x - c| - \\sum_{n=1}^{p} \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\frac{M_n}{(x - c)^n}.\n$$\n\nTo construct moments at parent boxes from children, use the binomial translation identity to re-express moments about the parent center $c_{\\text{par}}$ in terms of child moments about $c_{\\text{ch}}$:\n$$\nM_n^{(\\text{par})} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\,(c_{\\text{ch}} - c_{\\text{par}})^{\\,n-k}\\, M_k^{(\\text{ch})},\\quad n=0,1,\\dots,p.\n$$\n\nDefine the well-separation acceptance criterion as follows: for a box with center $c$ and half-length $a$, a target at $x$ is well separated from the box if\n$$\n|x - c| \\ge \\lambda\\, a,\n$$\nwith $\\lambda = 2$. If the criterion is satisfied, approximate the contribution of all sources in the box to the target using the truncated expansion as above. If the criterion is not satisfied and the box is not a leaf, refine to its children. If the criterion is not satisfied and the box is a leaf, evaluate the contribution from all sources in the leaf directly, excluding self-interaction when $x$ coincides with a source location in that leaf.

            "solution": "The problem posed is to implement and validate a one-dimensional hierarchical fast multipole-like method for computing logarithmic potentials. This is a standard problem in computational science, designed to reduce the computational complexity of N-body problems from the naive $O(N^2)$ scaling of direct summation to approximately $O(N)$. The problem statement is scientifically sound, mathematically consistent, and provides all necessary parameters and formulae. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe core principle of this method is the hierarchical decomposition of the problem domain and the use of series expansions to approximate the influence of distant source clusters. We shall proceed by first establishing the theoretical and algorithmic framework, then presenting the implementation.\n\n**1. Hierarchical Space Decomposition**\n\nThe foundation of the method is a binary tree structure that recursively partitions the one-dimensional domain containing the sources.\nThe process begins with a single root \"box\" that represents an interval $[c-a, c+a]$ enclosing all $N$ source points $\\{x_j\\}$. Here, $c$ is the center and $a$ is the half-length of the interval. This root box is at level $0$ of the tree.\n\nA box at any level is subdivided into two child boxes of equal half-length if it contains more than a prescribed maximum number of points, $L$ (the leaf capacity), and if the maximum tree depth, $D$, has not been reached. For a parent box with center $c$ and half-length $a$, its two children will have centers $c - a/2$ and $c + a/2$, and both will have a half-length of $a/2$. This subdivision process continues recursively, generating a tree structure. A box that is not subdivided is termed a \"leaf\" box.\n\n**2. Upward Pass: Multipole Moment Computation**\n\nAfter constructing the tree, we perform an \"upward pass\" from the leaves to the root to compute multipole moments for each box. A multipole expansion provides a compact representation of the source distribution within a box as viewed from a distant point. The moments are coefficients in this expansion.\n\nFor a leaf box with center $c$, the moments $M_n$ of order $n=0, 1, \\ldots, p$ are computed directly from the source points $\\{x_j\\}$ and their strengths $\\{q_j\\}$ contained within that box:\n$$\nM_n = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{box}} q_j (x_j - c)^n\n$$\nFor a non-leaf (parent) box, its moments are not computed directly from sources. Instead, they are synthesized from the already-computed moments of its children. This is achieved via a moment-to-moment (M2M) translation. If a child box with center $c_{\\text{ch}}$ has moments $\\{M_k^{(\\text{ch})}\\}$, these can be re-expressed as a series about the parent's center $c_{\\text{par}}$. The formula for the translated moments is derived from the binomial expansion of $(x_j - c_{\\text{par}})^n = ((x_j - c_{\\text{ch}}) + (c_{\\text{ch}} - c_{\\text{par}}))^n$. Summing over all sources in the child box yields the contribution to the parent moments:\n$$\nM_n^{(\\text{par})} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (c_{\\text{ch}} - c_{\\text{par}})^{n-k} M_k^{(\\text{ch})}\n$$\nThe total moments for the parent box are the sum of the translated moments from both of its children. This process is applied recursively from the leaves upward, ensuring that every box in the tree has a complete set of multipole moments $\\{M_n\\}_{n=0}^p$.\n\n**3. Downward Pass: Potential Evaluation**\n\nThe potential $S_i$ at each target location $x_i$ is computed in a \"downward pass\" by traversing the tree from the root. For a given target $x_i$, the algorithm decides at each node whether to use a multipole approximation for the box's contribution or to refine the calculation by descending to its children.\n\nThis decision is governed by a well-separation criterion. A box with center $c$ and half-length $a$ is considered well-separated (i.e., in the \"far-field\") from a target point $x_i$ if the distance to its center is sufficiently large compared to its size:\n$$\n|x_i - c| \\ge \\lambda a\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation parameter, given as $\\lambda=2$.\n\nThe evaluation for a single target $x_i$ proceeds as follows, starting with the root box:\n1.  **Far-Field interaction**: If the current box is well-separated from $x_i$, its contribution to the potential at $x_i$ is approximated using the $p$-th order truncated multipole expansion. The formula is derived from the Taylor series of the logarithmic kernel $\\log|x_i - x'|$ around the box center $c$. The contribution is:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{\\text{box}}(x_i) \\approx M_0 \\log|x_i - c| - \\sum_{n=1}^{p} \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{M_n}{(x_i - c)^n}\n    $$\n    This is a multipole-to-point (M2P) calculation. The traversal along this branch of the tree terminates.\n\n2.  **Near-Field interaction**: If the box is not well-separated from $x_i$, we must refine the calculation.\n    *   If the box is not a leaf, the algorithm recursively descends to its two children, and the contributions from each child are summed.\n    *   If the box is a leaf, a multipole approximation is no longer accurate. The contribution from the sources within this leaf must be computed by direct summation. For each source $x_j$ in the leaf, its exact contribution $q_j \\log|x_i - x_j|$ is added to the total potential, carefully excluding the self-interaction term where $j=i$.\n\nThe total potential $S_i^{(\\mathrm{approx})}$ is the sum of all contributions from the far-field multipole approximations and the near-field direct summations. This entire process is repeated for every target point $x_i$. The efficiency of this hierarchical method arises from aggregating the influence of many distant sources into a single, inexpensive multipole calculation, thereby avoiding the costly pairwise sums of the direct method.",
