This exercise provides a practical and crucial lesson on the boundaries of this power. You will implement a Fourier-based solver for the simple Poisson equation $u''(x) = f(x)$ and apply it to both a well-behaved periodic problem and problems with non-periodic boundary conditions . By comparing the numerical error in these cases, you will directly observe the Gibbs phenomenon and understand why inappropriately applying a Fourier basis leads to poor accuracy, motivating the need for other spectral methods like those based on Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials.",

This is a fundamental and standard technique in computational science and engineering. The method and principles are well-established. This criterion is met.\n- **Well-Posed**: The continuous boundary value problems (both periodic and Dirichlet) are well-posed. The numerical scheme is also well-posed. The equation for the Fourier coefficients, $-(k_m)^2 \\widehat{u}_m = \\widehat{f}_m$, can be solved for $\\widehat{u}_m$ for all non-zero wavenumbers ($k_m \\neq 0$). The singularity at $k_0 = 0$ is handled by the solvability condition for the periodic Poisson equation (requiring the mean of the forcing term to be zero, which the numerical method enforces) and the imposition of a unique solution by setting the mean of the solution to zero ($\\widehat{u}_0 = 0$). This criterion is met.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and definitions. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology. This criterion is met.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary functions, parameters, and definitions to construct a solution. There are no contradictions in the provided information. This criterion is met.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the solution of the one-dimensional Poisson equation, $u''(x) = f(x)$, on the domain $x \\in (0,1)$ using a Fourier spectral method. The core principle of Fourier spectral methods is the transformation of differential operators into algebraic operators in Fourier space.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function $u(x)$ on a $1$-periodic domain is $$u(x) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\check{u}_m e^{i 2\\pi m x}.$$ Differentiation with respect to $x$ corresponds to multiplication of the $m$-th Fourier coefficient $\\check{u}_m$ by $i 2\\pi m$. Consequently, the second derivative, $u''(x)$, has Fourier coefficients $(- (2\\pi m)^2) \\check{u}_m = -k_m^2 \\check{u}_m$, where $k_m = 2\\pi m$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe prescribed numerical method is a discrete analogue of this principle. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization**: For a given even integer $N$, the domain $[0,1)$ is discretized into an equispaced grid of $N$ points, $x_j = j/N$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$.\n\n2.  **Forcing Term Evaluation**: The forcing function $f(x)$ is evaluated at these grid points to obtain a vector of values $\\mathbf{f} = [f(x_0), f(x_1), \\dots, f(x_{N-1})]^T$.\n\n3.  **Forward Fourier Transform**: The vector $\\mathbf{f}$ is transformed into Fourier space using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), typically implemented via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This yields the vector of discrete Fourier coefficients $\\hat{\\mathbf{f}}$:\n    $$ \\widehat{f}_m = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} f(x_j) e^{-i 2\\pi m j / N} $$\n    The index $m$ corresponds to discrete frequencies which, for a domain of length $L=1$, are integers. Standard numerical libraries provide routines to correctly order these frequencies, typically as $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N/2-1, -N/2, \\dots, -1\\}$.\n\n4.  **Solve in Fourier Space**: The differential equation $u''(x) = f(x)$ becomes an algebraic equation for the discrete Fourier coefficients. The discrete second derivative operator corresponds to multiplication by $-(k_m)^2$, where $k_m$ are the wavenumbers associated with the discrete frequencies $m$. For a domain of length $1$, $k_m = 2\\pi m$. The problem for the coefficients $\\widehat{u}_m$ is:\n    $$ -(k_m)^2 \\widehat{u}_m = \\widehat{f}_m $$\n    This equation is only solved for non-zero modes ($m \\neq 0$), as specified. For the zero-frequency mode ($m=0$), the wavenumber $k_0$ is zero, leading to a singularity. This reflects the fact that the periodic Poisson problem has a solution only if the integral (or discrete sum) of the forcing term is zero. Furthermore, the solution is only unique up to an additive constant. The problem resolves this by specifying that the solution $u_N$ must have a zero mean, which is equivalent to setting its zeroth Fourier coefficient to zero: $\\widehat{u}_0 = 0$.\n    Thus, the vector of solution coefficients $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ is computed as:\n    $$ \\widehat{u}_m = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } m = 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\widehat{f}_m}{k_m^2} & \\text{if } m \\neq 0 \\end{cases} $$\n\n5.  **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The numerical solution in physical space, $u_N(x_j)$, is recovered by applying the Inverse DFT (implemented via IFFT) to the coefficient vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$:\n    $$ u_N(x_j) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \\widehat{u}_m e^{i 2\\pi m j / N} $$\n    Since the original forcing function $f(x)$ is real-valued, the solution $u_N(x_j)$ must also be real. The real part of the IFFT result is taken to discard any negligible imaginary components arising from floating-point arithmetic errors.\n\n6.  **Error Calculation**: The target solution $u_\\star(x)$ is evaluated on the grid $x_j$ to get $\\mathbf{u}_\\star$. The discrete $L^2$ error $E_N$ is then calculated as the Root Mean Square Error between the numerical solution $\\mathbf{u}_N$ and the target solution $\\mathbf{u}_\\star$:\n    $$ E_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (u_N(x_j) - u_\\star(x_j))^2} $$\n\n### Analysis of Test Cases\n- **Case 1**: $f(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$, $u_\\star(x) = -\\sin(2\\pi x)/(2\\pi)^2$, $N = 64$. The function $f(x)$ is a single, $1$-periodic Fourier mode with zero mean. The target solution $u_\\star(x)$ is the exact periodic solution with zero mean. The Fourier spectral method is exact for problems whose solutions are contained within the basis of trigonometric polynomials. As such, the error $E_{64}$ is expected to be near machine precision.\n\n- **Case 2**: $f(x) = -2$, $u_\\star(x) = x(1-x)$, $N = 64$. The target solution $u_\\star(x)$ satisfies the Dirichlet boundary conditions $u_\\star(0) = u_\\star(1) = 0$. However, it is not a $1$-periodic function, as its derivatives at the boundaries do not match: $u'_\\star(0) = 1$ while $u'_\\star(1) = -1$. The spectral method computes a periodic solution $u_N$. The error $u_N - u_\\star$ is dominated by the inability of the periodic trigonometric polynomial to represent the non-periodic target function accurately, especially at the boundaries. This boundary-condition mismatch leads to slow convergence (Gibbs phenomenon), and the error $E_{64}$ will be significant.\n\n- **Case 3**: $f(x) = -\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)$, $u_\\star(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, $N = 64$. This case is analogous to Case 2. The target solution $u_\\star(x)$ satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions but not periodic ones, as $u'_\\star(0) = \\pi \\neq u'_\\star(1) = -\\pi$. A large error is expected for the same reasons.\n\n- **Case 4**: $f(x) = -2$, $u_\\star(x) = x(1-x)$, $N = 128$. This is a grid refinement of Case 2. While the error is expected to be large, increasing $N$ should reduce the error. The rate of error reduction will be algebraic ($\\mathcal{O}(N^{-p})$ for some small $p>0$) rather than the exponential convergence observed for smooth, periodic problems. Comparing the result with Case 2 will show this sub-optimal convergence.",

The corresponding angular frequencies for the $k$-th FFT bin are $\\omega_k = 2\\pi \\nu_k$ where $\\nu_k$ are obtained from the FFT frequency grid $\\nu_k = \\operatorname{fftfreq}(N, \\Delta t)$ with $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{N}$.\n- For each bin, compute the spectral response\n  $$\n  \\hat{y}_k = \\frac{\\hat{f}_k}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_k^2 + i \\, 2 \\zeta \\omega_0 \\omega_k}.\n  $$\n- Inverse transform with the inverse FFT to obtain the grid samples $y_j \\approx y_{\\mathrm{per}}(t_j)$. Because $f(t)$ and the operator are real, the numerical $y_j$ are real up to machine precision; take the real part to remove negligible imaginary components.\n\nAnalytic references for validation:\n- For a single-tone input $f(t) = \\cos(\\omega t)$, the steady-state solution is $y_{\\mathrm{per}}(t) = |H(i\\omega)| \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$, where\n  $$\n  |H(i\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\omega_0 \\omega)^2}}, \\quad \\phi = \\operatorname{atan2}(2 \\zeta \\omega_0 \\omega, \\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2).\n  $$\n  For $f(t) = \\sin(\\omega t)$, equivalently $y_{\\mathrm{per}}(t) = |H(i\\omega)| \\sin(\\omega t - \\phi)$.\n- For a constant input $f(t) = f_0$, only the zero-frequency mode contributes, yielding $y_{\\mathrm{per}}(t) = \\frac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2}$.\n- For multi-harmonic forcing, linearity yields the sum of the respective steady responses.\n\nError metric and outputs:\n- For each test case, compute the maximum absolute error\n  $$\n  e = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le N-1} \\left| y_{\\mathrm{spec}}(t_j) - y_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t_j) \\right|.\n  $$\n  Here $y_{\\mathrm{spec}}$ is the spectral solution and $y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the analytic reference built from the formulas above. The errors are dimensionless real numbers.\n- The program must output a single line with the list $[e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4]$ corresponding to the four specified cases in order.\n\nWhy correctness holds:\n- The continuous operator is diagonal in the Fourier basis because complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of constant-coefficient differential operators, with eigenvalues $-\\omega^2$ for the second derivative and $i\\omega$ for the first derivative. Therefore the mapping from $\\hat{f}_k$ to $\\hat{y}_k$ is an algebraic division by the transfer function denominator.\n- The discrete implementation with the FFT is a pseudospectral collocation method over one period: it enforces the ODE in the Fourier domain at the sampled frequencies of the periodic grid, which converges spectrally (exponentially fast) for smooth periodic data, hence the small errors observed for smooth sinusoids and constants.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Use $N = 256$ for all cases as specified, $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{N}$, $\\omega_k = 2\\pi \\operatorname{fftfreq}(N, \\Delta t)$.\n- Build the analytic references using $|H(i\\omega)|$ and $\\phi$ formulas at the appropriate angular frequencies.\n- Report the four errors in the required single-line format.",

This exercise generalizes the concept to unstructured networks or graphs, a cornerstone of modern data analysis and computational science. You will solve a diffusion equation on a small, weighted graph by using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix, $L$, as your basis functions . Just as sine and cosine functions are the eigenfunctions of the standard derivative operator, the eigenvectors of $L$ diagonalize the discrete diffusion process on the graph, transforming a coupled system of equations into a simple, solvable set. This practice will broaden your perspective on what constitutes a \"spectral method\" and its applicability to complex, irregular geometries.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard initial value problem for a system of linear ordinary differential equations, representing a diffusion process on a graph. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe governing equation is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}u(t) = -\\alpha L\\,u(t) + b, \\quad u(0)=u_0\n$$\nwhere $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is the state vector, $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is the combinatorial graph Laplacian, $\\alpha \\ge 0$ is a scalar diffusion parameter, $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a constant source vector, and $u_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is the initial condition. Here, $N=5$.\n\nThe analytical solution to this system can be found using the method of eigendecomposition, which is appropriate as the graph Laplacian $L$ of an undirected graph is a real symmetric matrix. As such, $L$ is diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix $V$ of its eigenvectors:\n$$\nL = V \\Lambda V^T\n$$\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of the real eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of $L$, and $V$ is an orthogonal matrix ($V^T V = V V^T = I$) whose columns are the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. This decomposition is central to spectral methods on graphs.\n\nWe introduce a change of variables by projecting the state vector $u(t)$ onto the eigenbasis of $L$:\n$$\nv(t) = V^T u(t) \\quad \\iff \\quad u(t) = V v(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(V v(t)) = -\\alpha (V \\Lambda V^T) (V v(t)) + b\n$$\n$$\nV \\frac{d v(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha V \\Lambda v(t) + b\n$$\nMultiplying from the left by $V^T$ and using the orthogonality of $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{d v(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha \\Lambda v(t) + V^T b\n$$\nThis transforms the original coupled system into a set of $N$ independent scalar linear ordinary differential equations. Let $c = V^T b$. The $i$-th equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d v_i(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda_i v_i(t) + c_i, \\quad v_i(0) = (V^T u_0)_i\n$$\nThe solution for each component $v_i(t)$ depends on the value of $\\lambda_i$. For a connected graph, the Laplacian $L$ has one simple eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = 0$ and all other eigenvalues are strictly positive ($\\lambda_i > 0$ for $i > 0$).\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha \\lambda_i \\neq 0$. The solution is\n$$\nv_i(t) = e^{-\\alpha \\lambda_i t} v_i(0) + \\frac{1 - e^{-\\alpha \\lambda_i t}}{\\alpha \\lambda_i} c_i\n$$\nCase 2: $\\alpha \\lambda_i = 0$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d v_i(t)}{dt} = c_i$, with solution\n$$\nv_i(t) = v_i(0) + c_i t\n$$\nThis case applies if $\\alpha=0$ or if $\\lambda_i=0$. The provided test cases include instances of $\\alpha=0$ and $T=0$, which are handled as simple special cases:\n- If $T=0$, the solution is trivially $u(T) = u(0) = u_0$.\n- If $\\alpha=0$, the equation simplifies to $\\frac{d u(t)}{dt} = b$, whose solution is $u(T) = u_0 + bT$.\n\nOnce the vector $v(T)=[v_0(T), v_1(T), \\dots, v_{N-1}(T)]^T$ is computed at the final time $T$, the solution in the original basis is recovered by the inverse transformation:\n$$\nu(T) = V v(T)\n$$\nThe implementation will first construct the Laplacian matrix $L$ from the given graph structure. Then, for each test case, it will compute the solution $u(T)$ by applying the appropriate formula derived above. For the general case requiring eigendecomposition, we will use numerically robust linear algebra routines.
