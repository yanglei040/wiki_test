The eigendecomposition of $A$ is $A = PDP^{-1}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and $P$ is a matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors.\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 4-\\lambda & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (4-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda) - (-2)(1) = 4 - 5\\lambda + \\lambda^2 + 2 = \\lambda^2 - 5\\lambda + 6 = 0\n$$\nFactoring the quadratic equation gives $(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda - 3) = 0$.

This arises from the power series:\n$\\exp(At) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(PDP^{-1}t)^k}{k!} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{P(Dt)^k P^{-1}}{k!} = P\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(Dt)^k}{k!}\\right)P^{-1} = P\\exp(Dt)P^{-1}$.\nThe exponential of a diagonal matrix is the diagonal matrix of the exponentials of its elements:\n$$\n\\exp(Dt) = \\exp\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 2t & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3t \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(2t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\exp(At)$:\n$$\n\\exp(At) = P \\exp(Dt) P^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(2t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(2t) & 2\\exp(3t) \\\\ \\exp(2t) & \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{pmatrix} -\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t) & 2\\exp(2t) - 2\\exp(3t) \\\\ -\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) & 2\\exp(2t) - \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the solution $u(t) = \\exp(At) u_0$:\n$$\nu(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t) & 2\\exp(2t) - 2\\exp(3t) \\\\ -\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) & 2\\exp(2t) - \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nu(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1(t) \\\\ u_2(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t) \\\\ -\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\exp(3t) - \\exp(2t) \\\\ \\exp(3t) - \\exp(2t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the first component, $u_1(t)$.\n$$\nu_1(t) = 2\\exp(3t) - \\exp(2t)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the first component of the state vector as a function of time $t$.",

It is scientifically grounded as it pertains to the well-established theory of linear algebra, specifically the Jordan normal form. It is well-posed, as the Jordan form of a square matrix is unique up to the permutation of its Jordan blocks, and the value of superdiagonal entries is a deterministic property of the matrix. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any fundamental principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe Jordan normal form of a matrix is determined by its eigenvalues and the structure of their corresponding eigenspaces and generalized eigenspaces. The first step is to compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is:\n$$ \\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 5-\\lambda & -3 \\\\ 12 & -7-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ = (5-\\lambda)(-7-\\lambda) - (-3)(12) $$\n$$ = -35 - 5\\lambda + 7\\lambda + \\lambda^2 + 36 $$\n$$ = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 1 $$\n$$ = (\\lambda + 1)^2 $$\nSetting the characteristic polynomial to zero, $(\\lambda + 1)^2 = 0$, reveals a single eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1$ with an algebraic multiplicity of $m_a = 2$.\n\nNext, we determine the geometric multiplicity, $m_g$, of this eigenvalue. The geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the eigenspace associated with $\\lambda$, which is the dimension of the null space of the matrix $(A - \\lambda I)$.\nFor $\\lambda = -1$, we have:\n$$ A - \\lambda I = A - (-1)I = A + I = \\begin{pmatrix} 5+1 & -3 \\\\ 12 & -7+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & -3 \\\\ 12 & -6 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the null space, we solve the system $(A+I)v = 0$ for a vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & -3 \\\\ 12 & -6 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis system of linear equations is equivalent to the single equation $6x - 3y = 0$, which simplifies to $y = 2x$. The eigenspace is spanned by a single vector, for example, $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe dimension of this null space is $1$. Therefore, the geometric multiplicity is $m_g = 1$.\n\nSince the geometric multiplicity $m_g = 1$ is less than the algebraic multiplicity $m_a = 2$, the matrix $A$ is not diagonalizable. The Jordan normal form of $A$ must contain at least one non-diagonal Jordan block. Given that $A$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with a single eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity $2$, its Jordan form must consist of a single $2 \\times 2$ Jordan block.\n\nAccording to the definition and the convention specified in the problem statement, a Jordan block of size $k \\times k$ for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is an upper triangular matrix of the form:\n$$ J_k(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & 1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda & 1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\dots & \\lambda & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\dots & 0 & \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe superdiagonal entries are all $1$.\n\nFor the matrix $A$, the Jordan normal form is a single $2 \\times 2$ block corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1$. This block is:\n$$ J = J_2(-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis structure is a direct consequence of the matrix having only one linearly independent eigenvector for an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity two. A basis for the Jordan decomposition is formed by an eigenvector $v_1$ and a generalized eigenvector $v_2$, which satisfies $(A-\\lambda I)v_2 = v_1$. The existence of such a chain of length two confirms the structure of the Jordan block.\n\nThe Jordan form $J$ has a single superdiagonal entry. Inspecting the matrix $J$, this entry is located at row $1$, column $2$. The value of this entry is $1$.",
