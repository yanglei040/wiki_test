This exercise challenges you to determine the minimum PCE order required to perfectly capture a simple polynomial function, $y(\\xi) = \\xi^{4}$.

Let a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) be constructed using the Legendre polynomial basis $\\{L_{n}(\\xi)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$, which is orthogonal on $[-1,1]$ with respect to the constant weight function.

Provide your final answer as a single integer with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It poses a standard question in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and their application in uncertainty quantification. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the minimal integer order $P$ of a truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) that can exactly represent the model response $y(\\xi) = \\xi^{4}$, where $\\xi$ is a random variable with a uniform distribution on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The expansion is constructed using the Legendre polynomial basis $\\{L_{n}(\\xi)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nA truncated PCE of order $P$ is given by the finite series:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{P} a_{n} L_{n}(\\xi)\n$$\nwhere $a_{n}$ are deterministic coefficients. The Legendre polynomial $L_{n}(\\xi)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. Consequently, the truncated PCE of order $P$ is a polynomial of degree at most $P$.\n\nA cornerstone of approximation theory is that the set of Legendre polynomials $\\{L_{0}(\\xi), L_{1}(\\xi), \\dots, L_{P}(\\xi)\\}$ forms a complete orthogonal basis for the vector space of all polynomials of degree up to $P$. This space is denoted $\\mathbb{P}_{P}$.\n\nThe function to be represented is $y(\\xi) = \\xi^{4}$. This function is a monomial, and more specifically, it is a polynomial of degree $4$. As such, $y(\\xi)$ is an element of the space $\\mathbb{P}_{4}$.\n\nFor the PCE to represent $y(\\xi)$ exactly, the expansion must be identically equal to $\\xi^{4}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{P} a_{n} L_{n}(\\xi) = \\xi^{4}\n$$\nThe left side of this equation is a polynomial of degree at most $P$. The right side is a polynomial of degree $4$. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, two polynomials are identical if and only if their degrees are equal and all corresponding coefficients are equal.\n\nConsider an expansion of order $P < 4$. The sum $\\sum_{n=0}^{P} a_{n} L_{n}(\\xi)$ results in a polynomial of degree at most $P$. It is a logical impossibility for a polynomial of degree less than $4$ to be equal to $\\xi^{4}$ for all $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$. Therefore, an order $P < 4$ is insufficient to achieve an exact representation. This implies that the minimal required order must be $P \\ge 4$.\n\nNow, consider an expansion of order $P=4$. The set of basis functions is $\\{L_{0}(\\xi), L_{1}(\\xi), L_{2}(\\xi), L_{3}(\\xi), L_{4}(\\xi)\\}$. This set forms a basis for the space $\\mathbb{P}_{4}$. Since $y(\\xi) = \\xi^{4}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{P}_{4}$, it can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis polynomials. That is, there exist unique coefficients $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ such that:\n$$\n\\xi^{4} = a_{0}L_{0}(\\xi) + a_{1}L_{1}(\\xi) + a_{2}L_{2}(\\xi) + a_{3}L_{3}(\\xi) + a_{4}L_{4}(\\xi)\n$$\nThe coefficient $a_{4}$ must be non-zero. This is because the polynomial $L_{4}(\\xi)$ is the only polynomial in the basis set $\\{L_{0}(\\xi), \\dots, L_{4}(\\xi)\\}$ that contains a $\\xi^{4}$ term. All other basis polynomials $L_{n}(\\xi)$ for $n < 4$ are of degree less than $4$. To match the $\\xi^{4}$ term on the right-hand side, the $a_{4}L_{4}(\\xi)$ term is mandatory.\n\nSince an order of $P=4$ is sufficient for an exact representation and any order $P<4$ is insufficient, the minimal order required is precisely $P=4$. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the space of polynomials of degree up to $N$ is spanned by the first $N+1$ Legendre polynomials.",

All variables and constants are clearly defined, and there are no scientific or logical contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\n**Step 2: Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to find the PCE representation of $Z(\\xi)$ in the form $Z(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} z_k \\Phi_k(\\xi)$, where $z_k$ are the PCE coefficients for $Z(\\xi)$.\n\nWe are given the affine transformation:\n$$Z(\\xi) = a\\,Y(\\xi) + b$$\nThe PCE for the model output $Y(\\xi)$ is provided as:\n$$Y(\\xi) \\;=\\; 3\\,\\Phi_{0}(\\xi)\\;-\\;\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Phi_{1}(\\xi)\\;+\\;\\sqrt{2}\\,\\Phi_{2}(\\xi)\\;-\\;2\\,\\Phi_{3}(\\xi)$$\nWe substitute the expression for $Y(\\xi)$ into the definition of $Z(\\xi)$:\n$$Z(\\xi) = a \\left( 3\\,\\Phi_{0}(\\xi)\\;-\\;\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Phi_{1}(\\xi)\\;+\\;\\sqrt{2}\\,\\Phi_{2}(\\xi)\\;-\\;2\\,\\Phi_{3}(\\xi) \\right) + b$$\nBy distributing the constant $a$ across the terms within the parenthesis, we obtain:\n$$Z(\\xi) = 3a\\,\\Phi_{0}(\\xi)\\;-\\;\\frac{a}{2}\\,\\Phi_{1}(\\xi)\\;+\\;a\\sqrt{2}\\,\\Phi_{2}(\\xi)\\;-\\;2a\\,\\Phi_{3}(\\xi) + b$$\nTo express $Z(\\xi)$ as a linear combination of the basis functions $\\{\\Phi_k(\\xi)\\}_{k=0}^{3}$, we must represent the additive constant $b$ in terms of this basis. The first basis function is $\\Phi_{0}(\\xi) = 1$.
