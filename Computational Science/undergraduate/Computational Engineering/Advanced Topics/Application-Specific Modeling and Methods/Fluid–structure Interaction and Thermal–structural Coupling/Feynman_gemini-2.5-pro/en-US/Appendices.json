Model the thermally driven contraction and the resulting upward displacement under quasi-static mechanical equilibrium using first principles of thermal energy balance and one-dimensional linear elasticity with a simple phase-fraction model. All independent and derived quantities must be handled in the International System of Units (SI). The final upward displacement must be expressed in meters, as decimal floats rounded to six decimals.\n\nAssumptions and definitions:\n- Consider a one-dimensional rod model of the SMA wire, with uniform cross-section, length, and properties.

Gravity has magnitude $g$.\n- Let the ambient temperature be $T_{\\text{amb}}$. The wire is initially at $T(0) = T_{\\text{amb}}$ and is heated by a constant current $I$ from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{end}}$.\n- Thermal energy balance (lumped capacitance) for the wire is governed by\n  $$ C_{\\text{th}} \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = I^2 R - h A_{\\text{surf}} \\left( T - T_{\\text{amb}} \\right), $$\n  where $C_{\\text{th}} = \\rho c A L$ is the thermal capacitance, $\\rho$ is density, $c$ is specific heat, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and $R$ is the electrical resistance of the wire.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a self-contained set of definitions, constants, and equations for modeling the thermo-mechanical behavior of a Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire. The model is based on established principles of heat transfer and solid mechanics. We may now proceed with the formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the upward displacement $u_{\\uparrow}$ of a mass $m$ suspended by an SMA wire of length $L$, which contracts upon Joule heating. The solution is partitioned into two main stages: a thermal analysis to find the wire's temperature over time, and a mechanical analysis to compute the strain and resulting displacement.\n\nFirst, we analyze the thermal behavior. The temperature $T(t)$ of the wire is governed by the lumped capacitance model, a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ C_{\\text{th}} \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = I^2 R - h A_{\\text{surf}} \\left( T - T_{\\text{amb}} \\right) $$\nwhere $C_{\\text{th}} = \\rho c A L$ is the thermal capacitance, $R = \\rho_e L / A$ is the electrical resistance, and $A_{\\text{surf}} = 2 \\pi r L$ is the lateral surface area of the wire. The other parameters are: current $I$, convective heat transfer coefficient $h$, ambient temperature $T_{\\text{amb}}$, density $\\rho$, specific heat $c$, and electrical resistivity $\\rho_e$. The wire has a circular cross-section of radius $r$, so its area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, we rearrange it into standard form:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{h A_{\\text{surf}}}{C_{\\text{th}}} \\left( T - T_{\\text{amb}} \\right) = \\frac{I^2 R}{C_{\\text{th}}} $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{h A_{\\text{surf}}}{C_{\\text{th}}} T = \\frac{I^2 R}{C_{\\text{th}}} + \\frac{h A_{\\text{surf}}}{C_{\\text{th}}} T_{\\text{amb}} $$\nLet us define the characteristic time constant $\\tau$ and the steady-state temperature $T_{ss}$:\nThe coefficient of $T$ is $\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\alpha = \\frac{h A_{\\text{surf}}}{C_{\\text{th}}}$. Substituting the expressions for $A_{\\text{surf}}$ and $C_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{h (2 \\pi r L)}{\\rho c (\\pi r^2) L} = \\frac{2h}{\\rho c r} $$\nThe steady-state temperature $T_{ss}$ is reached when $\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0$, which gives:\n$$ I^2 R = h A_{\\text{surf}} (T_{ss} - T_{\\text{amb}}) \\implies T_{ss} = T_{\\text{amb}} + \\frac{I^2 R}{h A_{\\text{surf}}} $$\nThe ODE can now be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} + \\alpha T = \\alpha T_{ss} $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the general solution $T(t) = C e^{-\\alpha t} + T_{ss}$. We use the initial condition $T(0) = T_{\\text{amb}}$ to find the integration constant $C$:\n$$ T(0) = C e^0 + T_{ss} = C + T_{ss} = T_{\\text{amb}} \\implies C = T_{\\text{amb}} - T_{ss} $$\nThus, the particular solution for the temperature of the wire as a function of time $t$ is:\n$$ T(t) = T_{ss} + \\left( T_{\\text{amb}} - T_{ss} \\right) e^{-\\alpha t} $$\nWe must compute the final temperature $T(t_{\\text{end}})$ for each test case using this equation.\n\nSecond, we analyze the mechanical behavior under the quasi-static assumption. The total strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T)$ at a given temperature $T$ is the sum of the transformation strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T)$ and the elastic strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T)$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T) + \\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T) $$\nThe austenite volume fraction, $\\xi(T)$, is a piecewise linear function:\n$$ \\xi(T) = \\begin{cases}\n0, & T \\le A_s \\\\\n\\frac{T - A_s}{A_f - A_s}, & A_s < T < A_f \\\\\n1, & T \\ge A_f\n\\end{cases} $$\nwhere $A_s$ and $A_f$ are the austenite start and finish temperatures, respectively.\n\nThe transformation strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T)$ is defined relative to the austenite phase and depends on the martensite fraction $(1 - \\xi(T))$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T) = (1 - \\xi(T)) \\varepsilon_L $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_L$ is the maximum recoverable strain of the fully martensitic wire.\n\nThe elastic strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T)$ is given by Hooke's law, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T) = \\sigma / E(T)$, where the stress $\\sigma = mg/A$ is due to the suspended mass $m$. The effective Young's modulus $E(T)$ is determined by a linear rule of mixtures:\n$$ E(T) = \\xi(T) E_A + (1 - \\xi(T)) E_M $$\nwhere $E_A$ and $E_M$ are the moduli of austenite and martensite, respectively.\n\nThe upward displacement $u_{\\uparrow}$ is the total contraction of the wire from its initial state at $t=0$ (where $T(0) = T_{\\text{amb}}$) to its final state at $t=t_{\\text{end}}$. This is given by the change in total strain multiplied by the original length $L$:\n$$ u_{\\uparrow} = L \\left[ \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T(0)) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T(t_{\\text{end}})) \\right] $$\nSubstituting $T(0) = T_{\\text{amb}}$:\n$$ u_{\\uparrow} = L \\left[ \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T_{\\text{amb}}) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T(t_{\\text{end}})) \\right] $$\nFor each test case $(m, I, t_{\\text{end}}, T_{\\text{amb}})$, the computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  Calculate geometry-dependent constants: $A = \\pi r^2$, $A_{\\text{surf}} = 2 \\pi r L$.\n2.  Calculate material-dependent constants: $R = \\rho_e L / A$, $\\alpha = 2h / (\\rho c r)$.\n3.  Calculate the steady-state temperature $T_{ss} = T_{\\text{amb}} + I^2 R / (h A_{\\text{surf}})$.\n4.  Calculate the final temperature $T(t_{\\text{end}})$ using the derived analytical solution.\n5.  Determine the total strain at the initial temperature, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T_{\\text{amb}})$. This requires computing $\\xi(T_{\\text{amb}})$, $E(T_{\\text{amb}})$, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T_{\\text{amb}})$, and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T_{\\text{amb}})$.\n6.  Determine the total strain at the final temperature, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T(t_{\\text{end}}))$. This requires computing $\\xi(T(t_{\\text{end}}))$, $E(T(t_{\\text{end}}))$, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{tr}}(T(t_{\\text{end}}))$, and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}(T(t_{\\text{end}}))$.\n7.  Compute the final upward displacement $u_{\\uparrow} = L (\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T_{\\text{amb}}) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}(T(t_{\\text{end}})))$.\n\nThis rigorous, step-by-step procedure, founded upon first principles, will be implemented to solve the problem for the given test suite.",

            "problem": "A vertical slender cylindrical strand of spaghetti immersed in boiling water is modeled as a one-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli beam undergoing small transverse deflection under its own weight. The water thermally softens the spaghetti by convective heat transfer. The spaghetti’s elastic modulus depends on temperature and thereby on time, creating a thermal–structural coupling. Treat the convection from water to spaghetti as a one-directional fluid–structure interaction, where the fluid (water) drives the temperature evolution that alters the structural stiffness.\n\nAssumptions and base laws:\n- Use the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory for small deflections, with bending stiffness $E I$ where $E$ is the Young’s modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of a circular cross-section. The beam is a vertical cantilever of length $L$, clamped at the bottom and free at the top. Let $x \\in [0,L]$ denote the vertical coordinate measured from the clamp upward.\n- The axial force along the beam due to self-weight is $N(x) = q_0 (L - x)$, where $q_0 = \\rho_s A g$ is the weight per unit length, $\\rho_s$ is the material density, $A = \\pi r^2$ is the cross-sectional area for radius $r$, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.\n- The linearized buckling equation under axial compression is governed by the differential operator $E I \\, \\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + N(x) \\, \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = 0$ with clamped-free boundary conditions at $x=0$ (zero displacement and zero rotation) and at $x=L$ (zero bending moment and zero shear). You must solve this as a generalized eigenvalue problem using a consistent discretization.\n- The thermal model is lumped (spatially uniform temperature in the solid) based on energy balance and Newton’s law of cooling: $\\rho_s c_s V \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = h A_s (T_w - T)$, where $c_s$ is the specific heat capacity, $V = A L$ is the volume, $A_s = 2 \\pi r L$ is the lateral surface area (end faces are negligible), $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and $T_w$ is the water temperature. With initial temperature $T(0)=T_0$, the solution is $T(t) = T_w - (T_w - T_0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\tau = \\frac{\\rho_s c_s V}{h A_s}$.\n- The elastic modulus softens linearly with temperature relative to a reference state: $E(T) = E_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\, \\left[1 - \\alpha \\, (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right]$, where $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the elastic modulus at $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\alpha$ is a temperature coefficient. To maintain physical plausibility, bound the modulus below by a small fraction of the reference: $E(T) \\ge E_{\\min} = \\beta \\, E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $\\beta = 0.05$.\n\nTask:\n- Discretize the beam using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Euler–Bernoulli kinematics and geometric stiffness due to axial compression approximated by averaging $N(x)$ over each element. Assemble the global bending stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_b^0$ (factored so that the physical bending stiffness is $E I \\mathbf{K}_b^0$) and the global geometric stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_g^{\\mathrm{unit}}$ associated with the unit weight-per-length profile (i.e., the profile $N(x) = (L-x)$ corresponding to $q_0 = 1$), after enforcing the clamped boundary conditions at the base. Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_b^0 \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} = \\mu \\, \\mathbf{K}_g^{\\mathrm{unit}} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi},\n$$\nand extract the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\mu_{\\min}$.

If $E(0) I \\le E I_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, set $t_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0$.

Discretizing this equation using the Finite Element Method, we obtain the matrix form of the eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nE I \\mathbf{K}_b \\mathbf{d} + \\mathbf{K}_g(N) \\mathbf{d} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}_b$ is the conventional bending stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_g(N)$ is the geometric stiffness matrix dependent on the axial force profile $N(x)$, and $\\mathbf{d}$ is the vector of nodal displacements and rotations.\n\nThe problem specifies that the geometric stiffness matrix should be constructed using the average axial force over each element. For an element $i$ spanning from $x_i$ to $x_{i+1}$, the average force is $\\bar{N}_i = \\frac{1}{l_e} \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} q_0(L-x) dx = q_0 \\left(L - \\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}\\right)$, where $l_e$ is the element length.\n\nThe problem is stated as solving the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_b^0 \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} = \\mu \\, \\mathbf{K}_g^{\\mathrm{unit}} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\n$$\nThe physical buckling equation is $E I \\mathbf{K}_b^0 \\mathbf{d} = q_0 \\mathbf{K}_g^{\\mathrm{unit}} \\mathbf{d}$. Comparing these two forms reveals that the eigenvalue $\\mu$ corresponds to the ratio $q_0 / (E I)$. The critical condition (first buckling mode) corresponds to the smallest positive eigenvalue, $\\mu_{\\min}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\min} = \\frac{q_0}{E I_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\nFrom this, we find the critical bending stiffness:\n$$\nE I_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{q_0}{\\mu_{\\min}}\n$$\nWe implement this by assembling the global matrices $\\mathbf{K}_b^0$ and $\\mathbf{K}_g^{\\mathrm{unit}}$ from their standard element-level counterparts. For an Euler-Bernoulli beam element of length $l_e$, the element bending stiffness matrix (without the $EI$ factor) is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_b^e = \\frac{1}{l_e^3}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 6 l_e & -12 & 6 l_e \\\\\n6 l_e & 4 l_e^2 & -6 l_e & 2 l_e^2 \\\\\n-12 & -6 l_e & 12 & -6 l_e \\\\\n6 l_e & 2 l_e^2 & -6 l_e & 4 l_e^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe element geometric stiffness matrix for a unit average force term $\\bar{N}^{\\mathrm{unit}}_i / q_0 = (L - (x_i+x_{i+1})/2)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_g^{e, \\mathrm{unit}} = \\left(L - \\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}\\right) \\frac{1}{30 l_e}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n36 & 3 l_e & -36 & 3 l_e \\\\\n3 l_e & 4 l_e^2 & -3 l_e & -l_e^2 \\\\\n-36 & -3 l_e & 36 & -3 l_e \\\\\n3 l_e & -l_e^2 & -3 l_e & 4 l_e^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAfter assembling the global matrices, the clamped boundary conditions at $x=0$ (zero displacement and rotation at the first node) are enforced by removing the first two rows and columns. We then solve the resulting reduced system for the eigenvalues $\\mu$ and identify $\\mu_{\\min}$. For numerical stability and accuracy, the beam is discretized into $n_{el}=100$ elements.\n\n**Step 2: Thermomechanical Model**\n\nThe temperature $T$ of the spaghetti strand evolves according to Newton's law of cooling:\n$$\nT(t) = T_w - (T_w - T_0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nwhere the thermal time constant $\\tau$ is given by $\\tau = \\frac{\\rho_s c_s V}{h A_s} = \\frac{\\rho_s c_s (\\pi r^2 L)}{h (2 \\pi r L)} = \\frac{\\rho_s c_s r}{2 h}$.\n\nThe elastic modulus $E$ depends on temperature as:\n$$\nE(T) = \\max \\left( \\beta E_{\\mathrm{ref}}, E_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left[1 - \\alpha (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right] \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\beta=0.05$ provides a lower bound on the modulus. Substituting $T(t)$ into this equation gives the time-dependent modulus $E(t)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of Buckling Time $t_{\\mathrm{b}}$**\n\nBuckling occurs when the beam's modulus $E(t)$ drops to a critical value, $E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, defined by the buckling resistance $E_{\\mathrm{crit}} I = E I_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Therefore, $E_{\\mathrm{crit}} = E I_{\\mathrm{crit}} / I$. The steps to find the buckling time $t_{\\mathrm{b}}$ for each case are:\n1.  Calculate geometric properties $A=\\pi r^2$, $I=\\pi r^4/4$, and material properties like $q_0=\\rho_s A g$.\n2.  Numerically compute $\\mu_{\\min}$ for the given length $L$ using the FEM procedure.\n3.  Calculate the critical modulus $E_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{q_0}{\\mu_{\\min} I}$.\n4.  Calculate the initial modulus $E(0)$ and asymptotic modulus $E(\\infty)$ using the temperatures $T_0$ and $T_w$, respectively.\n5.  Apply the conditions:\n    - If $E(0) \\le E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, buckling is immediate or has already occurred. We set $t_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0$.\n    - If $E(\\infty) > E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the modulus never degrades to the critical level. Buckling does not occur. We set $t_{\\mathrm{b}} = -1$.\n    - Otherwise, a unique buckling time $t_{\\mathrm{b}} > 0$ exists. We solve $E(t_{\\mathrm{b}}) = E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ for $t_{\\mathrm{b}}$. This requires first finding the critical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ from $E(T_{\\mathrm{crit}}) = E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, which gives $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)$. Then, we solve for time:\n    $$\n    t_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\tau \\ln \\left( \\frac{T_w - T_0}{T_w - T_{\\mathrm{crit}}} \\right)\n    $$\nThe calculations for each case are performed according to this procedure. The final results are rounded to three decimal places as required.",

            "problem": "A thin-walled cylindrical pipe is subjected to periodic internal fluid slugs that are alternately hot and cold, with steady internal pressure applied at all times. The phenomenon of interest is thermal ratcheting under coupled fluid–structure interaction (FSI), modeled through thermal–structural coupling at the inner and outer surfaces via convection and conduction through the wall, and structural elastoplastic response under combined primary membrane and secondary thermal bending stresses.\n\nAssumptions and model definitions:\n- Geometry: inner radius $r$ and wall thickness $t$, with $t \\ll r$ so that thin-wall theory applies.\n- Material: homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic with Young’s modulus $E$ and coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha$, with elastic–perfectly–plastic yielding at uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y$. Plane stress holds in the hoop direction.\n- Thermal properties: wall thermal conductivity $k$. The inner surface experiences convection with heat transfer coefficient $h_i$ to a well-mixed internal fluid at temperature $T_f$, and the outer surface experiences convection with heat transfer coefficient $h_o$ to an ambient at temperature $T_\\infty$.\n- Loading: constant internal pressure $p$; two steady thermal stages per period: a hot slug with $T_f = T_h$ and a cold slug with $T_f = T_c$. Each slug persists long enough that the wall reaches steady state in that stage.\n- Thermal field: at steady state, heat transfer is one-dimensional across the wall thickness, and the temperature through the wall is linear in the thickness coordinate.\n- Primary membrane hoop stress: by thin-wall theory, $S_m = \\dfrac{p\\,r}{t}$.\n- Thermal bending stress at the inner surface in a steady stage $j \\in \\{\\text{hot},\\text{cold}\\}$: let the steady heat flux magnitude be $q_j$, and the through-thickness temperature drop be $\\Delta T_{\\text{thru},j} = q_j \\,\\dfrac{t}{k}$. Under plane stress with traction-free edges and a linear through-thickness temperature profile, the self-equilibrated thermal stress deviation from the average at the inner surface is $S_{\\text{th},j} = E\\,\\alpha\\,\\dfrac{\\Delta T_{\\text{thru},j}}{2}$. The thermal stress range is $S_b = \\left| S_{\\text{th},\\text{hot}} - S_{\\text{th},\\text{cold}} \\right|$.\n- Heat flux in steady stage $j$: the total thermal resistance between the internal fluid and the ambient is $R = \\dfrac{1}{h_i} + \\dfrac{t}{k} + \\dfrac{1}{h_o}$, so the steady heat flux per unit area is $q_j = \\dfrac{T_f^{(j)} - T_\\infty}{R}$ with $T_f^{(\\text{hot})} = T_h$ and $T_f^{(\\text{cold})} = T_c$.\n- Ratcheting definition for this problem: ratcheting is deemed to occur if and only if the following inequality holds,\n$$\n\\frac{S_m}{\\sigma_y} + \\frac{S_b}{2\\,\\sigma_y} > 1,\n$$\nand otherwise ratcheting is deemed not to occur.\n\nAll quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI).
