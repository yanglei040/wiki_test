Consider quasi-static conditions with no inertia. \n\nPart A (superposition principle): Starting from the balance of linear momentum in the absence of body forces, the infinitesimal strain-displacement relation, and the above constitutive law, argue from first principles why the stress field for a combined mechanical loading (prescribed tractions and/or displacements) and thermal loading $\\Delta T$ can be written as the sum of a purely mechanical stress field (obtained by setting $\\Delta T = 0$ and applying the mechanical load) and a purely thermal stress field (obtained by removing mechanical loading but enforcing the thermal field $\\Delta T$ with homogeneous mechanical boundary conditions).

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Part A: Superposition Principle in Linear Thermoelasticity\n\nThe governing equations for a quasi-static, linear thermoelastic solid in the absence of body forces are:\n1.  Balance of Linear Momentum (Equilibrium): $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = 0$\n2.  Strain-Displacement Relation (Kinematics): $\\varepsilon = \\mathcal{E}(u) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^T)$\n3.  Constitutive Law: $\\sigma = \\mathbb{C} : (\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_{th})$, where the thermal strain is $\\varepsilon_{th} = \\alpha \\Delta T I$.\n\nThe kinematic operator $\\mathcal{E}$ is linear. The constitutive law is linear in its arguments $\\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon_{th}$.\nSubstituting (2) into (3), and then into (1), we obtain the governing partial differential equation for the displacement field $u$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : (\\mathcal{E}(u) - \\alpha \\Delta T I)] = 0 $$\nLet us define a linear differential operator $\\mathcal{L}(u) \\equiv \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : \\mathcal{E}(u)]$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(u) = \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : (\\alpha \\Delta T I)] $$\nThis is a linear, non-homogeneous partial differential equation. The boundary of the solid, $\\partial \\Omega$, is partitioned into $\\partial \\Omega_u$ and $\\partial \\Omega_t$, where displacements and tractions are prescribed, respectively.\n- Displacement BC: $u = \\bar{u}$ on $\\partial \\Omega_u$.\n- Traction BC: $\\sigma \\cdot n = \\bar{t}$ on $\\partial \\Omega_t$.\n\nThe complete problem, which we will call Problem (P), consists of solving the governing PDE subject to these boundary conditions for a given thermal field $\\Delta T$ and mechanical loads $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{t})$. Let the solution be $(u, \\varepsilon, \\sigma)$.\n\nWe decompose this problem into two simpler ones based on the principle of superposition for linear systems.\n\n**Problem (M): Purely Mechanical**\nThis problem considers only the mechanical loads, with zero thermal field ($\\Delta T = 0$).\n- Governing Equation: $\\mathcal{L}(u_M) = 0$.\n- Boundary Conditions: $u_M = \\bar{u}$ on $\\partial \\Omega_u$ and $\\sigma_M \\cdot n = \\bar{t}$ on $\\partial \\Omega_t$.\n- The stress is $\\sigma_M = \\mathbb{C} : \\mathcal{E}(u_M)$.\nLet the solution be $(u_M, \\varepsilon_M, \\sigma_M)$.\n\n**Problem (T): Purely Thermal**\nThis problem considers only the thermal field, with homogeneous (zero) mechanical boundary conditions.\n- Governing Equation: $\\mathcal{L}(u_T) = \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : (\\alpha \\Delta T I)]$.\n- Boundary Conditions: $u_T = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega_u$ and $\\sigma_T \\cdot n = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega_t$.\n- The stress is $\\sigma_T = \\mathbb{C} : (\\mathcal{E}(u_T) - \\alpha \\Delta T I)$.\nLet the solution be $(u_T, \\varepsilon_T, \\sigma_T)$.\n\nNow, we propose that the solution to the original combined Problem (P) is the sum of the solutions from (M) and (T):\n$u = u_M + u_T$\n$\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_M + \\varepsilon_T$\n$\\sigma = \\sigma_M + \\sigma_T$\n\nWe must verify that this proposed solution satisfies the governing equation and boundary conditions of Problem (P).\n\n1.  **Verification of Governing Equation**:\n    We examine $\\mathcal{L}(u)$. Due to the linearity of the operator $\\mathcal{L}$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}(u) = \\mathcal{L}(u_M + u_T) = \\mathcal{L}(u_M) + \\mathcal{L}(u_T) $$\n    From the definitions of problems (M) and (T), this becomes:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}(u) = 0 + \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : (\\alpha \\Delta T I)] = \\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbb{C} : (\\alpha \\Delta T I)] $$\n    This is precisely the governing equation for the combined Problem (P).\n\n2.  **Verification of Stress Relation**:\n    The stress for the combined problem is $\\sigma = \\mathbb{C} : (\\varepsilon - \\alpha \\Delta T I)$. Substituting $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_M + \\varepsilon_T = \\mathcal{E}(u_M) + \\mathcal{E}(u_T)$:\n    $$ \\sigma = \\mathbb{C} : (\\mathcal{E}(u_M) + \\mathcal{E}(u_T) - \\alpha \\Delta T I) $$\n    $$ \\sigma = (\\mathbb{C} : \\mathcal{E}(u_M)) + (\\mathbb{C} : (\\mathcal{E}(u_T) - \\alpha \\Delta T I)) $$\n    The first term is exactly $\\sigma_M$ and the second term is exactly $\\sigma_T$. Thus, $\\sigma = \\sigma_M + \\sigma_T$ is a direct consequence of the linearity of the constitutive law.\n\n3.  **Verification of Boundary Conditions**:\n    - On $\\partial \\Omega_u$: $u = u_M + u_T = \\bar{u} + 0 = \\bar{u}$. The displacement BC is satisfied.\n    - On $\\partial \\Omega_t$: $\\sigma \\cdot n = (\\sigma_M + \\sigma_T) \\cdot n = (\\sigma_M \\cdot n) + (\\sigma_T \\cdot n) = \\bar{t} + 0 = \\bar{t}$. The traction BC is satisfied.\n\nSince the superimposed solution $(u, \\varepsilon, \\sigma)$ satisfies the governing equation and all boundary conditions of the original problem, and since the solution to a linear elastostatic problem is unique, this sum must be the correct and only solution. The argument rests fundamentally on the linearity of the governing differential operator, the constitutive law, and the boundary condition operators.\n\n### Part B: One-Dimensional Stress Computation\n\nWe now apply this proven principle to the specified one-dimensional bar. The total stress $\\sigma$ is the sum of a purely mechanical stress $\\sigma_M$ and a purely thermal stress $\\sigma_T$: $\\sigma = \\sigma_M + \\sigma_T$.\n\nIn this 1D quasi-static problem with no body forces, the equilibrium equation $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0$ dictates that the axial stress must be uniform along the bar's length.\n\n**1. Calculate Mechanical Stress ($\\sigma_M$)**\nFor this subproblem, we set $\\Delta T(x)=0$ and apply the mechanical boundary conditions $u_M(0)=0$ and $u_M(L)=\\delta$.\n- The stress $\\sigma_M$ is constant.\n- The constitutive law is $\\sigma_M = E \\varepsilon_M = E \\frac{du_M}{dx}$.\n- Since $\\sigma_M$ and $E$ are constant, the strain $\\varepsilon_M$ is also constant.\n- Integrating the strain gives the displacement: $u_M(x) = \\varepsilon_M x + C$.\n- Applying the boundary conditions:\n  - $u_M(0) = 0 \\implies \\varepsilon_M(0) + C = 0 \\implies C = 0$.\n  - $u_M(L) = \\delta \\implies \\varepsilon_M L = \\delta$.\n- The mechanical strain is $\\varepsilon_M = \\frac{\\delta}{L}$.\n- The resulting mechanical stress is $\\sigma_M = E \\varepsilon_M = \\frac{E \\delta}{L}$.\n\n**2. Calculate Thermal Stress ($\\sigma_T$)**\nFor this subproblem, we apply the thermal load $\\Delta T(x) = \\Delta T_0\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$ with homogeneous mechanical boundary conditions $u_T(0)=0$ and $u_T(L)=0$.\n- The stress $\\sigma_T$ is constant.\n- The constitutive law is $\\sigma_T = E (\\varepsilon_T - \\alpha \\Delta T(x)) = E (\\frac{du_T}{dx} - \\alpha \\Delta T(x))$.\n- Rearranging for the strain: $\\frac{du_T}{dx} = \\frac{\\sigma_T}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x)$.\n- To find the total elongation, we integrate from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n  $$ u_T(L) - u_T(0) = \\int_0^L \\frac{du_T}{dx} dx = \\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_T}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x)\\right) dx $$\n- Applying the homogeneous boundary conditions $u_T(L)=0$ and $u_T(0)=0$:\n  $$ 0 = \\frac{\\sigma_T L}{E} + \\alpha \\int_0^L \\Delta T_0\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx $$\n- Evaluating the integral:\n  $$ \\int_0^L \\Delta T_0\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx = \\Delta T_0 \\left[x + \\frac{\\gamma x^2}{2L}\\right]_0^L = \\Delta T_0 \\left(L + \\frac{\\gamma L^2}{2L}\\right) = \\Delta T_0 L \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) $$\n- Substituting this back into the equation for $\\sigma_T$:\n  $$ 0 = \\frac{\\sigma_T L}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T_0 L \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) $$\n- Solving for $\\sigma_T$:\n  $$ \\frac{\\sigma_T L}{E} = - \\alpha \\Delta T_0 L \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) $$\n  $$ \\sigma_T = -E \\alpha \\Delta T_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Compute Total Stress ($\\sigma$)**\nThe total stress is the sum of the mechanical and thermal components:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_M + \\sigma_T $$\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{E \\delta}{L} - E \\alpha \\Delta T_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) $$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring out the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\left[ \\frac{\\delta}{L} - \\alpha \\Delta T_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis is the final expression for the uniform axial stress in the bar.",

Inverting $\\,\\mathbf{J}\\,$ yields:\n$$\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\end{Bmatrix} = \\mathbf{J}^{-1}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\nThe strains can now be expressed in terms of nodal displacements $\\,\\mathbf{d}^e = [u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, u_3, v_3, u_4, v_4]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\,$ via the strain-displacement matrix $\\,\\mathbf{B}\\,$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}^e\n$$\nThe matrix $\\,\\mathbf{B}\\,$ is a $\\,3 \\times 8\\,$ matrix composed of four $\\,3 \\times 2\\,$ blocks, $\\,\\mathbf{B} = [\\mathbf{B}_1, \\mathbf{B}_2, \\mathbf{B}_3, \\mathbf{B}_4]\\,$, where each block $\\,\\mathbf{B}_i\\,$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_i = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}  0 \\\\\n0  \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe spatial derivatives of the shape functions, e.g., $\\,\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}\\,$, are computed using the inverse Jacobian:\n$$\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} \\end{Bmatrix} = \\mathbf{J}^{-1}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**1.3. Element Stiffness Matrix and System Assembly**\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $\\,\\mathbf{K}^e\\,$ relates nodal forces to nodal displacements for an element. It is derived by substituting the discrete formulations into the weak form integral:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}^e = \\int_{A_e} \\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nwhere $\\,A_e\\,$ is the element area and $\\,\\mathbf{D}\\,$ is the material constitutive matrix for plane stress:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1  \\nu  0 \\\\ \n\\nu  1  0 \\\\ \n0  0  \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwith $\\,E\\,$ being Young's modulus and $\\,\\nu\\,$ Poisson's ratio.\nThe integral is evaluated numerically using Gaussian quadrature. Transforming to the parent domain:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}^e = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mathbf{B}(\\xi, \\eta)^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B}(\\xi, \\eta) \\det(\\mathbf{J}(\\xi, \\eta)) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi \\mathrm{d}\\eta\n$$\nUsing $\\,2 \\times 2\\,$ Gaussian quadrature, with points at $\\,(\\xi_g, \\eta_g) \\in \\{\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}, \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}\\}\\,$ and unit weights $\\,(w_g = 1)\\,$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}^e \\approx \\sum_{g=1}^{4} \\mathbf{B}(\\xi_g, \\eta_g)^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B}(\\xi_g, \\eta_g) \\det(\\mathbf{J}(\\xi_g, \\eta_g)) w_g\n$$\nThe global stiffness matrix $\\,\\mathbf{K}\\,$ for the entire mesh is formed by assembling the contributions from each element stiffness matrix $\\,\\mathbf{K}^e\\,$ into the appropriate global degrees of freedom. This results in the linear system $\\,\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{f}\\,$.\n\n**2. Patch Test Procedure**\n\nThe patch test verifies if the element can exactly represent a state of constant strain. This is achieved by prescribing a displacement field on the boundary of a \"patch\" of elements that corresponds to a constant strain field. The FEM solution for the interior nodes is then computed and checked against the exact analytical solution.\n\n**2.1. Boundary Conditions and System Solution**\n\nAn affine displacement field is prescribed on the boundary nodes of the mesh:\n$$\nu(x,y) = \\gamma + \\alpha x + \\beta y \\quad\\quad v(x,y) = \\zeta + \\delta x + \\varepsilon y\n$$\nThis field corresponds to a constant engineering strain state:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\text{target}} = \\alpha, \\quad \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\text{target}} = \\varepsilon, \\quad \\gamma_{xy}^{\\text{target}} = \\beta + \\delta\n$$\nThe program must first algorithmically identify the boundary nodes. This is done by iterating through all elements and counting the occurrences of each edge. Edges that belong to only one element are boundary edges, and their constituent nodes are boundary nodes.\n\nThe global system $\\,\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{f}\\,$ is partitioned into free and prescribed degrees of freedom (DOFs), denoted by subscripts $\\,f\\,$ and $\\,p\\,$ respectively:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{K}_{ff}  \\mathbf{K}_{fp} \\\\ \\mathbf{K}_{pf}  \\mathbf{K}_{pp} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\mathbf{d}_f \\\\ \\mathbf{d}_p \\end{Bmatrix} =\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\mathbf{f}_f \\\\ \\mathbf{f}_p \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacements $\\,\\mathbf{d}_p\\,$ for the boundary nodes are known from the prescribed affine field. Since there are no external nodal forces, the force vector for the free DOFs, $\\,\\mathbf{f}_f\\,$, is zero. The system to be solved for the unknown interior displacements $\\,\\mathbf{d}_f\\,$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{ff} \\mathbf{d}_f = - \\mathbf{K}_{fp} \\mathbf{d}_p\n$$\nThis smaller linear system is solved for $\\,\\mathbf{d}_f\\,$.\n\n**2.2. Error Evaluation**\n\nOnce the displacements $\\,\\mathbf{d}_f\\,$ are computed, the full displacement vector $\\,\\mathbf{d}\\,$ is assembled. Two error metrics are then calculated:\n1.  **Displacement Error $\\,e_u\\,$**: The maximum absolute difference between the computed nodal displacements and the exact analytical displacements from the affine field at all nodes.\n    $$\n    e_u = \\max_{i} \\left\\lvert d_i - d_i^{\\text{exact}} \\right\\rvert\n    $$\n    A correct formulation should reproduce the affine displacement field exactly, so $\\,e_u\\,$ should be on the order of machine precision.\n2.  **Strain Error $\\,e_{\\varepsilon}\\,$**: The maximum absolute difference between the computed strains at each Gauss point of every element and the target constant strains.\n    $$\n    e_{\\varepsilon} = \\max_{e,g,k} \\left\\lvert \\varepsilon_k^{(e,g)} - \\varepsilon_k^{\\text{target}} \\right\\rvert\n    $$\n    Here, $\\,\\varepsilon_k^{(e,g)}\\,$ is the $\\,k$-th component of strain (xx, yy, or xy) at Gauss point $\\,g\\,$ of element $\\,e\\,$, computed using $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}^e\\,$. This error should also be near zero.\n\nA test case passes if both $\\,e_u\\,$ and $\\,e_{\\varepsilon}\\,$ are below the specified tolerance of $\\,10^{-10}\\,$. This confirms the element's ability to satisfy the patch test. The implementation will now follow this rigorous procedure.",

Since the Cauchy stress tensor is, by the principle of conservation of angular momentum, a symmetric matrix ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{T}$), the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices guarantees that it has three real eigenvalues (the principal stresses $\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}, \\sigma_{3}$) and a set of three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors (the principal directions $\\boldsymbol{v}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{v}_{2}, \\boldsymbol{v}_{3}$).\n\nThe first principal stress is defined as the algebraically largest eigenvalue, typically denoted $\\sigma_{1}$, where $\\sigma_{1} \\ge \\sigma_{2} \\ge \\sigma_{3}$. The corresponding first principal direction is its associated eigenvector, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{1}$.\n\nThe computational procedure to solve this for each given stress tensor is as follows:\nFirst, we solve the eigenvalue problem. This is a standard task in numerical linear algebra. We will employ a robust eigensolver, such as the one available in the `NumPy` library for Python, specifically `numpy.linalg.eigh`. This function is optimized for symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices and has the convenient property of returning the eigenvalues sorted in ascending order. Consequently, the maximum eigenvalue, $\\sigma_{1}$, will be the last element in the returned array of eigenvalues. The corresponding eigenvector, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{1}$, will be the last column in the returned matrix of eigenvectors.\n\nSecond, we must adhere to the problem's uniqueness convention. The `numpy.linalg.eigh` function returns eigenvectors that are already normalized to have a unit Euclidean norm, satisfying the first part of the convention. The second part is a sign-fixing rule. An eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is equivalent to $-\\boldsymbol{v}$ as they both define the same direction (eigenspace). To ensure a single representation, we apply the specified procedure. Let the computed unit eigenvector be $\\boldsymbol{v} = [v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}]^{T}$, and let the tolerance be $\\tau = 10^{-12}$.\n1. Examine the first component, $v_{x}$. If $|v_{x}| > \\tau$, its sign determines the sign of the entire vector. If $v_{x}  0$, we set the final vector to $-\\boldsymbol{v}$. Otherwise, we use $\\boldsymbol{v}$ as is.\n2. If $|v_{x}| \\le \\tau$, we proceed to examine the second component, $v_{y}$. If $|v_{y}| > \\tau$, its sign determines the orientation. If $v_{y}  0$, we use $-\\boldsymbol{v}$. Otherwise, we use $\\boldsymbol{v}$.\n3. If both $|v_{x}| \\le \\tau$ and $|v_{y}| \\le \\tau$, we examine the third component, $v_{z}$. As the vector has unit norm, $|v_{z}|$ must be greater than $\\tau$. If $v_{z}  0$, we use $-\\boldsymbol{v}$. Otherwise, we use $\\boldsymbol{v}$.\nThis procedure ensures that the reported vector is unique.\n\nFinally, the components of the resulting unique direction vector are rounded to six decimal places, as required. This entire process is systematically applied to each of the five given stress tensors, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{1}$ through $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{5}$. The results are then aggregated into the specified final output format.",
