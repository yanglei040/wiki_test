This practice demonstrates this core concept by asking you to build a multivariate polynomial regression model from scratch.

            "problem": "Consider the task of learning a nonlinear mapping from molecular descriptors to the normal boiling point using a multivariate polynomial regression model. You are given a training set of compounds with three descriptors: molecular weight $M$ in grams per mole, topological polar surface area $A$ in square angstroms, and hydrogen bond donor count $H$ (unitless). The target is the normal boiling point $T_b$ in Kelvin. Your goal is to design and implement a program that, starting from first principles of least squares estimation, fits a second-degree multivariate polynomial model to the training data and then predicts the boiling points for a set of test compounds.\n\nFundamental base and constraints:\n- Start from the definition of least squares estimation as the minimization of the sum of squared residuals between observed and predicted targets.\n- Treat the nonlinear relationship by constructing a polynomial feature map of total degree up to $2$ on standardized inputs. Specifically, for a descriptor vector $\\mathbf{x} = [M,A,H]^\\top$, standardize to $\\mathbf{z} = ( \\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu} ) \\oslash \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are the component-wise mean and standard deviation computed from the training descriptors, and $\\oslash$ denotes elementwise division. Then construct the feature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z})$ containing the constant term, all linear terms, all unique pairwise interaction terms, and all squared terms up to degree $2$.\n- Fit the model parameters by minimizing the squared residuals over the training set. Do not include any regularization term.\n- Use the fitted model to predict $T_b$ for the provided test descriptors.\n\nTraining data (each tuple is $(M,A,H,T_b)$; $M$ in grams per mole, $A$ in square angstroms, $T_b$ in Kelvin):\n- $\\left(60,\\,20,\\,1,\\,369.0\\right)$\n- $\\left(80,\\,35,\\,0,\\,382.6\\right)$\n- $\\left(120,\\,40,\\,2,\\,440.0\\right)$\n- $\\left(150,\\,70,\\,1,\\,503.95\\right)$\n- $\\left(90,\\,25,\\,2,\\,401.9\\right)$\n- $\\left(110,\\,60,\\,0,\\,446.45\\right)$\n- $\\left(140,\\,50,\\,1,\\,449.5\\right)$\n- $\\left(70,\\,15,\\,0,\\,343.6\\right)$\n- $\\left(180,\\,80,\\,2,\\,557.4\\right)$\n- $\\left(200,\\,30,\\,3,\\,433.7\\right)$\n- $\\left(100,\\,45,\\,1,\\,429.95\\right)$\n- $\\left(130,\\,55,\\,2,\\,478.4\\right)$\n\nFeature construction requirements:\n- Compute the training-set mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and standard deviation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ of $M$, $A$, and $H$ using only the training descriptors.\n- For each descriptor vector, compute standardized descriptors $\\mathbf{z} = \\left[z_1, z_2, z_3\\right]^\\top$ as $z_i = \\left(x_i - \\mu_i\\right)/\\sigma_i$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n- Construct the degree-$2$ polynomial feature vector\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\left[1,\\, z_1,\\, z_2,\\, z_3,\\, z_1^2,\\, z_2^2,\\, z_3^2,\\, z_1 z_2,\\, z_1 z_3,\\, z_2 z_3 \\right]^\\top.\n$$\n\nModel fitting requirement:\n- Fit a linear model in the feature space $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z})$ to predict $T_b$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals over the training set, using ordinary least squares without regularization.\n\nTest suite:\n- Predict $T_b$ for the following four descriptor triplets $(M,A,H)$:\n  1. $\\left(95,\\,38,\\,1\\right)$\n  2. $\\left(160,\\,65,\\,2\\right)$\n  3. $\\left(50,\\,10,\\,0\\right)$\n  4. $\\left(210,\\,85,\\,3\\right)$\n\nAnswer specification and units:\n- Report each predicted normal boiling point in Kelvin.\n- Round each prediction to the nearest $0.01$ Kelvin.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four rounded predictions as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no additional text. For example, the required format is [$r_1$,$r_2$,$r_3$,$r_4$], where each $r_i$ is a float rounded to the nearest $0.01$ Kelvin.",
            "solution": "The problem statement submitted for consideration is valid. It presents a well-posed problem in computational engineering, specifically in the domain of quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR). The task is to construct a predictive model for the normal boiling point of chemical compounds based on a set of molecular descriptors. The problem provides all necessary data, a clear definition of the model structure, and a precise methodology for parameter estimation based on ordinary least squares. The problem is scientifically grounded, logically consistent, and free of ambiguity. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to fit a multivariate polynomial regression model. Although the relationship between the target variable, boiling point $T_b$, and the original descriptors $\\mathbf{x} = [M, A, H]^\\top$ is nonlinear, the problem is transformed into a linear regression problem by constructing a new set of features, $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z})$. The model hypothesis is linear in the coefficients $\\mathbf{w}$ with respect to these engineered features:\n$$\n\\hat{T}_b = f(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{x}))\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{z}$ is the standardized descriptor vector and $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of model parameters to be determined.\n\nThe parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ are found by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) over the training set of $N$ samples. The SSR, which serves as the cost function $J(\\mathbf{w})$, is given by:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (T_{b,i} - \\hat{T}_{b,i})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (T_{b,i} - \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_i))^2\n$$\nwhere $T_{b,i}$ is the observed boiling point for the $i$-th sample.\n\nTo facilitate the derivation, we express this in matrix notation. Let $\\mathbf{y}$ be the $N \\times 1$ vector of observed boiling points, and let $\\Phi$ be the $N \\times D$ design matrix, where each row $i$ is the feature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_i)^\\top$ for the $i$-th training sample, and $D$ is the number of features (including the constant term). In this problem, $N=12$ and $D=10$. The cost function becomes:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = (\\mathbf{y} - \\Phi\\mathbf{w})^\\top (\\mathbf{y} - \\Phi\\mathbf{w})\n$$\nExpanding this expression yields:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\Phi\\mathbf{w} - (\\Phi\\mathbf{w})^\\top\\mathbf{y} + (\\Phi\\mathbf{w})^\\top(\\Phi\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\mathbf{y} - 2\\mathbf{w}^\\top\\Phi^\\top\\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{w}^\\top\\Phi^\\top\\Phi\\mathbf{w}\n$$\nTo find the minimum of this quadratic function, we compute its gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$ and set it to the zero vector:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}} J(\\mathbf{w}) = -2\\Phi^\\top\\mathbf{y} + 2\\Phi^\\top\\Phi\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis leads to the normal equations:\n$$\n(\\Phi^\\top\\Phi)\\mathbf{w} = \\Phi^\\top\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nAssuming the matrix $\\Phi^\\top\\Phi$ is invertible (which is generally true if the columns of $\\Phi$ are linearly independent), the unique solution for the optimal weight vector $\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{OLS}}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{OLS}} = (\\Phi^\\top\\Phi)^{-1} \\Phi^\\top\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThis equation provides the analytical solution for ordinary least squares. The term $(\\Phi^\\top\\Phi)^{-1}\\Phi^\\top$ is known as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $\\Phi$.\n\nThe implementation will follow these procedural steps:\n1.  **Data Standardization:**\n    First, the training descriptor data, an $N \\times 3$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}$, is used to compute the component-wise mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and standard deviation vector $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. Standard deviation is calculated using $N$ in the denominator, corresponding to the population standard deviation.\n    $$\n    \\mu_j = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{ij}, \\quad \\sigma_j = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_{ij} - \\mu_j)^2}\n    $$\n    Each training descriptor vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is then standardized: $\\mathbf{z}_i = (\\mathbf{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\oslash \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Feature Engineering:**\n    For each standardized vector $\\mathbf{z}_i = \\left[z_{i,1}, z_{i,2}, z_{i,3}\\right]^\\top$, the feature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_i)$ is constructed as specified:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_i) = \\left[1,\\, z_{i,1},\\, z_{i,2},\\, z_{i,3},\\, z_{i,1}^2,\\, z_{i,2}^2,\\, z_{i,3}^2,\\, z_{i,1} z_{i,2},\\, z_{i,1} z_{i,3},\\, z_{i,2} z_{i,3} \\right]^\\top\n    $$\n    These $N$ feature vectors are stacked as rows to form the $N \\times D$ design matrix $\\Phi$, where $N=12$ and $D=10$.\n\n3.  **Solving the Normal Equations:**\n    The vector of training targets $\\mathbf{y}$ is formed from the given $T_b$ values. The linear system $(\\Phi^\\top\\Phi)\\mathbf{w} = \\Phi^\\top\\mathbf{y}$ is solved for $\\mathbf{w}$. While direct computation of the inverse $(\\Phi^\\top\\Phi)^{-1}$ is possible, it is numerically less stable than using a dedicated linear system solver.\n\n4.  **Prediction:**\n    For each test descriptor triplet $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{test}}$, it must first be standardized using the same $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ calculated from the training set. Then, the corresponding feature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_{\\text{test}})$ is constructed. The prediction is computed as the dot product:\n    $$\n    \\hat{T}_{b, \\text{test}} = \\mathbf{w}_{\\text{OLS}}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}_{\\text{test}})\n    $$\n    The final results are rounded to two decimal places.",

It describes a standard procedure in computational statistics for fitting a polynomial regression model in the presence of heteroscedastic noise, where the variance of the error term is proportional to the magnitude of the mean response. The proposed method, feasible weighted least squares (FWLS), implemented via iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), is a correct and established technique for this class of problems. All necessary data, model specifications, algorithmic steps, hyperparameters, and output formats are provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to estimate the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_d]^T$ for the polynomial model $\\mu(x;\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} \\beta_j x^j$.

However, the true mean $\\mu(x_i;\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is unknown. The IRLS algorithm resolves this by iteratively approximating the optimal weights.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nLet the given data be $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$. First, we construct the $n \\times (d+1)$ design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, where the $i$-th row is given by $[1, x_i, x_i^2, \\dots, x_i^d]$.

Generate synthetic data points $y_i$ using the provided true parameters $(\\theta_{\\text{true}})$ and time points $t_i$: $y_i = C(t_i; \\theta_{\\text{true}})$.\n2.  Set the current parameters $\\theta$ to the initial guess $\\theta_{\\text{old}}$.\n3.  Compute the residual vector $r$, where each element is $r_i = y_i - C(t_i; \\theta_{\\text{old}})$.\n4.  Compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ using the derived formula, evaluated at $\\theta_{\\text{old}}$ and for all $t_i$.\n5.  Construct the approximate Hessian matrix $H = J^T J + \\lambda I$, where $J^T$ is the transpose of $J$, $\\lambda = 10^{-6}$ is the damping parameter, and $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix.\n6.  Construct the right-hand side vector $g = J^T r$.\n7.  Solve the linear system of normal equations $H \\Delta \\theta = g$ for the parameter update vector $\\Delta \\theta$.\n8.  Calculate the new parameter estimate $\\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\theta_{\\text{old}} + \\Delta \\theta$.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented and executed for each of the four test cases specified in the problem statement.
