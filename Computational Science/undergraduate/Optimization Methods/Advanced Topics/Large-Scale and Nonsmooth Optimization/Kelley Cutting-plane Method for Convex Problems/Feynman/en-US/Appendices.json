            "solution": "The problem requires the application of Kelley's cutting-plane method to a convex minimization problem. We are tasked with performing three iterations of the algorithm, starting from a given initial point, and determining the optimal objective value of the third master problem.\n\nThe problem is to minimize $f(x) = \\max\\{x_1+x_2, 2x_1-x_2, 1-x_1\\}$ over the feasible set $X = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|x\\|_\\infty \\le 2\\}$. The set $X$ can be written explicitly as $X = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : -2 \\le x_1 \\le 2, -2 \\le x_2 \\le 2\\}$.\n\nThe Kelley's cutting-plane method generates a sequence of points $\\{y^k\\}$ and a sequence of lower bounds $\\{t^k\\}$ on the optimal value. At each iteration $k$, we solve a linear programming (LP) master problem to find the next iterate $y^{k+1}$ and the updated lower bound $t^{k+1}$. The master problem minimizes a variable $t$ subject to a set of linear inequalities, called cuts, which are derived from the subgradient inequality.\n\nThe $k$-th cut is given by $t \\ge f(y^k) + g^{k\\top}(x-y^k)$, where $g^k$ is a subgradient of $f$ at $y^k$. For a function defined as the maximum of several differentiable functions, a subgradient at a point can be taken as the gradient of any one of the functions that is active (i.e., achieves the maximum) at that point.\n\nLet the three affine functions be $f_1(x) = x_1+x_2$, $f_2(x) = 2x_1-x_2$, and $f_3(x) = 1-x_1$. Their gradients are, respectively, $g_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $g_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $g_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Iteration 0 ($k=0$)**\n\nWe start with the initial point $y^0 = (0,0)$.\n\n1.  **Oracle Query**: We first evaluate the objective function at $y^0$:\n    $$f(y^0) = f(0,0) = \\max\\{0+0, 2(0)-0, 1-0\\} = \\max\\{0, 0, 1\\} = 1$$\n    The active function is $f_3(x) = 1-x_1$. We choose the corresponding gradient as the subgradient:\n    $$g^0 = g_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n2.  **First Kelley Cut**: The first cut (Cut 1) is constructed using the subgradient inequality:\n    $$t \\ge f(y^0) + g^{0\\top}(x-y^0)$$\n    $$t \\ge 1 + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - 0 \\\\ x_2 - 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    $$t \\ge 1 - x_1$$\n\n3.  **First Master Problem (LP1)**: We minimize $t$ subject to the first cut and the constraint $x \\in X$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    (LP1) \\quad \\min_{x, t} \\quad & t \\\\\n    \\text{s.t.} \\quad & t \\ge 1 - x_1 \\\\\n    & -2 \\le x_1 \\le 2 \\\\\n    & -2 \\le x_2 \\le 2\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Solution to LP1**: To minimize $t$, we must minimize the right-hand side of the inequality, $1-x_1$. This is achieved by maximizing $x_1$ over the feasible set $X$. The maximum value is $x_1=2$.\n    The optimal value for $t$ is thus $t^1 = 1 - 2 = -1$.\n    The set of optimal solutions for $x$ is $\\{(x_1, x_2) : x_1=2, -2 \\le x_2 \\le 2\\}$.\n    According to the tie-breaking rule, we must select the solution with the smallest Euclidean norm $\\|x\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$. For $x_1=2$, this requires minimizing $\\sqrt{2^2 + x_2^2}$, which occurs at $x_2=0$.\n    Therefore, the next iterate is $y^1 = (2,0)$, with the objective value of the master problem being $t^1=-1$.\n\n**Iteration 1 ($k=1$)**\n\nWe proceed with the point $y^1 = (2,0)$.\n\n1.  **Oracle Query**: We evaluate $f$ at $y^1$:\n    $$f(y^1) = f(2,0) = \\max\\{2+0, 2(2)-0, 1-2\\} = \\max\\{2, 4, -1\\} = 4$$\n    The active function is $f_2(x) = 2x_1-x_2$. The subgradient is:\n    $$g^1 = g_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n2.  **Second Kelley Cut**: The second cut (Cut 2) is:\n    $$t \\ge f(y^1) + g^{1\\top}(x-y^1)$$\n    $$t \\ge 4 + \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - 2 \\\\ x_2 - 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    $$t \\ge 4 + 2(x_1-2) - x_2 = 4 + 2x_1 - 4 - x_2$$\n    $$t \\ge 2x_1 - x_2$$\n\n3.  **Second Master Problem (LP2)**: We add the new cut to the master problem:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    (LP2) \\quad \\min_{x, t} \\quad & t \\\\\n    \\text{s.t.} \\quad & t \\ge 1 - x_1 \\quad (\\text{Cut 1}) \\\\\n    & t \\ge 2x_1 - x_2 \\quad (\\text{Cut 2}) \\\\\n    & -2 \\le x_1 \\le 2, \\quad -2 \\le x_2 \\le 2\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Solution to LP2**: This is equivalent to finding $\\min_{x \\in X} \\max\\{1-x_1, 2x_1-x_2\\}$. The minimum of this pointwise maximum function will occur either at a vertex of the domain $X$ or at a point where $1-x_1=2x_1-x_2$.\n    - Check vertices of $X = [-2,2]^2$:\n      - $x=(2,2): \\max\\{1-2, 4-2\\} = \\max\\{-1, 2\\}=2$.\n      - $x=(2,-2): \\max\\{1-2, 4-(-2)\\} = \\max\\{-1, 6\\}=6$.\n      - $x=(-2,2): \\max\\{1-(-2), -4-2\\} = \\max\\{3, -6\\}=3$.\n      - $x=(-2,-2): \\max\\{1-(-2), -4-(-2)\\} = \\max\\{3, -2\\}=3$.\n    - Check points where $1-x_1=2x_1-x_2$, which simplifies to $x_2=3x_1-1$. On this line, the value of the max function is $1-x_1$. We need to find the minimum of $1-x_1$ for points $(x_1, 3x_1-1)$ that lie in $X$. This means maximizing $x_1$.\n      The line segment of $x_2 = 3x_1-1$ within $X$ is bounded by its intersections with the boundary of the box.\n      - At $x_2=2$: $2 = 3x_1-1 \\implies 3x_1=3 \\implies x_1=1$. Point is $(1,2)$.\n      - At $x_2=-2$: $-2 = 3x_1-1 \\implies 3x_1=-1 \\implies x_1=-1/3$. Point is $(-1/3, -2)$.\n      The maximum $x_1$ on this segment is $x_1=1$. At this point, $(1,2)$, the objective value is $1-1=0$.\n    Comparing all candidate values $\\{2,6,3,0,1-(-1/3)=4/3\\}$, the minimum is $0$.\n    This minimum occurs at the unique point $(1,2)$.\n    Thus, the solution is $y^2 = (1,2)$ and $t^2=0$.\n\n**Iteration 2 ($k=2$)**\n\nWe now use the point $y^2 = (1,2)$.\n\n1.  **Oracle Query**: Evaluate $f$ at $y^2$:\n    $$f(y^2) = f(1,2) = \\max\\{1+2, 2(1)-2, 1-1\\} = \\max\\{3, 0, 0\\} = 3$$\n    The active function is $f_1(x) = x_1+x_2$. The subgradient is:\n    $$g^2 = g_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n2.  **Third Kelley Cut**: The third cut (Cut 3) is:\n    $$t \\ge f(y^2) + g^{2\\top}(x-y^2)$$\n    $$t \\ge 3 + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - 1 \\\\ x_2 - 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    $$t \\ge 3 + (x_1-1) + (x_2-2) = 3 + x_1 - 1 + x_2 - 2$$\n    $$t \\ge x_1 + x_2$$\n\n3.  **Third Master Problem (LP3)**: Add the new cut to form LP3:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    (LP3) \\quad \\min_{x, t} \\quad & t \\\\\n    \\text{s.t.} \\quad & t \\ge 1 - x_1 \\quad (\\text{Cut 1}) \\\\\n    & t \\ge 2x_1 - x_2 \\quad (\\text{Cut 2}) \\\\\n    & t \\ge x_1 + x_2 \\quad (\\text{Cut 3}) \\\\\n    & -2 \\le x_1 \\le 2, \\quad -2 \\le x_2 \\le 2\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Solution to LP3**: This is equivalent to finding $t^3 = \\min_{x \\in X} \\max\\{1 - x_1, 2x_1 - x_2, x_1 + x_2\\}$.\n    The function $h(x) = \\max\\{1 - x_1, 2x_1 - x_2, x_1 + x_2\\}$ is convex. Its unconstrained minimum on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ occurs at a point where the subdifferential contains the zero vector. A candidate for such a point is where all three affine functions are equal:\n    $$1 - x_1 = 2x_1 - x_2 = x_1 + x_2$$\n    From $2x_1 - x_2 = x_1 + x_2$, we get $x_1 = 2x_2$.\n    Substitute this into $1 - x_1 = x_1 + x_2$:\n    $$1 - 2x_2 = 2x_2 + x_2$$\n    $$1 = 5x_2 \\implies x_2 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n    Then $x_1 = 2x_2 = 2(\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n    Let's check this with the third equality $1 - x_1 = 2x_1 - x_2$:\n    $1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $2(\\frac{2}{5}) - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$. The equalities hold.\n    The point where the three functions are equal is $x^* = (\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})$.\n    We check if this point is in the feasible set $X$:\n    $|x_1^*| = \\frac{2}{5} \\le 2$ and $|x_2^*| = \\frac{1}{5} \\le 2$. The point is inside $X$.\n    Since the unconstrained minimizer of the convex function $h(x)$ lies within the feasible set $X$, it is also the minimizer for the constrained problem.\n    The optimal solution for the x-variables is $y^3 = (\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})$.\n    The optimal value for $t$ is the value of the functions at this point:\n    $$t^3 = 1 - x_1 = 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n    The optimal value of the third master problem is $t^3 = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nSummary of results:\n- Cut 1: $t \\ge 1-x_1$. LP1 solution: $(y^1, t^1) = ((2,0), -1)$.\n- Cut 2: $t \\ge 2x_1-x_2$. LP2 solution: $(y^2, t^2) = ((1,2), 0)$.\n- Cut 3: $t \\ge x_1+x_2$. LP3 solution: $(y^3, t^3) = ((\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}), \\frac{3}{5})$.\nThe question asks for the exact value of $t^3$.",

Kelley's cutting-plane method approximates the convex epigraph from below with a polyhedral set formed by the intersection of half-spaces (the cuts). For a function with a smoothly curved epigraph, such as $f(x) = \\|Ax-b\\|_2$, each linear cut is tangent to the epigraph at only one point.

High curvature is precisely what makes linear approximations poor and causes slow convergence for first-order methods like Kelley's.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $t \\ge -\\dfrac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} x_{1} + \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} x_{2}$. Linear cuts are slow here because $\\|A x - b\\|_{2}$ is not convex, so planes cannot support the epigraph.**\n-   **Cut Formula**: This is incorrect. It is missing the constant term $f(x_k) - g_k^\\top x_k$. The full inequality is $t \\ge f(x_k) + g_k^\\top(x-x_k) = (f(x_k) - g_k^\\top x_k) + g_k^\\top x$. The constant term evaluates to $\\sqrt{5} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(-4(0) + 1(1)) = \\sqrt{5} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}}$. So the full inequality should be $t \\ge \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{-4x_1+x_2}{\\sqrt{5}}$. The formula provided is incomplete.\n-   **Explanation**: This explanation is fundamentally wrong. The function $f(x) = \\|A x - b\\|_{2}$ is a well-known example of a convex function. It is a composition of a convex function (the Euclidean norm) with an affine function. The entire theoretical foundation of Kelley's method rests on the function being convex, which guarantees that the subgradient-based cuts are valid global underestimators.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $t \\ge \\sqrt{5} - \\dfrac{-4 x_{1} + x_{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Linear cuts are slow because norms are non-differentiable everywhere, preventing effective tangential approximation.**\n-   **Cut Formula**: This is incorrect. The sign between the $f(x_k)$ term and the subgradient term is wrong. The supporting hyperplane inequality is $t \\ge f(x_k) + g_k^\\top(x-x_k)$, not $t \\ge f(x_k) - g_k^\\top(x-x_k)$.\n-   **Explanation**: This explanation is incorrect. The Euclidean norm $\\|z\\|_2$ is differentiable everywhere except at $z=0$. The statement that norms are \"non-differentiable everywhere\" is false.

            "solution": "The user has requested a computational experiment to compare two fundamental first-order methods for constrained convex optimization: Kelley's cutting-plane method and projected gradient descent. The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and all necessary parameters for implementation are provided. The core of the task is to implement both algorithms, track specified performance metrics at each iteration, and report the aggregated results for a suite of test cases.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation and Principles\n\nThe problem is to minimize a differentiable convex function $f(x)$ over a compact convex set $\\mathcal{X}$.\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} f(x)\n$$\nThe specific objective function is $f(x) \\equiv \\sqrt{1+\\lVert x\\rVert_2^2}$, and the feasible set is a hypercube $\\mathcal{X} \\equiv \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n : \\lVert x\\rVert_\\infty \\le R\\}$. The function $f(x)$ is minimized at $x^\\star=0$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{X}$ for all test cases as $R>0$.\n\nThe gradient of the objective function is essential for both methods and is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+\\lVert x\\rVert_2^2}} = \\frac{x}{f(x)}\n$$\nFor $x=0$, the gradient is $\\nabla f(0) = 0$.\n\nA cornerstone of both the analysis and Kelley's method is the first-order characterization of convexity, which states that a function's linear approximation at any point provides a global underestimator:\n$$\nf(y) \\ge f(x) + \\nabla f(x)^\\top (y-x) \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\n$$\nThis inequality defines a supporting hyperplane to the graph of $f$ at the point $(x, f(x))$.\n\nKelley's method leverages this by iteratively building a polyhedral lower model of $f(x)$ from the supporting hyperplanes at past iterates $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{t-1}$. The model $m_{t-1}(x)$ is the pointwise maximum of these hyperplanes:\n$$\nm_{t-1}(x) \\equiv \\max_{0\\le i\\le t-1} \\left\\{ f(x_i) + \\nabla f(x_i)^\\top (x-x_i) \\right\\}\n$$\nThe next iterate $x_t$ is chosen to minimize this model over $\\mathcal{X}$. This is equivalent to solving a linear program (LP).\n\nProjected gradient descent, on the other hand, takes a step in the negative gradient direction and then projects the result back into the feasible set $\\mathcal{X}$. The projection onto a hypercube is a simple coordinate-wise clipping operation.\n\nBoth methods are evaluated based on two metrics:\n1.  **Cumulative Envelope Error**: $\\sum_{t=1}^K e_t$, where $e_t = f(x_t) - m_{t-1}(x_t)$. This measures how much the true function value at the new iterate $x_t$ exceeds the prediction of the current polyhedral model. For Kelley's method, $m_{t-1}(x_t)$ is the optimal value of the master problem, whereas for PGD we must explicitly compute it using the history of iterates. A small error suggests the model is a good approximation of the function.\n2.  **Final Distance to Optimum**: $d_K = \\lVert x_K - x^\\star \\rVert_2 = \\lVert x_K \\rVert_2$. This measures how close the final iterate is to the true minimizer.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\n\n**Kelley's Cutting-Plane Method**\n\nAt each iteration $t$, we must find $x_t$ that minimizes the model $m_{t-1}(x)$ over $\\mathcal{X}$, with an added regularization term $\\varepsilon \\lVert x\\rVert_1$ for tie-breaking. This is formulated as the following linear program:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{x, t_{\\text{var}}, u} \\quad & t_{\\text{var}} + \\varepsilon \\sum_{j=1}^n u_j \\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\quad & t_{\\text{var}} \\ge f(x_i) + \\nabla f(x_i)^\\top (x - x_i), && \\forall i \\in \\{0, \\dots, t-1\\} \\\\\n& -R \\le x_j \\le R, && \\forall j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\\\\n& -u_j \\le x_j \\le u_j, && \\forall j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\\\\n& u_j \\ge 0, && \\forall j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe optimization variables for the LP solver are $z = [x_1, \\dots, x_n, t_{\\text{var}}, u_1, \\dots, u_n]$. The constraints are rearranged into the standard form $A_{ub} z \\le b_{ub}$ for the solver. The implementation uses `scipy.optimize.linprog` for this purpose. The envelope error at iterate $x_t$ is $e_t = f(x_t) - t_{\\text{var}}^*$, where $t_{\\text{var}}^*$ is the optimal value of the epigraph variable from the LP.\n\n**Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**\n\nThe PGD implementation is more direct. At each iteration $t$, the update rule is:\n1.  $g_{t-1} = \\nabla f(x_{t-1})$\n2.  $\\tilde{x}_t = x_{t-1} - \\alpha g_{t-1}$\n3.  $x_t = \\Pi_{\\mathcal{X}}(\\tilde{x}_t) = \\text{numpy.clip}(\\tilde{x}_t, -R, R)$\n\nFor PGD, a history of iterates $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{t-1}$ and gradients $\\{\\nabla f(x_i)\\}_{i=0}^{t-1}$ is maintained solely for the purpose of computing the envelope error $e_t = f(x_t) - m_{t-1}(x_t)$, as specified.\n\nThe implementation encapsulates these two algorithms in separate functions. A main driver function iterates through the specified test cases, calls the algorithm implementations, collects the results, and formats them into the required single-line string output. Numerical robustness is handled by ensuring that calculated envelope errors, which could be slightly negative due to floating-point arithmetic, are floored at $0$.",
