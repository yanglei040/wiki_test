            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of computational costs for two procedures related to the minimization of the least-squares objective function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|A x - b\\|^{2}$. We begin by analyzing the computational cost of a single iteration of the Coordinate Descent (CD) method and then the cost of a full gradient computation.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the operations within a single iteration of Coordinate Descent. The method involves selecting a coordinate $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and minimizing $f(x)$ with respect to the variable $x_i$, while holding all other coordinates $x_j$ (for $j \\neq i$) fixed. Let the current iterate be $x$ and the corresponding residual be $r = A x - b$. The update to $x_i$ can be written as $x_{i, \\text{new}} = x_i + \\delta$. The objective function becomes a function of the scalar step $\\delta$:\n$$h(\\delta) = f(x + \\delta e_i) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|A(x + \\delta e_i) - b\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\|(Ax - b) + \\delta A e_i\\|^2$$\nwhere $e_i$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector. Since $A e_i$ is the $i$-th column of $A$, denoted $a_i$, and $Ax-b=r$, we have:\n$$h(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|r + \\delta a_i\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(r^\\top r + 2\\delta a_i^\\top r + \\delta^2 a_i^\\top a_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\|r\\|^2 + 2\\delta a_i^\\top r + \\delta^2 \\|a_i\\|^2)$$\nTo find the optimal step $\\delta^*$, we set the derivative of $h(\\delta)$ with respect to $\\delta$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dh}{d\\delta} = a_i^\\top r + \\delta \\|a_i\\|^2 = 0$$\nThe quantity $a_i^\\top r$ is the $i$-th component of the gradient, $(\\nabla f(x))_i$. The optimal step is thus:\n$$\\delta^* = -\\frac{a_i^\\top r}{\\|a_i\\|^2}$$\nThe CD iteration consists of computing $\\delta^*$ and then updating $x_i$ and the residual $r$. The problem states that the residual $r$ is maintained at all times. The updates are:\n1. $x_i \\leftarrow x_i + \\delta^*$\n2. $r \\leftarrow r + \\delta^* a_i$\n\nWe now evaluate the arithmetic cost of one such iteration for a given coordinate $i$, measured in multiply-add operations.\nThe cost is based on the assumption that operations involving the sparse column $a_i$ cost proportionally to its number of non-zero entries, $\\text{nnz}_i$. The quantities $\\|a_i\\|^2$ are precomputed.\n\n- **Cost of computing $\\delta^*$**: The main computation is the dot product $a_i^\\top r$. The vector $a_i$ is sparse with $\\text{nnz}_i$ non-zero elements, while $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is treated as dense. This dot product requires $\\text{nnz}_i$ multiplications and $\\text{nnz}_i - 1$ additions. This corresponds to approximately $\\text{nnz}_i$ multiply-add operations. The subsequent division by the precomputed scalar $\\|a_i\\|^2$ is a single operation, which is negligible compared to the dot product for typical values of $\\text{nnz}_i$. Thus, the cost of computing the numerator $a_i^\\top r$ is the dominant part, which we account as $\\text{nnz}_i$ operations.\n\n- **Cost of updating $x_i$ and $r$**: The update $x_i \\leftarrow x_i + \\delta^*$ is a single scalar addition, with negligible cost. The update $r \\leftarrow r + \\delta^* a_i$ is a sparse vector update (a scaled vector addition, or `axpy` operation). Since $a_i$ has $\\text{nnz}_i$ non-zero entries, this operation involves scaling these $\\text{nnz}_i$ entries by $\\delta^*$ and adding them to the corresponding components of $r$. This requires $\\text{nnz}_i$ multiplications and $\\text{nnz}_i$ additions, for a total of $\\text{nnz}_i$ multiply-add operations.\n\nThe total cost for a single CD iteration on coordinate $i$, denoted $C_{\\text{CD}, i}$, is the sum of these costs:\n$$C_{\\text{CD}, i} = (\\text{cost of } a_i^\\top r) + (\\text{cost of } r + \\delta^* a_i) = \\text{nnz}_i + \\text{nnz}_i = 2 \\cdot \\text{nnz}_i$$\n\nThe problem states that the coordinate $i$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The probability of selecting any specific $i$ is $P(i) = \\frac{1}{n}$. The expected per-iteration cost of CD, $E[C_{\\text{CD}}]$, is the average of $C_{\\text{CD}, i}$ over all possible choices of $i$:\n$$E[C_{\\text{CD}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(i) \\cdot C_{\\text{CD}, i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n} (2 \\cdot \\text{nnz}_i) = \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{nnz}_i$$\nThe sum of non-zero entries over all columns, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{nnz}_i$, is by definition the total number of non-zero entries in the matrix $A$, denoted $\\text{nnz}(A)$. Therefore,\n$$E[C_{\\text{CD}}] = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{nnz}(A)}{n}$$\n\nNext, we determine the cost of computing the full gradient, $\\nabla f(x) = A^{\\top}(A x - b) = A^{\\top}r$. The $i$-th component of the gradient is given by the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A^\\top$ with $r$. The $i$-th row of $A^\\top$ is the $i$-th column of $A$, which is $a_i$. Thus, $(\\nabla f(x))_i = a_i^\\top r$.\nTo compute the full gradient vector, we must compute this dot product for every coordinate $i=1, \\dots, n$. The cost of computing the $i$-th component is $\\text{nnz}_i$. The total cost to compute the full gradient, $C_{\\nabla f}$, is the sum of the costs for all components:\n$$C_{\\nabla f} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\text{cost of } a_i^\\top r) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{nnz}_i = \\text{nnz}(A)$$\nThis is equivalent to performing the sparse matrix-vector product $A^\\top r$, which requires one multiply-add operation for each non-zero entry in $A^\\top$ (or $A$).\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the expected per-iteration CD cost to the full gradient cost.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{E[C_{\\text{CD}}]}{C_{\\nabla f}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{nnz}(A)}{n}}{\\text{nnz}(A)}$$\nAssuming the matrix $A$ is not the zero matrix, $\\text{nnz}(A) > 0$, and we can simplify the expression by canceling $\\text{nnz}(A)$:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{2}{n}$$\nThis result shows that the expected cost of one CD iteration is a factor of $\\frac{n}{2}$ cheaper than computing the full gradient, a key insight into the efficiency of coordinate methods on large-scale problems.",

The objective function is a standard quadratic form, and Gradient Descent and Block Coordinate Descent are fundamental, well-established algorithms for solving such problems. The setup is entirely consistent with standard literature in numerical optimization.\n- **Well-Posed**: The objective function $f(x)$ is a quadratic, and its Hessian is the matrix $Q$. The matrix $D = \\operatorname{diag}(\\kappa, 1, \\dots, 1)$ is positive definite because its diagonal entries are positive ($\\kappa > 0$, $1 > 0$). The matrix $\\rho \\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^\\top$ is positive semidefinite because $\\rho \\ge 0$. The sum of a positive definite matrix and a positive semidefinite matrix, $Q = D + \\rho \\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^\\top$, is positive definite. A function with a positive definite Hessian is strictly convex, which guarantees the existence of a unique minimizer $x^\\star$. Thus, a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: All elements of the problem—the function, algorithms, parameters, and stopping conditions—are defined with mathematical precision. The language is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is fully self-contained. It provides all necessary information (parameters $n, \\kappa, \\rho$; initial vector $x^{(0)}$; termination criteria) to implement the algorithms and reproduce the results. There are no contradictions in the provided specifications.\n- The remaining criteria (Unrealistic, Ill-Posed, Trivial, etc.) are also clearly satisfied. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in comparing optimization algorithms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires us to compare the convergence of Gradient Descent (GD) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) on a specific convex quadratic objective function $f(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} x^\\top Q x - b^\\top x$.\n\n**1. Preliminaries**\nThe function $f(x)$ is a strictly convex quadratic form, as its Hessian, $Q$, is positive definite. The unique global minimizer $x^\\star$ is found by setting the gradient $\\nabla f(x) = Qx - b$ to zero, which gives the linear system $Qx = b$. The solution is $x^\\star = Q^{-1}b$.\n\nFor the stopping criterion, we need the value of the function at the optimum, $f(x^\\star)$, and at the initial point, $f(x^{(0)})$.\nThe initial point is $x^{(0)} = \\mathbf{0}$, so $f(x^{(0)}) = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{0}^\\top Q \\mathbf{0} - b^\\top \\mathbf{0} = 0$.\nThe optimal value is $f(x^\\star) = \\tfrac{1}{2} (x^\\star)^\\top Q x^\\star - b^\\top x^\\star$. Since $Qx^\\star = b$, this simplifies to $f(x^\\star) = \\tfrac{1}{2} (x^\\star)^\\top b - b^\\top x^\\star = -\\tfrac{1}{2} b^\\top x^\\star$.\nThe stopping criterion is checked at the beginning of each iteration $t$ for the current iterate $x^{(t)}$:\n$$ \\frac{f(x^{(t)}) - f(x^\\star)}{f(x^{(0)}) - f(x^\\star)} \\le \\varepsilon $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$. The denominator is $f(x^{(0)}) - f(x^\\star) = 0 - (-\\tfrac{1}{2}b^\\top x^\\star) = \\tfrac{1}{2}b^\\top x^\\star$. This value is constant throughout the iterations.\n\n**2. Gradient Descent (GD) Algorithm**\nThe GD algorithm generates a sequence of iterates $x^{(t)}$ using the update rule:\n$$ x^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \\alpha \\nabla f(x^{(t)}) = x^{(t)} - \\alpha (Q x^{(t)} - b) $$\nThe step size $\\alpha$ is fixed to the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of $Q$, $\\alpha = 1/\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$. This choice is standard for quadratic objectives and guarantees convergence. The value of $\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$ must be computed for each test case. An iteration consists of a single gradient computation and one update step.\n\n**3. Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) Algorithm**\nThe BCD algorithm iteratively minimizes the objective function along one coordinate direction at a time, cycling through the coordinates. For a quadratic function, this minimization can be done exactly. One full iteration (or sweep) consists of updating all $n$ coordinates sequentially for $j=1, 2, \\dots, n$.\nThe update for the $j$-th coordinate, holding all other coordinates $x_k$ ($k \\ne j$) fixed, is derived by solving $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} = 0$.\nThe partial derivative is $(\\nabla f(x))_j = (Qx)_j - b_j = \\sum_{k=1}^n Q_{jk}x_k - b_j = 0$.\nIsolating the new $x_j$ (let's call it $x_j^{\\text{new}}$), we have:\n$$ Q_{jj} x_j^{\\text{new}} + \\sum_{k \\ne j} Q_{jk} x_k = b_j $$\n$$ x_j^{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{Q_{jj}} \\left( b_j - \\sum_{k \\ne j} Q_{jk} x_k \\right) $$\nIn the cyclic BCD implementation, when updating $x_j$, the values of $x_k$ for $k < j$ have already been updated in the current sweep, while values for $k > j$ are from the previous sweep. The diagonal entries of $Q$ are $Q_{11} = \\kappa + \\rho$ and $Q_{jj} = 1 + \\rho$ for $j > 1$. Since $\\kappa>0$ and $\\rho\\ge0$, all $Q_{jj}>0$, so the division is well-defined.\n\n**4. Implementation Plan**\nFor each test case $(n, \\kappa, \\rho)$:\n1. Construct the matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and vector $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2. Compute the exact minimizer $x^\\star$ by solving the linear system $Qx = b$.\n3. Compute the optimal function value $f(x^\\star)$.\n4. Compute the denominator of the stopping criterion, $f_0\\_minus\\_fs = f(x^{(0)}) - f(x^\\star)$.\n5. Run GD:\n   a. Compute $\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$ and set step size $\\alpha$.\n   b. Initialize $x = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   c. Iterate, counting steps, until the relative suboptimality is $\\le \\varepsilon$ or the iteration cap is reached.\n6. Run BCD:\n   a. Initialize $x = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   b. Iterate, counting full sweeps, until the relative suboptimality is $\\le \\varepsilon$ or the sweep cap is reached. In each sweep, update all $n$ coordinates.\n7. Store the iteration counts for both methods.\nFinally, format all results into the specified string.",

Many crucial problems in machine learning and statistics involve more complex, non-linear functions. This final practice guides you through adapting the BCD framework to one of the most important models in classification: regularized logistic regression. Deriving the coordinate-wise Newton update will demonstrate how to handle non-quadratic objectives and build a bridge from foundational principles to advanced, real-world applications .",

            "problem": "Consider a dataset of $m$ labeled examples $\\{(a_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ with $a_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $y_{i}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$. Define the regularized logistic regression objective\n$$\nf(x)\\;=\\;\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\ln\\!\\big(1+\\exp(-y_{i}\\,a_{i}^{\\top}x)\\big)\\;+\\;\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\|x\\|^{2},\n$$\nwhere $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\lambda>0$ is a regularization parameter. In a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, a common strategy is to update a single coordinate $x_{j}$ at a time while holding all other coordinates fixed. One principled way to construct such a one-dimensional update is to apply Newton’s method along coordinate $j$ using a diagonal approximation of the Hessian, which replaces the full Hessian by its diagonal entries.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of the gradient and Hessian of $f(x)$, and using only the chain rule and well-tested facts about the logistic function, derive an analytic expression for the coordinate-wise Newton update $x_{j}^{\\text{new}}$ (the updated value of $x_{j}$) in terms of the current $x$, the data $\\{a_{i},y_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}$, and $\\lambda$, when the Hessian is approximated by its diagonal. You may define the logistic function as $\\sigma(t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)}$ and use it in your derivation.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $x_{j}^{\\text{new}}$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It describes a standard procedure in optimization for machine learning and is mathematically well-posed and self-contained.\n\nThe objective is to derive the update rule for a single coordinate $x_j$ in a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework for the regularized logistic regression objective function:\n$$\nf(x) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\ln\\!\\big(1+\\exp(-y_{i}\\,a_{i}^{\\top}x)\\big)\\;+\\;\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\|x\\|^{2}\n$$\nThe update rule is specified as a one-dimensional Newton step along the coordinate $x_j$. For a function of a single variable $g(t)$, a Newton step from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$ is given by $t_{k+1} = t_k - \\frac{g'(t_k)}{g''(t_k)}$. In our context, we are optimizing $f(x)$ with respect to a single coordinate $x_j$ while keeping all other coordinates $x_k$ (for $k \\neq j$) fixed. The update for $x_j$ is therefore:\n$$\nx_{j}^{\\text{new}} = x_j - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}}{\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j^2}}\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}$ is the $j$-th component of the gradient of $f(x)$, denoted $(\\nabla f(x))_j$. The term $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j^2}$ is the $j$-th diagonal element of the Hessian matrix of $f(x)$, denoted $(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj}$. This corresponds exactly to the specified method of using the diagonal of the Hessian.\n\nOur derivation proceeds in two steps: first, we compute the partial derivative $(\\nabla f(x))_j$, and second, we compute the second-order partial derivative $(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj}$.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the logistic sigmoid function, $\\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)}$. We will use this function and its properties.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the Gradient Component $(\\nabla f(x))_j$**\n\nThe objective function consists of two parts: the loss term $L(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\ln(1+\\exp(-y_{i}\\,a_{i}^{\\top}x))$ and the regularization term $R(x) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\|x\\|^{2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2$. The gradient is the sum of the gradients of these two parts.\n\nThe partial derivative of the regularization term with respect to $x_j$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R(x)}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (2x_j) = \\lambda x_j\n$$\n\nFor the loss term, we apply the chain rule. Let $t_i(x) = y_i a_i^\\top x$. Then the $i$-th term in the sum is $\\ln(1+\\exp(-t_i))$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\ln(1+\\exp(-t_i)) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t_i)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}(1+\\exp(-t_i))\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t_i)} \\cdot \\exp(-t_i) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial(-t_i)}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nThe derivative of the argument $-t_i(x)$ with respect to $x_j$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(-t_i)}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} (-y_i a_i^\\top x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(-y_i \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}x_k\\right) = -y_i a_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\ln(1+\\exp(-t_i)) = \\frac{\\exp(-t_i)}{1+\\exp(-t_i)} \\cdot (-y_i a_{ij}) = -\\frac{\\exp(-y_i a_i^\\top x)}{1+\\exp(-y_i a_i^\\top x)} y_i a_{ij}\n$$\nWe can express the fraction in terms of the sigmoid function $\\sigma(t)$. Notice that $\\sigma(t) - 1 = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1+\\exp(-t))}{1+\\exp(-t)} = -\\frac{\\exp(-t)}{1+\\exp(-t)}$.\nThus, the partial derivative of the $i$-th loss term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\ln(1+\\exp(-y_i a_i^\\top x)) = (\\sigma(y_i a_i^\\top x) - 1) y_i a_{ij}\n$$\nSumming over all data points $i=1, \\dots, m$ gives the partial derivative of the total loss $L(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L(x)}{\\partial x_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^m y_i a_{ij} (\\sigma(y_i a_i^\\top x) - 1)\n$$\nCombining the derivatives of the loss and regularization terms, we obtain the full gradient component:\n$$\n(\\nabla f(x))_j = \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x_j} = \\lambda x_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i} a_{ij} (\\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x) - 1)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Hessian Diagonal Element $(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj}$**\n\nTo find the diagonal element of the Hessian, we differentiate $(\\nabla f(x))_j$ with respect to $x_j$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x_j^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\lambda x_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i} a_{ij} (\\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x) - 1)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i} a_{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x)\n$$\nWe need the derivative of the sigmoid function, $\\sigma'(t)$. Using the quotient rule or chain rule:\n$$\n\\sigma'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( (1+\\exp(-t))^{-1} \\right) = -(1+\\exp(-t))^{-2} \\cdot (-\\exp(-t)) = \\frac{\\exp(-t)}{(1+\\exp(-t))^2}\n$$\nA well-known identity for $\\sigma'(t)$ is $\\sigma'(t) = \\sigma(t)(1-\\sigma(t))$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t)(1-\\sigma(t)) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-t)} \\frac{\\exp(-t)}{1+\\exp(-t)} = \\frac{\\exp(-t)}{(1+\\exp(-t))^2} = \\sigma'(t)\n$$\nUsing this identity and the chain rule on $\\sigma(y_i a_i^\\top x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x) = \\sigma'(y_i a_i^\\top x) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}(y_i a_i^\\top x) = \\sigma'(y_i a_i^\\top x) \\cdot (y_i a_{ij})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the second derivative:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj} = \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i} a_{ij} \\left( \\sigma'(y_i a_i^\\top x) \\cdot y_i a_{ij} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i}^2 a_{ij}^2 \\sigma'(y_i a_i^\\top x)\n$$\nSince $y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, we have $y_i^2 = 1$. Using the identity for $\\sigma'(t)$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj} = \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij}^2 \\sigma(y_{i}a_{i}^{\\top}x)(1 - \\sigma(y_{i}a_{i}^{\\top}x))\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Newton Update Rule**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for the gradient component and the Hessian diagonal element into the Newton update formula:\n$$\nx_{j}^{\\text{new}} = x_j - \\frac{(\\nabla f(x))_j}{(\\nabla^2 f(x))_{jj}}\n$$\n$$\nx_{j}^{\\text{new}} = x_j - \\frac{\\lambda x_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} y_{i} (\\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x) - 1)}{\\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij}^2 \\sigma(y_{i}a_{i}^{\\top}x)(1 - \\sigma(y_{i} a_{i}^{\\top} x))}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the coordinate-wise Newton update.",
