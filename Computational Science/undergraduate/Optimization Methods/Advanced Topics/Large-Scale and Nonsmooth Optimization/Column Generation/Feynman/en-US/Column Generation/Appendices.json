The coefficient multiplying $x_{p}$ in the Lagrangian, namely $c_{p} - a_{p}^{\\top} \\pi$, is the reduced cost of variable $x_{p}$ with respect to the dual vector $\\pi$. This follows because, for a given $\\pi$, the Lagrangian provides a linearized measure of how introducing a small positive amount of $x_{p}$ changes the objective after accounting for the value of the constraints through $\\pi$. In column generation, the pricing subproblem evaluates this reduced cost to decide whether adding the corresponding column can improve the current Restricted Master Problem solution (for a minimization problem, a negative reduced cost indicates potential improvement).\n\nThus, for each candidate column $p$, the reduced cost is\n$$\nr_{p} = c_{p} - a_{p}^{\\top} \\pi.\n$$\n\nWe are given $\\pi = (1,1)$ and three candidates:\n\n1.

Both variables are basic and strictly positive.\n\nTo find the optimal dual variables $\\pi^{\\text{before}} = (\\pi_{1}^{\\text{before}}, \\pi_{2}^{\\text{before}})$, we use the complementary slackness condition, which states that for basic variables, their corresponding reduced cost is zero.\nFor column $1$ (a basic variable):\n$$ \\bar{c}_{1} = c_{1} - (a_{11}\\pi_{1} + a_{21}\\pi_{2}) = 0 $$\n$$ 1.18 - (1 \\cdot \\pi_{1}^{\\text{before}} + 0 \\cdot \\pi_{2}^{\\text{before}}) = 0 \\implies \\pi_{1}^{\\text{before}} = 1.18 $$\nFor column $2$ (a basic variable):\n$$ \\bar{c}_{2} = c_{2} - (a_{12}\\pi_{1} + a_{22}\\pi_{2}) = 0 $$\n$$ 1.22 - (0 \\cdot \\pi_{1}^{\\text{before}} + 1 \\cdot \\pi_{2}^{\\text{before}}) = 0 \\implies \\pi_{2}^{\\text{before}} = 1.22 $$\nThus, the initial dual vector is $\\pi^{\\text{before}} = (1.18, 1.22)$.\n\n**2.

The new RMP is:\n$$ \\min \\ 1.18 x_{1} + 1.22 x_{2} + 2.35 x_{3} $$\nSubject to:\n$$ x_{1} + x_{3} = 1 $$\n$$ x_{2} + x_{3} = 1 $$\n$$ x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \\ge 0 $$\nTo solve this, we can perform a pivot of the simplex algorithm. Column $3$ enters the basis. The current basic solution is $x_1=1, x_2=1$. A standard ratio test would determine the leaving variable. However, we can also determine the new optimal basis by examining the problem structure. The solution will involve some combination of the variables $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$. By inspection, setting $x_3=1$ implies $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$. This solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (0,0,1)$ is feasible and gives an objective value of $2.35$. The initial solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (1,1,0)$ had an objective value of $1.18 + 1.22 = 2.40$. Since $2.35  2.40$, the new solution is better.\n\nAt the new optimal primal solution, $x_3=1$ is strictly positive and therefore must be in the basis. Since there are two constraints, the basis must contain two columns. This indicates a degenerate optimal solution, where a basic variable has a value of zero. The other basic variable can be either column $1$ or column $2$. Let's choose column $2$ to remain in the basis (along with the entering column $3$). This choice corresponds to a valid simplex pivot where $x_1$ leaves the basis.\n\nThe new basis consists of columns $\\{3, 2\\}$. The basis matrix $B$ and the corresponding cost vector $c_B$ are:\n$$ B = [a_{\\cdot 3} \\ a_{\\cdot 2}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c_B = \\begin{pmatrix} c_3 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.35 \\\\ 1.22 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe new dual variables $\\pi^{\\text{after}}$ are computed via the formula $\\pi^{\\text{after}\\top} = c_B^\\top B^{-1}$.\nFirst, we find the inverse of the basis matrix:\n$$ B^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -0 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute $\\pi^{\\text{after}}$:\n$$ \\pi^{\\text{after}\\top} = c_B^\\top B^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.35  1.22 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\pi^{\\text{after}\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.35 \\cdot 1 + 1.22 \\cdot (-1)  2.35 \\cdot 0 + 1.22 \\cdot 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.35 - 1.22  1.22 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.13  1.22 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo, the updated dual vector is $\\pi^{\\text{after}} = (1.13, 1.22)$.\nTo confirm optimality, the reduced cost of the non-basic variable $x_1$ must be non-negative:\n$$ \\bar{c}_{1}^{\\text{after}} = c_{1} - \\pi^{\\text{after}\\top} a_{\\cdot 1} = 1.18 - (1.13 \\cdot 1 + 1.22 \\cdot 0) = 1.18 - 1.13 = 0.05 \\ge 0 $$\nThe solution is optimal for the augmented RMP.\n\n**4.

This involves two main tasks: first, solving a restricted master problem (RMP) and finding its dual prices, and second, using these prices to solve a pricing subproblem to find a new cutting pattern with the most negative reduced cost.\n\n### Part 1: Restricted Master Problem and Dual Prices\n\nThe initial Restricted Master Problem (RMP) is formulated using a given subset of feasible cutting patterns. The objective is to satisfy total demand for all item types while minimizing the total number of rolls used.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Roll length: $L = 17$.\n- Item sizes: $s_1 = 3$, $s_2 = 4$, $s_3 = 7$.\n- Demands: $d_1 = 3$, $d_2 = 2$, $d_3 = 2$.\n\nThe initial basic patterns, denoted $p_1, p_2, p_3$, are the \"single-size maximal-fill\" patterns.\n- Pattern $p_1$: Cuts only items of size $s_1=3$. The number of items is $\\lfloor L/s_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 17/3 \\rfloor = 5$. The pattern vector is $a_{\\cdot 1} = (5, 0, 0)$.\n- Pattern $p_2$: Cuts only items of size $s_2=4$. The number of items is $\\lfloor L/s_2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 17/4 \\rfloor = 4$. The pattern vector is $a_{\\cdot 2} = (0, 4, 0)$.\n- Pattern $p_3$: Cuts only items of size $s_3=7$. The number of items is $\\lfloor L/s_3 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 17/7 \\rfloor = 2$. The pattern vector is $a_{\\cdot 3} = (0, 0, 2)$.\n\nLet $x_p \\ge 0$ be the decision variable representing how many times pattern $p$ is used. The LP-relaxed RMP is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad Z =  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad  5x_1 \\ge 3  (\\text{demand for size } 3) \\\\\n 4x_2 \\ge 2  (\\text{demand for size } 4) \\\\\n 2x_3 \\ge 2  (\\text{demand for size } 7) \\\\\n x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nTo minimize the sum $x_1+x_2+x_3$, we must choose the smallest possible values for each variable that satisfy the constraints. This yields the optimal primal solution for the RMP:\n$x_1^* = \\frac{3}{5}$, $x_2^* = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $x_3^* = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\nThe optimal objective value is $Z^* = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{10}{10} = \\frac{21}{10}$.\n\nNext, we formulate the dual of this RMP. Let $\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ be the dual variables associated with the three demand constraints. The dual problem is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad W =  3\\pi_1 + 2\\pi_2 + 2\\pi_3 \\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad  5\\pi_1 \\le 1  (\\text{dual constraint for } x_1) \\\\\n 4\\pi_2 \\le 1  (\\text{dual constraint for } x_2) \\\\\n 2\\pi_3 \\le 1  (\\text{dual constraint for } x_3) \\\\\n \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3 \\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\nTo find the optimal dual variables, we apply the principle of complementary slackness. The relevant condition states that for any optimal primal solution variable $x_p^*  0$, the corresponding dual constraint must be binding (satisfied with equality). In our case, $x_1^* = \\frac{3}{5}  0$, $x_2^* = \\frac{1}{2}  0$, and $x_3^* = 1  0$. Thus, all three dual constraints must be tight at the optimum:\n- $5\\pi_1^* = 1 \\implies \\pi_1^* = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $4\\pi_2^* = 1 \\implies \\pi_2^* = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $2\\pi_3^* = 1 \\implies \\pi_3^* = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThese values satisfy the non-negativity constraints $\\pi_i^* \\ge 0$. The optimal dual variables, often called simplex multipliers or shadow prices, are $\\pi^* = (\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n### Part 2: Pricing Subproblem and Reduced Cost\n\nThe next step in column generation is to find a new pattern that, if added to the RMP, could lead to a better solution. We search for a pattern $p$ with a negative reduced cost, $\\bar{c}_p$. The reduced cost of a pattern $p$ with vector $a_{\\cdot p} = (a_{1p}, a_{2p}, a_{3p})$ is given by:\n$$ \\bar{c}_p = c_p - \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\pi_i^* a_{ip} $$\nwhere $c_p=1$ is the cost of using the pattern (one roll). Using the optimal dual prices, we have:\n$$ \\bar{c}_p = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{5}a_{1p} + \\frac{1}{4}a_{2p} + \\frac{1}{2}a_{3p} \\right) $$\nTo find the pattern with the minimum reduced cost, we must find a feasible pattern that maximizes the quantity $\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\pi_i^* a_{ip}$. This is the pricing subproblem. It can be formulated as an integer knapsack problem:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z_{sub} =  \\frac{1}{5}a_1 + \\frac{1}{4}a_2 + \\frac{1}{2}a_3 \\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad  3a_1 + 4a_2 + 7a_3 \\le 17 \\\\\n a_1, a_2, a_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\n\\end{align*}\nHere, the item sizes $s_i$ are the \"weights,\" the dual prices $\\pi_i^*$ are the \"values,\" and the roll length $L$ is the \"knapsack capacity.\"\n\nWe solve this integer knapsack problem. This can be done using dynamic programming. Let $f(w)$ be the maximum value achievable with a capacity of $w$. We need to compute $f(17)$. The recurrence relation is:\n$$ f(w) = \\max \\left\\{ f(w-3) + \\frac{1}{5}, f(w-4) + \\frac{1}{4}, f(w-7) + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\} $$\nSolving this systematically, or by inspection for a small problem, we test combinations of items $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ that satisfy the capacity constraint $3a_1 + 4a_2 + 7a_3 \\le 17$.\n- Pattern $(5,0,0)$: weight $15$, value $5 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 1$.\n- Pattern $(0,4,0)$: weight $16$, value $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n- Pattern $(0,0,2)$: weight $14$, value $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n- Pattern $(1,0,2)$: weight $3(1)+7(2) = 17$, value $1 \\times \\frac{1}{5} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{5} + 1 = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n- Pattern $(3,0,1)$: weight $3(3)+7(1) = 16$, value $3 \\times \\frac{1}{5} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{11}{10}$.\n- Pattern $(2,1,1)$: weight $3(2)+4(1)+7(1) = 6+4+7=17$, value $2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{8+5+10}{20} = \\frac{23}{20}$.\n- Pattern $(0,2,1)$: weight $4(2)+7(1)=15$, value $2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1$.\n\nComparing the values:\n$\\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$\n$\\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$\n$\\frac{23}{20} = 1.15$\n$1$\n\nThe maximum value is $Z_{sub}^* = \\frac{6}{5}$, achieved with the pattern $a^* = (1, 0, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal reduced cost using this maximal value:\n$$ \\bar{c}_{min} = 1 - Z_{sub}^* = 1 - \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{5}{5} - \\frac{6}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5} $$\nSince the minimal reduced cost is negative, the current LP solution is not optimal for the full (unrestricted) master problem. The pattern $(1,0,2)$ is a candidate to enter the basis in the next iteration of the column generation algorithm. The problem asks only for the value of this minimal reduced cost.",
