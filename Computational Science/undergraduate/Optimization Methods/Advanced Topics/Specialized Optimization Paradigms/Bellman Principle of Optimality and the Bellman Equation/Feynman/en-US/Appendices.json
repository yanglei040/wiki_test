            "solution": "This problem is a deterministic finite-horizon optimal control problem. The solution requires applying the principle of optimality via dynamic programming. The analysis proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we address the non-Markovian nature of the problem and formulate the appropriate dynamic programming recursion.\nA stochastic process is Markovian if the conditional probability distribution of future states, given the present and past states, depends only upon the present state. In the context of optimal control, the decision-making process is Markovian if the optimal control at time $t$ depends only on the current state $x_t$. The total cost to be minimized is the sum of stage costs, $\\sum_{t=0}^{1} \\ell(x_t, u_t, u_{t-1})$. The stage cost at time $t$, $\\ell(x_t, u_t, u_{t-1}) = x_t^2 + u_t^2 + k \\,\\mathbf{1}\\{u_t \\neq u_{t-1}\\}$, explicitly depends on the previous control, $u_{t-1}$. To choose the optimal control $u_t$, a decision-maker at time $t$ must know both the state $x_t$ and the previous control $u_{t-1}$ to correctly evaluate the switching penalty. Since $u_{t-1}$ is not part of the state $x_t$, the information contained in $x_t$ alone is insufficient to make an optimal decision for the future. Therefore, the decision process with state $x_t$ is not Markovian.\n\nTo restore the Markov property, we must augment the state to include all information necessary for decision-making. We define an augmented state $s_t = (x_t, u_{t-1})$ for $t \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. With this definition, the state at time $t$ is $s_t = (x_t, u_{t-1})$, and the control is $u_t$. The state transition is given by $s_{t+1} = (x_{t+1}, u_t) = (x_t + u_t, u_t)$. The new state $s_{t+1}$ depends only on the current state $s_t$ and the current control $u_t$. The stage cost $\\ell(x_t, u_t, u_{t-1})$ can be written as a function $\\tilde{\\ell}(s_t, u_t)$, which depends only on the augmented state and the control. This structure ensures the process is a Markov Decision Process.\n\nThe value function, $V_t(s_t)$, represents the optimal cost-to-go from state $s_t$ at time $t$. We write it as $V_t(x_t, u_{t-1})$. The Bellman equation, derived from the principle of optimality, is:\n$$V_t(x_t, u_{t-1}) = \\min_{u_t \\in \\mathcal{U}} \\left\\{ \\ell(x_t, u_t, u_{t-1}) + V_{t+1}(x_{t+1}, u_t) \\right\\}$$\nSubstituting the problem's specifics, for $t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the recursion is:\n$$V_t(x_t, u_{t-1}) = \\min_{u_t \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}} \\left\\{ x_t^2 + u_t^2 + k \\, \\mathbf{1}\\{u_t \\neq u_{t-1}\\} + V_{t+1}(x_t + u_t, u_t) \\right\\}$$\nThe terminal condition is that the cost at time $t=2$ is zero, which means $V_2(x_2, u_1) = 0$ for all possible $x_2$ and $u_1$.\n\nSecond, we compute the optimal cost $V_0(1, 0)$ for the specific instance where $k=1$, $x_0=1$, and $u_{-1}=0$. We work backward in time from $t=2$.\n\n**Time $t=2$**: The terminal value function is given as zero.\n$$V_2(x_2, u_1) = 0$$\n\n**Time $t=1$**: We compute $V_1(x_1, u_0)$.\n$$V_1(x_1, u_0) = \\min_{u_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}} \\left\\{ x_1^2 + u_1^2 + 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{u_1 \\neq u_0\\} + V_2(x_1 + u_1, u_1) \\right\\}$$\nSince $V_2(\\cdot, \\cdot) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$V_1(x_1, u_0) = x_1^2 + \\min_{u_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}} \\left\\{ u_1^2 + \\mathbf{1}\\{u_1 \\neq u_0\\} \\right\\}$$\nThe minimization depends on the value of $u_0 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n- If $u_0 = 0$: The term to minimize is $\\min \\{(-1)^2 + 1, 0^2 + 0, 1^2 + 1\\} = \\min\\{2, 0, 2\\} = 0$. Thus, $V_1(x_1, 0) = x_1^2$.\n- If $u_0 = 1$: The term to minimize is $\\min \\{(-1)^2 + 1, 0^2 + 1, 1^2 + 0\\} = \\min\\{2, 1, 1\\} = 1$. Thus, $V_1(x_1, 1) = x_1^2 + 1$.\n- If $u_0 = -1$: The term to minimize is $\\min \\{(-1)^2 + 0, 0^2 + 1, 1^2 + 1\\} = \\min\\{1, 1, 2\\} = 1$. Thus, $V_1(x_1, -1) = x_1^2 + 1$.\n\n**Time $t=0$**: We compute $V_0(1, 0)$.\n$$V_0(1, 0) = \\min_{u_0 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}} \\left\\{ 1^2 + u_0^2 + 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{u_0 \\neq 0\\} + V_1(1 + u_0, u_0) \\right\\}$$\nWe evaluate the expression in the braces for each possible control $u_0$:\n- For $u_0 = -1$: The cost is $1^2 + (-1)^2 + \\mathbf{1}\\{-1 \\neq 0\\} + V_1(1 - 1, -1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + V_1(0, -1)$. Using our derived function, $V_1(0, -1) = 0^2 + 1 = 1$. The total cost is $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\n- For $u_0 = 0$: The cost is $1^2 + 0^2 + \\mathbf{1}\\{0 \\neq 0\\} + V_1(1 + 0, 0) = 1 + 0 + 0 + V_1(1, 0)$. Using our derived function, $V_1(1, 0) = 1^2 = 1$. The total cost is $1+0+0+1 = 2$.\n- For $u_0 = 1$: The cost is $1^2 + 1^2 + \\mathbf{1}\\{1 \\neq 0\\} + V_1(1 + 1, 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + V_1(2, 1)$. Using our derived function, $V_1(2, 1) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$. The total cost is $1+1+1+5 = 8$.\n\nComparing the three outcomes, the minimum cost is $2$, which occurs when $u_0=0$.\nTherefore, $V_0(1, 0) = 2$.\n\nThird, we discuss the computational implications of the state augmentation.\nIn a typical dynamic programming setting with a continuous state space like $\\mathbb{R}$, we must discretize the space to apply the algorithm numerically. Let the discretized space for the $x$ component be $\\mathcal{X}$, with size $|\\mathcal{X}|$. The control space $\\mathcal{U}$ is already discrete with size $|\\mathcal{U}|=3$.\n\nWithout state augmentation, the (hypothetical, incorrect) state space would just be $\\mathcal{X}$, with size $|\\mathcal{X}|$. A DP backup for each state would involve iterating through $|\\mathcal{U}|$ controls. The total complexity of one time-step update would be proportional to $|\\mathcal{X}| \\times |\\mathcal{U}|$.\n\nWith the augmented state $s_t = (x_t, u_{t-1})$, the state space becomes the Cartesian product of the discretized $x$-space and the control space, $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{U}$. The size of this augmented state space is $|\\mathcal{X}| \\times |\\mathcal{U}|$. To compute the value function for each of these states at time $t$, we must minimize over all possible controls $u_t \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Thus, for each of the $|\\mathcal{X}| \\times |\\mathcal{U}|$ states, we perform $|\\mathcal{U}|$ evaluations. The total complexity of one time-step update (a full DP backup) becomes proportional to $(|\\mathcal{X}| \\times |\\mathcal{U}|) \\times |\\mathcal{U}| = |\\mathcal{X}| \\times |\\mathcal{U}|^2$.\n\nThe augmentation increases the size of the state space that must be evaluated by a factor of $|\\mathcal{U}|$. Consequently, the computational complexity of each DP backup is also increased by a factor of $|\\mathcal{U}|$. In this specific problem, $|\\mathcal{U}| = 3$, so the state space size and per-step computational effort are both tripled compared to a naive (and incorrect) model that ignores the switching cost's dependency on past actions. This is a manifestation of the \"curse of dimensionality,\" where expanding the state vector leads to exponential growth in the state space volume and computational cost.",

As stage $2$ is the terminal stage, $V_2(s_2)$ is simply the minimum possible cost at this stage, given by $V_2(s_2) = \\min_{u_2} c_2(s_2, u_2)$, where $c_2$ is the stage-$2$ cost.

The time to reach $t$ from $t$ is $0$, regardless of the energy level upon arrival.\n$$V(t, e) = 0, \\quad \\forall e \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$$\n\nFor any other node $i \\neq t$, the value function $V(i, e)$ is determined by taking the minimum over the costs of all possible actions from state $(i, e)$. The possible actions are traversing to an adjacent node or recharging (if at a recharge station).\n\nLet $\\mathcal{N}(i)$ denote the set of nodes $j$ for which a directed arc $(i,j)$ exists. The cost of traversing an arc $(i, j)$ is the sum of the travel time $d_{ij}$ and the minimum future cost from the new state $(j, e - c_{ij})$. This action is only feasible if the current energy is sufficient, i.e., $e \\ge c_{ij}$.\n\nThe Bellman recursion can be formulated based on the type of node $i$:\n\n**Case 1: Node $i$ is not a recharging station ($i \\in \\{s, B, D\\}$)**\nThe only possible actions are to traverse to an adjacent node $j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)$.\n$$V(i, e) = \\min_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\text{ s.t. } e \\ge c_{ij}} \\{d_{ij} + V(j, e - c_{ij})\\}$$\nIf no such moves are possible (i.e., the set of feasible next nodes is empty), the cost is infinite, $V(i, e) = \\infty$, as $t$ is unreachable from this state.\n\n**Case 2: Node $i$ is a recharging station ($i \\in \\{A, C\\}$)**\nIn addition to traversing, the agent can choose to recharge. This action is available only if $e < E_{\\max}$. Recharging takes time $r_i$ and sets the energy level to $E_{\\max}$. The subsequent cost is $V(i, E_{\\max})$.\n\nIf $e < E_{\\max}$:\n$$V(i, e) = \\min \\left( r_i + V(i, E_{\\max}), \\quad \\min_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\text{ s.t. } e \\ge c_{ij}} \\{d_{ij} + V(j, e - c_{ij})\\} \\right)$$\nwhere $r_i$ is $r_A=6$ for $i=A$ and $r_C=3$ for $i=C$.\n\nIf $e = E_{\\max}$:\nThe agent cannot recharge further. The equation reduces to that of a non-recharging node:\n$$V(i, E_{\\max}) = \\min_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\text{ s.t. } E_{\\max} \\ge c_{ij}} \\{d_{ij} + V(j, E_{\\max} - c_{ij})\\}$$\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal time from the starting state $(s, E_0)$, which is $V(s, 3)$.\n\n### 2. Dominance Rule for Label Pruning\n\nIn a forward dynamic programming algorithm (such as Dijkstra's algorithm adapted for this problem), we explore paths starting from the source node $s$. We maintain a set of non-dominated \"labels\" at each node. A label for node $i$ is a pair $(\\ell, e)$ representing a path from $s$ to $i$ with a total travel time of $\\ell$ and a remaining energy of $e$.\n\n**Dominance Condition:**\nConsider two labels at the same node $i$: $L_1 = (\\ell_1, e_1)$ and $L_2 = (\\ell_2, e_2)$. Label $L_1$ is said to dominate label $L_2$ if it is at least as good in one dimension (cost or energy) and strictly better in the other, or better in both. A sufficient condition for $L_1$ to dominate $L_2$ is:\n$$\\ell_1 \\le \\ell_2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad e_1 \\ge e_2$$\nIf both inequalities hold and at least one is strict, then $L_1$ strictly dominates $L_2$, and the path corresponding to $L_2$ can be pruned.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe justification is rooted in Bellman's principle. The total time to reach the destination $t$ via the path that generated label $L_k$ is $\\ell_k + V(i, e_k)$, where $V(i, e_k)$ is the optimal cost-to-go from state $(i, e_k)$.\nThe value function $V(i, e)$ must be a non-increasing function of energy $e$. This is because having more energy can never be a disadvantage; it expands the set of feasible future actions, and the minimum over a wider set of choices can only be smaller or equal, i.e., if $e_1 \\ge e_2$, then $V(i, e_1) \\le V(i, e_2)$.\nGiven the dominance condition $\\ell_1 \\le \\ell_2$ and $e_1 \\ge e_2$, it follows that $V(i, e_1) \\le V(i, e_2)$. Therefore:\n$$\\ell_1 + V(i, e_1) \\le \\ell_2 + V(i, e_2)$$\nThis means the best possible path to $t$ continuing from the state represented by $L_1$ is guaranteed to be no worse than the best path from $L_2$. Thus, $L_2$ is redundant and can be discarded.\n\n**Illustration:**\nLet's find two paths from $s$ to node $D$ to illustrate dominance.\nPath 1: $s \\to A \\to \\text{recharge} \\to D$\n- $s \\to A$: Arrive at $A$ with time $\\ell = d_{sA} = 4$ and energy $e = 3 - c_{sA} = 3-2=1$.\n- Recharge at $A$: Time becomes $\\ell = 4 + r_A = 4+6=10$. Energy becomes $e = E_{\\max} = 5$.\n- $A \\to D$: Arrive at $D$ with time $\\ell = 10 + d_{AD} = 10+5=15$ and energy $e = 5 - c_{AD} = 5-4=1$. This gives label $L_1 = (15, 1)$ at node $D$.\n\nPath 2: $s \\to C \\to \\text{recharge} \\to D$\n- $s \\to C$: Arrive at $C$ with time $\\ell = d_{sC} = 5$ and energy $e = 3 - c_{sC} = 3-2=1$.\n- Recharge at $C$: Time becomes $\\ell = 5 + r_C = 5+3=8$. Energy becomes $e = E_{\\max} = 5$.\n- $C \\to D$: Arrive at $D$ with time $\\ell = 8 + d_{CD} = 8+2=10$ and energy $e = 5 - c_{CD} = 5-1=4$. This gives label $L_2 = (10, 4)$ at node $D$.\n\nComparing $L_1 = (\\ell_1=15, e_1=1)$ and $L_2 = (\\ell_2=10, e_2=4)$ at node $D$:\nWe observe that $\\ell_2 < \\ell_1$ ($10 < 15$) and $e_2 > e_1$ ($4 > 1$). Both conditions for dominance are met in a strict sense. Thus, label $L_2$ strictly dominates label $L_1$. The path corresponding to $L_1$ is inferior and can be pruned.\n\n### 3. Computation of Minimal Total Travel Time\n\nWe apply a forward search algorithm (a variant of Dijkstra's) starting from state $(s, 3)$ with cost $0$. We maintain a priority queue of labels $(\\ell, e, i)$ prioritized by the travel time $\\ell$.\n\n1.  Initialize priority queue `PQ` with `(0, 3, s)`. Initialize cost to $t$ as $\\infty$.\n2.  Pop `(0, 3, s)`.\n    - $s \\to A$: Feasible ($3 \\ge c_{sA}=2$). New label at $A$: time $0+4=4$, energy $3-2=1$. Push `(4, 1, A)`.\n    - $s \\to B$: Feasible ($3 \\ge c_{sB}=3$). New label at $B$: time $0+3=3$, energy $3-3=0$. Push `(3, 0, B)`.\n    - $s \\to C$: Feasible ($3 \\ge c_{sC}=2$). New label at $C$: time $0+5=5$, energy $3-2=1$. Push `(5, 1, C)`.\n3.  Pop `(3, 0, B)`. Node $B$ with energy $0$. All outgoing arcs from $B$ require energy $>0$. This path is a dead end.\n4.  Pop `(4, 1, A)`. At node $A$ with energy $1$.\n    - Moves: Arcs to $C, D, t$ require energy $2, 4, 5$ respectively. All are infeasible.\n    - Recharge: Possible since $1 < E_{\\max}$. Cost $r_A=6$. New label at $A$: time $4+6=10$, energy $5$. Push `(10, 5, A)`.\n5.  Pop `(5, 1, C)`. At node $C$ with energy $1$.\n    - Moves:\n        - $C \\to D$: Feasible ($1 \\ge c_{CD}=1$). New label at $D$: time $5+2=7$, energy $1-1=0$. Push `(7, 0, D)`.\n        - $C \\to t$: Infeasible ($1 < c_{Ct}=4$).\n    - Recharge: Possible ($1 < E_{\\max}$). cost $r_C=3$. New label at $C$: time $5+3=8$, energy $5$. Push `(8, 5, C)`.\n6.  Pop `(7, 0, D)`. At node $D$ with energy $0$.\n    - Move $D \\to t$: Infeasible ($0 < c_{Dt}=2$). Dead end.\n7.  Pop `(8, 5, C)`. At node $C$ with energy $5$.\n    - Moves:\n        - $C \\to D$: Feasible ($5 \\ge c_{CD}=1$). New label at $D$: time $8+2=10$, energy $5-1=4$. Check dominance at $D$: current label is $(7,0)$. Neither $(10,4)$ nor $(7,0)$ dominates the other. Push `(10, 4, D)`.\n        - $C \\to t$: Feasible ($5 \\ge c_{Ct}=4$). Arrive at $t$ at time $8+6=14$. This is a valid path. Update cost to $t$ to $14$.\n    - Recharge: Not possible (energy is at max).\n8.  Pop `(10, 4, D)`. At node $D$ with energy $4$.\n    - Move $D \\to t$: Feasible ($4 \\ge c_{Dt}=2$). Arrive at $t$ at time $10+3=13$. This is better than the previous path. Update cost to $t$ to $13$.\n9.  Pop `(10, 5, A)`. At node $A$ with energy $5$.\n    - Moves:\n        - $A \\to C$: Feasible ($5 \\ge c_{AC}=2$). New label at $C$: time $10+2=12$, energy $5-2=3$. Check dominance at $C$: existing labels are $(5,1)$ and $(8,5)$. The label $(8,5)$ dominates $(12,3)$ since $8<12$ and $5>3$. Prune this path.\n        - $A \\to D$: Feasible ($5 \\ge c_{AD}=4$). New label at $D$: time $10+5=15$, energy $5-4=1$. Check dominance at $D$: existing labels are $(7,0)$ and $(10,4)$. Label $(10,4)$ dominates $(15,1)$ since $10<15$ and $4>1$. Prune this path.\n        - $A \\to t$: Feasible ($5 \\ge c_{At}=5$). Arrive at $t$ at time $10+9=19$. This is worse than the current minimum of $13$. Ignore.\n10. The priority queue is now empty. The algorithm terminates.\n\nThe minimal total travel time is $13$. The optimal path is $s \\to C \\to \\text{recharge at } C \\to D \\to t$.\n- $s \\to C$: time $5$, energy upon arrival is $3-2=1$.\n- Recharge at $C$: time cost $3$, total time is $5+3=8$, energy is $5$.\n- $C \\to D$: time cost $2$, total time is $8+2=10$, energy upon arrival is $5-1=4$.\n- $D \\to t$: time cost $3$, total time is $10+3=13$, energy upon arrival is $4-2=2$.\nThe total time is $5+3+2+3=13$.",
