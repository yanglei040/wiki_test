In this exercise , the functional's integrand does not depend explicitly on the function $y(x)$, which allows the Euler-Lagrange equation to be immediately integrated once. Mastering this special case provides a solid first step toward tackling more complex variational problems.",

The constants $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary real numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem is to find the function $y(x)$ that extremizes the given functional. We will use the Euler-Lagrange equation, which provides a necessary condition for a function to be an extremum of a functional.\n\nThe functional is of the form $J[y] = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x, y, y') \\, dx$. For our specific problem, the integrand is:\n$$\nF(x, y, y') = \\frac{(y')^2}{x}\n$$\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}\\right) = 0\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary partial derivatives of $F(x, y, y')$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{(y')^2}{x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nsince the integrand $F$ does not explicitly depend on $y$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $y'$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'}\\left(\\frac{(y')^2}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x} \\cdot 2y' = \\frac{2y'}{x}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{2y'}{x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{2y'}{x}\\right) = 0\n$$\n\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$, we find that the expression inside the derivative must be a constant. Let's call this constant $C_1$.\n$$\n\\frac{2y'}{x} = C_1\n$$\n\nNow, we solve for $y'$:\n$$\ny' = \\frac{C_1}{2} x\n$$\nFor convenience, let's define a new constant $C = \\frac{C_1}{2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = C x\n$$\n\nTo find $y(x)$, we integrate this equation with respect to $x$:\n$$\ny(x) = \\int C x \\, dx = C \\frac{x^2}{2} + D\n$$\nwhere $D$ is another constant of integration. So, the general solution is a quadratic function of $x$.\n\nNext, we use the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C$ and $D$.\nThe boundary conditions are $y(1) = A$ and $y(2) = B$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $y(1) = A$:\n$$\nA = C \\frac{(1)^2}{2} + D \\implies A = \\frac{C}{2} + D \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nApplying the second boundary condition, $y(2) = B$:\n$$\nB = C \\frac{(2)^2}{2} + D \\implies B = \\frac{4C}{2} + D = 2C + D \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two constants $C$ and $D$.

            "solution": "**1. Identify the Functional and Boundary Conditions**\nThe problem is to find the curve $y(x)$ that minimizes the arc length functional from the origin to a point $(x_2, y_2)$ on the given curve:\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_{0}^{x_2} \\sqrt{1 + [y'(x)]^2} dx\n$$\nThe integrand is the Lagrangian $L(y, y') = \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n- Fixed endpoint at the origin: $y(0) = 0$.\n- Movable endpoint: The point $(x_2, y(x_2))$ must lie on the curve $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\n**2. Solve the Euler-Lagrange Equation**\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'} = 0\n$$\nFor our Lagrangian, $L = \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$, we have:\n- $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}}$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the term inside the derivative must be a constant:\n$$\n\\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} = C\n$$\nSolving for $y'$, we square both sides: $(y')^2 = C^2 (1 + (y')^2)$, which leads to $(y')^2 (1 - C^2) = C^2$. Thus, $y' = \\pm \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{1 - C^2}}$. This shows that the slope $y'$ is a constant, which we shall call $m$.\n$$\ny'(x) = m\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives the family of extremal curves:\n$$\ny(x) = mx + b\n$$\nThis confirms that the shortest path between any two points is a straight line.\n\n**3. Apply the Fixed Boundary Condition**\nThe path must start at the origin $(0,0)$. Applying this condition, $y(0)=0$, to the general solution:\n$$\ny(0) = m(0) + b = 0 \\implies b=0\n$$\nThus, the path is a straight line through the origin: $y(x) = mx$. Since the target curve $g(x) = 1/x$ is in the first quadrant for $x>0$, the slope $m$ must be positive.\n\n**4. Apply the Transversality Condition**\nThe second endpoint $(x_2, y_2)$ lies on the curve $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$. The derivative of this curve is $g'(x) = -\\frac{1}{x^2}$.\nThe transversality condition is:\n$$\n\\left[ L + (g'(x) - y'(x)) \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'} \\right]_{x=x_2} = 0\n$$\nAt the endpoint $x_2$, we have $y'(x_2) = m$ and $g'(x_2) = -\\frac{1}{x_2^2}$. The Lagrangian and its partial derivative are $L = \\sqrt{1 + m^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}}$.\nSubstituting these into the condition:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 + m^2} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{x_2^2} - m\\right) \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = 0\n$$\nTo simplify, multiply the entire equation by $\\sqrt{1 + m^2}$:\n$$\n(1 + m^2) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{x_2^2} - m\\right) m = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 + m^2 - \\frac{m}{x_2^2} - m^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{m}{x_2^2} = 0 \\implies m = x_2^2\n$$\nThis result is the condition $1 + g'(x_2)y'(x_2)=0$, which geometrically means the path must be orthogonal to the target curve at the point of intersection.\n\n**5. Determine the Intersection Point**\nThe intersection point $(x_2, y_2)$ must lie on both the line $y=mx$ and the hyperbola $y=1/x$.\n$$\ny_2 = mx_2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2 = \\frac{1}{x_2}\n$$\nEquating the expressions for $y_2$ gives the intersection requirement:\n$$\nmx_2 = \\frac{1}{x_2} \\implies mx_2^2 = 1\n$$\n\n**6. Solve for the Path Parameters**\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $m$ and $x_2$:\n1. $m = x_2^2$ (from the transversality condition)\n2. $mx_2^2 = 1$ (from the intersection point)\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$\n(x_2^2) x_2^2 = 1 \\implies x_2^4 = 1\n$$\nSince the path must end in the first quadrant where $x>0$, we take the positive real root:\n$$\nx_2 = 1\n$$\nUsing this, we find the slope $m$:\n$$\nm = x_2^2 = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nThe equation of the shortest path is $y(x) = x$, and the intersection point is $(x_2, y_2) = (1, 1)$.\n\n**7. Calculate the Length of the Path**\nThe shortest path is the straight line segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(1,1)$. The length $d$ can be found using the standard distance formula:\n$$\nd = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can evaluate the arc length functional with $y(x)=x$ (so $y'=1$) from $x_1=0$ to $x_2=1$:\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{1 + (1)^2} dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{2} dx = [\\sqrt{2} x]_0^1 = \\sqrt{2} - 0 = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The length of the shortest path is $\\sqrt{2}$.",
