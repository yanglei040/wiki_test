The problem is self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective question in mathematical optimization. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Dual Problem\n\nThe primal problem is given as:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\; c^{\\top} x \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad A x \\ge b, \\; x \\ge 0\n$$\nTo apply the Lagrangian framework, we first express the inequality constraints in the form $f_i(x) \\le 0$. The constraints are:\n1.  $A x \\ge b \\iff b - A x \\le 0$ (a set of $m$ inequalities)\n2.  $x \\ge 0 \\iff -x \\le 0$ (a set of $n$ inequalities)\n\nWe introduce nonnegative Lagrange multipliers for each of these constraints. Let $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ be the vector of multipliers for the constraints $b - A x \\le 0$, so $\\lambda \\ge 0$. Let $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector of multipliers for the constraints $-x \\le 0$, so $\\mu \\ge 0$.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $L(x, \\lambda, \\mu)$ is defined as the objective function plus the sum of multipliers times their corresponding constraint functions:\n$$\nL(x, \\lambda, \\mu) = c^{\\top} x + \\lambda^{\\top}(b - A x) + \\mu^{\\top}(-x)\n$$\nWe can rearrange the terms by collecting those involving the primal variable $x$:\n$$\nL(x, \\lambda, \\mu) = c^{\\top} x - \\lambda^{\\top} A x - \\mu^{\\top} x + \\lambda^{\\top} b\n$$\n$$\nL(x, \\lambda, \\mu) = (c^{\\top} - \\lambda^{\\top} A - \\mu^{\\top})x + b^{\\top} \\lambda\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly using transposes:\n$$\nL(x, \\lambda, \\mu) = (c - A^{\\top} \\lambda - \\mu)^{\\top}x + b^{\\top} \\lambda\n$$\nThe Lagrange dual function, denoted $g(\\lambda, \\mu)$, is defined as the infimum of the Lagrangian over the primal variable $x$:\n$$\ng(\\lambda, \\mu) = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} L(x, \\lambda, \\mu) = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\left[ (c - A^{\\top} \\lambda - \\mu)^{\\top}x + b^{\\top} \\lambda \\right]\n$$\nThe expression inside the infimum is an affine (linear plus constant) function of $x$. If the coefficient vector of $x$ is non-zero, i.e., $c - A^{\\top} \\lambda - \\mu \\ne 0$, then the function is unbounded below, and its infimum is $-\\infty$. To obtain a finite value for the dual function, the linear term in $x$ must vanish. This imposes a constraint on the dual variables $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\nc - A^{\\top} \\lambda - \\mu = 0\n$$\nWhen this condition holds, the Lagrangian becomes independent of $x$, and its value is simply $b^{\\top} \\lambda$. Therefore, the dual function is:\n$$\ng(\\lambda, \\mu) = \\begin{cases}\nb^{\\top}\\lambda & \\text{if } c - A^{\\top}\\lambda - \\mu = 0 \\\\\n-\\infty & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe dual problem is to maximize the dual function subject to the constraints on the dual variables:\n$$\n\\max_{\\lambda, \\mu} \\; g(\\lambda, \\mu) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\lambda \\ge 0, \\; \\mu \\ge 0\n$$\nMaximizing $g(\\lambda, \\mu)$ is equivalent to maximizing $b^{\\top}\\lambda$ subject to the condition that makes $g(\\lambda, \\mu)$ finite. The dual problem is thus:\n$$\n\\max_{\\lambda, \\mu} \\; b^{\\top}\\lambda \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad c - A^{\\top}\\lambda - \\mu = 0, \\quad \\lambda \\ge 0, \\quad \\mu \\ge 0\n$$\nWe can eliminate the dual variable $\\mu$. The constraint $c - A^{\\top}\\lambda - \\mu = 0$ implies $\\mu = c - A^{\\top}\\lambda$. The nonnegativity constraint $\\mu \\ge 0$ then becomes $c - A^{\\top}\\lambda \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $A^{\\top}\\lambda \\le c$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the optimization problem, we obtain the dual problem solely in terms of the dual variable $\\lambda$:\n-   Dual decision variables: $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n-   Dual objective function: Maximize $b^{\\top}\\lambda$.\n-   Dual constraints: $A^{\\top}\\lambda \\le c$ and $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\n\nThe resulting dual problem is:\n$$\n\\max_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}} \\; b^{\\top} \\lambda \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad A^{\\top}\\lambda \\le c, \\; \\lambda \\ge 0\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of the Concrete Instance\n\nThe problem gives the concrete instance:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nLet $x = (x_1, x_2)^{\\top}$. The primal problem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x_1, x_2} \\; 5x_1 + 4x_2\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_1 &\\ge 4 \\\\\n3x_2 &\\ge 3 \\\\\nx_1 + x_2 &\\ge 5 \\\\\nx_1, x_2 &\\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThese constraints simplify to $x_1 \\ge 2$, $x_2 \\ge 1$, and $x_1 + x_2 \\ge 5$. The nonnegativity constraints $x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0$ are redundant.\n\nTo find the optimal primal solution $x^{\\star}$, we can examine the vertices of the feasible region. The boundaries are $x_1=2$, $x_2=1$, and $x_1+x_2=5$. The vertices are the feasible intersections of these lines.\n-   Intersection of $x_1=2$ and $x_1+x_2=5$: $2+x_2=5 \\implies x_2=3$. The point is $(2, 3)$, which is feasible.\n-   Intersection of $x_2=1$ and $x_1+x_2=5$: $x_1+1=5 \\implies x_1=4$. The point is $(4, 1)$, which is feasible.\nThe objective function is $z(x_1, x_2) = 5x_1 + 4x_2$. We evaluate it at the vertices:\n-   At $(2, 3)$: $z = 5(2) + 4(3) = 10 + 12 = 22$.\n-   At $(4, 1)$: $z = 5(4) + 4(1) = 20 + 4 = 24$.\nThe minimum objective value is $22$, occurring at the optimal primal solution $x^{\\star} = (2, 3)^{\\top}$.\n\nNow we determine which constraints of $A x \\ge b$ are binding at $x^{\\star} = (2, 3)$:\n1.  $2x_1^{\\star} \\ge 4 \\implies 2(2) = 4$. This is **binding**.\n2.  $3x_2^{\\star} \\ge 3 \\implies 3(3) = 9 > 3$. This is **slack**.\n3.  $x_1^{\\star} + x_2^{\\star} \\ge 5 \\implies 2+3 = 5$. This is **binding**.\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for an LP imply complementary slackness. Let $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)^{\\top}$ be the dual variable. The complementary slackness conditions are:\n-   $\\lambda_i ((Ax^{\\star})_i - b_i) = 0$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n-   $(c - A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star})_j x_j^{\\star} = 0$ for $j=1, 2$.\n\nFrom the first set of conditions, since the second primal constraint is slack, its corresponding dual variable must be zero: $\\lambda_2^{\\star} = 0$.\n\nFrom the second set of conditions:\n-   For $j=1$: $x_1^{\\star} = 2 > 0$, so the first dual constraint must be binding: $(A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star})_1 = c_1$.\n    Using $A^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, this is $2\\lambda_1^{\\star} + 0\\lambda_2^{\\star} + 1\\lambda_3^{\\star} = 5 \\implies 2\\lambda_1^{\\star} + \\lambda_3^{\\star} = 5$.\n-   For $j=2$: $x_2^{\\star} = 3 > 0$, so the second dual constraint must be binding: $(A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star})_2 = c_2$.\n    This is $0\\lambda_1^{\\star} + 3\\lambda_2^{\\star} + 1\\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4 \\implies 3\\lambda_2^{\\star} + \\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4$.\n\nWe now have a system of equations to find the dual optimal solution $\\lambda^{\\star}$:\n1.  $\\lambda_2^{\\star} = 0$\n2.  $2\\lambda_1^{\\star} + \\lambda_3^{\\star} = 5$\n3.  $3\\lambda_2^{\\star} + \\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4$\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda_2^{\\star}=0$ into the third equation gives $3(0) + \\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4$, so $\\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4$.\nSubstituting $\\lambda_3^{\\star}=4$ into the second equation gives $2\\lambda_1^{\\star} + 4 = 5$, so $2\\lambda_1^{\\star} = 1$, which means $\\lambda_1^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe inferred dual optimal solution is $\\lambda^{\\star} = (\\frac{1}{2}, 0, 4)^{\\top}$.\n\nTo verify optimality, we use strong duality. We check if the primal and dual objective values are equal.\n-   Primal optimal objective value: $p^{\\star} = c^{\\top}x^{\\star} = 5(2) + 4(3) = 22$.\n-   Dual optimal objective value: $d^{\\star} = b^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star} = 4\\lambda_1^{\\star} + 3\\lambda_2^{\\star} + 5\\lambda_3^{\\star} = 4(\\frac{1}{2}) + 3(0) + 5(4) = 2 + 0 + 20 = 22$.\n\nSince $p^{\\star} = d^{\\star} = 22$, and both $x^{\\star}$ and $\\lambda^{\\star}$ are feasible for their respective problems (we must check dual feasibility for $\\lambda^{\\star}$: $\\lambda^{\\star} \\ge 0$ is true, and $A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star} \\le c$ is true since both constraints hold with equality), we have verified the optimality of both solutions.\n\nThe final request is to compute the optimal primal objective value $c^{\\top}x^{\\star}$. As calculated, this value is $22$.",

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Primal Problem\nThe primal problem is to find the minimum value of $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2}$ subject to the constraints $x_{1} x_{2} \\geq 1$, $x_{1} \\geq 0$, and $x_{2} \\geq 0$. Let $p^{\\star}$ denote the primal optimal value.\n\nThe constraints $x_{1} \\geq 0$, $x_{2} \\geq 0$, and $x_{1}x_{2} \\geq 1$ imply that we must have $x_{1} > 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$.\nBy the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, for any non-negative numbers $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} $$\nUsing the constraint $x_{1}x_{2} \\geq 1$, we can write:\n$$ \\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} \\geq \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\nCombining these inequalities gives:\n$$ \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} \\geq 1 $$\n$$ x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 2 $$\nThis shows that the objective function $f(x_{1}, x_{2})$ is bounded below by $2$. The minimum value of $2$ is attainable if the equality in the AM-GM inequality holds, which occurs if and only if $x_{1} = x_{2}$.\nSubstituting $x_{1} = x_{2}$ into the constraint $x_{1}x_{2} \\geq 1$, we get:\n$$ x_{1}^{2} \\geq 1 $$\nSince $x_{1} > 0$, this implies $x_{1} \\geq 1$. To achieve the minimum value of the sum $x_1+x_2 = 2x_1$, we must choose the smallest possible value for $x_1$, which is $x_{1} = 1$.\nThis gives the optimal point $(x_{1}^{\\star}, x_{2}^{\\star}) = (1, 1)$. This point satisfies all constraints: $1 \\times 1 = 1 \\geq 1$, $1 \\geq 0$, and $1 \\geq 0$.\nThe primal optimal value is the value of the objective function at this point:\n$$ p^{\\star} = f(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\n\n### Dual Problem\nTo formulate the dual problem, we first write the constraints in the standard form $g_{i}(x) \\leq 0$:\n1. $c_{1}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1 - x_{1}x_{2} \\leq 0$\n2. $c_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = -x_{1} \\leq 0$\n3. $c_{3}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = -x_{2} \\leq 0$\n\nThe Lagrangian function $L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ is defined as:\n$$ L(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}) = f(x_{1}, x_{2}) + \\lambda_{1} c_{1}(x_{1}, x_{2}) + \\lambda_{2} c_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}) + \\lambda_{3} c_{3}(x_{1}, x_{2}) $$\nwhere $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3} \\geq 0$ are the Lagrange multipliers (dual variables).\nSubstituting the functions, we have:\n$$ L(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\lambda) = (x_{1} + x_{2}) + \\lambda_{1}(1 - x_{1}x_{2}) + \\lambda_{2}(-x_{1}) + \\lambda_{3}(-x_{2}) $$\nWe can rearrange the terms by gathering coefficients of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$:\n$$ L(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\lambda) = (1 - \\lambda_{2})x_{1} + (1 - \\lambda_{3})x_{2} - \\lambda_{1}x_{1}x_{2} + \\lambda_{1} $$\nThe Lagrange dual function $q(\\lambda)$ is the infimum of the Lagrangian over the primal variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$:\n$$ q(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}) = \\inf_{x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} L(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}) $$\nThe term $L(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\lambda)$ is a function of $x_1, x_2$ that includes a bilinear term $- \\lambda_{1}x_{1}x_{2}$.\nIf $\\lambda_{1} > 0$, this function is a hyperbolic paraboloid, which is unbounded below. For any $\\lambda_1 > 0$, we can choose $x_1=x_2=x$ and let $x \\to \\infty$, which would make $L \\to -\\infty$ due to the $- \\lambda_1 x^2$ term.

This requires:\n$$ 1 - \\lambda_{2} = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{2} = 1 $$\n$$ 1 - \\lambda_{3} = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{3} = 1 $$\nSo, for the dual function to not be $-\\infty$, the dual variables must satisfy $\\lambda_{1} = 0$, $\\lambda_{2} = 1$, and $\\lambda_{3} = 1$. These values also satisfy the non-negativity constraints $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$.\nAt this specific point $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}) = (0, 1, 1)$, the Lagrangian is:\n$$ L(x_{1}, x_{2}, 0, 1, 1) = (1-1)x_{1} + (1-1)x_{2} - 0 \\cdot x_{1}x_{2} + 0 = 0 $$\nThe dual function value at this point is:\n$$ q(0, 1, 1) = \\inf_{x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} 0 = 0 $$\nFor any other set of non-negative dual variables, $q(\\lambda) = -\\infty$.\n\nThe dual problem is to maximize the dual function $q(\\lambda)$ subject to $\\lambda_{i} \\geq 0$:\n$$ d^{\\star} = \\sup_{\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\lambda_{3} \\geq 0} q(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}) $$\nSince $q(\\lambda)$ is $0$ for one specific point and $-\\infty$ everywhere else, the supremum is $0$:\n$$ d^{\\star} = 0 $$\n\n### Duality Gap\nThe duality gap is the difference between the primal optimal value $p^{\\star}$ and the dual optimal value $d^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\text{Duality Gap} = p^{\\star} - d^{\\star} $$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$ \\text{Duality Gap} = 2 - 0 = 2 $$\nThe existence of this non-zero duality gap ($p^{\\star} > d^{\\star}$) is a consequence of the fact that the problem is not convex (specifically, the constraint function $1-x_1x_2$ is not convex), and therefore strong duality does not hold.

The duality gap for the nonconvex integer program, measured against this LP-dual bound, equals $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}-z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=\\dfrac{6}{7}$, which arises because the LP can take a fractional amount of a high-density item to fill remaining capacity; the closer the item densities $v_i/w_i$ are to one another, the smaller this gap tends to be.\n\nB. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=21$, so the duality gap is $0$ and strong duality holds even for the integer program; the item densities do not affect the gap because fractional decisions are unnecessary.\n\nC. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=15$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=22.5$, so the duality gap is $7.5$; this large gap is driven by the low-density items, not by the ability to fractionally include any single high-density item.\n\nD. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=22$ (attained with dual scalar $y=2$), so the duality gap is $1$; the magnitude of the gap is unrelated to value-to-weight densities and is determined only by total capacity.\n\nE. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=\\dfrac{153}{7}$, but the duality gap is $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}-z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=-\\dfrac{6}{7}$; since this is negative, it shows strong duality holds for the integer program, independent of item densities.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a problem concerning a binary knapsack integer program (IP), its linear programming (LP) relaxation, and the corresponding dual problem. I will first validate the problem statement, then proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Problem Validation\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Problem: Binary knapsack integer program.\n-   Number of items: $3$.\n-   Knapsack capacity: $C=10$.\n-   Item weights: $w_1=7$, $w_2=6$, $w_3=4$.\n-   Item values: $v_1=15$, $v_2=12$, $v_3=9$.\n-   Decision variables: $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n-   Objective: Maximize $\\sum_{i=1}^3 v_i x_i$.\n-   Constraint: $\\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i x_i \\le C$.\n-   LP Relaxation: The constraints $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ are replaced by $0 \\le x_i \\le 1$.\n-   Task: Analyze the IP, its LP relaxation, and the dual of the LP relaxation to identify the correct statement among the given options. The statement must correctly identify the optimal IP value ($z_{\\mathrm{IP}}$), the optimal LP relaxation value ($z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$), a corresponding optimal dual solution, and provide a correct interpretation of the integrality gap.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It is a specific, well-defined instance of the knapsack problem, a canonical problem in the field of optimization methods. All data and definitions are standard and self-consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete, allowing for a unique solution to be derived from first principles. There are no factual errors, ambiguities, or logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\n**1. Integer Program (IP) Formulation and Solution**\n\nThe binary knapsack integer program is formulated as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{maximize} & z = 15x_1 + 12x_2 + 9x_3 \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & 7x_1 + 6x_2 + 4x_3 \\le 10 \\\\\n& x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\{0, 1\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTo find the optimal value $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}$, we can enumerate all feasible combinations due to the small problem size:\n-   $x=(0,0,0)$: weight=$0$, value=$0$.\n-   $x=(1,0,0)$: weight=$7$, value=$15$.\n-   $x=(0,1,0)$: weight=$6$, value=$12$.\n-   $x=(0,0,1)$: weight=$4$, value=$9$.\n-   $x=(1,1,0)$: weight=$7+6=13 > 10$ (infeasible).\n-   $x=(1,0,1)$: weight=$7+4=11 > 10$ (infeasible).\n-   $x=(0,1,1)$: weight=$6+4=10$, value=$12+9=21$.\n-   $x=(1,1,1)$: weight=$7+6+4=17 > 10$ (infeasible).\n\nComparing the values of the feasible solutions ($0$, $15$, $12$, $9$, $21$), the maximum value is $21$.\nThe optimal integer solution is $x_{\\mathrm{IP}}^*=(0, 1, 1)$, and the optimal value is $z_{\\mathrm{IP}} = 21$.\n\n**2. LP Relaxation Formulation and Solution**\n\nThe LP relaxation allows the decision variables to be continuous in the range $[0,1]$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{maximize} & z = 15x_1 + 12x_2 + 9x_3 \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & 7x_1 + 6x_2 + 4x_3 \\le 10 \\\\\n& 0 \\le x_1 \\le 1, \\quad 0 \\le x_2 \\le 1, \\quad 0 \\le x_3 \\le 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThis is a fractional knapsack problem, which can be solved optimally using a greedy approach based on value-to-weight densities ($v_i/w_i$).\n-   Item 1 density: $v_1/w_1 = 15/7 \\approx 2.143$\n-   Item 2 density: $v_2/w_2 = 12/6 = 2$\n-   Item 3 density: $v_3/w_3 = 9/4 = 2.25$\n\nThe items are sorted by decreasing density: Item 3, Item 1, Item 2.\n1.  Select all of Item 3 ($x_3=1$). Weight used: $4$. Remaining capacity: $10 - 4 = 6$.\n2.  Select as much of Item 1 as possible. Item 1 has weight $7$, but only $6$ units of capacity remain. Thus, we take a fraction $x_1 = 6/7$. Weight used: $(6/7) \\times 7 = 6$. Remaining capacity: $6 - 6 = 0$.\n3.  No capacity is left for Item 2, so $x_2=0$.\n\nThe optimal LP solution is $x_{\\mathrm{LP}}^*=(6/7, 0, 1)$. The optimal value $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{LP}} = 15\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right) + 12(0) + 9(1) = \\frac{90}{7} + 9 = \\frac{90+63}{7} = \\frac{153}{7}$$\nSo, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}} = 153/7 \\approx 21.857$.\n\n**3. Dual of the LP Relaxation**\n\nThe primal LP can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{maximize} & 15x_1 + 12x_2 + 9x_3 \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & 7x_1 + 6x_2 + 4x_3 \\le 10 & \\quad (\\text{dual variable } y \\ge 0) \\\\\n& x_1 \\le 1 & \\quad (\\text{dual variable } s_1 \\ge 0) \\\\\n& x_2 \\le 1 & \\quad (\\text{dual variable } s_2 \\ge 0) \\\\\n& x_3 \\le 1 & \\quad (\\text{dual variable } s_3 \\ge 0) \\\\\n& x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe corresponding dual LP is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{minimize} & 10y + s_1 + s_2 + s_3 \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & 7y + s_1 \\ge 15 \\\\\n& 6y + s_2 \\ge 12 \\\\\n& 4y + s_3 \\ge 9 \\\\\n& y, s_1, s_2, s_3 \\ge 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nBy strong duality for linear programs, the optimal value of the dual, $z_D^*$, must equal $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}^*$. We can find the optimal dual solution $(y^*, s_1^*, s_2^*, s_3^*)$ using the complementary slackness conditions with the optimal primal solution $x_{\\mathrm{LP}}^*=(6/7, 0, 1)$.\n-   The primal constraint $x_1 \\le 1$ is slack ($6/7 < 1$), so $s_1^*=0$.\n-   The primal constraint $x_2 \\le 1$ is slack ($0 < 1$), so $s_2^*=0$.\n-   The primal variable $x_1^*$ is non-zero ($x_1^*=6/7$), so the first dual constraint must be tight: $7y^* + s_1^* = 15$. With $s_1^*=0$, we get $7y^*=15$, so $y^*=15/7$.\n-   The primal variable $x_3^*$ is non-zero ($x_3^*=1$), so the third dual constraint must be tight: $4y^* + s_3^* = 9$. Substituting $y^*=15/7$, we get $4(15/7) + s_3^* = 9 \\implies 60/7 + s_3^* = 63/7 \\implies s_3^*=3/7$.\n\nThe optimal dual solution is $(y^*, s_1^*, s_2^*, s_3^*) = (15/7, 0, 0, 3/7)$.\nLet's verify this is a feasible solution: all variables are non-negative.\n-   Constraint 1: $7(15/7)+0 = 15 \\ge 15$ (True).\n-   Constraint 2: $6(15/7)+0 = 90/7 \\approx 12.857 \\ge 12$ (True).\n-   Constraint 3: $4(15/7)+3/7 = 60/7+3/7 = 63/7 = 9 \\ge 9$ (True).\nThe dual objective value is $10y^* + s_1^* + s_2^* + s_3^* = 10(15/7) + 0 + 0 + 3/7 = 150/7 + 3/7 = 153/7$.\nThis matches $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$, as expected from strong duality.\n\n**4. Integrality Gap and Interpretation**\n\nThe integrality gap for this maximization problem is defined as $z_{\\mathrm{LP}} - z_{\\mathrm{IP}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Gap} = \\frac{153}{7} - 21 = \\frac{153}{7} - \\frac{147}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}\n$$\nThis gap is also the duality gap between the original nonconvex integer program and its Lagrangian dual, whose optimal value is $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$. The gap arises because the LP relaxation can make a fractional choice that is unavailable to the IP. Here, the LP model fills the last $6$ units of capacity with a fraction $6/7$ of the high-density item 1 (density $15/7 \\approx 2.14$), whereas the IP must pick a combination of whole items, with the best choice being items 2 and 3 (densities $2$ and $2.25$). The ability to fractionally use item 1, which has a higher density than item 2, gives the LP relaxation an advantage. The magnitude of this advantage is related to the difference in item densities. Had all densities been equal, no such advantage could be gained. Thus, larger differences in densities tend to allow for larger integrality gaps.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=\\dfrac{153}{7}$, and there exists a dual-feasible solution with $y^*=\\dfrac{15}{7}$ and $s_1=0$, $s_2=0$, $s_3=\\dfrac{3}{7}$ such that $w_i y^*+s_i\\ge v_i$ for all $i$ and $C y^*+\\sum_i s_i=\\dfrac{153}{7}$. The duality gap for the nonconvex integer program, measured against this LP-dual bound, equals $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}-z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=\\dfrac{6}{7}$, which arises because the LP can take a fractional amount of a high-density item to fill remaining capacity; the closer the item densities $v_i/w_i$ are to one another, the smaller this gap tends to be.**\n-   The values for $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}$ and $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ are correct.\n-   The dual solution $(y^*, s_1, s_2, s_3) = (15/7, 0, 0, 3/7)$ is the correct optimal dual solution derived via complementary slackness.\n-   The conditions $w_i y^*+s_i\\ge v_i$ correctly state dual feasibility, and $C y^*+\\sum_i s_i=\\dfrac{153}{7}$ correctly states that this feasible solution achieves the optimal value, thus certifying the LP solution's optimality.\n-   The integrality gap is correctly calculated as $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}-z_{\\mathrm{IP}} = 6/7$.\n-   The interpretation of the gap's origin and its relationship to item densities is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=21$, so the duality gap is $0$ and strong duality holds even for the integer program; the item densities do not affect the gap because fractional decisions are unnecessary.**\n-   The value $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=21$ is incorrect. It is $153/7$. The premise is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=15$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=22.5$, so the duality gap is $7.5$; this large gap is driven by the low-density items, not by the ability to fractionally include any single high-density item.**\n-   The value $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=15$ is incorrect. It is $21$. The premise is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=22$ (attained with dual scalar $y=2$), so the duality gap is $1$; the magnitude of the gap is unrelated to value-to-weight densities and is determined only by total capacity.**\n-   The value $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=22$ is an incorrect approximation. The exact value is $153/7$. While $y=2$ provides an upper bound of $22$, it is not the least upper bound.\n-   The claim that the gap is unrelated to densities is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}=21$, $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=\\dfrac{153}{7}$, but the duality gap is $z_{\\mathrm{IP}}-z_{\\mathrm{LP}}=-\\dfrac{6}{7}$; since this is negative, it shows strong duality holds for the integer program, independent of item densities.**\n-   The definition of the integrality gap is conventionally non-negative for maximization problems ($z_{\\mathrm{LP}} - z_{\\mathrm{IP}} \\ge 0$).\n-   The conclusion that a non-zero gap (regardless of sign) implies strong duality for the IP is a fundamental misunderstanding. Strong duality for the IP requires a zero gap.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
