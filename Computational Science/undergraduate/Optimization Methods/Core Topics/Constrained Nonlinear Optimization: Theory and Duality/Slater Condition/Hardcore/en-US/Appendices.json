The objective function $f_{0}(x)$ is convex. The constraint function $f_{1}(x)$ is a sum of exponential functions of affine forms, which are convex. A sum of convex functions is also convex. Therefore, the feasible set defined by $f_{1}(x) \\leq 1$ is a convex set. The problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded in the field of optimization theory. It is self-contained, with all necessary information provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires us to demonstrate that Slater's condition holds for the given convex optimization problem. For a problem with convex inequality constraints $f_i(x) \\leq 0, i=1, \\dots, m$ and affine equality constraints $h_j(x) = 0, j=1, \\dots, p$, Slater's condition is satisfied if there exists a feasible point $x_{slater}$ that is strictly feasible for the non-affine inequality constraints. In this specific problem, there are no equality constraints and the single inequality constraint is convex and not affine. Therefore, to verify Slater's condition, we must find a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that the constraint is satisfied with strict inequality.\n\nLet $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. We first compute the inner products in the exponents:\n$a_{1}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1$\n$a_{2}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_2$\n$a_{3}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1 + x_2$\n\nSubstituting these into the strict inequality gives:\n$$\n\\exp(x_1) + \\exp(x_2) + \\exp(x_1 + x_2)  1\n$$\n\nOur task is to find a specific pair of values $(x_1, x_2)$ that satisfies this condition. The exponential function $\\exp(z)$ is always positive. To make the sum of three positive terms less than $1$, the terms themselves must be sufficiently small. The value of $\\exp(z)$ becomes small as $z$ becomes a large negative number. This suggests that we should search for a solution where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are negative.\n\nLet's consider a symmetric case where $x_1 = x_2 = y$ for some real number $y$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(y) + \\exp(y) + \\exp(y + y)  1\n$$\n$$\n2\\exp(y) + \\exp(2y)  1\n$$\n\nWe need to choose a value for $y$ such that this inequality holds. Let's try an integer value for simplicity. If we choose $y$ to be negative, $\\exp(y)$ will be less than $1$. Let's test the point where $y = -2$. This means we propose the point $x = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe check if this point satisfies the strict inequality:\n$$\n\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-2) + \\exp(-2 + (-2))  1\n$$\n$$\n2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4)  1\n$$\nTo verify this inequality without a calculator, we can recall that the base of the natural logarithm, $e$, is approximately $2.718$. Since $e  2$, it follows that $e^2  4$ and $e^4  16$.\nLet's evaluate the left-hand side (LHS):\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = 2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4) = \\frac{2}{e^2} + \\frac{1}{e^4}\n$$\nUsing our bounds:\n$$\n\\text{LHS}  \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{9}{16}  1$, the inequality $2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4)  1$ is satisfied.\n\nThus, the point $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is strictly feasible. The existence of such a point demonstrates that Slater's condition is satisfied for this optimization problem.\n\nThe problem asks for one explicit such point, which we have found.

The expression $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1$ is a real number for any choice of $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The function $g$ takes this real number and squares it. For any real number $u$, its square, $u^2$, is always non-negative. That is, $u^2 \\ge 0$.\nApplying this to our function, we have:\n$$g(x_1, x_2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)^2 \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$$\nThis means that the value of the function $g(x_1, x_2)$ can never be negative.\n\nThe feasible set is defined by the inequality $g(x_1, x_2) \\le 0$.\nWe have two conditions that must be satisfied for any point in the feasible set:\n1.  From the problem definition: $(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)^2 \\le 0$\n2.  From mathematical properties of squares: $(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)^2 \\ge 0$\n\nThe only way for a quantity to be both less than or equal to zero and greater than or equal to zero is for it to be exactly zero. Therefore, any feasible point must satisfy:\n$$(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)^2 = 0$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1$$\nThis is the equation of the unit circle centered at the origin. Thus, the feasible set is not empty; it consists of all points on this unit circle. For example, the point $(1, 0)$ is in the feasible set because $g(1, 0) = (1^2 + 0^2 - 1)^2 = 0^2 = 0$, which satisfies $g(x_1, x_2) \\le 0$.\n\nNow we check Slater's condition. The condition requires the existence of a point $\\mathbf{x}_s$ such that $g(\\mathbf{x}_s)  0$. As we have established, $g(x_1, x_2)$ is always greater than or equal to zero. There is no point $(x_1, x_2)$ for which $g(x_1, x_2)$ is strictly negative. Therefore, no Slater point exists. Consequently, Slater's constraint qualification does not hold for this feasible set.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\nA. Incorrect. At the point $(0, 0)$, $g(0, 0) = (0^2 + 0^2 - 1)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$. Since $1 \\not\\le 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is not even in the feasible set.\nB. Incorrect.

The condition does not hold. Furthermore, the constraint function $g(x_1, x_2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)^2$ is a fourth-degree polynomial and is therefore non-affine.

It is a well-structured question that tests fundamental concepts in optimization theory. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of two convex optimization problems, (P0) and (P1), concerning Slater's condition and the application of an interior-point method. Finally, it requests the optimal objective value for (P0). We begin by formally defining the core concepts.\n\nA general convex optimization problem is of the form $\\min f_0(x)$ subject to $f_i(x) \\le 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$ and $h_j(x)=0$ for $j=1, \\dots, p$, where the functions $f_0, \\dots, f_m$ are convex and $h_1, \\dots, h_p$ are affine. The feasible set is the set of all points $x$ satisfying the constraints.\n\n**Part 1: Slater's Condition for (P0)**\nFor problem (P0), the constraints are $g_1(x) = -x_1 \\le 0$, $g_2(x) = -x_2 \\le 0$, and $h_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$.\nSlater's condition requires the existence of a feasible point $x_{slater}$ that satisfies all inequality constraints strictly. Such a point is often called a \"strictly feasible point.\" Formally, we seek a point $x = (x_1, x_2)$ such that:\n1.  $h_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$ (Equality constraint is met)\n2.  $g_1(x) = -x_1  0 \\implies x_1  0$ (Inequality 1 is strictly met)\n3.  $g_2(x) = -x_2  0 \\implies x_2  0$ (Inequality 2 is strictly met)\n\nWe must determine if the set of points satisfying these three conditions is non-empty. Consider the point $x = (1/2, 1/2)$.\n-   $x_1 + x_2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$, so the equality constraint is satisfied.\n-   $x_1 = 1/2  0$, so the first inequality is strictly satisfied.\n-   $x_2 = 1/2  0$, so the second inequality is strictly satisfied.\nSince at least one such point exists, **Slater's condition holds for (P0)**. The existence of a strictly feasible point guarantees strong duality for this convex problem.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Problem (P1)**\nProblem (P1) adds the constraint $g_3(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 \\le 0$ to (P0).\n\n-   **Redundancy:** A constraint is redundant if removing it does not change the feasible set. The feasible set of (P0) is $S_0 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1+x_2 = 1, x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0\\}$. For any point $x \\in S_0$, the equality $x_1+x_2=1$ holds. This immediately implies that the inequality $x_1+x_2 \\le 1$ is also satisfied. Therefore, adding this constraint does not remove any points from the feasible set. The feasible set of (P1) is identical to $S_0$. The constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\le 1$ is **redundant**.\n\n-   **Tightness:** A constraint $g(x) \\le 0$ is tight on a feasible set $S$ if $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in S$. For any feasible point $x \\in S_0$, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. This is equivalent to $x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$. This means the constraint function $g_3(x)=x_1+x_2-1$ evaluates to $0$ for every point in the feasible set. Thus, the added inequality is **tight on the feasible set**.\n\n-   **Slater's Condition for (P1):** To check Slater's condition for (P1), we must find a point $x$ that satisfies the equality constraint $h_1(x) = x_1+x_2-1 = 0$ while strictly satisfying all inequality constraints:\n    1.  $g_1(x) = -x_1  0 \\implies x_1  0$.\n    2.  $g_2(x) = -x_2  0 \\implies x_2  0$.\n    3.  $g_3(x) = x_1+x_2-1  0 \\implies x_1+x_2  1$.\nThe equality constraint requires $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. The third strict inequality requires $x_1 + x_2  1$. It is impossible for a point to simultaneously satisfy both $x_1 + x_2 = 1$ and $x_1 + x_2  1$. No such point exists. Therefore, **Slater's condition does not hold for (P1)**.\n\n**Part 3: Barrier Subproblem Analysis**\nThe logarithmic barrier method is used for problems with inequality constraints. For (P0), the inequalities are $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$. The barrier function is $-\\mu(\\ln x_1 + \\ln x_2)$, where the domain requires $x_1  0$ and $x_2  0$. The barrier subproblem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\; \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2}\\big) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x_{1} + x_{2} = 1.\n$$\nTo solve this equality-constrained problem, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2}\\big) + \\nu(x_1 + x_2 - 1).\n$$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for optimality (stationarity) are obtained by setting the gradient with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_1} = x_1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_1} + \\nu = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_2} = x_2 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_2} + \\nu = 0\n$$\nFrom these two equations, we have $x_1 + \\nu = \\mu/x_1$ and $x_2 + \\nu = \\mu/x_2$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $x_1 - x_2 = \\mu/x_1 - \\mu/x_2 = \\mu \\frac{x_2-x_1}{x_1x_2}$. Rearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n(x_1 - x_2) = -\\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2}(x_1-x_2) \\implies (x_1 - x_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$ and the domain of the barrier function ensures $x_1  0$ and $x_2  0$, the term $(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2})$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the only possibility is $x_1 - x_2 = 0$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nUsing the feasibility constraint $x_1 + x_2 = 1$, we substitute $x_2=x_1$ to get $x_1 + x_1 = 1$, or $2x_1=1$. This yields $x_1 = 1/2$ and thus $x_2 = 1/2$.\nThe unique minimizer of the barrier subproblem is $x(\\mu) = (1/2, 1/2)$. This path of minimizers, known as the central path, is surprisingly constant for this specific problem.\n\nThe objective value along this path is found by substituting $x(\\mu)$ into the subproblem's objective function:\n$$\nf_{\\text{barrier}}(x(\\mu)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right) - \\mu\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) - \\mu\\left(2\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\mu(-\\ln 2) = \\frac{1}{4} + 2\\mu\\ln 2.\n$$\nNow, consider the analogous barrier subproblem for (P1). The inequality constraints are $x_1 \\ge 0$, $x_2 \\ge 0$, and $x_1+x_2 \\le 1$. The barrier function would be $-\\mu(\\ln x_1 + \\ln x_2 + \\ln(1 - (x_1+x_2)))$. The subproblem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\; \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2} + \\ln(1 - (x_1+x_2))\\big) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x_{1} + x_{2} = 1.\n$$\nThe domain of the logarithmic barrier function requires its arguments to be strictly positive: $x_1  0$, $x_2  0$, and $1 - (x_1+x_2)  0 \\implies x_1+x_2  1$. The feasible set of the subproblem is defined by the equality constraint $x_1+x_2=1$. The intersection of the domain of the objective function and the feasible set of the subproblem is the empty set. It is impossible to find a point that simultaneously satisfies $x_1+x_2  1$ and $x_1+x_2 = 1$.\nConsequently, the barrier subproblem for (P1) is ill-posed as it is infeasible. An interior-point method cannot be initialized because no strictly feasible starting point exists. The failure of Slater's condition for (P1) manifests as the immediate failure of the barrier method. This illustrates that formulations that violate Slater's condition, even with redundant constraints, are numerically and algorithmically problematic for interior-point methods.\n\n**Final Task: Optimal Objective Value of (P0)**\nTo find the optimal value of (P0), we can take the limit of the barrier subproblem's objective value as $\\mu \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + 2\\mu\\ln 2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThis suggests the optimal value is $1/4$. We can verify this by solving (P0) directly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The point $x^* = (1/2, 1/2)$ is the candidate solution from the central path.\n1.  **Primal Feasibility:** $x_1^*+x_2^* = 1/2+1/2=1$. $x_1^* \\ge 0, x_2^* \\ge 0$. All satisfied.\n2.  **KKT Conditions:** The Lagrangian for (P0) is $\\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda, \\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2+x_2^2) - \\lambda_1 x_1 - \\lambda_2 x_2 + \\nu(x_1+x_2-1)$. Stationarity requires $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L} = 0$, so $x_1-\\lambda_1+\\nu=0$ and $x_2-\\lambda_2+\\nu=0$. Complementary slackness requires $\\lambda_1 x_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 x_2 = 0$.\nAt $x^*=(1/2, 1/2)$, since $x_1^*  0$ and $x_2^*0$, we must have $\\lambda_1^*=0$ and $\\lambda_2^*=0$.\nSubstituting into stationarity: $1/2 - 0 + \\nu = 0 \\implies \\nu = -1/2$. Both equations yield the same $\\nu$.\nThe dual feasibility conditions $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$ are met.\nSince a point $x^*$ and dual variables $(\\lambda^*, \\nu^*)$ exist that satisfy all KKT conditions, and the problem is convex, $x^*=(1/2, 1/2)$ is the unique optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal objective value is:\n$$\nf_0(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nGeometrically, this problem seeks the point on the line segment connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ that is closest to the origin. By symmetry, this is the midpoint $(1/2, 1/2)$. The squared distance to the origin is $(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2$. The objective function is half the squared distance, so the minimum value is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.",
