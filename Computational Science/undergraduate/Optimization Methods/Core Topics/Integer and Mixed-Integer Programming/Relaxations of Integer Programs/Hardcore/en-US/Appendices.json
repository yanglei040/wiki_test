This practice introduces the foundational technique of Linear Programming (LP) relaxation, where we temporarily ignore the integer constraints to solve a much easier linear problem. By solving this relaxation , we establish an optimistic upper bound on the optimal value of the original IP, which is a critical piece of information for algorithms like branch-and-bound.",

            "problem": "A technology startup is deploying a new server cluster and must decide on the mix of two server types to purchase: a compute-intensive server (Type C) and a storage-intensive server (Type S). The goal is to maximize an aggregate performance metric, $Z$, while adhering to physical and budgetary constraints.\n\nLet $x_C$ be the number of Type C servers and $x_S$ be the number of Type S servers. The company's performance model estimates the aggregate metric as $Z = 5x_C + 6x_S$.\n\nThe deployment is subject to two primary constraints:\n1.  **Power Capacity:** The data center rack has a total power capacity of 16 kilowatts (kW). Each Type C server consumes 3 kW, and each Type S server consumes 2 kW.\n2.  **Physical Rack Space:** The rack has 17 units of available space. Each Type C server occupies 1 unit of space, while each Type S server occupies 4 units.\n\nThe number of servers of each type, $x_C$ and $x_S$, must be a non-negative integer. To solve this integer programming problem, the company decides to use the branch-and-bound algorithm. The first step of this method involves solving the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of the problem, where the integer constraint is temporarily ignored.\n\nDetermine the optimal value of the aggregate performance metric, $Z$, for this initial LP relaxation.

            "problem": "A mission planner for a remote research outpost is determining which scientific experiments to run during a limited operational window. The outpost has a finite energy budget for this period. There are three experiments under consideration:\n\n- **Experiment A (Atmospheric Analysis):** Scientific Value = 10 units, Energy Cost = 6 kWh.\n- **Experiment B (Geological Sampling):** Scientific Value = 8 units, Energy Cost = 5 kWh.\n- **Experiment C (Seismic Monitoring):** Scientific Value = 5 units, Energy Cost = 4 kWh.\n\nThe \"Scientific Value\" is a dimensionless score representing the experiment's importance, and the \"Energy Cost\" is the required energy. The total energy budget available is 10 kWh.\n\nA junior engineer proposes a two-step \"proportional-then-practical\" planning method. First, they calculate a theoretical maximum scientific value by solving a \"proportional\" problem, where experiments can be partially funded (e.g., funding 50% of an experiment's energy cost is assumed to yield 50% of its scientific value). Second, to create a practical plan where experiments are either fully funded or not at all, they round the proportional solution: any experiment with a proportional funding level of 0.5 or greater is set to be fully funded (ON), and any level below 0.5 is set to NOT funded (OFF). If this rounded plan exceeds the energy budget, the engineer defunds the experiment with the lowest scientific value among those that were set to ON, repeating this step if necessary until the plan is within budget.\n\nCalculate the absolute difference between the total scientific value of the true optimal plan and the total scientific value of the plan generated by the engineer's method. The \"true optimal plan\" is the combination of fully-funded experiments that yields the maximum possible scientific value without exceeding the energy budget.",
            "solution": "Let $x_A, x_B, x_C$ be the decision variables representing whether to run Experiment A, B, or C, respectively. In the true optimal plan, these variables must be binary, i.e., $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. In the proportional problem, these variables can be continuous, i.e., $x_i \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe problem can be formulated as an integer linear program for the true optimum, and a linear program for the proportional problem.\n\n**Objective Function:** Maximize Scientific Value $V = 10x_A + 8x_B + 5x_C$.\n**Constraint:** Total Energy Cost $C = 6x_A + 5x_B + 4x_C \\le 10$.\n\nFirst, we solve the engineer's \"proportional-then-practical\" method.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the Proportional Problem (Linear Programming Relaxation)**\nWe want to solve the linear program where $x_i \\in [0, 1]$. A common method for solving knapsack-type linear programs is to greedily select items based on their value-to-cost ratio.\n\nThe value-to-cost ratios are:\n- Experiment A: $\\frac{v_A}{c_A} = \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.667$\n- Experiment B: $\\frac{v_B}{c_B} = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6$\n- Experiment C: $\\frac{v_C}{c_C} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$\n\nExperiment A is the most \"efficient\". We select as much of it as possible. We set $x_A = 1$.\n- Energy consumed: 6 kWh.\n- Value generated: 10 units.\n- Remaining energy budget: $10 - 6 = 4$ kWh.\n\nExperiment B is the next most efficient. Its full energy cost is 5 kWh, which exceeds our remaining budget of 4 kWh. Therefore, we fund a fraction of Experiment B.\nThe fraction we can fund is $\\frac{\\text{remaining budget}}{\\text{full cost}} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$. So, we set $x_B = 0.8$.\n- Energy consumed: $0.8 \\times 5 = 4$ kWh.\n- Value generated: $0.8 \\times 8 = 6.4$ units.\n- Remaining energy budget: $4 - 4 = 0$ kWh.\n\nSince the budget is now exhausted, we set $x_C = 0$.\nThe solution to the proportional problem is $(x_A, x_B, x_C) = (1, 0.8, 0)$.\nThe theoretical maximum value is $V_{prop} = 10(1) + 8(0.8) + 5(0) = 10 + 6.4 = 16.4$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Rounding and Correction Procedure**\nThe engineer takes the proportional solution $(1, 0.8, 0)$ and rounds it.\n- $x_A = 1 \\ge 0.5 \\implies$ round to $x_A=1$.\n- $x_B = 0.8 \\ge 0.5 \\implies$ round to $x_B=1$.\n- $x_C = 0 < 0.5 \\implies$ round to $x_C=0$.\n\nThe initial rounded plan is $(1, 1, 0)$, meaning run Experiments A and B.\nLet's check the feasibility of this plan against the energy budget.\nTotal Cost = $6(1) + 5(1) + 4(0) = 11$ kWh.\nSince $11 > 10$, this plan is infeasible as it exceeds the budget.\n\nThe correction rule states: \"de-funds the experiment with the lowest scientific value among those that were set to ON\". The experiments set to ON are A and B.\n- Scientific Value of A is 10.\n- Scientific Value of B is 8.\nExperiment B has the lower value, so it is de-funded. We set $x_B = 0$.\n\nThe new plan is $(1, 0, 0)$.\nLet's check the feasibility of this corrected plan.\nTotal Cost = $6(1) + 5(0) + 4(0) = 6$ kWh.\nSince $6 \\le 10$, this plan is feasible.\nThe scientific value of the engineer's final plan is $V_{eng} = 10(1) + 8(0) + 5(0) = 10$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the True Optimal Plan**\nNow we must find the true maximum value achievable with binary choices ($x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$). We can do this by enumerating all feasible combinations of experiments.\n- **{A} only:** Cost = 6 kWh. Value = 10. (Feasible)\n- **{B} only:** Cost = 5 kWh. Value = 8. (Feasible)\n- **{C} only:** Cost = 4 kWh. Value = 5. (Feasible)\n- **{A, B}:** Cost = $6 + 5 = 11$ kWh. (Infeasible)\n- **{A, C}:** Cost = $6 + 4 = 10$ kWh. (Feasible) Value = $10 + 5 = 15$.\n- **{B, C}:** Cost = $5 + 4 = 9$ kWh. (Feasible) Value = $8 + 5 = 13$.\n- **{A, B, C}:** Cost = $6 + 5 + 4 = 15$ kWh. (Infeasible)\n\nComparing the values of all feasible plans:\n- Value({A}) = 10\n- Value({B}) = 8\n- Value({C}) = 5\n- Value({A, C}) = 15\n- Value({B, C}) = 13\n\nThe maximum feasible value is 15, achieved by running Experiments A and C.\nSo, the true optimal value is $V_{opt} = 15$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Absolute Difference**\nThe problem asks for the absolute difference between the true optimal value and the value from the engineer's method.\nDifference = $|V_{opt} - V_{eng}| = |15 - 10| = 5$.\nThe sub-optimality of the engineer's rounding-based heuristic is 5 units of scientific value.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the optimal values for two different Linear Programming (LP) relaxations of the maximum stable set problem on a 5-cycle graph, $G=(V,E)$, where $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $E=\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1)\\}$. The goal is to find the amount by which the addition of an odd-cycle inequality tightens the relaxation's bound.\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial LP relaxation. The integer program for the maximum stable set problem on $G$ is given by:\nMaximize $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i}$\nSubject to:\n$x_{i} + x_{j} \\leq 1$ for each $(i,j) \\in E$\n$x_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for each $i \\in V$\n\nThe initial LP relaxation is formed by relaxing the integrality constraint $x_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to a continuous range $0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$. Let the optimal value of this relaxation be $Z_{1}^{*}$. The LP is:\nMaximize $Z_{1} = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4} + x_{5}$\nSubject to:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 1$\n$x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 1$\n$x_{3} + x_{4} \\leq 1$\n$x_{4} + x_{5} \\leq 1$\n$x_{5} + x_{1} \\leq 1$\n$0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n\nTo find an upper bound on $Z_{1}$, we can sum the five edge constraints:\n$(x_{1} + x_{2}) + (x_{2} + x_{3}) + (x_{3} + x_{4}) + (x_{4} + x_{5}) + (x_{5} + x_{1}) \\leq 1+1+1+1+1$\n$2x_{1} + 2x_{2} + 2x_{3} + 2x_{4} + 2x_{5} \\leq 5$\n$2(x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4} + x_{5}) \\leq 5$\nThis implies that the objective function is bounded above:\n$Z_{1} = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4} + x_{5} \\leq \\frac{5}{2}$\nSo, the optimal value $Z_{1}^{*}$ cannot exceed $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nNow, we check if this upper bound is attainable. Consider the symmetric solution where $x_{i} = c$ for all $i \\in V$. The edge constraints become $c+c \\leq 1$, which means $2c \\leq 1$, or $c \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. To maximize the objective function $\\sum x_{i} = 5c$, we should choose the largest possible value for $c$, which is $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nLet's verify the solution $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=x_{4}=x_{5}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nEach edge constraint $x_{i} + x_{j} \\leq 1$ becomes $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\leq 1$, which is satisfied.\nThe variable bounds $0 \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\leq 1$ are also satisfied.\nThus, this is a feasible solution. The objective value for this solution is $Z_{1} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nSince we have found a feasible solution whose objective value equals the upper bound, this solution must be optimal.\nTherefore, the optimal value of the initial LP relaxation is $Z_{1}^{*} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the strengthened LP relaxation, which includes the odd-cycle inequality for the $5$-cycle, $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i} \\leq 2$. Let the optimal value of this new relaxation be $Z_{2}^{*}$. The strengthened LP is:\nMaximize $Z_{2} = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4} + x_{5}$\nSubject to:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 1$\n$x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 1$\n$x_{3} + x_{4} \\leq 1$\n$x_{4} + x_{5} \\leq 1$\n$x_{5} + x_{1} \\leq 1$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i} \\leq 2$\n$0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n\nThe new constraint, $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i} \\leq 2$, directly constrains the objective function. This immediately establishes an upper bound on the optimal value: $Z_{2}^{*} \\leq 2$.\nTo determine if this upper bound is achievable, we need to find a feasible solution with an objective value of $2$. The actual maximum stable set size of a $5$-cycle is $2$. For example, the set of vertices $\\{1,3\\}$ is a stable set. This corresponds to an integer solution: $x_{1}=1$, $x_{3}=1$, and $x_{2}=x_{4}=x_{5}=0$.\nLet's check if this solution is feasible for the strengthened LP.\n- The objective value is $1+0+1+0+0 = 2$.\n- The edge constraints are:\n  - $x_{1}+x_{2} = 1+0 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{2}+x_{3} = 0+1 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{3}+x_{4} = 1+0 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{4}+x_{5} = 0+0 = 0 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{5}+x_{1} = 0+1 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n- The odd-cycle constraint is $\\sum x_{i} = 2 \\leq 2$ (satisfied).\n- The variable bounds $0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$ are satisfied, as all variables are either $0$ or $1$.\nSince this is a feasible solution and its objective value of $2$ matches the upper bound, it is an optimal solution.\nTherefore, the optimal value of the strengthened LP relaxation is $Z_{2}^{*} = 2$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the amount by which the upper bound on the maximum stable set size decreases when the odd-cycle inequality is added. this is the difference between the two optimal values.\nDecrease = $Z_{1}^{*} - Z_{2}^{*}$\nDecrease = $\\frac{5}{2} - 2 = \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe addition of the odd-cycle inequality reduced the optimal value of the LP relaxation by $\\frac{1}{2}$, providing a tighter bound on the true integer optimal value (which is $2$).",
