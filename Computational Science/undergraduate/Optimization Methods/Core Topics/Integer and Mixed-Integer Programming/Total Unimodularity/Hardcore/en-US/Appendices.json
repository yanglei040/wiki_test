            "problem": "A binary path-selection model on a tiny directed graph is constructed as follows. Consider two nodes labeled $1$ and $2$. The modeling uses two binary decision variables $x_{12}$ and $x_{21}$, where $x_{12}$ indicates selecting the arc from node $1$ to node $2$ and $x_{21}$ indicates selecting the arc from node $2$ to node $1$. The model includes three linear constraints: two node balance constraints and one undirected edge linking constraint. Specifically, the constraints are\n$$\nx_{12} - x_{21} = 0,\\quad -x_{12} + x_{21} = 0,\\quad x_{12} + x_{21} = 1.\n$$\nThese constraints can be written in matrix form $A x = b$ with the $0,\\pm 1$ matrix\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTotal Unimodularity (TU) is defined as follows: a matrix $A$ is totally unimodular if the determinant of every square submatrix of $A$ is in the set $\\{0,\\pm 1\\}$. To certify that the matrix $A$ above is not totally unimodular, identify a $2\\times 2$ submatrix of $A$ whose determinant is equal to $2$ and compute its determinant. Then, interpret which modeling choice in the described formulation introduces the specific pattern of coefficients that creates this $2\\times 2$ minor.\n\nReport only the value of the determinant of your chosen submatrix as your final answer. No rounding is required, and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to certify that a given matrix $A$ is not totally unimodular (TU) by identifying a $2 \\times 2$ submatrix with a determinant of $2$. We must then provide an interpretation of the modeling choice that leads to this non-unimodular structure.\n\nThe given constraint matrix is:\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to the definition provided, a matrix is totally unimodular if the determinant of every one of its square submatrices is an element of the set $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. To demonstrate that $A$ is not TU, we need to find a square submatrix whose determinant lies outside this set.\n\nThe matrix $A$ has dimensions $3 \\times 2$. The only non-trivial square submatrices are of size $2 \\times 2$. We can form $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ such submatrices by selecting two out of the three rows. Let us compute the determinant for each of these.\n\n1.  The submatrix formed by selecting rows $1$ and $2$:\n    $$\n    A_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    Its determinant is $\\det(A_{12}) = (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0$. This value is within the set $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n2.  The submatrix formed by selecting rows $1$ and $3$:\n    $$\n    A_{13} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    Its determinant is $\\det(A_{13}) = (1)(1) - (-1)(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$. This value, $2$, is not in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. This submatrix thus certifies that the matrix $A$ is not totally unimodular. This is the submatrix requested by the problem statement.\n\n3.  The submatrix formed by selecting rows $2$ and $3$:\n    $$\n    A_{23} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    Its determinant is $\\det(A_{23}) = (-1)(1) - (1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2$. This determinant also confirms that $A$ is not TU.\n\nAs per the problem's instruction, we select the submatrix formed by rows $1$ and $3$, which has a determinant of $2$.\n\nNext, we interpret the modeling choice responsible for this structure. The rows of matrix $A$ are the coefficient vectors of the three linear constraints:\n-   Row $1$, $[1, -1]$, arises from the first node balance constraint, $x_{12} - x_{21} = 0$.\n-   Row $2$, $[-1, 1]$, arises from the second node balance constraint, $-x_{12} + x_{21} = 0$.\n-   Row $3$, $[1, 1]$, arises from the \"undirected edge linking constraint\", $x_{12} + x_{21} = 1$.\n\nThe submatrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is constructed from row $1$ and row $3$. Row $1$ represents a typical flow conservation structure, where coefficients are $+1$ and $-1$. Such structures, when isolated, often form TU matrices (specifically, network incidence matrices). Row $3$, however, represents a \"packing\" or \"cardinality\" constraint, where the coefficients are both $+1$.\n\nThe violation of total unimodularity is a direct consequence of combining these two distinct types of constraints. A well-known sufficient condition for a matrix to be TU requires that the rows of any submatrix can be partitioned into two sets such that the sum of entries in one set minus the sum of entries in the other differs by at most $1$ for any column. The submatrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ violates this condition. For its first column, $[1, 1]^T$, the sum of entries is $2$, which cannot be partitioned as required. The specific modeling choice that introduces this non-TU minor is the inclusion of the \"undirected edge linking constraint\" ($x_{12} + x_{21} = 1$) alongside a standard node-balance constraint ($x_{12} - x_{21} = 0$). This combination creates a submatrix with same-signed coefficients in one column ($1$ and $1$) and opposite-signed coefficients in another ($-1$ and $1$), a pattern that frequently breaks total unimodularity.\n\nThe value of the determinant of the chosen submatrix, as computed above, is $2$.",

Begin from the formal definition of the determinant and use only elementary, well-tested facts about bipartite graphs (such as the absence of odd cycles and the interpretation of permutation products as selecting incidences) to argue about the values of all $3 \\times 3$ determinants of submatrices of $A$ without brute-force enumeration. In particular, exploit cycle-versus-path structure to decide when permutation contributions cancel or when a unique contribution remains.\n\nCompute the single number that is the maximum absolute value among all $3 \\times 3$ determinants of submatrices of $A$. Express your final answer as an integer. As a byproduct of your reasoning, briefly indicate how your argument aligns with certifying total unimodularity (TU), that is, the property that every square subdeterminant of $A$ lies in $\\{-1,0,1\\}$. No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum absolute value of any $3 \\times 3$ subdeterminant of the given matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is the vertex-edge incidence matrix of a bipartite graph. We will show that $A$ is totally unimodular (TU), meaning every square subdeterminant is in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This will imply that the maximum absolute value is at most $1$. We will then find a specific submatrix whose determinant has an absolute value of $1$.\n\nThe proof that the incidence matrix of a bipartite graph is totally unimodular can be done by induction on the size $k$ of a square submatrix $M$.\n\n**Base Case ($k=1$):** A $1 \\times 1$ submatrix is a single entry of $A$. Since all entries are $0$ or $1$, the determinant is in $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that for any $(k-1) \\times (k-1)$ submatrix $M'$, $\\det(M') \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Let $M$ be a $k \\times k$ submatrix of $A$. Every column of $A$ has exactly two $1$s, so every column of $M$ has at most two $1$s.\n\n*   **Case 1: $M$ has a column of all zeros.** Then $\\det(M) = 0$.\n*   **Case 2: $M$ has a column with exactly one $1$.** Let the $j$-th column have a single $1$ in row $i$. By cofactor expansion along this column, $\\det(M) = \\pm 1 \\cdot \\det(M_{ij})$, where $M_{ij}$ is a $(k-1) \\times (k-1)$ submatrix. By the inductive hypothesis, $\\det(M_{ij}) \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, so $\\det(M) \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Case 3: Every column of $M$ has exactly two $1$s.** The rows of $M$ correspond to a set of vertices $V_M$ and the columns to a set of edges $E_M$, where $|V_M| = |E_M| = k$. Since each edge's endpoints are in $V_M$, the subgraph $G_M = (V_M, E_M)$ has $k$ vertices and $k$ edges, and thus must contain a cycle. As a subgraph of a bipartite graph, $G_M$ is also bipartite, so this cycle must be of even length. Let the vertices in $V_M$ be partitioned into $V_U$ and $V_W$ based on the original graph's bipartition. The sum of the row vectors corresponding to vertices in $V_U$ is equal to the sum of the row vectors for vertices in $V_W$. This linear dependency among the rows implies that $\\det(M) = 0$.\n\nSince these cases cover all possibilities, any square submatrix of $A$ has a determinant in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Therefore, the maximum absolute value of any $3 \\times 3$ subdeterminant is at most $1$.\n\nTo confirm the maximum absolute value is exactly $1$, we must find a submatrix with a determinant of $\\pm 1$. Let's select rows $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$ (for vertices $u_1, u_2, w_1$) and columns $\\{1, 2, 5\\}$ (for edges $(u_1, w_1), (u_2, w_1), (u_2, w_2)$). This gives the submatrix:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(M) = 1(0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) = -1$.\nThe absolute value is $|-1| = 1$. Since we have shown the maximum absolute value is at most $1$ and found an instance where it is exactly $1$, the final answer is $1$.",

This matrix is known to be totally unimodular. This property stems from its specific structure: each column contains at most two non-zero entries, and if there are two, they are $1$ and $-1$. Any matrix with this property is TU. This implies that if all right-hand sides are integer vectors, all basic feasible solutions of the system $A_{\\text{flow}}x=b$ will be integer-valued.\n\nHowever, the full matrix $A$ includes the resource constraint row and is not totally unimodular. To demonstrate this, we must find a square submatrix of $A$ with a determinant not in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. Let's select the square submatrix $A_{\\text{sub}}$ formed by rows $1, 2, 3, 4$ and columns corresponding to variables $x_{sa}, x_{at}, x_{sb}, x_{as}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{sub}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the determinant of this $4 \\times 4$ matrix by cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(A_{\\text{sub}}) = (-1) \\cdot (-1)^{3+3} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the $3 \\times 3$ minor is:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 0 + (-1)(-1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1) = 0 + 2 = 2\n$$\nTherefore, the determinant of the submatrix is:\n$$\n\\det(A_{\\text{sub}}) = -1 \\cdot (2) = -2\n$$\nSince the determinant is $-2$, which is not in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$, the matrix $A$ is not totally unimodular.\n\n**Task 2: Fractional Basic Feasible Solution (BFS)**\n\nA basic feasible solution is determined by a set of $n$ active, linearly independent constraints, where $n$ is the number of variables ($n=6$). We seek a BFS where at least one variable is fractional. Let's propose the following solution:\n$$\nx = (x_{sa}, x_{at}, x_{sb}, x_{bt}, x_{as}, x_{st}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0, 0)\n$$\nFirst, we verify feasibility:\n- Variable bounds: All components of $x$ are in $[0, 1]$. This is satisfied.\n- Flow conservation:\n    - Node $s$: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 0 - 0 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n    - Node $a$: $\\frac{1}{2} + 0 - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.

(Satisfied and active/tight)\n\nThe solution is feasible and fractional. To justify that it is a basic solution, we must identify $6$ active, linearly independent constraints that uniquely determine this solution. The active constraints are:\n1. $x_{sa} + x_{sb} - x_{as} + x_{st} = 1$\n2. $-x_{sa} + x_{at} + x_{as} = 0$\n3. $-x_{sb} + x_{bt} = 0$\n4. $x_{sa} + x_{at} + x_{as} + x_{st} = 1$ (resource constraint is tight)\n5. $x_{as} = 0$\n6. $x_{st} = 0$\n\nThis is a system of $6$ linear equations in $6$ variables. Let $M$ be the coefficient matrix of this system. The solution $x$ is basic if and only if this matrix is non-singular ($\\det(M) \\neq 0$). The determinant of the basis matrix corresponding to the non-zero variables ($x_{sa}, x_{at}, x_{sb}, x_{bt}$) and the active constraints is:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe expand along the fourth column:\n$$\n\\det = 1 \\cdot (-1)^{3+4} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\cdot \\left(1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\right) = -1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot (-1 - 1)) = -1 \\cdot (-2) = 2\n$$\nSince the determinant is $2 \\neq 0$, the $6$ active constraints are linearly independent. The proposed solution is the unique solution to this system, and is therefore a basic feasible solution.\n\n**Task 3: Objective Value of the Fractional BFS**\n\nThe objective function to minimize is $Z = x_{sb} + x_{bt} + 5x_{as} + 4x_{st}$. We substitute the values from our fractional BFS $x = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 0, 0)$:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 5(0) + 4(0) = 1\n$$\nThe objective value of this fractional basic feasible solution is $1$.",
