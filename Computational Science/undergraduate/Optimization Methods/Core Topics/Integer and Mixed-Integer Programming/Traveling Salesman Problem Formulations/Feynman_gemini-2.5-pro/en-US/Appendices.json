            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in combinatorial optimization with a clear structure and sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we address the four tasks sequentially. The core of the problem is a traveling salesman problem (TSP) on $n=5$ cities, with costs $c_{ij}$ defined as the shortest-path distances on a given underlying road network.\n\n**Task 1: Compute all-pairs shortest-path distances $c_{ij}$**\n\nThe road network consists of two clusters of vertices, $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5\\}$, connected by a single bridge edge $(3,4)$. The shortest-path distances $c_{ij}$ are computed as follows:\n\n1.  **Distances within cluster A ($\\{1,2,3\\}$):**\n    -   $c_{12}$: The direct path has length $4$. No shorter path exists. So, $c_{12}=c_{21}=4$.\n    -   $c_{23}$: The direct path has length $4$. No shorter path exists. So, $c_{23}=c_{32}=4$.\n    -   $c_{13}$: The direct path has length $7$. The alternative path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ has length $c_{12}+c_{23} = 4+4=8$. The shortest path is the direct one. So, $c_{13}=c_{31}=7$.\n\n2.  **Distances within cluster B ($\\{4,5\\}$):**\n    -   $c_{45}$: The only path is the direct edge of length $5$. So, $c_{45}=c_{54}=5$.\n\n3.  **Distances between clusters A and B:**\n    Any path from a vertex $i \\in A$ to a vertex $j \\in B$ must cross the bridge $(3,4)$. The shortest-path distance is therefore the sum of the shortest distance from $i$ to $3$, the length of the bridge, and the shortest distance from $4$ to $j$.\n    The general formula is $c_{ij} = c_{i3} + c_{34} + c_{4j}$ for $i \\in A, j \\in B$.\n    -   $c_{14} = c_{13} + c_{34} = 7 + 9 = 16$.\n    -   $c_{15} = c_{13} + c_{34} + c_{45} = 7 + 9 + 5 = 21$.\n    -   $c_{24} = c_{23} + c_{34} = 4 + 9 = 13$.\n    -   $c_{25} = c_{23} + c_{34} + c_{45} = 4 + 9 + 5 = 18$.\n    -   $c_{34} = 9$ (the bridge itself).\n    -   $c_{35} = c_{34} + c_{45} = 9 + 5 = 14$.\n    By symmetry of the underlying undirected graph, $c_{ji} = c_{ij}$.\n\nThe complete, symmetric cost matrix $C = (c_{ij})$ for the TSP is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  4  7  16  21 \\\\\n4  0  4  13  18 \\\\\n7  4  0  9  14 \\\\\n16  13  9  0  5 \\\\\n21  18  14  5  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Exhibit a feasible but disconnected solution**\n\nWe are asked to find a feasible solution to the assignment problem relaxation (degree constraints only), which consists of a $3$-cycle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and a $2$-cycle on $\\{4,5\\}$.\n-   For the $3$-cycle, we can choose the tour $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$. The corresponding binary variables are $x_{12}=1$, $x_{23}=1$, and $x_{31}=1$. The cost of this subtour is $c_{12} + c_{23} + c_{31} = 4 + 4 + 7 = 15$.\n-   For the $2$-cycle, the tour must be $4 \\to 5 \\to 4$. The corresponding binary variables are $x_{45}=1$ and $x_{54}=1$. The cost of this subtour is $c_{45} + c_{54} = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThe complete disconnected solution is given by the set of non-zero variables $\\{x_{12}, x_{23}, x_{31}, x_{45}, x_{54}\\}$. This set of variables satisfies the degree constraints for each vertex $i \\in V$: $\\sum_j x_{ij} = 1$ and $\\sum_j x_{ji} = 1$. The total objective value for this solution is the sum of the subtour costs: $15 + 10 = 25$.\n\n**Task 3: Subtour Elimination Constraints (SECs)**\n\nThe cut-based SEC for a directed TSP formulation states that for any non-empty proper subset of vertices $S \\subset V$, at least one arc must leave $S$. The constraint is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in S, j \\in V \\setminus S} x_{ij} \\geq 1\n$$\nFor the specific set $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, we have $V \\setminus S = \\{4,5\\}$, and the SEC becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, j \\in \\{4,5\\}} x_{ij} = x_{14} + x_{15} + x_{24} + x_{25} + x_{34} + x_{35} \\geq 1\n$$\nThe disconnected solution from Task $2$ has non-zero variables only for arcs whose endpoints are both within $S$ (i.e., $x_{12}, x_{23}, x_{31}$) or both within $V \\setminus S$ (i.e., $x_{45}, x_{54}$). All variables representing arcs that cross from $S$ to $V \\setminus S$ are zero: $x_{14}=x_{15}=x_{24}=x_{25}=x_{34}=x_{35}=0$.\nSubstituting these values into the SEC gives:\n$$\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $0  1$, the constraint is violated.\n\nThese SECs are pivotal because they enforce connectivity. The set $S$ corresponds to the left cluster of cities, which is connected to the right cluster $V \\setminus S$ only via the bridge in the underlying network. By requiring at least one arc to go from $S$ to $V \\setminus S$, the SEC ensures that any valid tour must \"cross the bridge\", preventing the solution from decomposing into separate, disconnected subtours within each cluster.\n\n**Task 4: Determine the optimal Hamiltonian tour length**\n\nA Hamiltonian tour on $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ must visit every city. Given the partition of cities into clusters $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5\\}$, any tour must contain a path that spans all cities in $A$, a path that spans all cities in $B$, and two \"crossing\" arcs that connect the endpoints of these paths to form a single cycle.\n\nThe total tour length $L$ can be decomposed as:\n$L = (\\text{Length of Hamiltonian path in } A) + (\\text{Length of Hamiltonian path in } B) + (\\text{Cost of two crossing arcs})$.\n\n1.  **Path in B:** The path must connect vertices $4$ and $5$. The only such path is $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$, with length $c_{45}=5$. The endpoints are $\\{4,5\\}$.\n\n2.  **Path in A:** We must find the length of a Hamiltonian path through $\\{1,2,3\\}$. There are three possibilities for the path's structure (up to reversal):\n    -   Path $1-2-3$: Length $c_{12} + c_{23} = 4 + 4 = 8$. Endpoints are $\\{1,3\\}$.\n    -   Path $2-1-3$: Length $c_{21} + c_{13} = 4 + 7 = 11$. Endpoints are $\\{2,3\\}$.\n    -   Path $1-3-2$: Length $c_{13} + c_{32} = 7 + 4 = 11$. Endpoints are $\\{1,2\\}$.\n\n3.  **Connecting the paths:** We must connect the endpoints of the chosen path in $A$ to the endpoints $\\{4,5\\}$ of the path in $B$ to minimize the total length. Let the endpoints of the path in $A$ be $\\{u,v\\}$. The cost of the crossing arcs is $\\min(c_{u4}+c_{v5}, c_{u5}+c_{v4})$.\n\nLet's evaluate the total tour length for each case:\n\n-   **Case A1 (Path $1-2-3$):** Length in A is $8$, endpoints are $\\{1,3\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{14}+c_{35}, c_{15}+c_{34}) = \\min(16+14, 21+9) = \\min(30,30) = 30$.\n    -   Total tour length: $8\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 30\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 43$.\n    -   An example tour is $3 \\to 2 \\to 1 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3$ with cost $c_{32}+c_{21}+c_{15}+c_{54}+c_{43} = 4+4+21+5+9 = 43$.\n\n-   **Case A2 (Path $2-1-3$):** Length in A is $11$, endpoints are $\\{2,3\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{24}+c_{35}, c_{25}+c_{34}) = \\min(13+14, 18+9) = \\min(27,27) = 27$.\n    -   Total tour length: $11\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 27\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 43$.\n    -   An example tour is $2 \\to 1 \\to 3 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 2$ with cost $c_{21}+c_{13}+c_{35}+c_{54}+c_{42} = 4+7+14+5+13=43$.\n\n-   **Case A3 (Path $1-3-2$):** Length in A is $11$, endpoints are $\\{1,2\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{14}+c_{25}, c_{15}+c_{24}) = \\min(16+18, 21+13) = \\min(34,34) = 34$.\n    -   Total tour length: $11\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 34\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 50$.\n\nComparing the total lengths from all cases ($43, 43, 50$), the minimum length is $43$. The optimal Hamiltonian tour length is $43$ kilometers. Rounding to four significant figures gives $43.00$ kilometers.",

The Hungarian algorithm is the canonical method for this problem and will be implemented.\n\nThe Hungarian algorithm operates on a cost matrix and consists of the following phases:\n1.  **Reduction:** Subtract the minimum value from each row and then from each column to create zero entries in the matrix without changing the optimal assignment. The sum of subtracted values provides a component of the total cost.\n2.  **Assignment:** Find a maximum matching in the bipartite graph corresponding to the zero-valued entries of the reduced cost matrix. A standard approach for this is using augmenting paths, which can be found via a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n3.  **Optimality Check:** If the size of the maximum matching equals the matrix dimension $n$, an optimal assignment has been found among the zero entries. The total cost is the sum of the costs from the *original* matrix at the positions of the optimal assignment.\n4.  **Matrix Update:** If the matching is not of size $n$, the cost matrix must be updated to create new opportunities for zero-cost assignments. This involves:\n    a. Finding the minimum number of lines (horizontal or vertical) required to cover all zeros in the matrix. By König's theorem, this number is equal to the size of the maximum matching. This set of lines can be determined from the augmenting path search state.\n    b. Identifying the minimum value, $\\delta$, among all elements not covered by any line.\n    c. Subtracting $\\delta$ from all uncovered elements and adding it to all elements covered by two lines (intersections).\n    d. Repeating from Step 2 with the updated matrix.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a main function to orchestrate these steps and a helper function for the DFS-based maximum matching search. This process is guaranteed to terminate and find the optimal assignment.\n\nThe complete solution will be encapsulated in a Python script that sets up each test case, calls the implemented Hungarian algorithm solver, and formats the output as specified.\n\n- **Test Case 1:** The $4 \\times 4$ cost matrix will be programmatically generated based on the Euclidean distances between the points $(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)$. The diagonal will be set to $M=10^6$. The expected minimum cost is $4.0$, corresponding to the tour around the perimeter of the square.\n- **Test Case 2:** The provided $5 \\times 5$ asymmetric matrix will be used. The minimum cost assignment is found to be $9$.\n- **Test Case 3:** The $3 \\times 3$ matrix will be used. Any valid assignment forms a 3-cycle with a total cost of $2+2+2 = 6$.\n- **Test Case 4:** The $2 \\times 2$ matrix will be used. The only valid assignment is the 2-cycle with cost $3+5=8$.\n\nThe final code will calculate these values and present them in the required format.",
