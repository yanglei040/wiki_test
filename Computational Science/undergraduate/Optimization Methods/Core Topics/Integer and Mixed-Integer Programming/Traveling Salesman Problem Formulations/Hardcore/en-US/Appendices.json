The core of the problem is a traveling salesman problem (TSP) on $n=5$ cities, with costs $c_{ij}$ defined as the shortest-path distances on a given underlying road network.\n\n**Task 1: Compute all-pairs shortest-path distances $c_{ij}$**\n\nThe road network consists of two clusters of vertices, $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5\\}$, connected by a single bridge edge $(3,4)$. The shortest-path distances $c_{ij}$ are computed as follows:\n\n1.  **Distances within cluster A ($\\{1,2,3\\}$):**\n    -   $c_{12}$: The direct path has length $4$. No shorter path exists. So, $c_{12}=c_{21}=4$.\n    -   $c_{23}$: The direct path has length $4$. No shorter path exists. So, $c_{23}=c_{32}=4$.\n    -   $c_{13}$: The direct path has length $7$. The alternative path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ has length $c_{12}+c_{23} = 4+4=8$. The shortest path is the direct one. So, $c_{13}=c_{31}=7$.\n\n2.  **Distances within cluster B ($\\{4,5\\}$):**\n    -   $c_{45}$: The only path is the direct edge of length $5$. So, $c_{45}=c_{54}=5$.\n\n3.  **Distances between clusters A and B:**\n    Any path from a vertex $i \\in A$ to a vertex $j \\in B$ must cross the bridge $(3,4)$. The shortest-path distance is therefore the sum of the shortest distance from $i$ to $3$, the length of the bridge, and the shortest distance from $4$ to $j$.\n    The general formula is $c_{ij} = c_{i3} + c_{34} + c_{4j}$ for $i \\in A, j \\in B$.\n    -   $c_{14} = c_{13} + c_{34} = 7 + 9 = 16$.\n    -   $c_{15} = c_{13} + c_{34} + c_{45} = 7 + 9 + 5 = 21$.\n    -   $c_{24} = c_{23} + c_{34} = 4 + 9 = 13$.\n    -   $c_{25} = c_{23} + c_{34} + c_{45} = 4 + 9 + 5 = 18$.\n    -   $c_{34} = 9$ (the bridge itself).\n    -   $c_{35} = c_{34} + c_{45} = 9 + 5 = 14$.\n    By symmetry of the underlying undirected graph, $c_{ji} = c_{ij}$.\n\nThe complete, symmetric cost matrix $C = (c_{ij})$ for the TSP is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 4 & 7 & 16 & 21 \\\\\n4 & 0 & 4 & 13 & 18 \\\\\n7 & 4 & 0 & 9 & 14 \\\\\n16 & 13 & 9 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n21 & 18 & 14 & 5 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Exhibit a feasible but disconnected solution**\n\nWe are asked to find a feasible solution to the assignment problem relaxation (degree constraints only), which consists of a 3-cycle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and a 2-cycle on $\\{4,5\\}$.\n-   For the 3-cycle, we can choose the tour $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$. The corresponding binary variables are $x_{12}=1$, $x_{23}=1$, and $x_{31}=1$. The cost of this subtour is $c_{12} + c_{23} + c_{31} = 4 + 4 + 7 = 15$.\n-   For the 2-cycle, the tour must be $4 \\to 5 \\to 4$. The corresponding binary variables are $x_{45}=1$ and $x_{54}=1$. The cost of this subtour is $c_{45} + c_{54} = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThe complete disconnected solution is given by the set of non-zero variables $\\{x_{12}, x_{23}, x_{31}, x_{45}, x_{54}\\}$. This set of variables satisfies the degree constraints for each vertex $i \\in V$: $\\sum_j x_{ij} = 1$ and $\\sum_j x_{ji} = 1$. The total objective value for this solution is the sum of the subtour costs: $15 + 10 = 25$.\n\n**Task 3: Subtour Elimination Constraints (SECs)**\n\nThe cut-based SEC for a directed TSP formulation states that for any non-empty proper subset of vertices $S \\subset V$, at least one arc must leave $S$. The constraint is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in S, j \\in V \\setminus S} x_{ij} \\geq 1\n$$\nFor the specific set $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, we have $V \\setminus S = \\{4,5\\}$, and the SEC becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, j \\in \\{4,5\\}} x_{ij} = x_{14} + x_{15} + x_{24} + x_{25} + x_{34} + x_{35} \\geq 1\n$$\nThe disconnected solution from Task $2$ has non-zero variables only for arcs whose endpoints are both within $S$ (i.e., $x_{12}, x_{23}, x_{31}$) or both within $V \\setminus S$ (i.e., $x_{45}, x_{54}$). All variables representing arcs that cross from $S$ to $V \\setminus S$ are zero: $x_{14}=x_{15}=x_{24}=x_{25}=x_{34}=x_{35}=0$.\nSubstituting these values into the SEC gives:\n$$\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $0 < 1$, the constraint is violated.\n\nThese SECs are pivotal because they enforce connectivity. The set $S$ corresponds to the left cluster of cities, which is connected to the right cluster $V \\setminus S$ only via the bridge in the underlying network. By requiring at least one arc to go from $S$ to $V \\setminus S$, the SEC ensures that any valid tour must \"cross the bridge\", preventing the solution from decomposing into separate, disconnected subtours within each cluster.\n\n**Task 4: Determine the optimal Hamiltonian tour length**\n\nA Hamiltonian tour on $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ must visit every city. Given the partition of cities into clusters $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5\\}$, any tour must contain a path that spans all cities in $A$, a path that spans all cities in $B$, and two \"crossing\" arcs that connect the endpoints of these paths to form a single cycle.\n\nThe total tour length $L$ can be decomposed as:\n$L = (\\text{Length of Hamiltonian path in } A) + (\\text{Length of Hamiltonian path in } B) + (\\text{Cost of two crossing arcs})$.\n\n1.  **Path in B:** The path must connect vertices $4$ and $5$. The only such path is $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$, with length $c_{45}=5$. The endpoints are $\\{4,5\\}$.\n\n2.  **Path in A:** We must find the length of a Hamiltonian path through $\\{1,2,3\\}$. There are three possibilities for the path's structure (up to reversal):\n    -   Path $1-2-3$: Length $c_{12} + c_{23} = 4 + 4 = 8$. Endpoints are $\\{1,3\\}$.\n    -   Path $2-1-3$: Length $c_{21} + c_{13} = 4 + 7 = 11$. Endpoints are $\\{2,3\\}$.\n    -   Path $1-3-2$: Length $c_{13} + c_{32} = 7 + 4 = 11$. Endpoints are $\\{1,2\\}$.\n\n3.  **Connecting the paths:** We must connect the endpoints of the chosen path in $A$ to the endpoints $\\{4,5\\}$ of the path in $B$ to minimize the total length. Let the endpoints of the path in $A$ be $\\{u,v\\}$. The cost of the crossing arcs is $\\min(c_{u4}+c_{v5}, c_{u5}+c_{v4})$.\n\nLet's evaluate the total tour length for each case:\n\n-   **Case A1 (Path $1-2-3$):** Length in A is $8$, endpoints are $\\{1,3\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{14}+c_{35}, c_{15}+c_{34}) = \\min(16+14, 21+9) = \\min(30,30) = 30$.\n    -   Total tour length: $8\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 30\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 43$.\n    -   An example tour is $3 \\to 2 \\to 1 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3$ with cost $c_{32}+c_{21}+c_{15}+c_{54}+c_{43} = 4+4+21+5+9 = 43$.\n\n-   **Case A2 (Path $2-1-3$):** Length in A is $11$, endpoints are $\\{2,3\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{24}+c_{35}, c_{25}+c_{34}) = \\min(13+14, 18+9) = \\min(27,27) = 27$.\n    -   Total tour length: $11\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 27\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 43$.\n    -   An example tour is $2 \\to 1 \\to 3 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 2$ with cost $c_{21}+c_{13}+c_{35}+c_{54}+c_{42} = 4+7+14+5+13=43$.\n\n-   **Case A3 (Path $1-3-2$):** Length in A is $11$, endpoints are $\\{1,2\\}$.\n    -   Crossing cost: $\\min(c_{14}+c_{25}, c_{15}+c_{24}) = \\min(16+18, 21+13) = \\min(34,34) = 34$.\n    -   Total tour length: $11\\ (\\text{path A}) + 5\\ (\\text{path B}) + 34\\ (\\text{crossings}) = 50$.\n\nComparing the total lengths from all cases ($43, 43, 50$), the minimum length is $43$. The optimal Hamiltonian tour length is $43$ kilometers. Rounding to four significant figures gives $43.00$ kilometers.",

Thus, the 1.5-approximation guarantee fails.\n\nE. If any triangle inequality is violated, the DFJ integer program becomes infeasible because the convex hull of tours ceases to exist.",
            "solution": "We begin from definitions. A Hamiltonian tour is a cycle visiting every vertex exactly once. The DFJ formulation describes the convex hull of Hamiltonian tours using binary decision variables $x_{i j}$ indicating whether undirected edge $\\{i,j\\}$ is in the tour, degree constraints $\\sum_{j \\neq i} x_{i j} = 2$ for each $i$ to enforce exactly two incident edges at each vertex, and subtour-elimination constraints $\\sum_{i \\in S, j \\notin S} x_{i j} \\geq 2$ for all proper nonempty $S \\subset V$ to prevent disconnected cycles. These constraints encode the combinatorial structure of Hamiltonian tours purely topologically and do not reference or require any metric property of the costs.\n\nThe Christofides algorithm’s performance analysis for the symmetric metric TSP uses two key facts that depend on the triangle inequality: (i) shortcutting an Eulerian walk to a Hamiltonian cycle without increasing cost relies on $c_{i j} \\leq c_{i k} + c_{k j}$ whenever a repeated vertex $k$ is removed; and (ii) bounding the minimum-weight matching on the odd-degree vertices of the MST by at most half the optimal tour cost uses metric structure. While $\\operatorname{cost}(\\text{MST}) \\le \\operatorname{OPT}$ holds whenever costs are nonnegative (because any Hamiltonian tour contains a spanning tree whose cost is at most the tour’s cost), the full $1.5$ bound fails when the triangle inequality is not satisfied.\n\nNow analyze the given instance. The edges are:\n- $c_{a x} = 1$, $c_{x y} = 1$, $c_{y b} = 1$, $c_{x b} = 3$, $c_{a y} = 3$, $c_{a b} = 100$,\nwith $c_{i j} = c_{j i}$ and $c_{i i} = 0$.\n\nFirst, compute an MST. The four vertices can be connected with three edges. The cheapest way is to select the path $a - x - y - b$, whose edges have costs $1$, $1$, and $1$, totaling $3$. Any alternative spanning tree that uses $c_{x b}=3$ or $c_{a y}=3$ would be strictly more expensive. Therefore, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is the path with edges $\\{a,x\\}$, $\\{x,y\\}$, and $\\{y,b\\}$, of total cost $3$. The odd-degree vertices of this MST are $a$ and $b$ (each has degree $1$), so the set of odd-degree vertices is exactly $\\{a,b\\}$.\n\nNext, Christofides computes a minimum-weight perfect matching on the odd-degree set. Since the odd-degree set is $\\{a,b\\}$, the only perfect matching pairs $a$ with $b$, contributing cost $c_{a b} = 100$. Combining MST and matching yields an Eulerian multigraph with edges $\\{a,x\\}$, $\\{x,y\\}$, $\\{y,b\\}$, and $\\{a,b\\}$, of total cost $3 + 100 = 103$. An Eulerian tour of this multigraph is $a \\to x \\to y \\to b \\to a$, which is already a Hamiltonian cycle; its cost is $1 + 1 + 1 + 100 = 103$.\n\nHowever, a cheaper Hamiltonian tour exists: $a \\to x \\to b \\to y \\to a$, whose edges have costs $c_{a x}=1$, $c_{x b}=3$, $c_{b y}=1$, $c_{y a}=3$, totaling $1+3+1+3=8$. Therefore, the optimal tour cost satisfies $\\operatorname{OPT} \\le 8$. Consequently, the Christofides output on this instance is $103$, which is far larger than $1.5 \\cdot \\operatorname{OPT} \\le 12$. This demonstrates that the 1.5-approximation guarantee fails when the triangle inequality is violated.\n\nWith these principles and computations, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. The DFJ formulation’s constraints are combinatorial: the degree constraints enforce two incident edges at each vertex, and the subtour-elimination constraints enforce connectivity across every cut $\\{S, V \\setminus S\\}$ by requiring at least $2$ crossing edges for any nonempty proper subset $S$. These constraints characterize Hamiltonian tours independently of the cost structure. Violations of the triangle inequality do not affect feasibility or correctness of the formulation; the optimization simply minimizes the tour cost under the same feasible set. Thus, the DFJ formulation remains valid and well-defined for this instance. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. The statement asserts that the Christofides 1.5-approximation guarantee still holds on this instance because $\\operatorname{cost}(\\text{MST}) \\le \\operatorname{OPT}$ does not use the triangle inequality. While it is true that $\\operatorname{cost}(\\text{MST}) \\le \\operatorname{OPT}$ holds without the triangle inequality, the guarantee also requires bounding the matching cost and the shortcutting step, both of which rely on the triangle inequality. Our explicit computation shows Christofides returns a tour of cost $103$, whereas $\\operatorname{OPT} \\le 8$, violating the $1.5$ bound. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Subtour-elimination constraints are purely structural and do not depend on the triangle inequality. They do not exclude valid Hamiltonian tours when costs violate the triangle inequality; they simply eliminate disconnected cycles by requiring at least two edges cross every nontrivial cut. Therefore, the claim that they become invalid and can exclude valid tours is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. On this instance, the MST is the $a - x - y - b$ path (cost $3$), which forces the odd-degree set to be $\\{a,b\\}$. The minimum-weight perfect matching on $\\{a,b\\}$ is the single edge $(a,b)$ of cost $100$. The resulting Eulerian multigraph yields the Hamiltonian cycle $a \\to x \\to y \\to b \\to a$ of cost $103$. Meanwhile, there exists a Hamiltonian tour of cost $8$ (for example $a \\to x \\to b \\to y \\to a$). Therefore, the Christofides 1.5-approximation guarantee fails on this instance. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. The convex hull of Hamiltonian tours is a polyhedron defined by linear constraints; it exists regardless of cost properties. Triangle inequality violations do not affect feasibility of the DFJ integer program; they only impact algorithmic approximation guarantees that rely on metric properties. Hence, the claim that the DFJ integer program becomes infeasible is false. Verdict: Incorrect.",
