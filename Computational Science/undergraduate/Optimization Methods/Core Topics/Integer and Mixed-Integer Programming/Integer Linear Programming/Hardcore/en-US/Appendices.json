            "introduction": "Many real-world optimization problems involve logical rules, such as 'if we open this warehouse, then its capacity cannot be exceeded'. The 'big-$M$' method is a standard tool for translating these 'if-then' statements into linear constraints. This practice guides you through deriving the theoretically best, or 'tightest', value for $M$ and demonstrates how this choice critically impacts the numerical stability of your model, a crucial factor for finding reliable solutions .",

            "problem": "Consider an integer linear programming (ILP) model with a binary decision variable $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and a vector of continuous variables $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ with component-wise bounds $l \\le y \\le u$. The model includes a logical implication constraint of the form $x = 1 \\Rightarrow a^\\top y \\le b$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are given. A standard linearization technique is the so-called big-$M$ method, which replaces the implication with a single linear inequality that is valid for both values of $x$. Without loss of generality, this can be expressed as a linear inequality in variables $(y,x)$ involving a scalar parameter $M$ to be chosen:\n$$\na^\\top y \\le b + M(1 - x).\n$$\nThis linear inequality must satisfy both correctness (the implication holds for binary $x$) and numerical robustness. The goal is to derive a choice of $M$ that is as small as possible while maintaining correctness, relying only on the known bounds $l \\le y \\le u$. Then, use this $M$ to assess and compare the numerical conditioning of the linear programming (LP) relaxation derived from the big-$M$ formulation under different $M$ choices.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions in integer linear programming (feasible sets defined by linear inequalities, logical implication, and binary variables), and using only the implied variable bounds $l \\le y \\le u$, proceed as follows for each test case:\n1. Derive the tightest valid nonnegative big-$M$ value $\\hat{M}$ that ensures correctness of the big-$M$ linearization of $x = 1 \\Rightarrow a^\\top y \\le b$ based solely on the bounds $l \\le y \\le u$.\n2. Form the LP relaxation in variables $(y,x)$ with $x \\in [0,1]$, the bound constraints $l \\le y \\le u$, $0 \\le x \\le 1$, and the big-$M$ inequality\n$$\na^\\top y + M x \\le b + M.\n$$\nTo evaluate numerical conditioning attributable to the big-$M$ row, convert all inequalities to equalities by introducing nonnegative slack variables $s \\ge 0$, obtaining a system of the form\n$$\nA y + \\alpha x + s = h,\n$$\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, $s \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, and $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. Construct the augmented coefficient matrix\n$$\n\\tilde{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} A  \\alpha  I_m \\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $I_m$ is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix.\n3. Compute the spectral (two-norm) condition number of $\\tilde{A}$ for each of the following three choices of $M$:\n   - The derived tight value $\\hat{M}$ from step 1.\n   - A scaled value $M_{10} = \\max\\{1, 10 \\hat{M}\\}$ to investigate moderate overestimation; this is defined to be at least $1$ to ensure a meaningful change even when $\\hat{M} = 0$.\n   - A naive large value $M_{\\text{naive}} = 10^6$.\n4. For each test case, the required output is the list $[\\hat{M}, \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; \\hat{M}), \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; M_{10}), \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; M_{\\text{naive}})]$, where $\\kappa(\\tilde{A}; M)$ denotes the spectral condition number of $\\tilde{A}$ constructed with a given $M$.\n\nYour program must implement the above steps and aggregate the results for a predefined test suite. All results must be reported as real numbers rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite (use exactly these instances):\n- Test case 1: $a = [4, -3, 2]$, $b = 7$, $l = [0, -1, 1]$, $u = [3, 2, 4]$.\n- Test case 2: $a = [-1, 5]$, $b = 12$, $l = [-2, 0]$, $u = [2, 3]$.\n- Test case 3 (boundary case): $a = [1, 1, 1]$, $b = 10$, $l = [0, 0, 0]$, $u = [3, 3, 3]$.\n\nAnswer specification and final output format:\n- For each test case, compute the tight big-$M$ $\\hat{M}$ and the three condition numbers as specified.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list of case results, each itself a comma-separated list, with no spaces, enclosed in square brackets. For example, a valid shape is\n\"[[m1,c11,c12,c13],[m2,c21,c22,c23],[m3,c31,c32,c33]]\",\nwhere each $m_i$ and $c_{ij}$ is rounded to six decimal places.\n\nNo physical units, angle units, or percentages are involved in this problem.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the tightest non-negative big-$M$ value, denoted $\\hat{M}$, for linearizing a logical implication in an integer linear program, followed by an analysis of the numerical conditioning of the resulting LP relaxation's constraint matrix. The analysis compares the conditioning for this tight $\\hat{M}$ against two larger values of $M$.\n\nThe problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of mathematical optimization and numerical linear algebra, is well-posed with a clear objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the formula for $\\hat{M}$; second, the systematic construction of the augmented coefficient matrix for the LP relaxation; and third, the calculation of its condition number for different choices of $M$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Tightest Non-negative Big-$M$ Value ($\\hat{M}$)**\n\nWe are given a logical implication involving a binary variable $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and a continuous variable vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\nx = 1 \\implies a^\\top y \\le b\n$$\nThis is to be replaced by a single linear inequality using the big-$M$ method:\n$$\na^\\top y \\le b + M(1-x)\n$$\nwhere $M$ is a sufficiently large positive constant. The correctness of this formulation requires that the linear inequality is equivalent to the original implication for $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and does not cut off any feasible solutions for $y$ within its given bounds $l \\le y \\le u$.\n\nWe verify this by checking the two possible values of $x$:\n- If $x=1$, the inequality becomes $a^\\top y \\le b + M(1-1)$, which simplifies to $a^\\top y \\le b$. This correctly enforces the consequence of the implication.\n- If $x=0$, the antecedent of the implication is false, so the implication itself is true regardless of the value of $a^\\top y$. The big-$M$ inequality becomes $a^\\top y \\le b + M(1-0)$, or $a^\\top y \\le b + M$. This new constraint must be redundant for any feasible $y$ (i.e., any $y$ satisfying $l \\le y \\le u$). For this constraint to be redundant, the right-hand side, $b+M$, must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of the left-hand side, $a^\\top y$, over its feasible domain.\n\nThis leads to the condition:\n$$\nb + M \\ge \\max_{l \\le y \\le u} \\{a^\\top y\\}\n$$\nThis must hold to ensure no feasible points are lost when $x=0$. To find the tightest (smallest) possible value for $M$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$\nM \\ge \\max_{l \\le y \\le u} \\{a^\\top y\\} - b\n$$\nThe maximization of the linear function $a^\\top y = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i$ over the hyperrectangle defined by $l \\le y \\le u$ is separable. The maximum value is obtained by choosing for each component $y_i$ the bound that maximizes the term $a_i y_i$:\n$$\n\\max_{l \\le y \\le u} \\{a^\\top y\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\max_{l_i \\le y_i \\le u_i} \\{a_i y_i\\}\n$$\nFor each term $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n- If $a_i \\ge 0$, the term $a_i y_i$ is maximized when $y_i = u_i$.\n- If $a_i  0$, the term $a_i y_i$ is maximized when $y_i = l_i$.\n\nLet $U_{max} = \\max_{l \\le y \\le u} \\{a^\\top y\\}$. The minimum required value for $M$ is therefore $U_{max} - b$. As the problem specifies that $\\hat{M}$ must be non-negative, the tightest valid non-negative big-$M$ value is:\n$$\n\\hat{M} = \\max\\{0, U_{max} - b\\} = \\max\\left\\{0, \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\begin{cases} a_i u_i  \\text{if } a_i \\ge 0 \\\\ a_i l_i  \\text{if } a_i  0 \\end{cases}\\right) - b\\right\\}\n$$\n\n**2. Construction of the Augmented Coefficient Matrix $\\tilde{A}$**\n\nThe LP relaxation involves variables $(y,x)$ subject to the constraints $l \\le y \\le u$, $0 \\le x \\le 1$, and the big-$M$ inequality. For the conditioning analysis, these inequalities are converted into a system of linear equalities of the form $A y + \\alpha x + s = h$ by introducing non-negative slack variables.\n\nThe set of inequalities defining the feasible region is:\n1. $y_i \\le u_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$ ($n$ inequalities)\n2. $-y_i \\le -l_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$ ($n$ inequalities)\n3. $x \\le 1$ ($1$ inequality)\n4. $-x \\le 0$ ($1$ inequality)\n5. $a^\\top y + M x \\le b + M$ ($1$ inequality)\n\nThis gives a total of $m = 2n+3$ inequalities. Introducing a unique slack variable $s_j \\ge 0$ for each inequality $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ yields a system of $m$ equalities. The coefficient matrix for the variables $(y,x)$, denoted $[A | \\alpha]$ where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, is constructed as follows:\n$$\n[A | \\alpha] =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nI_n  \\mathbf{0}_{n \\times 1} \\\\\n-I_n  \\mathbf{0}_{n \\times 1} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}_{1 \\times n}  1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}_{1 \\times n}  -1 \\\\\na^\\top  M\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, and $\\mathbf{0}$ are zero matrices/vectors of appropriate dimensions. The rows correspond to the inequalities in the order listed above.\n\nThe augmented coefficient matrix $\\tilde{A}$ is formed by concatenating $[A | \\alpha]$ with the identity matrix $I_m$ corresponding to the coefficients of the slack variables:\n$$\n\\tilde{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} A  \\alpha  I_m \\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nI_n  \\mathbf{0}_{n \\times 1}  \\\\\n-I_n  \\mathbf{0}_{n \\times 1}  \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}_{1 \\times n}  1  I_m \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}_{1 \\times n}  -1  \\\\\na^\\top  M \n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting matrix $\\tilde{A}$ has dimensions $m \\times (n+1+m)$, which is $(2n+3) \\times (3n+4)$.\n\n**3. Numerical Conditioning Analysis**\n\nThe numerical conditioning of this system is evaluated using the spectral (or $2$-norm) condition number of $\\tilde{A}$, defined as:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tilde{A}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}(\\tilde{A})}{\\sigma_{\\min}(\\tilde{A})}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}$ are the largest and smallest singular values of $\\tilde{A}$, respectively. This calculation will be performed for each test case using three different choices for the parameter $M$:\n1. $M = \\hat{M}$, the tightest non-negative value derived in step $1$.\n2. $M = M_{10} = \\max\\{1, 10\\hat{M}\\}$, representing a moderately overestimated value.\n3. $M = M_{\\text{naive}} = 10^6$, representing a common but potentially poor choice.\n\nThe following procedure is implemented for each test case:\n- Compute $\\hat{M}$.\n- Construct the three variants of the matrix $\\tilde{A}$ using $\\hat{M}$, $M_{10}$, and $M_{\\text{naive}}$.\n- Calculate the spectral condition number for each of the three matrices.\n- Report the results as a list $[\\hat{M}, \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; \\hat{M}), \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; M_{10}), \\kappa(\\tilde{A}; M_{\\text{naive}})]$, with all values rounded to six decimal places.",

            "problem": "You are given a family of binary knapsack problems with pairwise item conflicts represented by an undirected graph. For a problem instance with items indexed by $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, each item has profit $p_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ and weight $w_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, and there is a capacity $C \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. There is a conflict graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, where an edge $(i,j) \\in E$ indicates that items $i$ and $j$ cannot be simultaneously selected. The decision variables are binary: $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether item $i$ is selected.\n\nFrom first principles:\n- The $0$-$1$ integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for a knapsack with conflicts uses the objective $\\max \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i x_i$, the capacity constraint $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i x_i \\le C$, the pairwise conflict constraints $x_i + x_j \\le 1$ for every $(i,j) \\in E$, and binary constraints $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- The linear programming (LP) relaxation replaces $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ by the interval constraints $0 \\le x_i \\le 1$ for all $i$.\n- A clique in a graph is a subset $Q \\subseteq V$ such that all distinct pairs in $Q$ are adjacent. A maximal clique is a clique not strictly contained in a larger clique. For any clique $Q$, the valid inequality $\\sum_{i \\in Q} x_i \\le 1$ holds for the ILP because at most one item in a conflicting set can be selected; when added to the LP relaxation, this is called a clique cut. Adding all maximal clique cuts strengthens the LP relaxation.\n\nTask:\n1. Derive the ILP model as described using the core definitions above.\n2.

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and solution of linear programming (LP) relaxations for a series of binary knapsack problems with pairwise item conflicts. The solution process involves three primary stages: formal model derivation, implementation strategy for solving the LPs, and application to specific test instances.\n\n### 1. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) Formulation\n\nThe problem is defined on a set of $n$ items, indexed by $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Each item has an associated profit $p_i \\ge 0$ and weight $w_i \\ge 0$. The total weight of selected items cannot exceed a capacity $C \\ge 0$. Conflicts between items are represented by an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ and an edge $(i,j) \\in E$ signifies that items $i$ and $j$ cannot be selected together.\n\nWe introduce binary decision variables $x_i$ for each item $i$:\n$$\nx_i = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if item } i \\text{ is selected} \\\\ 0  \\text{if item } i \\text{ is not selected} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit from the selected items.

This is enforced by ensuring the sum of their corresponding variables is at most $1$.\n    $$\n    x_i + x_j \\le 1 \\quad \\forall (i,j) \\in E\n    $$\n\n3.  **Binary Variable Constraints**: The decision variables must be binary.\n    $$\n    x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\n    $$\n\nCombining these elements gives the full Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the knapsack problem with conflicts:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i x_i \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i x_i \\le C \\\\\n x_i + x_j \\le 1,  \\forall (i,j) \\in E \\\\\n x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\},  \\forall i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n### 2. Standard LP Relaxation ($z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$)\n\nSolving ILPs is computationally hard (NP-hard). A common technique is to solve a relaxed version of the problem where the integer constraints are loosened. The standard LP relaxation is obtained by replacing the binary constraint $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ with a continuous interval constraint $0 \\le x_i \\le 1$. This transforms the problem into a Linear Program, which can be solved efficiently.\n\nThe LP relaxation is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i x_i \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i x_i \\le C \\\\\n x_i + x_j \\le 1,  \\forall (i,j) \\in E \\\\\n 0 \\le x_i \\le 1,  \\forall i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe optimal objective value of this LP, denoted as $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$, provides an upper bound on the optimal objective value of the original ILP.\n\n### 3. Strengthened LP Relaxation with Clique Cuts ($z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}}$)\n\nThe standard LP relaxation can often be \"strengthened\" or \"tightened\" by adding more constraints, known as cutting planes or cuts. These cuts are valid for the original ILP (i.e., they do not eliminate any feasible integer solutions) but cut off parts of the fractional feasible region of the LP relaxation, leading to a better approximation of the ILP's feasible region.\n\nA clique in the conflict graph $G$ is a subset of vertices $Q \\subseteq V$ where every two distinct vertices in $Q$ are adjacent. Since all items in a clique are mutually conflicting, at most one item from $Q$ can be selected in any valid solution. This gives rise to a **clique inequality**:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in Q} x_i \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any integer solution. Adding these inequalities to the LP relaxation can significantly improve the bound. Note that the pairwise conflict constraints are a special case of clique inequalities for cliques of size $2$.\n\nTo create the strengthened LP relaxation, we add clique inequalities for all *maximal* cliques of the conflict graph. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding any other vertex. The resulting LP is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i x_i \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i x_i \\le C \\\\\n x_i + x_j \\le 1,  \\forall (i,j) \\in E \\\\\n \\sum_{i \\in Q} x_i \\le 1,  \\forall \\text{ maximal clique } Q \\subseteq V \\\\\n 0 \\le x_i \\le 1,  \\forall i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nAs per the problem statement, we add the maximal clique cuts to the existing set of pairwise conflict constraints. The optimal objective value of this strengthened LP is denoted $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}}$. Since we are adding constraints to a maximization problem, it is guaranteed that $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}} \\le z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$.\n\n### 4. Computational Strategy\n\nTo compute $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ and $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}}$ for each test instance, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find Maximal Cliques**: For a given conflict graph $G=(V,E)$, we first need to find all maximal cliques. The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is a standard, efficient recursive algorithm for this task. It explores the graph to identify all subsets of vertices that are maximal cliques.\n\n2.  **Formulate and Solve LPs**: We use a numerical LP solver. The `scipy.optimize.linprog` function is suitable. This function solves minimization problems in the form `min c^T x` subject to `A_ub x = b_ub`. We must adapt our problem to this format:\n    *   **Objective**: Maximizing $\\sum p_i x_i$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\sum (-p_i) x_i$. So, the cost vector is $c = -p$.\n    *   **Constraints**: All constraints (`capacity`, `pairwise conflict`, `clique`) are of the form `a^T x = b`. These can be stacked to form the matrix `A_ub` and vector `b_ub`.\n    *   **Bounds**: The constraint $0 \\le x_i \\le 1$ is handled directly by the solver's `bounds` parameter.\n\n3.  **Procedure for each test instance**:\n    a. Construct the conflict graph from the given edges $E$.\n    b. Find all maximal cliques of the graph using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.\n    c. **Solve for $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$**:\n        i. Construct the `A_ub` matrix and `b_ub` vector including the capacity constraint and all pairwise conflict constraints.\n        ii. Call the LP solver with `c = -p`, the constructed `A_ub` and `b_ub`, and bounds $(0,1)$ for all variables.\n        iii. The optimal value is $z_{\\mathrm{LP}} = -(\\text{solver's result})$.\n    d. **Solve for $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}}$**:\n        i. Augment the `A_ub` matrix and `b_ub` vector from the previous step by adding new rows for each maximal clique inequality.\n        ii. Call the LP solver with the augmented constraints.\n        iii. The optimal value is $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}} = -(\\text{solver's result})$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases provided. The numerical results are then formatted as required.\n\nFor example, in Test 1, the conflict graph has edges $E = \\{(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)\\}$. The maximal cliques are $\\{0,1,2\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{3,4\\}$. The LP for $z_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ includes pairwise constraints like $x_0+x_1 \\le 1$. The LP for $z_{\\mathrm{LP+clq}}$ adds the new inequality $x_0+x_1+x_2 \\le 1$, which is derived from the only maximal clique of size greater than $2$. This new constraint tightens the feasible region, potentially leading to a smaller (more accurate) objective value.",

            "problem": "You are asked to formalize the graph coloring problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model using binary decision variables and to study the effect of symmetry-breaking constraints on the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation. The fundamental base for this task includes the following well-established concepts: a graph is a pair $(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, a proper coloring assigns a color to each vertex such that adjacent vertices receive different colors, and an integer linear program is an optimization problem with a linear objective and linear constraints where some variables are restricted to integer values.\n\nFormulate an ILP for vertex coloring with an a priori cap of $K$ colors using binary variables $x_{v,c} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether vertex $v \\in V$ takes color $c \\in \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$, and $y_c \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether color $c$ is used. Your constraints must include:\n- For each vertex $v \\in V$, exactly one color is assigned: $\\sum_{c=1}^K x_{v,c} = 1$.\n- Linking constraints: for all vertices $v \\in V$ and colors $c \\in \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$, enforce $x_{v,c} \\le y_c$.\n- Conflict constraints for each edge $(u,v) \\in E$ and color $c \\in \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$: $x_{u,c} + x_{v,c} \\le y_c$.\n\nIntroduce symmetry-breaking constraints by ordering the color usage variables, enforcing $y_1 \\ge y_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge y_K$. Explain why these constraints do not eliminate any optimal integer solution but can tighten the LP relaxation by reducing symmetric fractional solutions.\n\nTo compare the LP gaps, consider the LP relaxation obtained by replacing $x_{v,c} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $y_c \\in \\{0,1\\}$ with $0 \\le x_{v,c} \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y_c \\le 1$, keeping all linear constraints unchanged. The LP gap for a given instance and constraint set is defined as the difference between the optimal ILP objective value and the optimal LP relaxation objective value.\n\nYou will evaluate the gaps on three different graphs, each on $N = 10$ vertices labeled by integers $0,1,\\ldots,9$ (all numbers are given without physical units; there are no angles or percentages in this problem). Use $K = 10$ colors. The three test instances are:\n\n- Graph $\\mathcal{G}_1$: the cycle $C_{10}$ on $10$ vertices with edges $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,5)$, $(5,6)$, $(6,7)$, $(7,8)$, $(8,9)$, $(9,0)$.\n- Graph $\\mathcal{G}_2$: the complete graph $K_{10}$ on $10$ vertices with edges $(i,j)$ for all distinct $i,j \\in \\{0,\\ldots,9\\}$.\n- Graph $\\mathcal{G}_3$: two $5$-cycles connected by a bridge, with edges $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,0)$, $(5,6)$, $(6,7)$, $(7,8)$, $(8,9)$, $(9,5)$ and the bridge $(4,5)$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Compute the optimal ILP objective value for each graph, which is the chromatic number $\\chi(\\mathcal{G})$, by exact combinatorial search of a proper coloring (you may assume $K = 10$ so the ILP is always feasible).\n- Solve the LP relaxation twice for each graph: once without symmetry-breaking constraints and once with the ordering constraints $y_1 \\ge y_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge y_K$.\n- Report, for each graph, the pair of LP gaps as $[\\text{gap without symmetry}, \\text{gap with symmetry}]$, where each gap is the ILP optimum minus the corresponding LP relaxation optimum.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each entry corresponds to a graph and is itself a two-element list of the two LP gaps in the order described above.

            "solution": "The problem statement provides a comprehensive and formally correct specification for an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model of the vertex coloring problem. It is scientifically grounded in the established theories of graph theory and mathematical optimization, well-posed, and free from any contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, we proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe task is to formalize the vertex coloring problem as an ILP, analyze its Linear Programming (LP) relaxation, and evaluate the effect of symmetry-breaking constraints on the LP gap for three specific graphs.\n\n**1. ILP Formulation for Vertex Coloring**\n\nGiven a graph $\\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$, a set of $K$ available colors $\\{1, \\dots, K\\}$, the problem of finding the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring (the chromatic number $\\chi(\\mathcal{G})$) can be formulated as an ILP. We define two sets of binary decision variables:\n- $x_{v,c} \\in \\{0,1\\}$: takes the value $1$ if vertex $v \\in V$ is assigned color $c \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$, and $0$ otherwise.\n- $y_c \\in \\{0,1\\}$: takes the value $1$ if color $c \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ is used in the coloring, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total number of colors used:\n$$ \\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = \\sum_{c=1}^K y_c $$\n\nThis objective function is subject to the following constraints as specified:\n1.  **Assignment Constraints**: Each vertex must be assigned exactly one color.\n    $$ \\sum_{c=1}^K x_{v,c} = 1 \\quad \\forall v \\in V $$\n2.  **Linking Constraints**: If any vertex is assigned color $c$, then color $c$ must be marked as used.\n    $$ x_{v,c} \\le y_c \\quad \\forall v \\in V, \\forall c \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\} $$\n3.  **Conflict Constraints**: For any edge $(u,v) \\in E$, vertices $u$ and $v$ cannot be assigned the same color $c$. The formulation $x_{u,c} + x_{v,c} \\le y_c$ enforces this. If $y_c=1$, it becomes $x_{u,c} + x_{v,c} \\le 1$, which ensures that at most one of $u$ or $v$ can take color $c$. If $y_c=0$, the linking constraints already force $x_{u,c}=0$ and $x_{v,c}=0$, satisfying the condition trivially.\n    $$ x_{u,c} + x_{v,c} \\le y_c \\quad \\forall (u,v) \\in E, \\forall c \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\} $$\n\n**2. Symmetry-Breaking Constraints**\n\nThe formulation above is highly symmetric. If we have a valid coloring, any permutation of the color labels results in another distinct but equivalent valid coloring. For example, swapping color $1$ and color $2$ everywhere yields a new solution with the same objective value. This symmetry can degrade the performance of solvers.\n\nTo mitigate this, we introduce symmetry-breaking constraints that enforce an ordering on the use of colors:\n$$ y_1 \\ge y_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge y_K $$\nThese constraints dictate that if $k$ colors are used, they must be the first $k$ colors in the set $\\{1, \\dots, K\\}$. This does not eliminate any optimal integer solution, as any optimal coloring can be relabeled to conform to this ordering without changing its objective value. However, it can significantly prune the search space of the solver and, more importantly for this problem, tighten the LP relaxation.\n\n**3. LP Relaxation and LP Gap**\n\nThe LP relaxation is formed by relaxing the integrality constraints on the decision variables, allowing them to take any real value between $0$ and $1$:\n$$ 0 \\le x_{v,c} \\le 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\le y_c \\le 1 $$\nThe optimal objective value of the LP relaxation, $Z^*_{LP}$, provides a lower bound on the optimal ILP objective value, $Z^*_{ILP} = \\chi(\\mathcal{G})$. The LP gap, defined as $Z^*_{ILP} - Z^*_{LP}$, measures the weakness of this lower bound. Symmetry-breaking constraints can cut off symmetric fractional solutions that are not representative of any integer solution, thus increasing $Z^*_{LP}$ and tightening (reducing) the gap.\n\n**4. Analysis of Test Instances**\n\nWe evaluate the LP gaps on three graphs, each with $N=10$ vertices and using a cap of $K=10$ colors.\n\n- **Graph $\\mathcal{G}_1$ (Cycle $C_{10}$)**: A cycle graph $C_n$ is bipartite if and only if $n$ is even. Since $C_{10}$ is an even cycle, it is bipartite and its vertices can be partitioned into two sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. Therefore, its chromatic number is $2$.\n  $$ \\chi(\\mathcal{G}_1) = 2 $$\n- **Graph $\\mathcal{G}_2$ (Complete Graph $K_{10}$)**: In a complete graph $K_n$, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Consequently, each of the $n$ vertices requires a unique color.\n  $$ \\chi(\\mathcal{G}_2) = 10 $$\n- **Graph $\\mathcal{G}_3$ (Two $5$-cycles with a bridge)**: This graph consists of two $5$-cycles, which are odd cycles. The chromatic number of an odd cycle $C_{2k+1}$ is $3$. Let the two $C_5$ subgraphs be $A$ and $B$. Both $\\chi(A)=3$ and $\\chi(B)=3$. A $3$-coloring of the entire graph is possible. For instance, one can $3$-color subgraph $A$. The vertex on $A$ connected by the bridge, say $v_A$, will have some color $c_A$. The adjacent vertex on $B$, $v_B$, must be colored with a color different from $c_A$. Since we have two other colors available, we can always complete the $3$-coloring of subgraph $B$. Thus, the chromatic number of the combined graph is $3$.\n  $$ \\chi(\\mathcal{G}_3) = 3 $$\n\n**5. Computational Approach**\n\nFor each graph, we will perform the following steps:\n1.  Construct the matrix representation of the LP relaxation based on the formulation above. This involves defining the objective vector `c`, the inequality constraint matrix `A_ub` and vector `b_ub`, the equality constraint matrix `A_eq` and vector `b_eq`, and variable bounds.\n2.  Solve the LP relaxation without symmetry-breaking constraints using `scipy.optimize.linprog` to obtain the optimal value $Z^*_{LP, \\text{no-sym}}$.\n3.  Add the symmetry-breaking constraints $y_c \\ge y_{c+1}$ to the inequality matrix and solve the modified LP to obtain $Z^*_{LP, \\text{sym}}$.\n4.  Calculate the two gaps for each graph $\\mathcal{G}_i$:\n    $$ \\text{gap}_{\\text{no-sym}} = \\chi(\\mathcal{G}_i) - Z^*_{LP, \\text{no-sym}} $$\n    $$ \\text{gap}_{\\text{sym}} = \\chi(\\mathcal{G}_i) - Z^*_{LP, \\text{sym}} $$\nThe final program implements this procedure for the three specified graphs and formats the output as required. The analysis predicts that for graphs $\\mathcal{G}_2$ and $\\mathcal{G}_3$, the symmetry-breaking constraints will lead to a non-zero reduction in the LP gap. For $\\mathcal{G}_1$, which has a simpler structure, the gap is expected to be zero in both cases.\n\nFor any graph with $N1$ and at least one edge, a universal fractional solution exists for the model without symmetry breaking: set $x_{v,c} = 1/K$ for all $v,c$ and $y_c=2/K$ for all $c$. This yields an objective value of $K \\times (2/K)=2$. This satisfies all constraints, demonstrating that $Z^*_{LP, \\text{no-sym}} \\le 2$ for any graph. For $\\mathcal{G}_1$, since $\\chi(\\mathcal{G}_1)=2$, the LP value is exactly $2$. For $\\mathcal{G}_2$ and $\\mathcal{G}_3$, this leads to large initial gaps.",
