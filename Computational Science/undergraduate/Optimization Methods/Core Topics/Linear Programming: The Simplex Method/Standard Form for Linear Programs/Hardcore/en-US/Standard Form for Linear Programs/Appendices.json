            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the dimensions of a standardized linear program. The standardized form is defined as having all equality constraints and all variables being nonnegative. The initial mixed linear program has decision variables $x = (x_f, x_+) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_f + n_+}$, where $x_f \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_f}$ are free variables and $x_+ \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_+}$ are nonnegative variables ($x_+ \\ge 0$). The constraints are given in three blocks: $A_{\\le} x \\le b_{\\le}$ ($m_{\\le}$ constraints), $A_{\\ge} x \\ge b_{\\ge}$ ($m_{\\ge}$ constraints), and $A_{=} x = b_{=}$ ($m_{=}$ constraints). The standardized problem will have a constraint matrix $\\tilde{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m} \\times \\tilde{n}}$. Our task is to find the expressions for $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$.\n\nWe will determine $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$ by systematically applying the allowed transformations to the constraints and variables.\n\n**1. Determination of $\\tilde{m}$, the number of constraints in the standardized problem.**\n\nThe standardized LP must have only equality constraints. We convert the initial set of constraints as follows:\n- The first block consists of $m_{\\le}$ inequality constraints of the form $A_{\\le} x \\le b_{\\le}$. Each such inequality is converted into an equality by introducing a unique nonnegative slack variable. For the $i$-th row, where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m_{\\le}\\}$, the constraint $(A_{\\le})_i x \\le (b_{\\le})_i$ becomes $(A_{\\le})_i x + s_i = (b_{\\le})_i$, where $s_i \\ge 0$. This process transforms the $m_{\\le}$ inequalities into $m_{\\le}$ equality constraints.\n- The second block consists of $m_{\\ge}$ inequality constraints of the form $A_{\\ge} x \\ge b_{\\ge}$. Each such inequality is converted into an equality by introducing a unique nonnegative surplus (or slack) variable. For the $j$-th row, where $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m_{\\ge}\\}$, the constraint $(A_{\\ge})_j x \\ge (b_{\\ge})_j$ becomes $(A_{\\ge})_j x - t_j = (b_{\\ge})_j$, where $t_j \\ge 0$. This process transforms the $m_{\\ge}$ inequalities into $m_{\\ge}$ equality constraints.\n- The third block consists of $m_{=}$ equality constraints of the form $A_{=} x = b_{=}$. These constraints are already in the required form and do not need any transformation. They contribute $m_{=}$ equality constraints to the standardized problem.\n\nThe total number of equality constraints, $\\tilde{m}$, in the standardized problem is the sum of the number of constraints from each of these three blocks.\n$$ \\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=} $$\n\n**2. Determination of $\\tilde{n}$, the number of variables in the standardized problem.**\n\nThe standardized LP must have only nonnegative variables. We account for the original variables and the new variables introduced during the conversion of constraints.\n- The initial problem has $n_f$ free variables, denoted by the vector $x_f$. Each free variable $x_{f_k}$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n_f\\}$ must be represented as the difference of two new nonnegative variables. We set $x_{f_k} = u_k - v_k$, where $u_k \\ge 0$ and $v_k \\ge 0$. This substitution replaces the $n_f$ free variables with $2n_f$ nonnegative variables.\n- The initial problem has $n_+$ variables, denoted by the vector $x_+$, which are already constrained to be nonnegative ($x_+ \\ge 0$). These variables already satisfy the condition and are carried over to the standardized problem. They contribute $n_+$ variables to the total count.\n- In the process of converting the $m_{\\le}$ inequality constraints, we introduced $m_{\\le}$ new nonnegative slack variables ($s_1, \\dots, s_{m_{\\le}}$).\n- In the process of converting the $m_{\\ge}$ inequality constraints, we introduced $m_{\\ge}$ new nonnegative surplus variables ($t_1, \\dots, t_{m_{\\ge}}$).\n\nThe total number of nonnegative variables, $\\tilde{n}$, in the standardized problem is the sum of all these variables.\n$$ \\tilde{n} = (\\text{variables from } x_f) + (\\text{variables from } x_+) + (\\text{slack variables}) + (\\text{surplus variables}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the systematic application of the specified standardization rules, the number of constraints in the final standardized problem is $\\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=}$, and the number of variables is $\\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge}$. The problem asks for the ordered pair $(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{n})$.\n\nTherefore, the expressions for $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$ are:\n$$ \\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=} $$\n$$ \\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} $$\n\nThis gives the ordered pair $(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{n}) = (m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=}, 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge})$.",

To obtain equality constraints, the engineer attempts to add a slack variable by writing $a^\\top x + s = b$ with $s \\ge 0$.

            "solution": "The core of the problem is to correctly convert a 'greater-than-or-equal-to' inequality in a maximization problem into an equality, and to determine the sign of the associated dual variable. We must analyze the engineer's attempted conversion based on two principles: preserving the feasible set and consistency with duality theory.\n\n**Principle (i): Preserving the Feasible Set**\nThe original constraint is $a^\\top x \\ge b$. This inequality means that the quantity $a^\\top x$ is either equal to $b$ or greater than $b$. Consequently, the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side must be a non-negative number.\n\nLet us define this non-negative difference as a new variable, $s$.\n$$s = a^\\top x - b$$\nBy this definition, it must be that $s \\ge 0$. This variable, $s$, which is subtracted from the larger side of a '$\\ge$' inequality to create an equality, is known as a **surplus variable**.\n\nRearranging the definition $s = a^\\top x - b$ gives the correct equality form:\n$$a^\\top x - s = b, \\quad \\text{with } s \\ge 0$$\nThis formulation is equivalent to the original constraint $a^\\top x \\ge b$. If $s=0$, then $a^\\top x = b$. If $s > 0$, then $a^\\top x = b+s > b$. Thus, $a^\\top x \\ge b$ is perfectly represented.\n\nNow, let us analyze the engineer's attempted formulation: $a^\\top x + s = b$ with $s \\ge 0$.\nRearranging this equation gives $a^\\top x = b - s$. Since $s \\ge 0$, the term $-s$ must be less than or equal to $0$. This implies:\n$$a^\\top x = b - s \\le b$$\nThe engineer's formulation is equivalent to $a^\\top x \\le b$. This reverses the direction of the original inequality and thus does not preserve the feasible set. The attempt is incorrect.\n\n**Principle (ii): Sign of the Dual Multiplier**\nThe sign of the dual variable associated with a constraint depends on the type of optimization (maximization or minimization) and the direction of the inequality. We can determine this rigorously by constructing the dual problem.\n\nThe primal problem $(P)$ is:\n$$\n\\max \\quad c^\\top x \\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\quad a^\\top x \\ge b \\\\\nx \\ge 0\n$$\nTo put this in a standard form for finding the dual, we can multiply the inequality by $-1$ to flip its direction:\n$$\n\\max \\quad c^\\top x \\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\quad -a^\\top x \\le -b \\\\\nx \\ge 0\n$$\nFor a maximization problem, a '$\\le$' constraint is associated with a non-negative dual variable, let's call it $y \\ge 0$. The dual problem is then:\n$$\n\\min \\quad -by \\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\quad -ay \\ge c \\\\\ny \\ge 0\n$$\nThis is one way to formulate the dual. A more common convention in duality tables states that for a maximization primal, a '$\\ge$' constraint corresponds to a non-positive dual variable. Let's call this variable $y_{alt} \\le 0$. If we set $y_{alt} = -y$, where $y \\ge 0$, then the dual becomes:\n$$\n\\min \\quad -b(-y_{alt}) = \\min by_{alt} \\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\quad -a(-y_{alt}) \\ge c \\implies ay_{alt} \\ge c \\\\\ny_{alt} \\le 0\n$$\nThis confirms that the dual variable associated with the original $a^\\top x \\ge b$ constraint must be non-positive ($y \\le 0$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The attempted reformulation reverses the inequality because $s \\ge 0$ forces $a^\\top x \\le b$. The correct equality is $a^\\top x - s = b$ with $s \\ge 0$, which preserves $a^\\top x \\ge b$. In the dual of a maximization problem, the multiplier for this constraint must satisfy $y \\le 0$.**\n- The analysis of the attempted reformulation ($a^\\top x + s = b, s \\ge 0 \\implies a^\\top x \\le b$) is correct.\n- The proposed correct equality ($a^\\top x - s = b, s \\ge 0$) is correct and uses a surplus variable.\n- The conclusion about the sign of the dual multiplier ($y \\le 0$) is correct, as derived above.\nAll three statements in this option are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The attempted reformulation is valid provided one enforces $s \\le 0$; with this choice the associated dual multiplier must satisfy $y \\ge 0$.**\n- If we take the engineer's equation $a^\\top x + s = b$ and enforce $s \\le 0$, we can define $s' = -s \\ge 0$. The equation becomes $a^\\top x - s' = b$, which is the correct formulation. So, the first clause is technically correct.\n- However, the second part states the dual multiplier must satisfy $y \\ge 0$. As proven earlier, for a $\\ge$ constraint in a maximization problem, the multiplier must be $y \\le 0$. This part is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The attempted reformulation is valid as stated, because adding any nonnegative slack preserves feasibility; the associated dual multiplier must satisfy $y \\ge 0$.**\n- The claim that the attempted reformulation is valid is false, as it reverses the inequality.\n- The claim that the dual multiplier must be $y \\ge 0$ is also false for a $\\ge$ constraint in a max problem. A multiplier of $y \\ge 0$ would correspond to a $\\le$ constraint.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The correct equality is $a^\\top x - s = b$ with $s \\le 0$, which preserves $a^\\top x \\ge b$. This implies that the associated dual multiplier is unrestricted in sign.**\n- The statement proposes $a^\\top x - s = b$ with $s \\le 0$. This implies $a^\\top x = b + s$. Since $s \\le 0$, we have $a^\\top x \\le b$. This does not preserve the original constraint $a^\\top x \\ge b$.\n- The statement that the dual multiplier is unrestricted is false. A dual multiplier is only unrestricted if the corresponding primal constraint is an equality *in the original problem formulation*. Here, the original constraint is an inequality, which leads to a sign-restricted dual variable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Multiply the constraint by $-1$ to get $-a^\\top x \\le -b$, then add a slack as $-a^\\top x - s = -b$ with $s \\ge 0$. This preserves feasibility and implies $y \\ge 0$ in the dual.**\n- Multiplying the inequality by $-1$ to get $-a^\\top x \\le -b$ is a valid first step.\n- The next step is to convert this '$\\le$' inequality to an equality. This is done by adding a non-negative **slack** variable. The correct form would be $-a^\\top x + s' = -b$ with $s' \\ge 0$. The option proposes $-a^\\top x - s = -b$, which is equivalent to $a^\\top x + s = b$. This is the same incorrect form as the engineer's original attempt.\n- The final claim is that this implies $y \\ge 0$ in the dual. For a maximization problem, a '$\\le$' constraint (like $-a^\\top x \\le -b$) does indeed correspond to a non-negative dual variable. However, since the proposed equality conversion is incorrect, the option as a whole is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
