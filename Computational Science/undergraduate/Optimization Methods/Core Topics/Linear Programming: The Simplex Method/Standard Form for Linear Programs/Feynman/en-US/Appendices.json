            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the dimensions of a standardized linear program. The standardized form is defined as having all equality constraints and all variables being nonnegative. The initial mixed linear program has decision variables $x = (x_f, x_+) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_f + n_+}$, where $x_f \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_f}$ are free variables and $x_+ \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_+}$ are nonnegative variables ($x_+ \\ge 0$). The constraints are given in three blocks: $A_{\\le} x \\le b_{\\le}$ ($m_{\\le}$ constraints), $A_{\\ge} x \\ge b_{\\ge}$ ($m_{\\ge}$ constraints), and $A_{=} x = b_{=}$ ($m_{=}$ constraints). The standardized problem will have a constraint matrix $\\tilde{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m} \\times \\tilde{n}}$. Our task is to find the expressions for $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$.\n\nWe will determine $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$ by systematically applying the allowed transformations to the constraints and variables.\n\n**1. Determination of $\\tilde{m}$, the number of constraints in the standardized problem.**\n\nThe standardized LP must have only equality constraints. We convert the initial set of constraints as follows:\n- The first block consists of $m_{\\le}$ inequality constraints of the form $A_{\\le} x \\le b_{\\le}$. Each such inequality is converted into an equality by introducing a unique nonnegative slack variable. For the $i$-th row, where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m_{\\le}\\}$, the constraint $(A_{\\le})_i x \\le (b_{\\le})_i$ becomes $(A_{\\le})_i x + s_i = (b_{\\le})_i$, where $s_i \\ge 0$. This process transforms the $m_{\\le}$ inequalities into $m_{\\le}$ equality constraints.\n- The second block consists of $m_{\\ge}$ inequality constraints of the form $A_{\\ge} x \\ge b_{\\ge}$. Each such inequality is converted into an equality by introducing a unique nonnegative surplus (or slack) variable. For the $j$-th row, where $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m_{\\ge}\\}$, the constraint $(A_{\\ge})_j x \\ge (b_{\\ge})_j$ becomes $(A_{\\ge})_j x - t_j = (b_{\\ge})_j$, where $t_j \\ge 0$. This process transforms the $m_{\\ge}$ inequalities into $m_{\\ge}$ equality constraints.\n- The third block consists of $m_{=}$ equality constraints of the form $A_{=} x = b_{=}$. These constraints are already in the required form and do not need any transformation. They contribute $m_{=}$ equality constraints to the standardized problem.\n\nThe total number of equality constraints, $\\tilde{m}$, in the standardized problem is the sum of the number of constraints from each of these three blocks.\n$$ \\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=} $$\n\n**2. Determination of $\\tilde{n}$, the number of variables in the standardized problem.**\n\nThe standardized LP must have only nonnegative variables. We account for the original variables and the new variables introduced during the conversion of constraints.\n- The initial problem has $n_f$ free variables, denoted by the vector $x_f$. Each free variable $x_{f_k}$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n_f\\}$ must be represented as the difference of two new nonnegative variables. We set $x_{f_k} = u_k - v_k$, where $u_k \\ge 0$ and $v_k \\ge 0$. This substitution replaces the $n_f$ free variables with $2n_f$ nonnegative variables.\n- The initial problem has $n_+$ variables, denoted by the vector $x_+$, which are already constrained to be nonnegative ($x_+ \\ge 0$). These variables already satisfy the condition and are carried over to the standardized problem. They contribute $n_+$ variables to the total count.\n- In the process of converting the $m_{\\le}$ inequality constraints, we introduced $m_{\\le}$ new nonnegative slack variables ($s_1, \\dots, s_{m_{\\le}}$).\n- In the process of converting the $m_{\\ge}$ inequality constraints, we introduced $m_{\\ge}$ new nonnegative surplus variables ($t_1, \\dots, t_{m_{\\ge}}$).\n\nThe total number of nonnegative variables, $\\tilde{n}$, in the standardized problem is the sum of all these variables.\n$$ \\tilde{n} = (\\text{variables from } x_f) + (\\text{variables from } x_+) + (\\text{slack variables}) + (\\text{surplus variables}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the systematic application of the specified standardization rules, the number of constraints in the final standardized problem is $\\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=}$, and the number of variables is $\\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge}$. The problem asks for the ordered pair $(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{n})$.\n\nTherefore, the expressions for $\\tilde{m}$ and $\\tilde{n}$ are:\n$$ \\tilde{m} = m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=} $$\n$$ \\tilde{n} = 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} $$\n\nThis gives the ordered pair $(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{n}) = (m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge} + m_{=}, 2n_f + n_+ + m_{\\le} + m_{\\ge})$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a student's erroneous conversion of a linear program (LP) to standard form and an evaluation of statements regarding the consequences of this error.\n\n**Analysis of the Original and Converted Systems**\n\n**Original System Feasibility:**\nThe constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0$.\nThe equality constraint $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ dictates the value of the expression $x_1 + 2x_2$. Substituting this into the inequality constraint gives $6 \\ge 4$, which is a tautology. Therefore, the first constraint is redundant. The feasible region is defined by the set of points $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, $x_1 \\ge 0$, and $x_2 \\ge 0$. This is the line segment connecting the points $(6, 0)$ and $(0, 3)$. Since this set is non-empty, the original LP is **feasible**.\n\n**Student's Converted System Feasibility:**\nThe student's constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1, x_2, s_1 \\ge 0$.\nFrom the second constraint, we have $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$. Substituting this into the first constraint yields:\n$$6 + s_1 = 4$$\nThis implies $s_1 = 4 - 6 = -2$.\nHowever, the student introduced $s_1$ as a nonnegative variable, i.e., $s_1 \\ge 0$. The result $s_1 = -2$ contradicts the condition $s_1 \\ge 0$. Thus, there is no solution $(x_1, x_2, s_1)$ that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. The student's converted system is **infeasible**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The equality $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$ encodes $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$, not $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$, so together with $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ it renders the converted system infeasible even though the original system is feasible.**\n\n- The equation $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ can be rewritten as $x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 - s_1$. Since $s_1 \\ge 0$, it follows that $4 - s_1 \\le 4$. Therefore, this equality correctly encodes the inequality $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. The student has used a *slack* variable, which is appropriate for a '$\\le$' constraint, on a '$\\ge$' constraint. This part of the statement is correct.\n- The student's system thus requires that $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ both hold. It is impossible for a quantity to be simultaneously equal to $6$ and less than or equal to $4$. As demonstrated in the analysis above, this renders the converted system infeasible. This part of the statement is correct.\n- As also shown above, the original system is feasible. This part of the statement is correct.\n- The entire statement accurately describes the student's error, its logical implication, and the resulting infeasibility, contrasting it with the feasibility of the original problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A correct equality conversion of the first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$, or equivalently $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$.**\n\n- The first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. This means the left-hand side exceeds the right-hand side by some non-negative amount. To form an equality, one must subtract this non-negative amount, called a *surplus* or *excess* variable, from the left-hand side.\n- Let $s_1 \\ge 0$ be this surplus variable. The correct conversion is $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$. This part of the statement is correct.\n- Multiplying the equation $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$ by $-1$ on both sides yields $- (x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1) = -4$, which simplifies to $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$. This is a valid algebraic manipulation and is equivalent to the first form. The condition $s_1 \\ge 0$ remains.\n- The statement presents the standard correct method for converting a '$\\ge$' inequality into an equality.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In the correct dual of the original maximization problem, the dual variable associated with the first constraint must satisfy $y_1 \\le 0$; treating that constraint as a “less-than-or-equal” and taking $y_1 \\ge 0$ is a dual sign error.**\n\n- Standard primal-dual relationships for a maximization problem are as follows:\n    - A '$\\le$' constraint corresponds to a non-negative ($y_i \\ge 0$) dual variable.\n    - A '$\\ge$' constraint corresponds to a non-positive ($y_i \\le 0$) dual variable.\n    - An '$=$' constraint corresponds to an unrestricted in sign ($y_i$ URS) dual variable.\n- The original problem is a maximization problem. Its first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$, which is a '$\\ge$' type. Therefore, the corresponding dual variable, let's call it $y_1$, must be non-positive, i.e., $y_1 \\le 0$. The first part of the statement is correct.\n- The student's error was to effectively treat the first constraint as $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. If one were to carry this mistake into the dual formulation, they would associate a non-negative dual variable ($y_1 \\ge 0$) with this '$\\le$' constraint. This would be a sign error in the dual problem. The second part of the statement correctly identifies this potential a dual sign error.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because the right-hand sides are nonnegative, adding a nonnegative slack with a plus sign to any constraint never changes the feasible region.**\n\n- This statement is a broad generalization. Let's test it against the problem's first constraint, $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. The student added a non-negative slack variable with a plus sign, which resulted in the equation $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$. As established in the analysis of option A, this is equivalent to the inequality $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$.\n- The original feasible region for this constraint is the half-plane defined by $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. The new feasible region is the half-plane defined by $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. These two regions are distinct and only share the boundary line $x_1 + 2x_2 = 4$.\n- Therefore, adding a slack variable with a plus sign to a '$\\ge$' constraint fundamentally changes the feasible region. The statement is false. The condition \"Because the right-hand sides are nonnegative\" is irrelevant to this logical error; the transformation from '$\\ge$' to '$\\le$' would occur regardless of the sign of the right-hand side.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
