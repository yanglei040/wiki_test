            "solution": "**1. Analysis of the Initial LP Problem**\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial problem to find the feasible region and the optimal solution.\nThe LP is:\nMaximize $z = x_1 + 2 x_2$ subject to:\n1.  $x_1 + x_2 \\le 4$\n2.  $x_1 \\le 3$\n3.  $x_2 \\le 3$\n4.  $x_1 \\ge 0$\n5.  $x_2 \\ge 0$\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon in the first quadrant. Its vertices are the intersections of the boundary lines:\n*   $(0, 0)$: Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$. $z = 0 + 2(0) = 0$.\n*   $(3, 0)$: Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $x_2=0$. $z = 3 + 2(0) = 3$.\n*   $(3, 1)$: Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $x_1+x_2=4$. $z = 3 + 2(1) = 5$.\n*   $(1, 3)$: Intersection of $x_2=3$ and $x_1+x_2=4$. $z = 1 + 2(3) = 7$.\n*   $(0, 3)$: Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2=3$. $z = 0 + 2(3) = 6$.\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is $z=7$, which occurs at the vertex $x^\\star = (1, 3)$. At this vertex, the two active constraints (besides non-negativity) are $x_2 = 3$ and $x_1 + x_2 = 4$. Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (with $n=2$ variables) and exactly two constraints are active, this vertex is non-degenerate.\n\n**2. Analysis after Adding the New Constraint**\n\nThe new constraint to be added is $x_1 + 3 x_2 \\le 10$. A constraint is redundant if it does not change the feasible region. We can check this by testing if all vertices of the original feasible region satisfy the new constraint.\n*   $(0, 0): 0 + 3(0) = 0 \\le 10$. (Satisfied)\n*   $(3, 0): 3 + 3(0) = 3 \\le 10$. (Satisfied)\n*   $(3, 1): 3 + 3(1) = 6 \\le 10$. (Satisfied)\n*   $(1, 3): 1 + 3(3) = 10 \\le 10$. (Satisfied, and is active at this vertex)\n*   $(0, 3): 0 + 3(3) = 9 \\le 10$. (Satisfied)\n\nSince all vertices of the original feasible region satisfy the new inequality, the feasible region remains unchanged. The new constraint is redundant.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Each Statement**\n\n*   **A. The feasible region is unchanged after adding $x_1 + 3 x_2 \\le 10$.**\n    This is **correct**. As shown in our analysis, the new constraint is redundant and does not alter the feasible set.\n\n*   **B. The optimal vertex $x^\\star = (1, 3)$ becomes a degenerate vertex because more than $n = 2$ constraints are active at $x^\\star$.**\n    The optimal vertex is still $x^\\star = (1, 3)$. Before, the active constraints were $x_1 + x_2 = 4$ and $x_2 = 3$. Now, the new constraint $x_1 + 3 x_2 \\le 10$ is also active at this point, since $1 + 3(3) = 10$. We now have three active constraints at a single point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is more than the dimension $n=2$, so by definition, the vertex has become degenerate. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C. The optimal value of the LP increases as a result of adding $x_1 + 3 x_2 \\le 10$.**\n    Adding a constraint can only restrict the feasible region further or leave it unchanged. It can never expand it. Therefore, the optimal value can only decrease or stay the same. In this case, since the feasible region and optimal vertex are unchanged, the optimal value remains $z=7$. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The addition can create the possibility of SM cycling under pivot rules that allow ties, because degeneracy is introduced; degeneracy is necessary but not sufficient for cycling.**\n    Degeneracy is a necessary condition for the Simplex method to cycle. By making the optimal vertex degenerate (as shown in B), we introduce the possibility that the Simplex algorithm could perform a sequence of pivots at this vertex without improving the objective function, potentially leading to a cycle if a non-anti-cycling pivot rule is used. The statement that degeneracy is necessary but not sufficient for cycling is also a standard result in LP theory. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **E. The number of extreme points of the feasible region increases.**\n    Since the feasible region is unchanged, the set of its extreme points (vertices) is also unchanged. The number of vertices remains 5. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **F. In standard form with slack variables, introducing $x_1 + 3 x_2 \\le 10$ can make a BFS associated with $x^\\star$ degenerate by causing at least one basic slack variable to have value $0$.**\n    Let's analyze the algebraic representation. Let $s_1, s_3, s_4$ be the slack variables for the constraints $x_1+x_2 \\le 4$, $x_2 \\le 3$, and $x_1 + 3x_2 \\le 10$ respectively. At the optimal vertex $x^\\star=(1,3)$:\n    *   $s_1 = 4 - x_1 - x_2 = 4 - 1 - 3 = 0$.\n    *   $s_3 = 3 - x_2 = 3 - 3 = 0$.\n    *   $s_4 = 10 - x_1 - 3x_2 = 10 - 1 - 9 = 0$.\n    A Basic Feasible Solution (BFS) in the new system will have $m=4$ basic variables (after adding all slack variables). At the vertex $(1,3)$, we have three variables ($s_1, s_3, s_4$) that are zero. A BFS is formed by choosing a basis. For this vertex, multiple bases are possible. Any basis must contain variables whose values are non-zero (like $x_1, x_2$, and some slacks). However, since there are more zero-valued variables than non-basic slots, at least one of these zero-valued variables must be chosen as a basic variable. A BFS is degenerate if at least one basic variable is zero. Therefore, any BFS corresponding to the vertex $(1,3)$ in the new system will be degenerate. For instance, a basis could be $\\{x_1, x_2, s_2, s_4\\}$, where $s_2$ is the slack for $x_1 \\le 3$. The values of these basic variables are $x_1=1, x_2=3, s_2=2, s_4=0$. Since the basic variable $s_4$ is zero, the BFS is degenerate. The statement is **correct**.",

There is no repetition of a previous basis, so no cycling occurs under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nCase $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (largest row index leaves):\n- Entering variable: $x_{1}$.\n- Leaving row: the largest index among ties is the second constraint row, so $s_{2}$ leaves. The pivot element is the $(2,1)$ entry, which equals $1$.\n\nPerform the pivot operations. Divide the pivot row by $1$ (no change). Eliminate the $x_{1}$-column entries from the other rows:\n- New first row: old first row minus old second row,\n$$\n[\\,1,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] - [\\,1,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,-1,\\,1,\\,-1\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\n- New $z$-row: old $z$-row minus $2$ times the old second row,\n$$\n[\\,2,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] - 2\\cdot[\\,1,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,-2,\\,0,\\,-2\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\nThe updated tableau is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n & x_{1} & x_{2} & s_{1} & s_{2} & \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\ns_{1} & 0 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\nx_{1} & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\hline\nz & 0 & -2 & 0 & -2 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow check the reduced costs: the only nonbasic decision variable is $x_{2}$ with reduced cost $-2$, which is not strictly positive in our maximization convention. Hence no variable is eligible to enter, and the algorithm terminates immediately. No repetition of a previous basis occurs, so no cycling under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{max}}$.\n\nCase $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{Bland}}$ (Bland’s anti-cycling tie-break among leaving candidates; smallest-index entering among those with maximal strictly positive reduced cost):\n- Entering variable: the only strictly positive reduced cost is for $x_{1}$, so $x_{1}$ enters. Among the tied leaving candidates, Bland’s rule selects the smallest-index basic variable, which is $s_{1}$ (since variable index 1 for $s_1$ is less than variable index 2 for $s_2$). Therefore this case produces exactly the same pivot as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$, and the resulting tableau is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n & x_{1} & x_{2} & s_{1} & s_{2} & \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\nx_{1} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\ns_{2} & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\hline\nz & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nAs before, there are no strictly positive reduced costs, so the algorithm stops immediately. No cycling occurs under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{Bland}}$.\n\nConclusion. For each of the three tie-break rules, the simplex method performs a single degenerate pivot and then terminates with no strictly positive reduced costs, and no basis is ever revisited. Therefore, if $C$ denotes the number of rules under which cycling occurs for this tableau, we have $C = 0$.",
