Extracted Givens:**\n-   **Problem Type:** Linear Programming (LP), minimization form.\n-   **Decision Vector:** $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n-   **Objective Function:** Minimize $c^T x$.\n-   **Nonnegativity Constraints:** $x \\ge 0$ (componentwise).\n-   **System of Linear Inequalities:**\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} &\\le 3, \\\\\n    - x_{1} + 4x_{2} + 2x_{3} &\\le -5, \\\\\n    3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} &\\le 7, \\\\\n    - 2x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} &\\le -1.\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n-   **Transformation Procedure:**\n    1.  Perform sign normalization: For each inequality with a negative right-hand side (RHS), multiply the entire inequality by $-1$.\n    2.  Introduce slack variables for $\\le$ constraints.\n    3.  Introduce surplus and artificial variables for $\\ge$ constraints.\n-   **Phase-I Objective:** The objective function for Phase-I is defined as the sum of all introduced artificial variables.\n-   **Initial Point:** The original decision variables are initialized at the zero vector, $x = 0$.\n-   **Question:** What is the value of the Phase-I objective at this initial point?\n\n**1.2. Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, self-contained mathematical problem within the scope of linear programming and optimization theory. The terminology is standard, the instructions are precise, and no scientific or logical flaws are present. It adheres to all criteria for a valid problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by following the prescribed transformation procedure.\n\n**2.1. Sign Normalization:**\nThe given system of inequalities is:\n1.  $2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} \\le 3$\n2.  $-x_{1} + 4x_{2} + 2x_{3} \\le -5$\n3.  $3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\le 7$\n4.  $-2x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} \\le -1$\n\nWe identify the constraints with a negative RHS. These are constraints 2 and 4. We multiply them by $-1$, which reverses the direction of the inequality sign from $\\le$ to $\\ge$.\n\n-   Constraint 2: $(-1)(-x_{1} + 4x_{2} + 2x_{3}) \\ge (-1)(-5) \\implies x_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\ge 5$.\n-   Constraint 4: $(-1)(-2x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}) \\ge (-1)(-1) \\implies 2x_{1} - x_{2} - x_{3} \\ge 1$.\n\nThe sign-normalized system of inequalities is:\n1.  $2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} \\le 3$\n2.  $x_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\ge 5$\n3.  $3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\le 7$\n4.  $2x_{1} - x_{2} - x_{3} \\ge 1$\n\n**2.2. Conversion to Canonical Equality Form:**\nWe now convert this system into a set of linear equalities by introducing slack, surplus, and artificial variables. All introduced variables must be non-negative.\n\n-   For constraint 1 ($2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} \\le 3$): This is a 'less than or equal to' inequality. We add a non-negative **slack variable** $s_1 \\ge 0$.\n    $$2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} + s_1 = 3$$\n\n-   For constraint 2 ($x_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\ge 5$): This is a 'greater than or equal to' inequality. We subtract a non-negative **surplus variable** $s_2 \\ge 0$.\n    $$x_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} - s_2 = 5$$\n    To obtain an initial basic feasible solution (where the basis forms an identity matrix), we must also add a non-negative **artificial variable** $a_1 \\ge 0$.\n    $$x_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} - s_2 + a_1 = 5$$\n\n-   For constraint 3 ($3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\le 7$): This is a 'less than or equal to' inequality. We add a non-negative **slack variable** $s_3 \\ge 0$.\n    $$3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} + s_3 = 7$$\n\n-   For constraint 4 ($2x_{1} - x_{2} - x_{3} \\ge 1$): This is a 'greater than or equal to' inequality. We subtract a non-negative **surplus variable** $s_4 \\ge 0$ and add a non-negative **artificial variable** $a_2 \\ge 0$.\n    $$2x_{1} - x_{2} - x_{3} - s_4 + a_2 = 1$$\n\nThe resulting canonical equality system is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} + s_1 \\phantom{-s_2+a_1} \\phantom{+s_3} \\phantom{-s_4+a_2} &= 3 \\\\\nx_{1} - 4x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\phantom{+s_1} - s_2 + a_1 \\phantom{+s_3} \\phantom{-s_4+a_2} &= 5 \\\\\n3x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x_{3} \\phantom{+s_1} \\phantom{-s_2+a_1} + s_3 \\phantom{-s_4+a_2} &= 7 \\\\\n2x_{1} - x_{2} - x_{3} \\phantom{+s_1} \\phantom{-s_2+a_1} \\phantom{+s_3} - s_4 + a_2 &= 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nsubject to the nonnegativity constraints: $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, a_1, a_2 \\ge 0$.\n\n**2.3. Phase-I Objective and Initial Value Calculation:**\nThe Phase-I objective is to minimize the sum of the artificial variables. Let this objective function be $w$.\n$$w = a_1 + a_2$$\nThe initial point for the Phase-I simplex procedure corresponds to an initial basic feasible solution for this auxiliary system. The basis is chosen to be the identity matrix embedded in the constraints, which corresponds to the variables $\\{s_1, a_1, s_3, a_2\\}$. These are the initial basic variables. All other variables, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, s_2, s_4\\}$, are the initial non-basic variables and are set to $0$.\n\nThe problem states that the original decision variables are initialized at $x = 0$, which means $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 0$, and $x_3 = 0$. This is consistent with them being non-basic. The surplus variables $s_2$ and $s_4$ are also non-basic and thus set to $0$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the canonical equality system to find the values of the basic variables:\n-   From eq. 1: $2(0) - (0) + (0) + s_1 = 3 \\implies s_1 = 3$.\n-   From eq. 2: $(0) - 4(0) - 2(0) - (0) + a_1 = 5 \\implies a_1 = 5$.\n-   From eq. 3: $3(0) + (0) - 2(0) + s_3 = 7 \\implies s_3 = 7$.\n-   From eq. 4: $2(0) - (0) - (0) - (0) + a_2 = 1 \\implies a_2 = 1$.\n\nThe initial basic feasible solution is $(x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, a_1, a_2) = (0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 5, 1)$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the value of the Phase-I objective function $w$ at this initial point:\n$$w = a_1 + a_2 = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n\nThe value of the Phase-I objective at the specified initial point is $6$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe first step is to convert the given linear program's constraints into the canonical form, which consists of a system of linear equalities with non-negative right-hand side (RHS) values. This is achieved by introducing slack and surplus variables.\n\nThe original constraints are:\n1. $2 x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 6$\n2. $-x_{1} + 3 x_{2} + 2 x_{3} \\geq 2$\n3. $x_{1} + x_{2} - x_{3} = 1$\n\nFor the first constraint, a \"less than or equal to\" inequality, we introduce a non-negative slack variable $s_{1}$:\n$2 x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} + s_{1} = 6$, with $s_{1} \\geq 0$.\nThe RHS is $6$, which is non-negative.\n\nFor the second constraint, a \"greater than or equal to\" inequality, we introduce a non-negative surplus variable $s_{2}$:\n$-x_{1} + 3 x_{2} + 2 x_{3} - s_{2} = 2$, with $s_{2} \\geq 0$.\nThe RHS is $2$, which is non-negative.\n\nThe third constraint is already an equality with a non-negative RHS:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - x_{3} = 1$.\n\nThe complete system of canonical constraints is:\n$2 x_{1} - x_{2} + x_{3} + 1 s_{1} + 0 s_{2} = 6$\n$-1 x_{1} + 3 x_{2} + 2 x_{3} + 0 s_{1} - 1 s_{2} = 2$\n$1 x_{1} + 1 x_{2} - 1 x_{3} + 0 s_{1} + 0 s_{2} = 1$\n\nThe set of all variables is $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, s_{1}, s_{2}\\}$, and all are required to be non-negative.

The basic matrix, denoted as $A_{B}$, is constructed by taking the columns from $A$ that correspond to these variables, in the given order.\n- The column for $s_{1}$ is the $4^{th}$ column of $A$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The column for $x_{2}$ is the $2^{nd}$ column of $A$: $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The column for $x_{1}$ is the $1^{st}$ column of $A$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAssembling these columns in the specified order gives the basic matrix $A_{B}$:\n$$\nA_{B} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo verify that this set of columns forms a valid basis, we must check if the matrix $A_{B}$ is invertible, which is true if and only if its determinant is non-zero.

Using cofactor expansion along the first column is most efficient due to the zeros:\n$$\n\\det(A_{B}) = 1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_{B}) = 1 \\cdot ((3)(1) - (-1)(1))\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_{B}) = 1 \\cdot (3 + 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_{B}) = 4\n$$\nSince $\\det(A_{B}) = 4 \\neq 0$, the matrix $A_{B}$ is invertible, and the columns corresponding to $\\{s_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1}\\}$ indeed form a valid basis.

We need to express the basic variables and the objective function in terms of only the non-basic variables.\n\nThe system of constraints can be written in matrix form as $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where the columns of $A$ are partitioned into a basis matrix $B$ and a non-basic matrix $N$.\n$$\nB \\mathbf{x}_B + N \\mathbf{x}_N = \\mathbf{b}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{x}_B = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_N = \\begin{pmatrix} x_4 \\\\ s_1 \\\\ s_2 \\\\ s_3 \\end{pmatrix}$.

We need to compute $B^{-1}N$:\n$$\nB^{-1}N = \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 6 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 6 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 6 & -2 \\\\ 8 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the equations for the basic variables are:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 11/8 \\\\ 13/4 \\\\ 23/8 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 6 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 6 & -2 \\\\ 8 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_4 \\\\ s_1 \\\\ s_2 \\\\ s_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives us the first part of the dictionary:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{11}{8} - \\frac{1}{2} x_4 - \\frac{3}{8} s_1 + \\frac{3}{16} s_2 - \\frac{1}{16} s_3 \\\\\nx_2 = \\frac{13}{4} \\qquad - \\frac{1}{4} s_1 - \\frac{3}{8} s_2 + \\frac{1}{8} s_3 \\\\\nx_3 = \\frac{23}{8} - \\frac{1}{2} x_4 + \\frac{1}{8} s_1 - \\frac{1}{16} s_2 - \\frac{5}{16} s_3\n$$\nFinally, we express the objective function $z$ in terms of the non-basic variables. Let $\\mathbf{c}_B^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{c}_N^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nz = \\mathbf{c}_B^T \\mathbf{x}_B + \\mathbf{c}_N^T \\mathbf{x}_N = \\mathbf{c}_B^T (B^{-1}\\mathbf{b} - B^{-1}N \\mathbf{x}_N) + \\mathbf{c}_N^T \\mathbf{x}_N\n$$\n$$\nz = \\mathbf{c}_B^T (B^{-1}\\mathbf{b}) + (\\mathbf{c}_N^T - \\mathbf{c}_B^T B^{-1}N) \\mathbf{x}_N\n$$\nThe constant term is the objective value at the basic feasible solution:\n$$\nz_0 = \\mathbf{c}_B^T (B^{-1}\\mathbf{b}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 11/8 \\\\ 13/4 \\\\ 23/8 \\end{pmatrix} = 5\\left(\\frac{11}{8}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{13}{4}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{23}{8}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nz_0 = \\frac{55}{8} + \\frac{3 \\cdot 26}{8} + \\frac{92}{8} = \\frac{55 + 78 + 92}{8} = \\frac{225}{8}\n$$\nThis is the required objective value.\nTo complete the dictionary for pedagogical purposes, we find the coefficients of the non-basic variables in the objective row:\n$$\n\\mathbf{c}_B^T B^{-1}N = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 6 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 6 & -2 \\\\ 8 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{pmatrix} 40+0+32, & 30+12-8, & -15+18+4, & 5-6+20 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{16}\\begin{pmatrix} 72 & 34 & 7 & 19 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced costs are $\\mathbf{c}_N^T - \\mathbf{c}_B^T B^{-1}N$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{1}{16}\\begin{pmatrix} 72 & 34 & 7 & 19 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \\frac{72}{16}, & -\\frac{34}{16}, & -\\frac{7}{16}, & -\\frac{19}{16} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32-72}{16}, & -\\frac{17}{8}, & -\\frac{7}{16}, & -\\frac{19}{16} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{40}{16}, & -\\frac{17}{8}, & -\\frac{7}{16}, & -\\frac{19}{16} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{5}{2}, & -\\frac{17}{8}, & -\\frac{7}{16}, & -\\frac{19}{16} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe full canonical simplex dictionary is:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{11}{8} - \\frac{1}{2} x_4 - \\frac{3}{8} s_1 + \\frac{3}{16} s_2 - \\frac{1}{16} s_3 \\\\\nx_2 = \\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} s_1 - \\frac{3}{8} s_2 + \\frac{1}{8} s_3 \\\\\nx_3 = \\frac{23}{8} - \\frac{1}{2} x_4 + \\frac{1}{8} s_1 - \\frac{1}{16} s_2 - \\frac{5}{16} s_3 \\\\\n\\hline\nz \\ \\ = \\frac{225}{8} - \\frac{5}{2} x_4 - \\frac{17}{8} s_1 - \\frac{7}{16} s_2 - \\frac{19}{16} s_3\n$$\nThe problem asks for the objective value at this basic feasible solution.
