            "solution": "The user has provided a linear programming (LP) problem and has requested that a Phase I simplex procedure be carried out to determine its feasibility.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\nThe problem is stated as:\nMaximize $z = x_{1}$ subject to:\n1. $x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$\n2. $x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 5$\n3. $x_{1} \\geq 0$, $x_{2} \\geq 0$\n\nThe task is to find the optimal value of the Phase I objective function, which is the minimum of the sum of artificial variables.\n\nThis is a standard problem in the field of optimization and linear programming. The concepts of Phase I, slack, surplus, and artificial variables are fundamental to the simplex method for solving LPs that do not have an obvious initial basic feasible solution. The constraints $x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$ and $x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 5$ are contradictory for non-negative $x_1$ and $x_2$, which implies the feasible region is empty. The Phase I procedure is precisely the standard algorithm to formally prove such infeasibility. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It is a valid problem for which a definitive answer can be derived using the specified method.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Conversion to Standard Form**\nFirst, we convert the inequality constraints into equalities.\nFor the constraint $x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$, we introduce a slack variable $s_{1} \\geq 0$:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n\nFor the constraint $x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 5$, we introduce a surplus variable $s_{2} \\geq 0$:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} = 5$\n\nThe system is now:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} = 5$\nwith all variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}$ being non-negative.\n\nTo start the simplex method, we need an initial Basic Feasible Solution (BFS). A BFS is typically found by setting the original decision variables ($x_1, x_2$) to zero. This gives $s_{1} = 3$ and $-s_{2} = 5$, or $s_{2} = -5$. Since variables must be non-negative, this is not a feasible solution.\n\nTo resolve this, we introduce an artificial variable $a_{1} \\geq 0$ into the second equation:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} + a_{1} = 5$\n\nThe complete set of constraints for the Phase I problem is:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} + a_{1} = 5$\n$x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1} \\geq 0$\n\nAn initial BFS can be found by choosing $\\{s_{1}, a_{1}\\}$ as the basic variables. Setting the non-basic variables $x_{1}=0$, $x_{2}=0$, $s_{2}=0$, we get $s_{1}=3$ and $a_{1}=5$. This is a valid BFS for the modified problem.\n\n**2. Phase I Objective Function**\nThe objective of Phase I is to minimize the sum of all artificial variables. In this case, we have only one, $a_{1}$. Let $w$ be the sum of artificial variables.\nMinimize $w = a_{1}$\n\nThe simplex method is typically formulated as a maximization problem. We can achieve this by maximizing the negative of $w$. Let $w' = -w = -a_{1}$.\nMaximize $w'$\n\nWe must express $w'$ in terms of the non-basic variables ($x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{2}$). From the second constraint:\n$a_{1} = 5 - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2}$\nTherefore, the Phase I objective function is:\n$w' = -a_{1} = -(5 - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} - 5$\nIn standard tableau form, this is written as:\n$w' - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = -5$\n\n**3. Simplex Tableau and Pivot Operations**\nWe construct the initial tableau for the Phase I problem. The basic variables are $s_{1}$ and $a_{1}$.\n\nInitial Phase I Tableau:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w' & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & a_1 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nw' & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -5 \\\\\ns_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\na_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTo improve the objective function $w'$, we select a non-basic variable with a negative coefficient in the $w'$-row to enter the basis. The coefficients for $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are both $-1$. We can choose either; let's select $x_{1}$ as the entering variable.\n\nNext, we perform the ratio test to determine the leaving variable. We divide the RHS value by the corresponding positive entry in the pivot column ($x_{1}$ column):\n- Row $s_{1}$: $\\frac{3}{1} = 3$\n- Row $a_{1}$: $\\frac{5}{1} = 5$\n\nThe minimum positive ratio is $3$, which corresponds to the $s_{1}$ row. Thus, $s_{1}$ is the leaving variable. The pivot element is $1$, located at the intersection of the $s_{1}$ row and the $x_{1}$ column.\n\nWe perform a pivot operation to make $x_{1}$ a basic variable and $s_{1}$ non-basic.\nThe pivot row (Row $s_{1}$) already has a $1$ in the pivot position. Let's call this New Row $x_1$.\nNew Row $x_{1}$: $[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3]$\n\nNow, we update the other rows:\nNew $w'$-row = Old $w'$-row + New Row $x_1$\n$[-1, -1, 0, 1, 0, -5] + [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -2]$\nThe full row is $[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -2]$.\n\nNew $a_{1}$-row = Old $a_{1}$-row - New Row $x_1$\n$[1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 5] - [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3] = [0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 2]$\nThe full row is $[0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 2]$.\n\nThe tableau after one pivot operation is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w' & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & a_1 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nw' & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -2 \\\\\nx_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\na_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**4. Final Answer Determination**\nWe examine the $w'$-row in the new tableau. The coefficients for the non-basic variables ($x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}$) are $0$, $1$, and $1$. Since all these coefficients are non-negative, the current tableau is optimal for the Phase I problem.\n\nFrom this final tableau, we read the optimal value of $w'$ from the RHS, which is $w'_{\\text{max}} = -2$.\nThe original Phase I objective was to minimize $w = a_{1}$. Since $w' = -w$, the minimum value of $w$ is given by:\n$w_{\\text{min}} = -w'_{\\text{max}} = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the value of the artificial variable $a_{1}$ directly from the tableau. Since $a_{1}$ is a basic variable, its value is given in the RHS column of its row: $a_{1} = 2$. The sum of artificial variables is just $w = a_1 = 2$.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Phase I method, if the optimal value of the sum of artificial variables is positive ($w_{\\text{min}} > 0$), then the original LP problem has no feasible solution. In this case, $w_{\\text{min}} = 2$, confirming that the original problem is infeasible.\n\nThe question asks for the optimal value of the Phase I objective, which is the minimum of the sum of artificial variables. This value is $2$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires performing one pivot step of the primal simplex method for a minimization linear program and calculating the updated reduced cost of a specific nonbasic variable, $x_{j}$. The process must adhere to the fundamental definitions and mechanics of tableau-based pivoting.\n\nThe givens are:\nThe initial basis matrix is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix, $B = I_{3}$.\nThe initial vector of basic variables is $x_{B} = b = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe cost vector for the basic variables is $c_{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nA new variable $x_{n+1}$ has column $a_{n+1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$ and cost $c_{n+1} = -3$.\nAnother nonbasic variable $x_{j}$ has column $a_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and cost $c_{j} = 5$.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested.\n\nStep 1: Pricing and selecting the entering variable.\nThe first step is to determine if the new variable $x_{n+1}$ is a profitable candidate to enter the basis. This is done by computing its reduced cost, $\\bar{c}_{n+1}$. The reduced cost is defined as $\\bar{c}_{k} := c_{k} - y^{\\top} a_{k}$, where $y^{\\top} = c_{B}^{\\top} B^{-1}$ is the vector of simplex multipliers.\n\nFirst, we compute the simplex multipliers $y^{\\top}$ for the current basis:\n$$y^{\\top} = c_{B}^{\\top} B^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} (I_{3})^{-1}$$\nSince the inverse of the identity matrix $I_{3}$ is itself, we have:\n$$y^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} I_{3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we can calculate the reduced cost of the entering variable candidate $x_{n+1}$:\n$$\\bar{c}_{n+1} = c_{n+1} - y^{\\top} a_{n+1} = -3 - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = -3 - 0 = -3$$\nFor a minimization problem, a variable is a candidate to enter the basis if its reduced cost is negative. Since $\\bar{c}_{n+1} = -3 < 0$, the variable $x_{n+1}$ will enter the basis.\n\nFor later use, we also compute the initial reduced cost of the nonbasic variable $x_{j}$:\n$$\\bar{c}_{j} = c_{j} - y^{\\top} a_{j} = 5 - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 5 - 0 = 5$$\n\nStep 2: Ratio test and selecting the leaving variable.\nThe next step is to determine which basic variable must leave the basis to make room for $x_{n+1}$. This is decided by the minimum ratio test. The test requires the simplex direction vector $d$, which is the representation of the entering variable's column in the current basis. It is calculated as $d = B^{-1} a_{n+1}$.\n$$d = (I_{3})^{-1} a_{n+1} = I_{3} a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe ratio test computes the maximum step length $\\theta$ that can be taken in the direction $-d$ before a basic variable becomes non-positive. $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$\\theta = \\min_{i=1,2,3 \\, : \\, d_{i} > 0} \\left\\{ \\frac{(x_{B})_{i}}{d_{i}} \\right\\}$$\nUsing the current basic solution $x_{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the direction $d = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$, we compute the ratios for each basic variable (let's denote them $x_{B1}, x_{B2}, x_{B3}$ corresponding to the rows):\n$$\\text{Ratio for } x_{B1}: \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\n$$\\text{Ratio for } x_{B2}: \\frac{8}{1} = 8$$\n$$\\text{Ratio for } x_{B3}: \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$\nThe minimum ratio is $\\theta = 2.5$, which corresponds to the third basic variable, $x_{B3}$. Therefore, $x_{B3}$ is the leaving variable. The pivot operation will occur in the third row of the simplex tableau. The pivot element is the element of the entering column $d$ in the pivot row, which is $d_{3} = 4$.\n\nStep 3: Pivot operation and updating the reduced cost of $x_{j}$.\nThe pivot operation updates the simplex tableau to reflect the change of basis. We are asked to find the new reduced cost of $x_{j}$, denoted $\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime}$, by applying the pivot's row operations, without recomputing the new basis inverse.\n\nIn a simplex tableau, the update rule for the reduced cost row (row $0$) during a pivot on element $d_{p}$ (in pivot row $p$) is:\n$$(\\text{New Row } 0) = (\\text{Old Row } 0) - \\bar{c}_{\\text{entering}} \\times (\\text{New Pivot Row})$$\nwhere $(\\text{New Pivot Row}) = (\\text{Old Pivot Row}) / d_{p}$.\nApplying this rule to the specific element in column $j$, the new reduced cost $\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime}$ is given by:\n$$\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime} = \\bar{c}_{j} - \\frac{\\bar{c}_{n+1}}{d_{p}} (\\bar{a}_{j})_{p}$$\nwhere $\\bar{a}_{j} = B^{-1}a_{j}$ is the column for $x_{j}$ in the current tableau, $p$ is the index of the pivot row, and $d_p$ is the pivot element.\n\nFrom our previous steps, we have:\nThe initial reduced cost of $x_{j}$ is $\\bar{c}_{j} = 5$.\nThe reduced cost of the entering variable $x_{n+1}$ is $\\bar{c}_{n+1} = -3$.\nThe pivot row index is $p=3$.\nThe pivot element is $d_{p} = d_{3} = 4$.\nThe column for $x_{j}$ in the tableau is $\\bar{a}_{j} = B^{-1}a_{j} = I_{3} a_{j} = a_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe element of this column in the pivot row is $(\\bar{a}_{j})_{p} = (\\bar{a}_{j})_{3} = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the update formula:\n$$\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime} = 5 - \\frac{-3}{4} \\times 2$$\n$$\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime} = 5 + \\frac{6}{4}$$\n$$\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime} = 5 + \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$\\bar{c}_{j}^{\\prime} = \\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{13}{2}$$\nThus, after the pivot operation where $x_{n+1}$ enters the basis and $x_{B3}$ leaves, the updated reduced cost of the nonbasic variable $x_{j}$ is $\\frac{13}{2}$.",

In the $(x_3, x_4)$-plane, this is the point $(0,2)$.\n\nWe have now found three optimal BFSs: $P_1, P_2, P_3$. These correspond to three vertices of the polygon defining the optimal face. A fourth vertex may exist at the intersection of the boundary lines $x_3 + 2x_4 = 4$ and $2x_3 - x_4 = 2$.\nWe solve the system of equations:\n$x_3 + 2x_4 = 4$\n$2x_3 - x_4 = 2$\nFrom the second equation, $x_4 = 2x_3 - 2$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$x_3 + 2(2x_3 - 2) = 4$\n$x_3 + 4x_3 - 4 = 4$\n$5x_3 = 8 \\implies x_3 = \\frac{8}{5}$\nThen, $x_4 = 2(\\frac{8}{5}) - 2 = \\frac{16}{5} - \\frac{10}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\nThis point $(\\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5})$ satisfies $x_3 \\ge 0$ and $x_4 \\ge 0$, so it is a valid vertex. This corresponds to a fourth optimal BFS, $P_4$.\nFor $P_4$: $x_3 = \\frac{8}{5}, x_4 = \\frac{6}{5}, x_5 = 0$. The values of the original basic variables are:\n$x_1 = 4 - (\\frac{8}{5}) - 2(\\frac{6}{5}) = \\frac{20-8-12}{5} = 0$\n$x_2 = 2 - 2(\\frac{8}{5}) + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{10-16+6}{5} = 0$\nSo, $P_4 = (0, 0, \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5}, 0)$. In this BFS, the basic variables are $x_3$ and $x_4$.\n\nThe four distinct optimal basic feasible solutions (extreme points) are:\n1. $P_1: (4, 2, 0, 0, 0)$\n2. $P_2: (3, 0, 1, 0, 0)$\n3. $P_3: (0, 4, 0, 2, 0)$\n4. $P_4: (0, 0, \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5}, 0)$\n\nPivoting from $P_2$, $P_3$, or $P_4$ on non-basic variables with zero reduced cost will lead back to one of these four solutions. For example, from $P_2$ (basis $\\{x_1, x_3\\}$), one can pivot to $P_1$ (by entering $x_2$) or to $P_4$ (by entering $x_4$). From $P_3$ (basis $\\{x_2, x_4\\}$), one can pivot to $P_1$ (by entering $x_1$) or to $P_4$ (by entering $x_3$). From $P_4$ (basis $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$), one can pivot to $P_2$ (by entering $x_1$) or to $P_3$ (by entering $x_2$).\nNo further distinct extreme points can be found.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $4$ distinct extreme points on the optimal face.",
