The arcs $(s,b)$ and $(b,t)$ are saturated in the forward direction.\nThe available $s-t$ paths in $G_1$ and their costs are:\n- $P_D: s \\to c \\to t$. Cost: $c_{sc} + c_{ct} = 3 + 1 = 4$. Path capacity is $\\min(u_{sc}, u_{ct}) = \\min(1, 2)=1$.\n- $P_E: s \\to a \\to t$. Cost: $c_{sa} + c_{at} = 1 + 4 = 5$.

Path capacity is $\\min(u_{sa}, u_{ab}, u_{bc}, u_{ct}) = \\min(2,2,1,2)=1$.\n(Note: Paths $P_B$ and $P_C$ are unavailable due to saturated arcs from Iteration 1).\nThe shortest path is $P_2 = s \\to c \\to t$ with a cost of $4$.\nWe augment $\\delta_2 = 1$ unit of flow along $P_2$.\n- Cost of this augmentation: $\\delta_2 \\times 4 = 1 \\times 4 = 4$.\n- Total flow: $v = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n- Cumulative cost: $C_2 = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n- Update flow variables: $x_{sc}=1$, $x_{ct}=1$.\n- Update residual network ($G_2$): $u^R_{sc} = 1-1=0$. $u^R_{ct}$ is reduced to $2-1=1$. Backward arcs $(c,s)$ and $(t,c)$ are introduced.\n\n**Iteration 3: Augment 1 unit of flow**\nWe find the shortest path in the residual network $G_2$. Now arcs $(s,b)$, $(b,t)$, and $(s,c)$ are saturated in the forward direction. Any path from $s$ must begin with the arc $(s,a)$.\nThe available paths starting with $(s,a)$ are:\n- $P_E: s \\to a \\to t$. Cost: $c_{sa} + c_{at} = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n- $P_F: s \\to a \\to b \\to c \\to t$. Cost: $c_{sa} + c_{ab} + c_{bc} + c_{ct} = 1+1+2+1=5$.\nBoth remaining path options have a cost of $5$. The algorithm may choose either one. Let's choose $P_3 = s \\to a \\to t$.\nWe augment $\\delta_3 = 1$ unit of flow along $P_3$.\n- Cost of this augmentation: $\\delta_3 \\times 5 = 1 \\times 5 = 5$.\n- Total flow: $v = 2 + 1 = 3$. This satisfies the requirement.\n- Cumulative cost: $C_3 = 6 + 5 = 11$.\n\nThe algorithm terminates as $k=3$ units of flow have been sent. The total cost is $C^{\\mathrm{SSP}} = 11$.\nThe final flow assignment is: $x_{sb}=1, x_{bt}=1, x_{sc}=1, x_{ct}=1, x_{sa}=1, x_{at}=1$, and all other flows are $0$. This flow is feasible and has a total cost of $1(2) + 1(4) + 1(5) = 11$.\n\n**Computation of $C^{*}$ and $\\Delta$**\nAccording to the fundamental theory of network flows, the successive shortest path algorithm correctly computes the minimum cost for a given amount of flow in a network with non-negative costs. Therefore, the cost $C^{\\mathrm{SSP}}$ obtained is the minimal possible cost.\n1. Minimal total cost: $C^{*} = C^{\\mathrm{SSP}} = 11$.\n2. Cost from the Successive Shortest Path algorithm: $C^{\\mathrm{SSP}} = 11$.\n3. The numerical difference $\\Delta$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta = C^{\\mathrm{SSP}} - C^{*} = 11 - 11 = 0\n$$\n\nThe final answer is the value of $\\Delta$.",

            "solution": "The problem is a well-posed Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) problem, a standard topic in network optimization. It is self-contained, mathematically consistent, and all terms are clearly defined. The total supply equals the total demand, $\\sum_i b_i = 10 + 0 + 0 - 10 = 0$, ensuring the potential for a feasible solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**1. Formulation of the Minimum Cost Flow Problem**\n\nLet $x_{ij}$ be the amount of flow on the directed arc from node $i$ to node $j$. The set of nodes is $N = \\{s, a, b, t\\}$ and the set of arcs is $A = \\{(s,a), (a,t), (s,b), (b,t), (a,b), (b,a)\\}$. The problem is to minimize the total cost of sending a flow of $10$ units from the source $s$ to the sink $t$.\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost, which is the sum of the costs on each arc multiplied by the flow on that arc:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } Z = c_{sa}x_{sa} + c_{at}x_{at} + c_{sb}x_{sb} + c_{bt}x_{bt} + c_{ab}x_{ab} + c_{ba}x_{ba} $$\nSubstituting the given costs, we have:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } Z = 2x_{sa} + 3x_{at} + 2x_{sb} + 3x_{bt} + 0x_{ab} + 0x_{ba} $$\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- **Flow Conservation:** For each node $i \\in N$, the net flow (total outflow minus total inflow) must equal the supply/demand $b_i$.\n    - Node $s$ (supply $b_s=10$):\n    $$ x_{sa} + x_{sb} = 10 $$\n    - Node $a$ (transshipment $b_a=0$):\n    $$ (x_{at} + x_{ab}) - (x_{sa} + x_{ba}) = 0 $$\n    - Node $b$ (transshipment $b_b=0$):\n    $$ (x_{bt} + x_{ba}) - (x_{sb} + x_{ab}) = 0 $$\n    - Node $t$ (sink/demand $b_t=-10$):\n    $$ 0 - (x_{at} + x_{bt}) = -10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x_{at} + x_{bt} = 10 $$\n- **Non-negativity and Capacity:** The flow on each arc must be non-negative and must not exceed its capacity. The lower bound is given as $0$ and the upper bound is $+\\infty$.\n    $$ x_{ij} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (i,j) \\in A $$\n    The infinite upper bounds do not impose active constraints.\n\n**2. Optimality Conditions from LP Duality**\n\nThe MCF problem is a Linear Program (LP). The optimality conditions can be derived from the theory of LP duality. We associate a dual variable, or node potential, $\\pi_i$ with each flow conservation constraint for node $i$. The dual LP is:\n$$ \\text{Maximize } W = \\sum_{i \\in N} b_i \\pi_i = 10\\pi_s + 0\\pi_a + 0\\pi_b - 10\\pi_t $$\nSubject to constraints derived from the primal variables $x_{ij}$. For each arc $(i,j) \\in A$, the dual constraint is:\n$$ \\pi_i - \\pi_j \\le c_{ij} $$\nThis can be rewritten using the concept of **reduced cost**, $c_{ij}^\\pi = c_{ij} - \\pi_i + \\pi_j$. The dual constraints are equivalent to requiring that all reduced costs are non-negative:\n$$ c_{ij}^\\pi \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (i,j) \\in A $$\nThe dual variables $\\pi_i$ are unrestricted in sign.\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality connect the primal solution $x$ and the dual solution $\\pi$. They consist of:\n1.  **Primal Feasibility:** The flow vector $x$ must satisfy all flow conservation and non-negativity constraints.\n2.  **Dual Feasibility:** The node potentials $\\pi$ must satisfy the reduced cost non-negativity condition, $c_{ij}^\\pi \\ge 0$ for all arcs $(i,j)$.\n3.  **Complementary Slackness:** For each arc $(i,j) \\in A$, the product of the primal flow and the slack in the dual constraint must be zero. The slack in the dual constraint is exactly the reduced cost. Thus, the condition is:\n    $$ x_{ij} \\cdot c_{ij}^\\pi = 0 $$\nThis implies that if a flow $x_{ij}$ is positive, then its corresponding arc must be \"tight,\" meaning its reduced cost $c_{ij}^\\pi$ must be zero. If an arc has a strictly positive reduced cost ($c_{ij}^\\pi > 0$), the flow on that arc must be zero.\n\n**3. Construction of an Optimal Flow and Certifying Potentials**\n\nLet's propose a simple feasible flow. The path $s \\to a \\to t$ has a total cost of $c_{sa} + c_{at} = 2 + 3 = 5$. The path $s \\to b \\to t$ also has a cost of $c_{sb} + c_{bt} = 2 + 3 = 5$. Let's send all $10$ units of flow along the first path.\nProposed flow $x$:\n- $x_{sa} = 10$\n- $x_{at} = 10$\n- $x_{sb} = 0$, $x_{bt} = 0$, $x_{ab} = 0$, $x_{ba} = 0$\nThis flow is primally feasible as it satisfies all conservation and non-negativity constraints.\n\nNow, we must find node potentials $\\pi_i$ that certify the optimality of this flow. The potentials are not unique, so we can set one arbitrarily, e.g., $\\pi_s = 0$.\nThe complementary slackness conditions require that arcs with positive flow have zero reduced cost:\n- For arc $(s,a)$ with $x_{sa}=10 > 0$: $c_{sa}^\\pi = c_{sa} - \\pi_s + \\pi_a = 2 - 0 + \\pi_a = 0 \\implies \\pi_a = -2$.\n- For arc $(a,t)$ with $x_{at}=10 > 0$: $c_{at}^\\pi = c_{at} - \\pi_a + \\pi_t = 3 - (-2) + \\pi_t = 0 \\implies 5 + \\pi_t = 0 \\implies \\pi_t = -5$.\n\nNext, we must ensure dual feasibility for all other arcs (those with zero flow). We need to determine $\\pi_b$ such that all remaining reduced costs are non-negative.\n- Arc $(s,b)$: $c_{sb}^\\pi = c_{sb} - \\pi_s + \\pi_b = 2 - 0 + \\pi_b \\ge 0 \\implies \\pi_b \\ge -2$.\n- Arc $(b,t)$: $c_{bt}^\\pi = c_{bt} - \\pi_b + \\pi_t = 3 - \\pi_b + (-5) = -2 - \\pi_b \\ge 0 \\implies \\pi_b \\le -2$.\n- Arc $(a,b)$: $c_{ab}^\\pi = c_{ab} - \\pi_a + \\pi_b = 0 - (-2) + \\pi_b = 2 + \\pi_b \\ge 0 \\implies \\pi_b \\ge -2$.\n- Arc $(b,a)$: $c_{ba}^\\pi = c_{ba} - \\pi_b + \\pi_a = 0 - \\pi_b + (-2) = -2 - \\pi_b \\ge 0 \\implies \\pi_b \\le -2$.\n\nThe only value that satisfies both $\\pi_b \\ge -2$ and $\\pi_b \\le -2$ is $\\pi_b = -2$.\nThus, our proposed set of potentials is $\\pi_s = 0$, $\\pi_a = -2$, $\\pi_b = -2$, $\\pi_t = -5$. This set satisfies all KKT conditions, certifying that our proposed flow is optimal.\n\n**4. Degeneracy, Zero-Cost Cycles, and Multiple Optima**\n\nAn interesting outcome of our chosen potentials is that several arcs with zero flow also have zero reduced cost. This is a condition known as degeneracy in LP, and it indicates the existence of multiple optimal solutions. Let's calculate all reduced costs with our potentials:\n- $c_{sa}^\\pi = 2 - 0 + (-2) = 0$\n- $c_{at}^\\pi = 3 - (-2) + (-5) = 0$\n- $c_{sb}^\\pi = 2 - 0 + (-2) = 0$\n- $c_{bt}^\\pi = 3 - (-2) + (-5) = 0$\n- $c_{ab}^\\pi = 0 - (-2) + (-2) = 0$\n- $c_{ba}^\\pi = 0 - (-2) + (-2) = 0$\nAll arcs in the network are tight (have zero reduced cost).\n\nA directed cycle comprised entirely of tight arcs is a zero-cost cycle. The cycle $a \\to b \\to a$ consists of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$. As shown, $c_{ab}^\\pi = 0$ and $c_{ba}^\\pi = 0$.\n\nLet $x^*$ be any optimal flow (e.g., the one found in part 3). Let $C$ be the cycle $a \\to b \\to a$. We can define a circulation $d$ on this cycle where $d_{ab} = \\delta$ and $d_{ba} = \\delta$ for some $\\delta \\ge 0$, and $d_{ij} = 0$ for all other arcs. This is a valid circulation because at node $a$, the net flow is $d_{ab} - d_{ba} = \\delta - \\delta = 0$, and at node $b$, the net flow is $d_{ba} - d_{ab} = \\delta - \\delta = 0$.\nThe cost of this circulation is $\\sum c_{ij} d_{ij} = c_{ab}\\delta + c_{ba}\\delta = 0 \\cdot \\delta + 0 \\cdot \\delta = 0$.\n\nWe can generate a new feasible flow $x' = x^* + d$. Since $d$ is a circulation, $x'$ will also satisfy the flow conservation constraints. Since all flows in $x^*$ are non-negative and we choose $\\delta \\ge 0$, the flow $x'$ remains non-negative. The cost of $x'$ is $\\text{Cost}(x') = \\text{Cost}(x^*) + \\text{Cost}(d) = \\text{Cost}(x^*) + 0$.\nThus, by adding a zero-cost circulation, we have created a new flow that is also optimal. For example, starting with $x_{sa}=10, x_{at}=10$ and all others zero, we can create a new optimal flow $x'$ with $x'_{sa}=10, x'_{at}=10, x'_{ab}=\\delta, x'_{ba}=\\delta$. This can be done for any $\\delta \\ge 0$, demonstrating an infinite number of optimal flow patterns, all achieving the same minimum cost. This phenomenon arises because the set of tight arcs contains a cycle, which is a direct consequence of the LP degeneracy.\n\n**5. Minimum Total Cost**\n\nThe minimum cost can be computed from any optimal flow. Using the flow $x$ from part 3:\n$$ Z = c_{sa}x_{sa} + c_{at}x_{at} = 2 \\cdot 10 + 3 \\cdot 10 = 20 + 30 = 50 $$\nAlternatively, we can use strong duality, which states that the optimal objective value of the primal problem equals the optimal objective value of the dual problem. Using our optimal potentials from part 3:\n$$ W = 10\\pi_s - 10\\pi_t = 10(0) - 10(-5) = 50 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The minimum total cost is $50$.",
