A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem of assigning each of the available digits $\\{1, 4, 5, 6, 8\\}$ to a unique empty cell $\\{2, 3, 5, 6, 8\\}$ to minimize a total cost is a classic instance of the assignment problem.\n\nThe assignment problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. In its general form, it considers a set of agents and a set of tasks, and a cost associated with assigning each agent to each task. The goal is to find a one-to-one assignment of agents to tasks that minimizes the total cost.\n\nLet the set of empty cells be the agents, $\\mathcal{I}=\\{2,3,5,6,8\\}$, and the set of available digits be the tasks, $\\mathcal{J}=\\{1,4,5,6,8\\}$. The size of the problem is $n=|\\mathcal{I}|=|\\mathcal{J}|=5$. We first construct the $5 \\times 5$ cost matrix $C = [c_{i,j}]$, where $i \\in \\mathcal{I}$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{J}$, using the provided rule $c_{i,j} = H-s_{i,j}$ for allowed assignments and $c_{i,j} = \\Gamma$ for forbidden ones. With $H=10$ and $\\Gamma=10^{4}$:\n\n-   **Row for Cell $i=2$**: Digits $\\{1,4,5\\}$ are allowed.\n    $c_{2,1} = 10-9 = 1$; $c_{2,4} = 10-6 = 4$; $c_{2,5} = 10-4 = 6$. Other costs are $\\Gamma$.\n-   **Row for Cell $i=3$**: Digits $\\{4,5,6\\}$ are allowed.\n    $c_{3,4} = 10-8 = 2$; $c_{3,5} = 10-7 = 3$; $c_{3,6} = 10-5 = 5$. Other costs are $\\Gamma$.\n-   **Row for Cell $i=5$**: Digits $\\{1,5,8\\}$ are allowed.\n    $c_{5,1} = 10-5 = 5$; $c_{5,5} = 10-9 = 1$; $c_{5,8} = 10-7 = 3$. Other costs are $\\Gamma$.\n-   **Row for Cell $i=6$**: Digits $\\{4,6,8\\}$ are allowed.\n    $c_{6,4} = 10-3 = 7$; $c_{6,6} = 10-9 = 1$; $c_{6,8} = 10-6 = 4$.

Other costs are $\\Gamma$.\n\nThe resulting cost matrix $C$, with rows indexed by cells $\\{2,3,5,6,8\\}$ and columns by digits $\\{1,4,5,6,8\\}$, is:\n$$\nC =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 4 & 6 & 10^4 & 10^4 \\\\\n10^4 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 10^4 \\\\\n5 & 10^4 & 1 & 10^4 & 3 \\\\\n10^4 & 7 & 10^4 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 10^4 & 10^4 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe mathematical formulation of the assignment problem is as follows. Let $x_{i,j}$ be a binary variable such that $x_{i,j}=1$ if cell $i$ is assigned digit $j$, and $x_{i,j}=0$ otherwise. The objective is to minimize the total cost $Z$:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize } Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}} c_{i,j} x_{i,j}\n$$\nsubject to the constraints:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}} x_{i,j} = 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I} \\quad (\\text{each cell gets one digit})\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} x_{i,j} = 1 \\quad \\forall j \\in \\mathcal{J} \\quad (\\text{each digit is used once})\n$$\n$$\nx_{i,j} \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I}, j \\in \\mathcal{J}\n$$\n\nWe can solve this using the Hungarian algorithm.\n**Step 1: Row Reduction.** Subtract the minimum value of each row from all elements in that row.\n-   Row $1$ min is $1$: $[1, 4, 6, 10^4, 10^4] \\rightarrow [0, 3, 5, 10^4-1, 10^4-1]$\n-   Row $2$ min is $2$: $[10^4, 2, 3, 5, 10^4] \\rightarrow [10^4-2, 0, 1, 3, 10^4-2]$\n-   Row $3$ min is $1$: $[5, 10^4, 1, 10^4, 3] \\rightarrow [4, 10^4-1, 0, 10^4-1, 2]$\n-   Row $4$ min is $1$: $[10^4, 7, 10^4, 1, 4] \\rightarrow [10^4-1, 6, 10^4-1, 0, 3]$\n-   Row $5$ min is $1$: $[6, 5, 10^4, 10^4, 1] \\rightarrow [5, 4, 10^4-1, 10^4-1, 0]$\n\nThe reduced matrix $C'$ is:\n$$\nC' =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 3 & 5 & 9999 & 9999 \\\\\n9998 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 9998 \\\\\n4 & 9999 & 0 & 9999 & 2 \\\\\n9999 & 6 & 9999 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 9999 & 9999 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Column Reduction.** Subtract the minimum value of each column of $C'$ from all elements in that column.\n-   Column $1$ min is $0$.\n-   Column $2$ min is $0$.\n-   Column $3$ min is $0$.\n-   Column $4$ min is $0$.\n-   Column $5$ min is $0$.\nThe matrix remains unchanged after this step.\n\n**Step 3: Determine an Optimal Assignment.** We look for a set of $n=5$ independent zeros (one in each row and column). By inspection of matrix $C'$, we can identify such a set on the main diagonal:\n-   Position $(1,1)$, corresponding to $x_{2,1}$.\n-   Position $(2,2)$, corresponding to $x_{3,4}$.\n-   Position $(3,3)$, corresponding to $x_{5,5}$.\n-   Position $(4,4)$, corresponding to $x_{6,6}$.\n-   Position $(5,5)$, corresponding to $x_{8,8}$.\n\nSince we have found a full set of $5$ independent zeros, this constitutes an optimal assignment. The optimal assignment is:\n-   Cell $2$ is assigned digit $1$.\n-   Cell $3$ is assigned digit $4$.\n-   Cell $5$ is assigned digit $5$.\n-   Cell $6$ is assigned digit $6$.\n-   Cell $8$ is assigned digit $8$.\n\nThe minimal total cost is the sum of the costs from the original cost matrix $C$ for these assignments:\n$$\nZ_{min} = c_{2,1} + c_{3,4} + c_{5,5} + c_{6,6} + c_{8,8}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{min} = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n$$\n\n**Comment on the \"all-different\" constraint**:\nIn Constraint Programming (CP), a problem like this would be modeled using variables for each cell, whose domains are the allowed digits. For example, variables $V_2, V_3, V_5, V_6, V_8$ would represent the digits in cells $2, 3, 5, 6, 8$. The core constraint would be $\\text{alldifferent}(V_2, V_3, V_5, V_6, V_8)$, which enforces that all these variables must take unique values.\nThe assignment problem formulation intrinsically captures this constraint. The two sets of equality constraints, $\\sum_j x_{i,j} = 1$ and $\\sum_i x_{i,j} = 1$, together enforce a bijective (one-to-one) mapping between cells and digits. This is exactly the semantics of the `alldifferent` constraint. The use of a very large cost $\\Gamma$ for forbidden assignments acts as a hard constraint, effectively removing those pairs from consideration, analogous to how domains are specified in CP. Thus, the assignment problem provides an optimization-based framework to solve what is, at its core, a constraint satisfaction problem with an objective function.",

The standard integer formulation uses decision variables $x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $x_{ij} = 1$ means worker $i$ is assigned to job $j$, and $x_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The linear programming (LP) relaxation drops the integrality requirement to $x_{ij} \\in [0,1]$.\n\nStart from the following base:\n- The fundamental model of the assignment problem is defined by the linear constraints $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_{ij} = 1$ for every $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{ij} = 1$ for every $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and the objective is to maximize $\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} c_{ij} x_{ij}$.\n- The concept of Total Unimodularity (TUM) is that a matrix $A$ is totally unimodular if every square subdeterminant of $A$ has value in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$.

            "solution": "This problem consists of two parts. The first part requires an explanation of why the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the standard assignment problem has integral extreme points. The second part requires calculating the integrality gap for a related but non-bipartite matching problem.\n\n### Part I: Bipartite Assignment Problem and Integrality\n\nThe assignment problem is defined on a set of workers $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and a set of jobs $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The decision variables are $x_{ij}$, where $x_{ij} = 1$ if worker $i$ is assigned to job $j$, and $x_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The objective is to maximize the total reward, $\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} c_{ij} x_{ij}$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n$1$. Each worker must be assigned to exactly one job: $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_{ij} = 1$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n$2$. Each job must be assigned to exactly one worker: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{ij} = 1$ for each $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe Integer Linear Program (ILP) requires $x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The LP relaxation replaces this with $x_{ij} \\in [0, 1]$, or more simply $x_{ij} \\geq 0$, since the constraints already imply $x_{ij} \\leq 1$.\n\nThe constraints can be written in matrix form as $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is a column vector of the $9$ variables $x_{ij}$, $A$ is the $6 \\times 9$ constraint matrix, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a column vector of six $1$s. Each column of $A$, corresponding to a variable $x_{ij}$, has exactly two non-zero entries, both equal to $1$. One $1$ appears in the row corresponding to the constraint for worker $i$, and the other $1$ appears in the row for job $j$.\n\nThis structure is key. The matrix $A$ is the node-edge incidence matrix of the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$, with one set of vertices representing workers and the other representing jobs. The columns of $A$ correspond to the edges of the graph, and the rows correspond to the vertices. A matrix is Totally Unimodular (TUM) if the determinant of every square submatrix is in the set $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. The incidence matrix of a graph is TUM if and only if the graph is bipartite. Since the assignment problem's constraint matrix is the incidence matrix of a bipartite graph, it is TUM.\n\nTo demonstrate this from first principles, we consider an arbitrary $k \\times k$ submatrix $S$ of $A$. We can show by induction on $k$ that $\\det(S) \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n- **Base Case ($k=1$):** A $1 \\times 1$ submatrix is just an element of $A$. The elements of $A$ are $0$ or $1$. Thus, the determinant is either $0$ or $1$.\n- **Inductive Step ($k > 1$):** Assume all $(k-1) \\times (k-1)$ submatrices have a determinant in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. Consider a $k \\times k$ submatrix $S$.\n    1. If $S$ has a column with all zeros, $\\det(S) = 0$.\n    2. If $S$ has a column with exactly one non-zero entry (which must be a $1$), we can expand the determinant along this column. The determinant is $\\pm 1$ times the determinant of a $(k-1) \\times (k-1)$ submatrix of $A$. By the inductive hypothesis, this minor is in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$, so $\\det(S) \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    3. If every column of $S$ has at least two non-zero entries, since each column of $A$ has exactly two $1$s, every column of $S$ must have exactly two $1$s. The rows of $A$ can be partitioned into a set for worker constraints ($U$) and a set for job constraints ($V$). Any column of $A$ has one $1$ in a $U$-row and one $1$ in a $V$-row. Let the rows of $S$ be partitioned accordingly into $S_U$ and $S_V$. If we sum the rows in $S_U$, we get a row vector. If we sum the rows in $S_V$, we get another row vector. For any column in $S$, its two $1$s must be distributed between the rows from $S_U$ and $S_V$. If for every column, one $1$ is in a row from $S_U$ and the other is in a row from $S_V$, then the sum of rows in $S_U$ is equal to the sum of rows in $S_V$. This implies linear dependence of the rows of $S$, so $\\det(S) = 0$. If there is a column with two $1$s both in $S_U$ or both in $S_V$, this would contradict the bipartite structure. For a bipartite graph incidence matrix, this case does not happen.\n\nSince $A$ is TUM and the right-hand-side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is integral (all entries are $1$), a fundamental theorem of linear programming states that all extreme points of the feasible region defined by $\\{ \\mathbf{x} | A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0 \\}$ are integral. Because the optimal solution to an LP can always be found at an extreme point, the optimal solution to the LP relaxation of the assignment problem will consist of integer values.\n\n### Part II: Non-bipartite Matching and Integrality Gap\n\nWe now consider a matching problem on a non-bipartite graph, specifically a $3$-cycle with vertices $V=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and edges $\\{1,2\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{3,1\\}$. The decision variables are $y_{12}, y_{23}, y_{31}$. The constraints are $\\sum_{e \\in \\delta(v)} y_e \\leq 1$ for each vertex $v$, where $\\delta(v)$ is the set of edges incident to $v$.\nThe constraints are:\n$y_{12} + y_{31} \\leq 1$ (for vertex $1$)\n$y_{12} + y_{23} \\leq 1$ (for vertex $2$)\n$y_{23} + y_{31} \\leq 1$ (for vertex $3$)\nThe objective is to maximize $Z = 3y_{12} + 3y_{23} + 3y_{31}$.\n\nFirst, we test if the constraint matrix is TUM. The matrix $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is a $3 \\times 3$ square matrix, so it is its own submatrix. Its determinant is:\n$$ \\det(A) = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 1) - 0(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 1) + 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0) = 1(1) + 1(1) = 2 $$\nSince $\\det(A) = 2$, which is not in $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$, the matrix $A$ is not totally unimodular. This is expected, as it is the incidence matrix of an odd cycle ($C_3$), a non-bipartite graph.\n\nNext, we calculate the optimal value of the ILP, $Z_{\\text{ILP}}$, where $y_e \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We want to find a matching (a set of edges with no common vertices) with maximum total weight. We can select at most one edge. For example, if we select edge $\\{1,2\\}$ ($y_{12}=1$), then both vertex $1$ and vertex $2$ are covered. The constraints $y_{12} + y_{31} \\leq 1$ and $y_{12} + y_{23} \\leq 1$ force $y_{31}=0$ and $y_{23}=0$. The solution $(y_{12},y_{23},y_{31})=(1,0,0)$ is feasible. The objective value is $3(1) + 3(0) + 3(0) = 3$. By symmetry, selecting any single edge gives an objective value of $3$. We cannot select two or more edges, as they would share a vertex. Thus, the optimal value for the integer program is $Z_{\\text{ILP}} = 3$.\n\nNow, we calculate the optimal value of the LP relaxation, $Z_{\\text{LP}}$, where $y_e \\in [0,1]$.\nConsider the feasible point $y_{12} = 0.5$, $y_{23} = 0.5$, $y_{31} = 0.5$.\nChecking the constraints:\n$y_{12} + y_{31} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\leq 1$\n$y_{12} + y_{23} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\leq 1$\n$y_{23} + y_{31} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\leq 1$\nThe point is feasible. The objective value at this point is $Z = 3(0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) = 3(1.5) = 4.5$.\nTo show this is optimal, we sum the three constraints:\n$(y_{12} + y_{31}) + (y_{12} + y_{23}) + (y_{23} + y_{31}) \\leq 1 + 1 + 1$\n$2(y_{12} + y_{23} + y_{31}) \\leq 3$\n$y_{12} + y_{23} + y_{31} \\leq 1.5$\nThe objective function is $Z = 3(y_{12} + y_{23} + y_{31})$. Multiplying the derived inequality by $3$, we get an upper bound on the objective:\n$Z = 3(y_{12} + y_{23} + y_{31}) \\leq 3(1.5) = 4.5$.\nSince we found a feasible solution that achieves this upper bound, the optimal value of the LP relaxation is $Z_{\\text{LP}} = 4.5$.\n\nFinally, the integrality gap is the difference between the optimal LP value and the optimal ILP value:\nIntegrality Gap = $Z_{\\text{LP}} - Z_{\\text{ILP}} = 4.5 - 3 = 1.5$.",
