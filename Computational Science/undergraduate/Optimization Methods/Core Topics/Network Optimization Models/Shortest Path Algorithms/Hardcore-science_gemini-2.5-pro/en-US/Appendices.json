            "problem": "A small data center's network consists of one central Router, labeled `R`, and five servers, labeled `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`, and `S5`. Data packets can travel between certain pairs of devices, and each connection has an associated latency, measured in milliseconds (ms). The network topology and latencies are as follows:\n\n- `R` is connected to `S1` with a latency of 10 ms.\n- `R` is connected to `S2` with a latency of 3 ms.\n- `R` is connected to `S3` with a latency of 8 ms.\n- `S1` is connected to `S2` with a latency of 4 ms.\n- `S1` is connected to `S4` with a latency of 2 ms.\n- `S2` is connected to `S3` with a latency of 2 ms.\n- `S2` is connected to `S4` with a latency of 9 ms.\n- `S3` is connected to `S5` with a latency of 5 ms.\n- `S4` is connected to `S5` with a latency of 1 ms.\n\nAll connections are bidirectional, meaning the latency is the same in either direction. Determine the minimum possible latency for a data packet to travel from the central Router `R` to each of the five servers.\n\nProvide the final latencies for `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`, and `S5`, in that specific order.

            "solution": "Dijkstra's algorithm is correct when all edge weights are nonnegative because once a vertex $u$ is extracted with minimal tentative distance $d(u)$, no shorter path to $u$ can be found via any remaining unsettled vertex.

            "problem": "A company is designing a new delivery network for its fleet of autonomous drones in a city. The network is modeled as a directed graph where nodes represent key locations (hubs, charging stations, customer addresses) and edges represent possible flight paths. Due to a combination of factors, such as utilizing tailwinds, regenerative braking during descent, or availing government subsidies for certain routes, the \"cost\" of traversing a path can be positive (representing energy consumption) or negative (representing an energy credit or monetary gain).\n\nThe drone's flight controller has a software limitation: for any given delivery task from a source to a destination, the flight plan must consist of at most $K$ flight paths (edges).\n\nConsider the following small-scale network with 5 locations labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The available flight paths and their associated costs are:\n- A to B, cost: 4\n- A to C, cost: 5\n- B to D, cost: 7\n- C to B, cost: -3\n- C to E, cost: 8\n- D to C, cost: 2\n- D to E, cost: -5\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum possible cost for a drone to travel from the main hub at location A to the destination at location E, using a path that consists of at most $K=3$ edges. If no such path exists, your answer should be 'Infinity'.",
            "solution": "We model the delivery network as a directed graph with nodes $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$ and edge costs as given. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of its edges. The task is to find the minimum total cost from $A$ to $E$ using at most $K=3$ edges. Because edge costs may be negative, we do not assume optimal substructure via greedy methods like Dijkstra’s; instead, we explicitly enumerate all paths from $A$ to $E$ with at most $3$ edges and compute their costs.\n\nFirst, consider paths of length $1$ (one edge) from $A$ to $E$. There is no direct edge $A \\to E$, so there are no valid paths of length $1$.\n\nNext, consider paths of length $2$ (two edges) from $A$ to $E$. The only possibility is $A \\to C \\to E$ because the available edges from $A$ are $A \\to B$ and $A \\to C$, and among the nodes reachable in one step, only $C$ has an outgoing edge to $E$. The cost is\n$$\n\\text{cost}(A \\to C \\to E) = 5 + 8 = 13.\n$$\n\nNow consider paths of length $3$ (three edges) from $A$ to $E$. We split by the first step out of $A$:\n- Starting with $A \\to B$: the only edge out of $B$ is $B \\to D$. From $D$, to reach $E$ within the third edge, we must use $D \\to E$. This yields the path $A \\to B \\to D \\to E$ with cost\n$$\n\\text{cost}(A \\to B \\to D \\to E) = 4 + 7 + (-5) = 6.\n$$\nThe alternative $D \\to C$ would end at $C$ in three edges and would not reach $E$ within $3$ edges.\n- Starting with $A \\to C$: the edges out of $C$ are $C \\to B$ and $C \\to E$. The choice $C \\to E$ gives only a $2$-edge path already accounted for. The choice $C \\to B$ would require a subsequent $B \\to E$ to reach $E$ in three edges, but there is no edge $B \\to E$. The only edge out of $B$ is $B \\to D$, which would necessitate a fourth edge to reach $E$, violating the $K=3$ constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only valid paths from $A$ to $E$ with at most $3$ edges are:\n- $A \\to C \\to E$ with cost $13$,\n- $A \\to B \\to D \\to E$ with cost $6$.\n\nTaking the minimum over all valid paths,\n$$\n\\min\\{13, 6\\} = 6.\n$$\n\nHence, the minimum possible cost from $A$ to $E$ using at most $3$ edges is $6$.",
