            "solution": "First, we will derive the formula for the induced matrix $1$-norm, denoted $\\|A\\|_1$, for a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$.

The $i$-th component of the vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is given by $y_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j$, where $a_{ij}$ are the entries of $A$. The $1$-norm of $Ax$ is then:\n$$\n\\|Ax\\|_1 = \\|y\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |y_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j \\right|\n$$\nApplying the triangle inequality for absolute values, which states that $|\\sum_k z_k| \\le \\sum_k |z_k|$, to the inner sum, we get:\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j \\right| \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij} x_j| = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}| |x_j|\n$$\nSubstituting this inequality back into the expression for $\\|Ax\\|_1$:\n$$\n\\|Ax\\|_1 \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}| |x_j| \\right)\n$$\nSince all terms are non-negative, we can interchange the order of summation:\n$$\n\\|Ax\\|_1 \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ij}| |x_j| = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( |x_j| \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ij}| \\right)\n$$\nLet us define $C_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ij}|$ as the sum of the absolute values of the entries in the $j$-th column of $A$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\|Ax\\|_1 \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_j |x_j|\n$$\nNow, let $C_{\\max} = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le n} C_j = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le n} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ij}|$. Since $C_j \\le C_{\\max}$ for all $j$, we can write:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_j |x_j| \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{\\max} |x_j| = C_{\\max} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |x_j| = C_{\\max} \\|x\\|_1\n$$\nCombining these inequalities, we have established an upper bound for the ratio $\\frac{\\|Ax\\|_1}{\\|x\\|_1}$:\n$$\n\\|Ax\\|_1 \\le C_{\\max} \\|x\\|_1 \\implies \\frac{\\|Ax\\|_1}{\\|x\\|_1} \\le C_{\\max} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\neq 0\n$$\nThis implies that the supremum of the ratio is also less than or equal to $C_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_1 = \\sup_{x \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|Ax\\|_1}{\\|x\\|_1} \\le C_{\\max}\n$$\nTo complete the derivation, we must show that this upper bound is attainable. That is, we must find a specific non-zero vector $x_0$ for which the equality $\\frac{\\|Ax_0\\|_1}{\\|x_0\\|_1} = C_{\\max}$ holds.\n\nLet $k$ be the index of the column for which the maximum absolute column sum is achieved, such that $C_k = C_{\\max}$. Consider the vector $x_0 = e_k$, where $e_k$ is the $k$-th standard basis vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This vector has a $1$ in the $k$-th position and $0$s elsewhere.\nThe $1$-norm of this vector is $\\|x_0\\|_1 = \\|e_k\\|_1 = 1$.\nThe product $Ax_0 = Ae_k$ is the $k$-th column of the matrix $A$. Let's denote this column vector as $a_k$.\nThe $1$-norm of $Ax_0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\|Ax_0\\|_1 = \\|a_k\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ik}|\n$$\nBy our definition of the index $k$, this sum is exactly $C_k = C_{\\max}$.\nFor this specific choice of $x_0 = e_k$, the ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|Ax_0\\|_1}{\\|x_0\\|_1} = \\frac{C_{\\max}}{1} = C_{\\max}\n$$\nSince we have found a vector $x_0$ for which the ratio equals $C_{\\max}$, and we have also shown that the ratio can never exceed $C_{\\max}$, we conclude that the supremum must be exactly $C_{\\max}$. Thus, the closed-form expression for the induced matrix $1$-norm is the maximum absolute column sum:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_{1} = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le n} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |a_{ij}|\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given matrix:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n7.5  0.2  -0.1 \\\\\n8.3  -0.15  0.05 \\\\\n6.9  0.1  0.2 \\\\\n9.1  -0.05  -0.15 \\\\\n8.7  0.25  0.05\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $m=5$ and $n=3$. We calculate the absolute column sums $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.\nFor the first column ($j=1$):\n$$\nC_1 = |7.5| + |8.3| + |6.9| + |9.1| + |8.7| = 7.5 + 8.3 + 6.9 + 9.1 + 8.7 = 40.5\n$$\nFor the second column ($j=2$):\n$$\nC_2 = |0.2| + |-0.15| + |0.1| + |-0.05| + |0.25| = 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.1 + 0.05 + 0.25 = 0.75\n$$\nFor the third column ($j=3$):\n$$\nC_3 = |-0.1| + |0.05| + |0.2| + |-0.15| + |0.05| = 0.1 + 0.05 + 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.55\n$$\nThe induced matrix $1$-norm is the maximum of these sums:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_{1} = \\max(C_1, C_2, C_3) = \\max(40.5, 0.75, 0.55) = 40.5\n$$\n\nFinally, we explain the connection to feature scaling. The derived formula, $\\|A\\|_1 = \\max_j \\sum_i |a_{ij}|$, reveals that the induced $1$-norm is determined solely by the column with the largest sum of absolute values. In the context given, each column of $A$ represents a feature, and its entries are the values of that feature across different samples. The sum $\\sum_i |a_{ij}|$ can be interpreted as a measure of the total magnitude or scale of the $j$-th feature in the dataset.\n\nThe induced norm $\\|A\\|_1$ quantifies the maximum amplification of a vector's $1$-norm under the linear transformation $x \\mapsto Ax$. It represents a worst-case sensitivity metric: any input perturbation $\\delta x$ to a vector $x$ will result in a perturbation $\\delta y = A\\delta x$ in the output, bounded by $\\|\\delta y\\|_1 \\le \\|A\\|_1 \\|\\delta x\\|_1$.\n\nThe given matrix $A$ was constructed to have one feature (the first column) with a much larger scale than the others. As our calculation shows, this imbalanced scaling causes the absolute sum of the first column ($C_1=40.5$) to completely dominate the sums of the other columns ($C_2=0.75$, $C_3=0.55$). Consequently, the overall norm $\\|A\\|_1$ is determined entirely by this single, heavily scaled feature. This implies that the stability and behavior of any optimization algorithm sensitive to this norm (like certain coordinate-wise methods) will be dictated by the worst-scaled feature. Perturbations aligned with this feature (i.e., concentrated in the first component of the input vector $x$) are amplified by a factor of $40.5$, while perturbations along other feature directions would be amplified by much smaller factors. Such a large, imbalanced amplification factor can lead to poor conditioning and instability in numerical methods, which is why feature scaling (e.g., standardizing columns to have a similar scale) is a critical preprocessing step for many optimization and machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe exact numerical value of $\\|A\\|_1$ is $40.5$.",

To show it is invertible and find its inverse, we first analyze the properties of $S$. Let's compute $S^2$. The element $(i, k)$ of $S^2$ is given by $(S^2)_{ik} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} s_{ij} s_{jk}$.\n- If $i  1$, then $s_{ij} = 0$ for all $j$, so $(S^2)_{ik} = 0$.\n- If $i = 1$, then $(S^2)_{1k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} s_{1j} s_{jk}$. The only non-zero terms $s_{1j}$ are for $j \\in \\{2, 3, \\dots, n\\}$. Thus, the sum becomes $(S^2)_{1k} = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} s_{1j} s_{jk} = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} (1) s_{jk}$.\nFor $s_{jk}$ to be non-zero, we must have $j=1$. However, the sum runs from $j=2$ to $n$. Therefore, for every $j$ in the sum, $s_{jk} = 0$.\nAs a result, $(S^2)_{1k} = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} 0 = 0$ for all $k$.\nSince all elements of $S^2$ are zero, $S^2 = O$, where $O$ is the $n \\times n$ zero matrix. This shows that $S$ is a nilpotent matrix of order $2$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is given by $A = I - S$.
