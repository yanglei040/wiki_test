The method relies on the Intermediate Value Theorem, which guarantees at least one root in the interval $(a_0, b_0)$.\n\nAt each step, the method divides the interval in two by computing the midpoint $c_k = \\frac{a_k + b_k}{2}$.

Specifically:\n- If $f(a_k)f(c_k)  0$, then the new interval is $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}] = [a_k, c_k]$.\n- If $f(c_k)f(b_k)  0$, then the new interval is $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}] = [c_k, b_k]$.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = 2^x - x^2$.
