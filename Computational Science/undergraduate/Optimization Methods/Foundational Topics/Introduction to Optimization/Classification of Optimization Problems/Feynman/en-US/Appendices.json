            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed question in optimization theory. It asks to classify the bounded least-squares problem and determine the condition for strict convexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Objective Function**: The objective function is $f(x) = \\lVert A x - b \\rVert_2^2$. We can expand this expression:\n    $$ f(x) = (Ax - b)^\\top (Ax - b) = x^\\top A^\\top A x - 2 b^\\top A x + b^\\top b $$\n    This is a quadratic function of the variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, in the form $x^\\top Q x + c^\\top x + d$ with $Q = A^\\top A$, $c = -2A^\\top b$, and $d = b^\\top b$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Constraints**: The constraints are given by $l \\le x \\le u$. These are known as box constraints and are a set of $2n$ linear inequalities: $l_i \\le x_i$ and $x_i \\le u_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. These are linear constraints.\n\n3.  **Classify the Problem**: According to the provided definitions, a problem with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints is a Quadratic Program (QP). Therefore, this problem is a QP.\n\n4.  **Determine Convexity**: For a twice-differentiable function, convexity is determined by its Hessian matrix, $\\nabla^2 f(x)$. First, we find the gradient:\n    $$ \\nabla f(x) = 2 A^\\top A x - 2 A^\\top b = 2A^\\top(Ax-b) $$\n    The Hessian is the Jacobian of the gradient:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 f(x) = 2 A^\\top A $$\n    A function is convex if its Hessian is positive semidefinite (PSD). For any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, we have:\n    $$ v^\\top (2 A^\\top A) v = 2 (Av)^\\top (Av) = 2 \\lVert Av \\rVert_2^2 \\ge 0 $$\n    Since the result is always non-negative, the Hessian $2 A^\\top A$ is always PSD. This means the objective function $f(x)$ is always convex, and the problem is a **convex QP**.\n\n5.  **Determine Strict Convexity**: A function is strictly convex if its Hessian is positive definite (PD), meaning $v^\\top H v > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $v$. From our previous calculation, we need $2 \\lVert Av \\rVert_2^2 > 0$ for all $v \\neq 0$. This is equivalent to requiring that $Av \\neq 0$ for all $v \\neq 0$. This condition means that the null space of $A$ contains only the zero vector, which is the definition of $A$ having linearly independent columns, i.e., having **full column rank**. The condition that the Hessian $2A^\\top A$ is positive definite ($A^\\top A \\succ 0$) is equivalent to $A$ having full column rank. If $A$ does not have full column rank, the function is convex but not strictly so.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n*   **A**: This statement correctly identifies the problem as a convex QP. It also correctly states that the objective is strictly convex if and only if $A$ has full column rank (equivalent to $A^\\top A \\succ 0$), and is otherwise merely convex. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n*   **B**: This is incorrect. The problem is always a convex QP. The condition for strict convexity is full *column* rank, not full *row* rank.\n*   **C**: This is incorrect. The objective is quadratic, so it is not an LP. The objective can be strictly convex.\n*   **D**: This is incorrect. The constraints are linear, not quadratic, so it is not a QCQP. The condition for strict convexity is also incorrect; a nonzero matrix $A$ without full column rank will not yield a strictly convex objective.\n*   **E**: This is incorrect. While it correctly identifies the problem as a convex QP, the condition for strict convexity (\"square and invertible\") is sufficient but not necessary. A tall matrix ($m > n$) can have full column rank.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct and complete statement.",

This is a classic problem in optimization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand the Objective**: The problem is to minimize $\\|A x - b\\|_{\\infty}$. The infinity norm of a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is defined as $\\|v\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{i=1,\\dots,m} |v_i|$. So, the problem is:\n    $$ \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\max_{i=1,\\dots,m} |(Ax - b)_i| $$\n    The objective function is non-linear and non-differentiable.\n\n2.  **Epigraph Reformulation**: We can transform this \"minimax\" problem into a constrained problem by introducing a single auxiliary scalar variable, $t$. Minimizing $\\max(\\dots)$ is equivalent to minimizing an upper bound $t$ on that expression. This gives:\n    $$ \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, t \\in \\mathbb{R}} & t \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} & \\|A x - b\\|_{\\infty} \\le t\n    \\end{array} $$\n\n3.  **Unpack the Constraint**: The constraint $\\|A x - b\\|_{\\infty} \\le t$ means that the maximum absolute value of any component of the residual vector $Ax - b$ must be less than or equal to $t$. This is equivalent to requiring this condition for every component:\n    $$ |(Ax - b)_i| \\le t \\quad \\text{for all } i = 1, \\dots, m $$\n\n4.  **Linearize the Constraint**: An inequality involving an absolute value, $|z| \\le c$ (for non-negative $c$), is equivalent to the pair of linear inequalities $-c \\le z \\le c$. Applying this to our set of constraints, we get:\n    $$ -t \\le (Ax - b)_i \\le t \\quad \\text{for all } i = 1, \\dots, m $$\n    This can be written compactly using vector notation, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of all ones:\n    $$ -t \\mathbf{1} \\le A x - b \\le t \\mathbf{1} $$\n\n5.  **Final Formulation and Classification**: The original problem is equivalent to the following:\n    $$\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, t \\in \\mathbb{R}} & t \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} & Ax - b \\le t \\mathbf{1} \\\\\n    & -(Ax - b) \\le t \\mathbf{1}\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n    The objective function is linear in the optimization variables $(x, t)$. The constraints are also linear inequalities in $x$ and $t$. Therefore, the problem is a **Linear Program (LP)**. Note that the constraint $t \\ge 0$ is often added; it is redundant because $t$ is constrained to be greater than or equal to a norm, which is non-negative, but its inclusion does not change the problem.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n*   **A**: This correctly identifies the problem as an LP and provides the exact formulation derived above.\n*   **B**: This is incorrect. It suggests solving a different problem (least squares, or $\\ell_2$-norm minimization), which gives a different solution. Minimizing the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm is not equivalent to minimizing the $\\ell_2$-norm.\n*   **C**: This is incorrect. The formulation provided, with the constraint $\\|A x - b\\|_{2} \\le t$, is the correct way to reformulate the minimization of the $\\ell_2$-norm, not the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm.\n*   **D**: This is incorrect. This formulation introduces a vector of slack variables, $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, and minimizes their sum, $\\sum t_i$. This is the standard reformulation for minimizing the $\\ell_1$-norm, $\\|Ax-b\\|_1 = \\sum |(Ax-b)_i|$, not the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm.\n*   **E**: This is incorrect.

A key property of a norm is absolute homogeneity: $\\|\\alpha x\\| = |\\alpha| \\|x\\|$. Let $x = [1, 1, 0, \\dots]^T$ and $\\alpha=2$. Then $\\|x\\|_0 = 2$, but $\\|\\alpha x\\|_0 = \\|[2, 2, 0, \\dots]^T\\|_0 = 2$. Since $\\|\\alpha x\\|_0 \\ne |\\alpha| \\|x\\|_0$ (i.e., $2 \\ne 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$), it is not a norm.

Let $x_1=[1,0]^T$ and $x_2=[0,1]^T$. Let $\\alpha = 0.5$. Then $g(x_1)=1$ and $g(x_2)=1$. The right side of the inequality is $0.5(1) + 0.5(1) = 1$.

The Euclidean norm $f(x) = \\|x\\|_2$ is not a linear function. For example, $\\|[1,0]^T + [0,1]^T\\|_2 = \\sqrt{2}$, which is not equal to $\\|[1,0]^T\\|_2 + \\|[0,1]^T\\|_2 = 1+1=2$. Since the objective is non-linear, the problem cannot be an LP, which requires a linear objective. As established in option A, it is an SOCP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ can be encoded as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem... and in general it is combinatorial and nonconvex (NP-hard in the worst case).**\n\n1.  **MILP Formulation**: The non-convex problem $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ can be exactly formulated as an MILP. We introduce a binary variable $z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for each component $x_i$, where $z_i=1$ if $x_i \\ne 0$. The objective becomes $\\min \\sum z_i$. This logic is enforced using \"big-M\" constraints: $-Mz_i \\le x_i \\le Mz_i$, where $M$ is a sufficiently large constant. The resulting problem has a linear objective, linear constraints, and both continuous ($x_i$) and integer ($z_i$) variables, which is the definition of an MILP.\n2.  **Complexity**: The problem of finding the sparsest solution to a system of equations ($Bx=c$) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. It is known to be NP-hard, meaning it is computationally intractable in the worst case. The statement accurately describes the nature of $\\mathcal{P}_0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
