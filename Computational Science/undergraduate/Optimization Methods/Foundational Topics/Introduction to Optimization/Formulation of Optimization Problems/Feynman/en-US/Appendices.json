            "problem": "You are tasked with formulating and solving a linear optimization problem for a simplified diet planning scenario. The goal is to minimize the daily cost while satisfying minimum daily requirements for energy (calories), protein, and vitamins. The formulation must start from core definitions of linear optimization: decision variables representing consumptions, a linear objective to minimize total cost, and linear inequality constraints to enforce minimum nutritional requirements and consumption bounds.\n\nLet the decision variables be $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, representing the number of servings (nonnegative real numbers) of three available foods: Food $1$ (Oats), Food $2$ (Chicken), and Food $3$ (Spinach), respectively. All constraints and data are linear, and all units must be respected.\n\nNutrient and cost data per serving:\n- Food $1$ (Oats): energy $200$ kilocalories per serving, protein $5$ grams per serving, vitamins $1$ unit per serving, cost $\\$0.50$ per serving, upper bound $20$ servings.\n- Food $2$ (Chicken): energy $250$ kilocalories per serving, protein $30$ grams per serving, vitamins $0$ units per serving, cost $\\$2.00$ per serving, upper bound $10$ servings.\n- Food $3$ (Spinach): energy $50$ kilocalories per serving, protein $4$ grams per serving, vitamins $8$ units per serving, cost $\\$0.80$ per serving, upper bound $10$ servings.\n\nDefine the vectors and matrices for linear programming:\n- Decision vector $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]^\\top$.\n- Cost vector $\\mathbf{c} = [0.5, 2.0, 0.8]^\\top$ (dollars per serving).\n- Nutrient contribution matrix\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n200 & 250 & 50 \\\\\n5 & 30 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 8\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwhere row $1$ is energy in kilocalories, row $2$ is protein in grams, and row $3$ is vitamins in units.\n- Lower bounds $0 \\le x_i$ for each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n- Upper bounds $\\mathbf{u} = [20, 10, 10]^\\top$ so that $x_1 \\le 20$, $x_2 \\le 10$, $x_3 \\le 10$.\n\nFor each test case, you are given minimum daily requirements $c_{\\min}$ (calories in kilocalories), $p_{\\min}$ (protein in grams), and $v_{\\min}$ (vitamin units).

The formulation and data are simplifications of reality but are not scientifically unsound or based on pseudoscience. The nutrient values and costs are within a plausible range for the specified foods. The problem is valid on this criterion.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is stated as a linear program, which has a well-defined mathematical structure. It consists of a linear objective function and a set of linear inequality constraints. The feasible region, defined by these constraints and non-negativity, is a convex polytope. The added upper bounds on the decision variables ensure that this feasible region is bounded. A linear function optimized over a non-empty, bounded convex polytope is guaranteed to have a minimum value. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is specified with precise, objective, and quantitative terms. All variables, constants, and relationships are mathematically defined. There is no subjective or ambiguous language. The problem is valid on this criterion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in linear optimization, a topic within computational engineering. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe task is to solve a linear programming (LP) problem for four distinct sets of constraints. A linear program is a problem of optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The standard form of a minimization LP problem, as expected by many numerical solvers, is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad & \\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}, \\\\\n\\quad & \\mathbf{A}_{eq} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}_{eq}, \\\\\n\\text{and} \\quad & \\mathbf{l} \\le \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of decision variables, $\\mathbf{c}$ is the cost vector, $\\mathbf{A}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{eq}$ are constraint matrices, $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{eq}$ are constraint vectors, and $\\mathbf{l}$ and $\\mathbf{u}$ are the lower and upper bounds on $\\mathbf{x}$, respectively.\n\nIn this specific problem, the components are:\n1.  **Decision Variables**: $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]^\\top$.\n2.  **Objective Function**: The objective is to minimize the total cost $Z = 0.5 x_1 + 2.0 x_2 + 0.8 x_3$. This can be written as $\\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x}$, where the cost vector is $\\mathbf{c} = [0.5, 2.0, 0.8]^\\top$.\n3.  **Constraints**: The nutritional requirements are given as \"greater than or equal to\" inequalities:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}_{req}\n    $$\n    where $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 200 & 250 & 50 \\\\ 5 & 30 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 8 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{req} = [c_{\\min}, p_{\\min}, v_{\\min}]^\\top$.\n    To convert these into the standard \"less than or equal to\" form ($\\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}$), we multiply the inequality by $-1$:\n    $$\n    -\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} \\le -\\mathbf{b}_{req}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{ub}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ for the solver are:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} -200 & -250 & -50 \\\\ -5 & -30 & -4 \\\\ -1 & 0 & -8 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{b}_{req} = \\begin{bmatrix} -c_{\\min} \\\\ -p_{\\min} \\\\ -v_{\\min} \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n    There are no equality constraints, so $\\mathbf{A}_{eq}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{eq}$ are empty.\n4.  **Bounds**: The decision variables are bounded. The lower bounds are $l_1=l_2=l_3=0$. The upper bounds are $u_1=20$, $u_2=10$, and $u_3=10$. This can be expressed as a set of bounds for each variable: $0 \\le x_1 \\le 20$, $0 \\le x_2 \\le 10$, and $0 \\le x_3 \\le 10$.\n\nFor each of the four test cases, we construct the vector $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ using the given values of $c_{\\min}$, $p_{\\min}$, and $v_{\\min}$. Then, we employ a numerical LP solver, such as the `'highs'` method available in `scipy.optimize.linprog`, to find the optimal solution vector $\\mathbf{x}^*$. The minimum cost is then calculated as $\\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^*$. This procedure is repeated for all four cases. The final results are rounded to two decimal places as specified.\n\nFor the trivial case, Case $4$, where all minimum requirements are zero, the constraints are $200x_1 + 250x_2 + 50x_3 \\ge 0$, etc. Since all $x_i$ must be non-negative, and all coefficients in the nutrient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are non-negative, these constraints are satisfied by any non-negative $\\mathbf{x}$. To minimize the cost function $0.5x_1 + 2.0x_2 + 0.8x_3$, where all costs are positive, the optimal solution is to set all variables to their lowest possible value, which is $x_1=0$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=0$. The minimal cost is therefore $0$. This serves as a logical check for the methodology.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nA formulation is guaranteed to be infeasible if the set of constraints is contradictory, meaning no set of design variables can satisfy all constraints simultaneously. The central constraint is the heat balance, which requires the total heat rejection capacity, $Q_{\\text{rej}}$, to be at least equal to the heat generated, $P$.\n$$Q_{\\text{rej}} = hA(T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) + \\epsilon\\sigma A(T_{s}^{4}-T_{\\infty}^{4}) \\geq P$$\nwhere $P=100\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nTo determine if a formulation is infeasible, we must calculate the maximum possible heat rejection, $Q_{\\text{rej,max}}$, under its given constraints. If $Q_{\\text{rej,max}} < P$, then the formulation is infeasible. $Q_{\\text{rej,max}}$ is achieved by maximizing all parameters that contribute positively to heat transfer, namely the surface area $A$, the convective coefficient $h$, the surface temperature $T_s$, and the emissivity $\\epsilon$, up to their allowed upper bounds.\n\nFirst, all temperatures must be converted to the absolute Kelvin scale for the radiation calculation.\n$T_{\\infty} = 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe surface temperature constraint is $T_{s} \\leq 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so the maximum surface temperature is $T_{s,\\max} = 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 303.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe maximum temperature difference for convection is $\\Delta T_{\\max} = T_{s,\\max} - T_{\\infty} = 303.15\\,\\mathrm{K} - 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K} = 5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe total heat rejection can be written as $Q_{\\text{rej}} = A \\cdot q''$, where $q''$ is the total heat flux (power per unit area).\n$q'' = h(T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) + \\epsilon\\sigma(T_{s}^{4}-T_{\\infty}^{4})$.\nTo find the maximum possible heat rejection, we first find the maximum possible heat flux, $q''_{\\max}$. This occurs at $T_{s}=T_{s,\\max}$, $\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{\\max}=1$, and $h=h_{\\max}$.\n\nThe radiative component of the maximum heat flux is:\n$$q''_{\\text{rad,max}} = \\epsilon_{\\max}\\sigma(T_{s,\\max}^{4} - T_{\\infty}^{4})$$\n$$q''_{\\text{rad,max}} = (1) (5.670\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-4}) ((303.15\\,\\mathrm{K})^{4} - (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K})^{4})$$\n$$q''_{\\text{rad,max}} \\approx (5.670\\times 10^{-8}) (8.4457\\times 10^{9} - 7.9021\\times 10^{9}) \\approx (5.670\\times 10^{-8})(0.5436\\times 10^{9})$$\n$$q''_{\\text{rad,max}} \\approx 30.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Feasibility with manufacturability and natural convection:**\nThe constraints are $A\\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, $h\\leq 15\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $V \\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nWe must use SI units. $A_{\\max} = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = 20 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\nThe maximum convective heat transfer coefficient is $h_{\\max} = 15\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\nThe maximum convective heat flux is:\n$$q''_{\\text{conv,max}} = h_{\\max}(T_{s,\\max}-T_{\\infty}) = (15\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(5\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 75\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum total heat flux is:\n$$q''_{\\text{total,max}} = q''_{\\text{conv,max}} + q''_{\\text{rad,max}} \\approx 75 + 30.82 = 105.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum possible heat rejection is:\n$$Q_{\\text{rej,max}} = A_{\\max} \\cdot q''_{\\text{total,max}} = (2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (105.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\approx 0.2116\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe required heat rejection is $P=100\\,\\mathrm{W}$. Since $Q_{\\text{rej,max}} \\approx 0.21\\,\\mathrm{W} < 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$, it is impossible to satisfy the heat balance constraint. The geometric constraints $V\\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $A\\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ are physically consistent (a sphere of volume $1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ has a surface area of approximately $4.84\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, which is less than $20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$). The infeasibility arises from the insufficient heat transfer capacity.\nVerdict: The formulation in option A is guaranteed to be infeasible. Therefore, A is a correct answer to the question. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Feasibility without an area bound, natural convection:**\nThis formulation is identical to A, but the manufacturability constraint $A\\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is removed. The only geometric constraint is $V \\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nFor a given volume, the surface area is bounded from below by the isoperimetric inequality but is not bounded from above. One can construct geometries (e.g., featuring many thin fins or a porous structure) with an arbitrarily large surface area for a fixed, finite volume.\nTo satisfy the heat balance $Q_{\\text{rej}} \\geq 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$, we require $A \\cdot q'' \\geq 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nUsing the maximum heat flux calculated for this case, $q''_{\\text{total,max}} \\approx 105.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, the required area is:\n$$A \\geq \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{W}}{105.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}} \\approx 0.945\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 9450\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$$\nIt is physically possible to design a device with $V \\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $A \\geq 9450\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Thus, a feasible solution could exist. The formulation is not guaranteed to be infeasible.\nVerdict: This option describes a potentially feasible problem. It is not a correct answer to the question. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Feasibility with manufacturability and aggressive forced convection:**\nThe constraints are $A\\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, $h\\leq 1000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $V \\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n$A_{\\max} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The maximum convective heat transfer coefficient is $h_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\nThe maximum convective heat flux is:\n$$q''_{\\text{conv,max}} = h_{\\max}(T_{s,\\max}-T_{\\infty}) = (1000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(5\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 5000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum total heat flux is:\n$$q''_{\\text{total,max}} = q''_{\\text{conv,max}} + q''_{\\text{rad,max}} \\approx 5000 + 30.82 = 5030.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe maximum possible heat rejection is:\n$$Q_{\\text{rej,max}} = A_{\\max} \\cdot q''_{\\text{total,max}} = (2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (5030.82\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\approx 10.06\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe required heat rejection is $P=100\\,\\mathrm{W}$. Since $Q_{\\text{rej,max}} \\approx 10.06\\,\\mathrm{W} < 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$, it is impossible to satisfy the heat balance constraint.\nVerdict: The formulation in option C is guaranteed to be infeasible. Therefore, C is a correct answer to the question. **Correct**.\n\n**D. Minimize volume with temperature and power constraints, no area bound:**\nThis is an optimization problem. A problem is infeasible if its feasible region is empty. The constraints defining the feasible region are identical to those in option B: $V\\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, $T_{s}\\leq 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $h\\leq 15\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and heat balance $Q_{rej} \\geq 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$, with no upper bound on area $A$.\nAs established in the analysis of option B, this set of constraints is not guaranteed to be infeasible, because one can find a geometry with $V \\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$ and a sufficiently large surface area $A$ to meet the heat rejection requirement. Since the feasible region is not empty, the optimization problem is not infeasible.\nVerdict: This option describes a potentially feasible problem. It is not a correct answer to the question. **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "A department must assign $3$ seminars to a single lecture hall over a morning planning horizon. Each seminar $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ requires uninterrupted use of the hall for a known duration $p_i$ (in minutes). Each seminar $i$ also has a desired completion time (a due date) $d_i$ (in minutes from the start of the horizon). If seminar $i$ completes at time $C_i$, its tardiness is defined as $T_i = \\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a validation process.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Number of seminars, $N = 3$.\n- Seminar durations: $p_1 = 50$ min, $p_2 = 60$ min, $p_3 = 40$ min.\n- Seminar due dates: $d_1 = 70$ min, $d_2 = 120$ min, $d_3 = 100$ min.\n- Planning starts at time $t=0$.\n- Seminars are non-preemptive.\n- Only one seminar can be scheduled at a time.\n- Tardiness for seminar $i$: $T_i = \\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$, where $C_i$ is the completion time.\n- Objective: Minimize total tardiness, $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} T_i$.\n- Task: Formulate a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) and determine the minimum achievable total tardiness.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a classic single-machine scheduling problem, denoted as $1||\\sum T_i$ in standard three-field notation. This is a well-established problem in operations research.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on the principles of integer programming and scheduling theory. It is a standard, scientifically sound problem.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data ($p_i, d_i$) are provided. The objective function and constraints are clearly defined.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely specified, and its solution is verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, the formulation of the Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), and second, the determination of the optimal schedule and minimum total tardiness for the given data.\n\n**Part 1: MILP Formulation**\n\nLet $I = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ be the set of seminars.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n- $S_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the start time of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $C_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the completion time of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $T_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the tardiness of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $x_{ij}$: a binary variable for each pair $(i, j) \\in I \\times I$ with $i < j$. $x_{ij}=1$ if seminar $i$ finishes before seminar $j$ begins, and $x_{ij}=0$ if seminar $j$ finishes before seminar $i$ begins.\n\n**Objective Function:**\nThe objective is to minimize the sum of the tardiness values for all seminars.\n$$ \\min \\sum_{i \\in I} T_i $$\n\n**Constraints:**\n1.  **Completion Time:** The completion time of a seminar is its start time plus its duration. No preemption is allowed.\n    $$ C_i = S_i + p_i \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n\n2.  **Tardiness Definition:** The tardiness $T_i$ is defined as $\\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$. In a minimization problem, this non-linear function can be linearized by the following two inequalities. The objective function will drive $T_i$ to its smallest possible value, which is exactly $\\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$.\n    $$ T_i \\ge C_i - d_i \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n    $$ T_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n\n3.  **Disjunctive (Non-Overlap) Constraints:** For any two distinct seminars $i$ and $j$, one must be completed before the other begins. This is expressed as a disjunction: $(C_i \\le S_j) \\lor (C_j \\le S_i)$. Using the binary variables $x_{ij}$ and the big-$M$ method, this is formulated as a pair of linear inequalities for each pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$.\n    $$ C_i \\le S_j + M(1-x_{ij}) \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in I \\times I, i < j $$\n    $$ C_j \\le S_i + M x_{ij} \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in I \\times I, i < j $$\n    Here, $M$ is a sufficiently large positive constant. A valid choice for $M$ is a value larger than any possible difference between a completion time and a start time. The total duration of all seminars provides a safe upper bound on any single completion time. Let $H = \\sum_{k \\in I} p_k = 50 + 60 + 40 = 150$. A valid choice is $M = H = 150$.\n\n4.  **Variable Domains:**\n    $$ S_i \\ge 0, C_i \\ge 0, T_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n    $$ x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in I \\times I, i < j $$\n\n**Part 2: Determining the Minimum Total Tardiness**\nFor a small number of seminars ($N=3$), the problem can be solved by enumerating all possible sequences. There are $3! = 6$ possible permutations. Since the objective is to minimize tardiness, there is no advantage to inserting idle time between seminars. Therefore, all seminars in a sequence are scheduled back-to-back, starting at time $t=0$.\n\nThe data is: $p_1 = 50, d_1 = 70$; $p_2 = 60, d_2 = 120$; $p_3 = 40, d_3 = 100$.\n\nThe six possible sequences are evaluated:\n\n1.  **Sequence (1, 2, 3):**\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 0$, $C_1 = 0 + 50 = 50$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 50 - 70\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 50$, $C_2 = 50 + 60 = 110$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 110 - 120\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 110$, $C_3 = 110 + 40 = 150$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 100\\} = 50$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 0 + 50 = 50$.\n\n2.  **Sequence (1, 3, 2):**\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 0$, $C_1 = 0 + 50 = 50$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 50 - 70\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 50$, $C_3 = 50 + 40 = 90$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 90 - 100\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 90$, $C_2 = 90 + 60 = 150$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 120\\} = 30$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 0 + 30 = 30$.\n\n3.  **Sequence (2, 1, 3):**\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 0$, $C_2 = 0 + 60 = 60$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 60 - 120\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 60$, $C_1 = 60 + 50 = 110$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 110 - 70\\} = 40$.\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 110$, $C_3 = 110 + 40 = 150$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 100\\} = 50$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 40 + 50 = 90$.\n\n4.  **Sequence (2, 3, 1):**\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 0$, $C_2 = 0 + 60 = 60$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 60 - 120\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 60$, $C_3 = 60 + 40 = 100$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 100 - 100\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 100$, $C_1 = 100 + 50 = 150$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 70\\} = 80$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 0 + 80 = 80$.\n\n5.  **Sequence (3, 1, 2):**\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 0$, $C_3 = 0 + 40 = 40$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 40 - 100\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 40$, $C_1 = 40 + 50 = 90$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 90 - 70\\} = 20$.\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 90$, $C_2 = 90 + 60 = 150$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 120\\} = 30$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 20 + 30 = 50$.\n\n6.  **Sequence (3, 2, 1):**\n    - Seminar 3: $S_3 = 0$, $C_3 = 0 + 40 = 40$. $T_3 = \\max\\{0, 40 - 100\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 2: $S_2 = 40$, $C_2 = 40 + 60 = 100$. $T_2 = \\max\\{0, 100 - 120\\} = 0$.\n    - Seminar 1: $S_1 = 100$, $C_1 = 100 + 50 = 150$. $T_1 = \\max\\{0, 150 - 70\\} = 80$.\n    - Total Tardiness $\\sum T_i = 0 + 0 + 80 = 80$.\n\nBy comparing the total tardiness for all possible sequences:\n- Sequence (1, 2, 3): Total Tardiness = $50$\n- Sequence (1, 3, 2): Total Tardiness = $30$\n- Sequence (2, 1, 3): Total Tardiness = $90$\n- Sequence (2, 3, 1): Total Tardiness = $80$\n- Sequence (3, 1, 2): Total Tardiness = $50$\n- Sequence (3, 2, 1): Total Tardiness = $80$\n\nThe minimum value is $30$, which is achieved with the sequence (1, 3, 2).",
