            "problem": "You are tasked with formulating and solving a linear optimization problem for a simplified diet planning scenario. The goal is to minimize the daily cost while satisfying minimum daily requirements for energy (calories), protein, and vitamins. The formulation must start from core definitions of linear optimization: decision variables representing consumptions, a linear objective to minimize total cost, and linear inequality constraints to enforce minimum nutritional requirements and consumption bounds.\n\nLet the decision variables be $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, representing the number of servings (nonnegative real numbers) of three available foods: Food $1$ (Oats), Food $2$ (Chicken), and Food $3$ (Spinach), respectively. All constraints and data are linear, and all units must be respected.\n\nNutrient and cost data per serving:\n- Food $1$ (Oats): energy $200$ kilocalories per serving, protein $5$ grams per serving, vitamins $1$ unit per serving, cost $\\$0.50$ per serving, upper bound $20$ servings.\n- Food $2$ (Chicken): energy $250$ kilocalories per serving, protein $30$ grams per serving, vitamins $0$ units per serving, cost $\\$2.00$ per serving, upper bound $10$ servings.\n- Food $3$ (Spinach): energy $50$ kilocalories per serving, protein $4$ grams per serving, vitamins $8$ units per serving, cost $\\$0.80$ per serving, upper bound $10$ servings.\n\nDefine the vectors and matrices for linear programming:\n- Decision vector $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]^\\top$.\n- Cost vector $\\mathbf{c} = [0.5, 2.0, 0.8]^\\top$ (dollars per serving).\n- Nutrient contribution matrix\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n200 & 250 & 50 \\\\\n5 & 30 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 8\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwhere row $1$ is energy in kilocalories, row $2$ is protein in grams, and row $3$ is vitamins in units.\n- Lower bounds $0 \\le x_i$ for each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n- Upper bounds $\\mathbf{u} = [20, 10, 10]^\\top$ so that $x_1 \\le 20$, $x_2 \\le 10$, $x_3 \\le 10$.\n\nFor each test case, you are given minimum daily requirements $c_{\\min}$ (calories in kilocalories), $p_{\\min}$ (protein in grams), and $v_{\\min}$ (vitamin units).

The formulation and data are simplifications of reality but are not scientifically unsound or based on pseudoscience. The nutrient values and costs are within a plausible range for the specified foods. The problem is valid on this criterion.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is stated as a linear program, which has a well-defined mathematical structure. It consists of a linear objective function and a set of linear inequality constraints. The feasible region, defined by these constraints and non-negativity, is a convex polytope. The added upper bounds on the decision variables ensure that this feasible region is bounded. A linear function optimized over a non-empty, bounded convex polytope is guaranteed to have a minimum value. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is specified with precise, objective, and quantitative terms. All variables, constants, and relationships are mathematically defined. There is no subjective or ambiguous language. The problem is valid on this criterion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in linear optimization, a topic within computational engineering. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe task is to solve a linear programming (LP) problem for four distinct sets of constraints. A linear program is a problem of optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The standard form of a minimization LP problem, as expected by many numerical solvers, is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad & \\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}, \\\\\n\\quad & \\mathbf{A}_{eq} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}_{eq}, \\\\\n\\text{and} \\quad & \\mathbf{l} \\le \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of decision variables, $\\mathbf{c}$ is the cost vector, $\\mathbf{A}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{eq}$ are constraint matrices, $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{eq}$ are constraint vectors, and $\\mathbf{l}$ and $\\mathbf{u}$ are the lower and upper bounds on $\\mathbf{x}$, respectively.\n\nIn this specific problem, the components are:\n1.  **Decision Variables**: $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]^\\top$.\n2.  **Objective Function**: The objective is to minimize the total cost $Z = 0.5 x_1 + 2.0 x_2 + 0.8 x_3$. This can be written as $\\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x}$, where the cost vector is $\\mathbf{c} = [0.5, 2.0, 0.8]^\\top$.\n3.  **Constraints**: The nutritional requirements are given as \"greater than or equal to\" inequalities:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}_{req}\n    $$\n    where $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 200 & 250 & 50 \\\\ 5 & 30 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 8 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{req} = [c_{\\min}, p_{\\min}, v_{\\min}]^\\top$.\n    To convert these into the standard \"less than or equal to\" form ($\\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}$), we multiply the inequality by $-1$:\n    $$\n    -\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} \\le -\\mathbf{b}_{req}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{ub}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ for the solver are:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} -200 & -250 & -50 \\\\ -5 & -30 & -4 \\\\ -1 & 0 & -8 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{b}_{req} = \\begin{bmatrix} -c_{\\min} \\\\ -p_{\\min} \\\\ -v_{\\min} \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n    There are no equality constraints, so $\\mathbf{A}_{eq}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{eq}$ are empty.\n4.  **Bounds**: The decision variables are bounded. The lower bounds are $l_1=l_2=l_3=0$. The upper bounds are $u_1=20$, $u_2=10$, and $u_3=10$. This can be expressed as a set of bounds for each variable: $0 \\le x_1 \\le 20$, $0 \\le x_2 \\le 10$, and $0 \\le x_3 \\le 10$.\n\nFor each of the four test cases, we construct the vector $\\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ using the given values of $c_{\\min}$, $p_{\\min}$, and $v_{\\min}$. Then, we employ a numerical LP solver, such as the `'highs'` method available in `scipy.optimize.linprog`, to find the optimal solution vector $\\mathbf{x}^*$. The minimum cost is then calculated as $\\mathbf{c}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^*$. This procedure is repeated for all four cases. The final results are rounded to two decimal places as specified.\n\nFor the trivial case, Case $4$, where all minimum requirements are zero, the constraints are $200x_1 + 250x_2 + 50x_3 \\ge 0$, etc. Since all $x_i$ must be non-negative, and all coefficients in the nutrient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are non-negative, these constraints are satisfied by any non-negative $\\mathbf{x}$. To minimize the cost function $0.5x_1 + 2.0x_2 + 0.8x_3$, where all costs are positive, the optimal solution is to set all variables to their lowest possible value, which is $x_1=0$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=0$. The minimal cost is therefore $0$. This serves as a logical check for the methodology.",

            "problem": "A department must assign $3$ seminars to a single lecture hall over a morning planning horizon. Each seminar $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ requires uninterrupted use of the hall for a known duration $p_i$ (in minutes). Each seminar $i$ also has a desired completion time (a due date) $d_i$ (in minutes from the start of the horizon).

A solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, the formulation of the Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), and second, the determination of the optimal schedule and minimum total tardiness for the given data.\n\n**Part 1: MILP Formulation**\n\nLet $I = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ be the set of seminars.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n- $S_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the start time of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $C_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the completion time of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $T_i$: a continuous, non-negative variable representing the tardiness of seminar $i \\in I$.\n- $x_{ij}$: a binary variable for each pair $(i, j) \\in I \\times I$ with $i < j$. $x_{ij}=1$ if seminar $i$ finishes before seminar $j$ begins, and $x_{ij}=0$ if seminar $j$ finishes before seminar $i$ begins.\n\n**Objective Function:**\nThe objective is to minimize the sum of the tardiness values for all seminars.\n$$ \\min \\sum_{i \\in I} T_i $$\n\n**Constraints:**\n1.  **Completion Time:** The completion time of a seminar is its start time plus its duration. No preemption is allowed.\n    $$ C_i = S_i + p_i \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n\n2.  **Tardiness Definition:** The tardiness $T_i$ is defined as $\\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$. In a minimization problem, this non-linear function can be linearized by the following two inequalities. The objective function will drive $T_i$ to its smallest possible value, which is exactly $\\max\\{0, C_i - d_i\\}$.\n    $$ T_i \\ge C_i - d_i \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n    $$ T_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in I $$\n\n3.  **Disjunctive (Non-Overlap) Constraints:** For any two distinct seminars $i$ and $j$, one must be completed before the other begins. This is expressed as a disjunction: $(C_i \\le S_j) \\lor (C_j \\le S_i)$. Using the binary variables $x_{ij}$ and the big-$M$ method, this is formulated as a pair of linear inequalities for each pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$.\n    $$ C_i \\le S_j + M(1-x_{ij}) \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in I \\times I, i < j $$\n    $$ C_j \\le S_i + M x_{ij} \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in I \\times I, i < j $$\n    Here, $M$ is a sufficiently large positive constant. A valid choice for $M$ is a value larger than any possible difference between a completion time and a start time. The total duration of all seminars provides a safe upper bound on any single completion time. Let $H = \\sum_{k \\in I} p_k = 50 + 60 + 40 = 150$.

The cost functions use established mathematical functions ($\\max$, ceiling function). The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines a clear objective (minimization of cost) subject to well-defined constraints (choice of one carrier, given cost functions). A unique minimum cost exists. The task is to find a correct formulation, which is a standard problem in optimization.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem statement is self-contained, consistent, and logically sound. It does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Formulation**\nThe goal is to formulate a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to select one of three options, where the cost associated with each option is a discontinuous function involving the ceiling operator.\n\nLet $y_A, y_B, y_C$ be binary variables such that $y_i=1$ if Carrier $i$ is chosen, and $y_i=0$ otherwise. Since exactly one carrier must be chosen, we have the constraint:\n$$y_A + y_B + y_C = 1, \\quad y_A, y_B, y_C \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of costs from each carrier, weighted by the binary selection variables. A naive objective function would be $y_A C_A(w_0) + y_B C_B(w_0) + y_C C_C(w_0)$. This is non-linear due to the product of variables and the non-linear cost functions. We must linearize this.\n\nThe total cost can be expressed as a sum of the base fees and the variable, weight-dependent portions. The objective function is:\n$$\\min \\left( 10y_A + 7y_B + 14y_C \\right) + \\text{Variable Costs}$$\n\nThe variable costs depend on the ceiling function, $\\lceil x \\rceil$. The value $z = \\lceil x \\rceil$ can be modeled in a minimization context by introducing an integer variable $z$ and the constraint $z \\ge x$. Since the objective function will push $z$ downwards, it will take the smallest integer value satisfying the constraint, which is precisely $\\lceil x \\rceil$.\n\nLet us define integer variables $z_A, z_B, z_C \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$ to represent the discontinuous portions of the costs.\n- **For Carrier A**: The variable cost is $5 \\max\\{0, \\lceil w_0 - 1 \\rceil\\}$. We introduce an integer variable $z_A \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$. For minimization, the expression $\\max\\{0, \\lceil w_0-1 \\rceil\\}$ is correctly modeled by the constraints $z_A \\ge w_0 - 1$ and $z_A \\ge 0$. As $z_A$ is defined as a non-negative integer ($\\mathbb{Z}_+$), the second constraint is implicit. Thus, we need $z_A \\ge w_0 - 1$.\n- **For Carrier B**: The variable cost is $6 \\lceil w_0 \\rceil$. We introduce an integer variable $z_B \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$ and the constraint $z_B \\ge w_0$.\n- **For Carrier C**: The variable cost is $4 \\max\\{0, \\lceil w_0 - 2 \\rceil\\}$. We introduce an integer variable $z_C \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$ and the constraint $z_C \\ge w_0 - 2$.\n\nThe key is that these costs should only apply if the respective carrier is chosen. If $y_i = 0$, the corresponding variable cost must be zero. This requires linking the integer variables $z_i$ to the binary variables $y_i$.\n\nLet's define new variables to represent the cost contributions. The objective function becomes:\n$$\\min 10y_A + 5z_A^* + 7y_B + 6z_B^* + 14y_C + 4z_C^*$$\nwhere $z_i^*$ is the effective integer multiplier for carrier $i$. If $y_i=1$, then $z_i^*$ must be equal to our previously defined $z_i$; if $y_i=0$, then $z_i^*$ must be $0$. This is equivalent to modeling $z_i^* = z_i y_i$. This product can be linearized using the Big-M method.\n\nLet's directly model the conditions on $z_A, z_B, z_C$:\n1. If $y_i = 0$, then $z_i = 0$.\n2. If $y_i = 1$, then $z_i$ must satisfy its lower bound constraint ($z_A \\ge w_0-1$, etc.).\n\nThese two conditions can be combined using Big-M constraints.\n- To enforce $z_i=0$ when $y_i=0$, we add the constraint $z_i \\le M y_i$, where $M$ is a sufficiently large constant. If $y_i=0$, this forces $z_i \\le 0$, and since $z_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$, we must have $z_i=0$. If $y_i=1$, we get $z_i \\le M$, which serves as an upper bound.\n- To enforce the lower bound only when $y_i=1$, we write $z_i \\ge (\\text{expression}) - M(1 - y_i)$. If $y_i=1$, this becomes $z_i \\ge (\\text{expression})$. If $y_i=0$, this becomes $z_i \\ge (\\text{expression}) - M$, which must be a non-binding constraint (i.e., less than or equal to $0$ as $z_i$ will be $0$).\n\nLet's apply this to our problem with $w_0 = 2.35$.\nA valid upper bound $M$ on the values of $z_i$ is required.\n$z_A^{\\text{actual}} = \\max\\{0, \\lceil 2.35-1 \\rceil\\} = \\lceil 1.35 \\rceil = 2$.\n$z_B^{\\text{actual}} = \\lceil 2.35 \\rceil = 3$.\n$z_C^{\\text{actual}} = \\max\\{0, \\lceil 2.35-2 \\rceil\\} = \\lceil 0.35 \\rceil = 1$.\nThe maximum of these values is $3$. So, $M = \\lceil w_0 \\rceil = 3$ is a valid (and tight) upper bound.\n\nThe constraints for each carrier are:\n- **Carrier A**:\n  $z_A \\ge w_0 - 1 - M(1-y_A)$\n  $z_A \\le M y_A$\n- **Carrier B**:\n  $z_B \\ge w_0 - M(1-y_B)$\n  $z_B \\le M y_B$\n- **Carrier C**:\n  $z_C \\ge w_0 - 2 - M(1-y_C)$\n  $z_C \\le M y_C$\n\nCombining everything, the full MILP formulation is:\n$$\n\\min\\; 10\\,y_A + 5\\,z_A \\;+\\; 7\\,y_B + 6\\,z_B \\;+\\; 14\\,y_C + 4\\,z_C\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\ny_A + y_B + y_C = 1,\n$$\n$$\nz_A \\ge w_0 - 1 - M(1 - y_A),\\quad 0 \\le z_A \\le M y_A,\n$$\n$$\nz_B \\ge w_0 - M(1 - y_B),\\quad 0 \\le z_B \\le M y_B,\n$$\n$$\nz_C \\ge w_0 - 2 - M(1 - y_C),\\quad 0 \\le z_C \\le M y_C,\n$$\n$$\ny_A,y_B,y_C \\in \\{0,1\\},\\quad z_A,z_B,z_C \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+.\n$$\nHere, $w_0=2.35$ and a valid $M$ is $3$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** The formulation given matches our derived formulation precisely. It correctly uses binary variables for selection, integer variables for the ceiling function values, and the Big-M method to create indicator constraints that activate/deactivate costs based on the selection. The lower bound for $z_B$ is written as $w_0-0$, which is trivially $w_0$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.** In this formulation, the integer variables $z_A, z_B, z_C$ are not linked to the binary selection variables $y_A, y_B, y_C$. The constraints on $z_i$ are always active, regardless of which carrier is chosen. The optimization will find the minimal integer values $z_A=2, z_B=3, z_C=1$ and add their associated costs ($5z_A+6z_B+4z_C$) to the total objective function, in addition to the base fee of the selected carrier. This is incorrect, as the costs of unchosen carriers should not be included.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This formulation is fundamentally flawed for multiple reasons. First, it assumes a single variable cost multiplier of $5$, which only corresponds to Carrier A. The multipliers for B and C are $6$ and $4$, respectively. Second, a single integer variable $z$ cannot simultaneously represent the three different quantities $(\\max\\{0, \\lceil w_0-1 \\rceil\\}, \\lceil w_0 \\rceil, \\max\\{0, \\lceil w_0-2 \\rceil\\})$. Third, the constraints of the form $z \\ge w_0 - k \\cdot y_i$ are nonsensical and do not correctly model indicator constraints. For example, if $y_B=1$, the constraints become $z \\ge w_0$, $z \\ge w_0$, $z \\ge w_0$, forcing $z=3$. The cost would be $7+5(3)=22$, while the correct cost is $7+6(3)=25$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This formulation uses non-linear terms in the objective function ($y_A z_A$, etc.). The problem explicitly asks for a mixed-integer *linear* programming (MILP) formulation. An objective function with products of variables is non-linear (specifically, quadratic). Therefore, this is not an MILP formulation. Furthermore, it defines $z_A, z_B, z_C$ as continuous variables, which cannot model the ceiling function. The minimization over a continuous $z_i \\ge x$ would yield $z_i=x$, not $z_i=\\lceil x \\rceil$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
