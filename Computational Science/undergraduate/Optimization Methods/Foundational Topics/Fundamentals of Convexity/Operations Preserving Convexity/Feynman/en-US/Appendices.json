It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine the truth value of the provided statements. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, let us state the definitions of convexity and strong convexity, as per the problem's instructions.\n\nA function $F: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined on a convex domain $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^k$ is said to be **convex** if for all $x, y \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and for all $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$, the following inequality holds:\n$$F(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta F(x) + (1-\\theta)F(y)$$\nA function $F: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is **$\\sigma$-strongly convex** for some $\\sigma > 0$ if for all $x, y \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and for all $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$, the following inequality holds:\n$$F(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta F(x) + (1-\\theta)F(y) - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|x-y\\|_2^2$$\nAn equivalent and often more useful definition for $\\sigma$-strong convexity is that the function $x \\mapsto F(x) - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$ is convex.\n\nWe are given the composite function $f:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = g(Ax) + h(x)$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, $g:\\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and $h:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We will now analyze each statement.\n\n### A. If $g$ is convex and $h$ is convex, then $f$ is convex for any choice of the matrix $A$.\n\nLet's analyze the two terms of $f(x)$ separately.\n1.  The term $h(x)$ is given to be convex.\n2.  Consider the term $\\phi(x) = g(Ax)$. The function $x \\mapsto Ax$ is a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$. For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$, we have:\n    $$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) = g(A(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y))$$\n    By the linearity of the matrix-vector product, this becomes:\n    $$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) = g(\\theta(Ax) + (1-\\theta)(Ay))$$\n    Since $g$ is convex, and $Ax, Ay \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, we can apply the definition of convexity to $g$:\n    $$g(\\theta(Ax) + (1-\\theta)(Ay)) \\le \\theta g(Ax) + (1-\\theta)g(Ay)$$\n    Substituting back $\\phi(x)$ and $\\phi(y)$, we get:\n    $$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta \\phi(x) + (1-\\theta)\\phi(y)$$\n    This shows that $\\phi(x) = g(Ax)$ is a convex function. This property holds for any matrix $A$.\n3.  The function $f(x)$ is the sum of two convex functions, $\\phi(x) = g(Ax)$ and $h(x)$. The sum of convex functions is convex. To demonstrate this from first principles:\n    $$f(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) = g(A(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y)) + h(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y)$$\n    Since both terms are convex:\n    $$f(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le [\\theta g(Ax) + (1-\\theta)g(Ay)] + [\\theta h(x) + (1-\\theta)h(y)]$$\n    $$f(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta(g(Ax) + h(x)) + (1-\\theta)(g(Ay) + h(y))$$\n    $$f(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta f(x) + (1-\\theta)f(y)$$\n    Therefore, $f(x)$ is convex.\n\nTherefore, statement (A) is **Correct**.\n\n### B. If $g$ is convex and $h$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex for some $\\mu>0$, then $f$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex for any choice of the matrix $A$.\n\nTo check if $f(x)$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex, we examine the convexity of the function $F(x) = f(x) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$.\n$$F(x) = (g(Ax) + h(x)) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$$\nWe can rearrange the terms as:\n$$F(x) = g(Ax) + \\left(h(x) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2\\right)$$\n1.  From the analysis of statement A, since $g$ is convex, the function $x \\mapsto g(Ax)$ is also convex for any matrix $A$.\n2.  By the definition of $\\mu$-strong convexity for $h$, the function $x \\mapsto h(x) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$ is convex.\n3.  $F(x)$ is the sum of two convex functions. As shown in the analysis for A, the sum of two convex functions is convex.\nSince $F(x) = f(x) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$ is convex, $f(x)$ is, by definition, $\\mu$-strongly convex. This result does not depend on the choice of $A$.\n\nTherefore, statement (B) is **Correct**.\n\n### C. If $g$ is $m$-strongly convex for some $m>0$ and $A$ has full column rank, and $h$ is convex, then $f$ is $m\\,\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)$-strongly convex, where $\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)$ denotes the smallest eigenvalue of $A^\\top A$.\n\nLet's analyze the strong convexity of $\\phi(x) = g(Ax)$. Since $g$ is $m$-strongly convex, for any $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\\theta \\in [0,1]$:\n$$g(\\theta u + (1-\\theta)v) \\le \\theta g(u) + (1-\\theta)g(v) - \\frac{m}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|u-v\\|_2^2$$\nLet $u=Ax$ and $v=Ay$. Then:\n$$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) = g(\\theta Ax + (1-\\theta)Ay) \\le \\theta g(Ax) + (1-\\theta)g(Ay) - \\frac{m}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|Ax-Ay\\|_2^2$$\n$$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta \\phi(x) + (1-\\theta)\\phi(y) - \\frac{m}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|A(x-y)\\|_2^2$$\nWe can write the squared norm as a quadratic form: $\\|A(x-y)\\|_2^2 = (x-y)^\\top A^\\top A (x-y)$. The matrix $A^\\top A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is always positive semidefinite. The statement specifies that $A$ has full column rank, which means $\\text{rank}(A) = n$. This implies that $A^\\top A$ is positive definite, and all its eigenvalues are strictly positive. The smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)$, is therefore greater than $0$.\nFor any vector $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the Rayleigh-Ritz quotient gives the bound $z^\\top(A^\\top A)z \\ge \\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)\\|z\\|_2^2$. Applying this with $z=x-y$:\n$$\\|A(x-y)\\|_2^2 \\ge \\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)\\|x-y\\|_2^2$$\nSubstituting this into the inequality for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta \\phi(x) + (1-\\theta)\\phi(y) - \\frac{m\\,\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|x-y\\|_2^2$$\nThis is the definition of strong convexity for $\\phi(x)$ with modulus $\\sigma_\\phi = m\\,\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)$.\nNow, $f(x) = \\phi(x) + h(x)$, where $\\phi(x)$ is $\\sigma_\\phi$-strongly convex and $h(x)$ is convex. Let's check if $f(x)$ is $\\sigma_\\phi$-strongly convex. Consider the function $f(x) - \\frac{\\sigma_\\phi}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$:\n$$f(x) - \\frac{\\sigma_\\phi}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2 = \\left(\\phi(x) - \\frac{\\sigma_\\phi}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2\\right) + h(x)$$\nThe first term, $\\phi(x) - \\frac{\\sigma_\\phi}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$, is convex by the definition of $\\sigma_\\phi$-strong convexity of $\\phi$. The second term, $h(x)$, is given as convex. The sum of these two convex functions is convex. Thus, $f(x)$ is $\\sigma_\\phi = m\\,\\lambda_{\\min}(A^\\top A)$-strongly convex.\n\nTherefore, statement (C) is **Correct**.\n\n### D. Choosing $h(x)=\\lambda\\|x\\|_1$ with $\\lambda>0$ always makes $f$ strongly convex, even if $g$ is only convex.\n\nLet $f(x) = g(Ax) + \\lambda\\|x\\|_1$.\nWe are given that $g$ is convex. From the analysis for statement A, $g(Ax)$ is a convex function. The function $h(x) = \\lambda\\|x\\|_1$ is also convex for $\\lambda > 0$, as it is a positive scaling of the L$1$-norm. Thus, $f(x)$ is always convex. The question is whether it is always *strongly* convex.\nFor $f$ to be strongly convex, the function $f(x) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$ must be convex for some $\\mu>0$.\nLet's choose a simple counterexample. Let $g$ be the zero function, $g(z)=0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. The zero function is convex. In this case, $f(x) = \\lambda\\|x\\|_1$. Is $h(x) = \\lambda\\|x\\|_1$ strongly convex?\nLet's check the definition. Let $n=1$, so $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. $h(x) = \\lambda|x|$.\nLet $x=c$ and $y=-c$ for some $c>0$. Let $\\theta=1/2$. The midpoint is $z=\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y = 0$.\nThe strong convexity condition is $h(z) \\le \\theta h(x) + (1-\\theta) h(y) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\theta(1-\\theta)\\|x-y\\|_2^2$.\n$h(0) \\le \\frac{1}{2}h(c) + \\frac{1}{2}h(-c) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2}\\|c - (-c)\\|_2^2$\n$0 \\le \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda c) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda c) - \\frac{\\mu}{8}(2c)^2$\n$0 \\le \\lambda c - \\frac{\\mu}{8}(4c^2)$\n$0 \\le \\lambda c - \\frac{\\mu}{2}c^2$\n$\\frac{\\mu}{2}c^2 \\le \\lambda c$\nSince $c>0$, we can divide by it: $c \\le \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\mu}$.\nThis inequality must hold for all $c>0$ for the function to be strongly convex. However, we can clearly choose a value of $c$ that violates this, for example $c = 1 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\mu}$. Thus, $\\lambda\\|x\\|_1$ is not a strongly convex function. Since we found a valid choice of convex $g$ for which $f$ is not strongly convex, the statement that this choice of $h$ *always* makes $f$ strongly convex is false.\n\nTherefore, statement (D) is **Incorrect**.\n\n### E. If $A$ does not have full column rank, then no choice of convex $h$ can make $f$ strongly convex.\n\nThis statement claims that if $A$ does not have full column rank, then for *any* convex function $h$, the resulting function $f(x) = g(Ax) + h(x)$ cannot be strongly convex.\nTo disprove this, we need to find a counterexample: a matrix $A$ without full column rank and a convex function $h$ such that $f$ is strongly convex.\nLet's refer back to statement B: \"If $g$ is convex and $h$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex for some $\\mu>0$, then $f$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex for any choice of the matrix $A$.\"\nA strongly convex function is also a convex function. So, we can choose $h$ to be a $\\mu$-strongly convex function. According to statement B, which we have proven to be correct, this choice of $h$ will make $f$ be $\\mu$-strongly convex, regardless of the properties of $A$. This holds even if $A$ does not have full column rank.\nLet's provide a concrete counterexample.\nLet $n=2$, $m=1$. Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix does not have full column rank since its rank is $1$ while it has $2$ columns. Its null space is spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be $g(z)=0$, which is convex.\nLet $h: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be $h(x) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ for some $\\mu>0$. The function $h$ is convex (it is even $\\mu$-strongly convex).\nThen $f(x) = g(Ax) + h(x) = 0 + \\frac{\\mu}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|x\\|_2^2$.\nThe function $f(x)$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex by definition.\nWe have found a matrix $A$ without full column rank and a convex function $h$ such that $f$ is strongly convex. This contradicts the statement.\n\nTherefore, statement (E) is **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal summary: Statements A, B, and C are correct, while D and E are incorrect.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid, self-contained, and mathematically well-posed. It is grounded in the fundamental principles of convex geometry and linear algebra. We shall proceed to solve the three tasks in the specified order.\n\nThe feasible region is the set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by six linear inequalities:\n$$ S = \\left\\{(x_{1},x_{2},y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\;:\\; y \\ge 0,\\; y \\le 1,\\; x_{1}+y \\le 1,\\; -x_{1}+y \\le 1,\\; x_{2}+y \\le 1,\\; -x_{2}+y \\le 1 \\right\\} $$\nThese inequalities can be compactly written as $y \\in [0, 1]$, $|x_1| \\le 1-y$, and $|x_2| \\le 1-y$. For a point to exist for a given $y$, we must have $1-y \\ge 0$, which implies $y \\le 1$. This is consistent with the explicit constraint $y \\le 1$. The set $S$ is a polyhedron, being the intersection of six closed half-spaces.\n\n**Task 1: Show that $P(S)$ is convex**\n\nThe proof consists of two parts as required by the use of fundamental definitions. First, we must show that the set $S$ itself is convex. Second, we leverage the linearity of the projection map $P$ to demonstrate the convexity of its image, $P(S)$.\n\nTo prove that $S$ is a convex set, let $s_a = (x_{1a}, x_{2a}, y_a)$ and $s_b = (x_{1b}, x_{2b}, y_b)$ be any two points in $S$. For any scalar $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, we form the convex combination $s_c = \\lambda s_a + (1-\\lambda)s_b$. The coordinates of $s_c$ are:\n$$ s_c = (\\lambda x_{1a} + (1-\\lambda)x_{1b}, \\; \\lambda x_{2a} + (1-\\lambda)x_{2b}, \\; \\lambda y_a + (1-\\lambda)y_b) $$\nLet the coordinates of $s_c$ be denoted by $(x_{1c}, x_{2c}, y_c)$. We must verify that $s_c$ satisfies all six inequalities that define $S$.\nSince $s_a, s_b \\in S$, we know they satisfy the inequalities. For the coordinate $y_c$:\n$y_a \\ge 0$ and $y_b \\ge 0 \\implies y_c = \\lambda y_a + (1-\\lambda)y_b \\ge \\lambda(0) + (1-\\lambda)(0) = 0$.\n$y_a \\le 1$ and $y_b \\le 1 \\implies y_c = \\lambda y_a + (1-\\lambda)y_b \\le \\lambda(1) + (1-\\lambda)(1) = 1$.\nFor the other coordinates:\n$x_{1a} + y_a \\le 1$ and $x_{1b} + y_b \\le 1 \\implies x_{1c} + y_c = \\lambda(x_{1a}+y_a) + (1-\\lambda)(x_{1b}+y_b) \\le \\lambda(1) + (1-\\lambda)(1) = 1$.\n$-x_{1a} + y_a \\le 1$ and $-x_{1b} + y_b \\le 1 \\implies -x_{1c} + y_c = \\lambda(-x_{1a}+y_a) + (1-\\lambda)(-x_{1b}+y_b) \\le \\lambda(1) + (1-\\lambda)(1) = 1$.\n$x_{2a} + y_a \\le 1$ and $x_{2b} + y_b \\le 1 \\implies x_{2c} + y_c = \\lambda(x_{2a}+y_a) + (1-\\lambda)(x_{2b}+y_b) \\le \\lambda(1) + (1-\\lambda)(1) = 1$.\n$-x_{2a} + y_a \\le 1$ and $-x_{2b} + y_b \\le 1 \\implies -x_{2c} + y_c = \\lambda(-x_{2a}+y_a) + (1-\\lambda)(-x_{2b}+y_b) \\le \\lambda(1) + (1-\\lambda)(1) = 1$.\nSince $s_c$ satisfies all defining inequalities, $s_c \\in S$. Thus, $S$ is a convex set.\n\nNow, we prove that $P(S)$ is convex. Let $u$ and $v$ be two arbitrary points in $P(S)$. By definition of the set $P(S)$, there must exist points $s_u, s_v \\in S$ such that $P(s_u) = u$ and $P(s_v) = v$. To show $P(S)$ is convex, we must show that for any $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the point $w = \\lambda u + (1-\\lambda)v$ is also in $P(S)$.\nConsider the point $s_w = \\lambda s_u + (1-\\lambda)s_v$. As established above, $S$ is a convex set, so $s_w \\in S$.\nThe projection map $P(x_1, x_2, y) = (x_1, x_2)$ is a linear transformation. Applying $P$ to $s_w$ and using linearity:\n$$ P(s_w) = P(\\lambda s_u + (1-\\lambda)s_v) = \\lambda P(s_u) + (1-\\lambda)P(s_v) $$\nBy substituting $P(s_u) = u$ and $P(s_v) = v$, we obtain:\n$$ P(s_w) = \\lambda u + (1-\\lambda)v = w $$\nWe have found a point $s_w \\in S$ such that $P(s_w) = w$. This signifies that $w \\in P(S)$. Since this holds for any pair of points $u, v \\in P(S)$ and any $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, we conclude that $P(S)$ is a convex set.\n\n**Task 2: Determine the extreme points of $S$ and of $P(S)$**\n\nAn extreme point of a polyhedron like $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a vertex, which is a feasible point lying at the intersection of at least $3$ of the boundary-defining planes. The equations of these planes are:\n1. $y=0$\n2. $y=1$\n3. $x_1+y=1$\n4. $-x_1+y=1$\n5. $x_2+y=1$\n6. $-x_2+y=1$\n\nWe find candidate points by solving systems of $3$ of these equations and checking feasibility with respect to the remaining inequalities.\nCase 1: Intersections involving the plane $y=0$. The inequalities reduce to $|x_1| \\le 1$ and $|x_2| \\le 1$. The vertices of this feasible square region at $y=0$ are extreme points of $S$.\n- Intersection of $y=0$, $x_1+y=1$ (i.e., $x_1=1$), and $x_2+y=1$ (i.e., $x_2=1$): This gives the point $(1, 1, 0)$, which satisfies all six original inequalities.\n- Intersection of $y=0$, $x_1+y=1$ ($x_1=1$), and $-x_2+y=1$ ($x_2=-1$): This gives $(1, -1, 0)$, which is feasible.\n- Intersection of $y=0$, $-x_1+y=1$ ($x_1=-1$), and $x_2+y=1$ ($x_2=1$): This gives $(-1, 1, 0)$, which is feasible.\n- Intersection of $y=0$, $-x_1+y=1$ ($x_1=-1$), and $-x_2+y=1$ ($x_2=-1$): This gives $(-1, -1, 0)$, which is feasible.\nThese four points form a square base in the $y=0$ plane.\n\nCase 2: Intersections involving the plane $y=1$.\nSubstituting $y=1$ into the other active inequalities gives $x_1+1 \\le 1 \\implies x_1 \\le 0$ and $-x_1+1 \\le 1 \\implies x_1 \\ge 0$, which forces $x_1=0$. Similarly, $x_2+1 \\le 1 \\implies x_2 \\le 0$ and $-x_2+1 \\le 1 \\implies x_2 \\ge 0$, forcing $x_2=0$. This yields a unique point $(0,0,1)$, which is feasible. This point is the simultaneous solution to $y=1$ and boundary equations $3,4,5,6$.\n\nThe set of extreme points of $S$, denoted $E_S$, is therefore:\n$$ E_S = \\left\\{ (1,1,0), (1,-1,0), (-1,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,1) \\right\\} $$\nGeometrically, $S$ is a right pyramid with its apex at $(0,0,1)$ and its base being a square on the $y=0$ plane with vertices $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$.\n\nNext, we identify the set $P(S)$ and its extreme points. A point $(x_1, x_2)$ belongs to $P(S)$ if there exists a $y$ such that $(x_1, x_2, y) \\in S$. The constraints on $y$ are $y \\in [0,1]$, $y \\le 1-|x_1|$, and $y \\le 1-|x_2|$. For such a $y$ to exist, the lower bound on $y$ must be less than or equal to the upper bound.\n$$ 0 \\le \\min(1, 1-|x_1|, 1-|x_2|) $$\nThis requires $0 \\le 1$ (which is true), $0 \\le 1-|x_1| \\implies |x_1| \\le 1$, and $0 \\le 1-|x_2| \\implies |x_2| \\le 1$.\nThe projected set $P(S)$ is therefore the square in the $x_1x_2$-plane:\n$$ P(S) = \\left\\{ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\;:\\; -1 \\le x_1 \\le 1, \\; -1 \\le x_2 \\le 1 \\right\\} $$\nThis set is a convex polygon whose extreme points are its four vertices. Let $E_{P(S)}$ be the set of extreme points of $P(S)$:\n$$ E_{P(S)} = \\left\\{ (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) \\right\\} $$\nTo explain how the projection $P$ changes the extreme points, we project each point in $E_S$:\n$P(1,1,0) = (1,1)$\n$P(1,-1,0) = (1,-1)$\n$P(-1,1,0) = (-1,1)$\n$P(-1,-1,0) = (-1,-1)$\n$P(0,0,1) = (0,0)$\nThe specific effects are:\n1. The four extreme points of $S$ that form its base on the plane $y=0$ are mapped one-to-one onto the four extreme points of $P(S)$.\n2. The fifth extreme point of $S$, the apex $(0,0,1)$, is mapped to the point $(0,0)$. This point is the geometric center of the square $P(S)$ and is an interior point of $P(S)$, not an extreme point.\nThis example demonstrates that the projection of an extreme point of a convex set is not necessarily an extreme point of the projected set.\n\n**Task 3: Compute the exact area of $P(S)$**\n\nAs found in Task 2, the set $P(S)$ is a square in the $x_1x_2$-plane defined by $-1 \\le x_1 \\le 1$ and $-1 \\le x_2 \\le 1$.\nThe side length of this square along the $x_1$-axis is the distance from $x_1=-1$ to $x_1=1$, which is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nSimilarly, the side length along the $x_2$-axis is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe area of a square is the product of its side lengths.\n$$ \\text{Area}(P(S)) = 2 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nThe exact area is $4$.",

            "introduction": "While knowing that an operation preserves convexity is important, understanding the *robustness* of this property offers a deeper level of mastery. This exercise  challenges you to determine the precise amount of a non-convex term, specifically $-\\epsilon \\|x\\|^{2}$, that can be subtracted from a convex function before it loses its convexity. This threshold is directly related to the function's strong convexity modulus, a measure of its curvature, and by linking it to the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, you will gain a hands-on, quantitative understanding of the boundary between convex and non-convex functions.",

The scalar $\\epsilon$ is given to be non-negative, i.e., $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $f(x)$ and $\\|x\\|^{2}$ into the definition of $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ to obtain a consolidated quadratic form.\n$$g_{\\epsilon}(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} A x + b^{\\top} x + c\\right) - \\epsilon (x^{\\top} I x)$$\n$$g_{\\epsilon}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} A x - \\epsilon x^{\\top} I x + b^{\\top} x + c$$\nBy factoring out the quadratic term, we get:\n$$g_{\\epsilon}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} (A - 2\\epsilon I) x + b^{\\top} x + c$$\nThis expresses $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ as a standard quadratic function with the associated matrix $A - 2\\epsilon I$.\n\nThe problem states that a twice continuously differentiable function is convex if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite (PSD) everywhere. The function $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial, so it is infinitely differentiable.\n\nThe Hessian of a general quadratic function $h(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} Q x + d^{\\top} x + k$, where $Q$ is a symmetric matrix, is given by $\\nabla^2 h(x) = Q$.\nIn our case, the matrix for $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ is $Q_{\\epsilon} = A - 2\\epsilon I$. The matrix $A$ is symmetric, and the identity matrix $I$ is symmetric. Thus, $Q_{\\epsilon}$ is also symmetric.\nThe Hessian of $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ is therefore constant and equal to this matrix:\n$$\\nabla^2 g_{\\epsilon}(x) = A - 2\\epsilon I$$\n\nFor $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ to be convex, its Hessian must be positive semidefinite.\n$$\\nabla^2 g_{\\epsilon}(x) \\succeq 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad A - 2\\epsilon I \\succeq 0$$\nThe notation $\\succeq 0$ indicates that the matrix is positive semidefinite. A symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if all its eigenvalues are non-negative.\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A - 2\\epsilon I$ and $v$ be the corresponding eigenvector. Then:\n$$(A - 2\\epsilon I)v = \\lambda v$$\n$$Av - 2\\epsilon Iv = \\lambda v$$\n$$Av = (\\lambda + 2\\epsilon)v$$\nThis shows that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $A$, with eigenvalue $\\lambda_A = \\lambda + 2\\epsilon$.\nConversely, if $\\lambda_A$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then the corresponding eigenvalue of $A - 2\\epsilon I$ is $\\lambda = \\lambda_A - 2\\epsilon$.\n\nThe condition that all eigenvalues of $A - 2\\epsilon I$ are non-negative translates to:\n$$\\lambda_A - 2\\epsilon \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all eigenvalues } \\lambda_A \\text{ of } A$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to find a constraint on $\\epsilon$:\n$$2\\epsilon \\le \\lambda_A$$\n$$\\epsilon \\le \\frac{\\lambda_A}{2}$$\nThis must hold for all eigenvalues of $A$. Therefore, $\\epsilon$ must be less than or equal to half the minimum eigenvalue of $A$.\n$$\\epsilon \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\min(\\lambda_A)$$\nwhere $\\min(\\lambda_A)$ denotes the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest value $\\epsilon^{\\star}$ such that $g_{\\epsilon}$ is convex if and only if $\\epsilon \\le \\epsilon^{\\star}$. This value is precisely $\\frac{1}{2} \\min(\\lambda_A)$.\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2} \\min(\\lambda_A)$$\n\nNext, we must compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 4-\\lambda & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$(4-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda) - (2)(2) = 0$$\n$$12 - 4\\lambda - 3\\lambda + \\lambda^2 - 4 = 0$$\n$$\\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 8 = 0$$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{-(-7) \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 32}}{2}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}$$\n\nThe two eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\nThe smallest eigenvalue is:\n$$\\min(\\lambda_A) = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{17}}{2}$$\nNote that since $\\sqrt{16}=4$ and $\\sqrt{25}=5$, $\\sqrt{17}$ is between $4$ and $5$. Thus, $7 - \\sqrt{17}$ is positive, and so is $\\min(\\lambda_A)$. This confirms that the original function $f(x)$ is strictly convex.\n\nFinally, we determine the value of $\\epsilon^{\\star}$:\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2} \\min(\\lambda_A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{17}}{2} \\right)$$\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{17}}{4}$$\nThis is the largest value of $\\epsilon$ for which $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ remains convex. The initial condition $\\epsilon \\ge 0$ is satisfied since $7 - \\sqrt{17} > 7 - 5 = 2 > 0$.",
