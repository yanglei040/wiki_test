            "solution": "The problem is analyzed in two parts as requested. First, we verify if the given points lie within the specified affine set. Second, we determine the affine hull of these points and its dimension from first principles.\n\nAn affine set is a subset of a vector space that is closed under affine combinations. A set $S$ is affine if for any $x, y \\in S$, the point $\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y$ is also in $S$ for any scalar $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

That is, for any affine set $S$ containing a point $x_0$, the set $V = \\{x - x_0 \\mid x \\in S\\}$ is a vector subspace. The dimension of the affine set $S$ is defined as the dimension of this associated subspace $V$.\n\nTo find the dimension of the affine hull of $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$, we first construct the associated vector subspace. We can choose any of the points as the origin of the translation, for instance $x^{(1)}$. The subspace $V$ is spanned by the difference vectors between $x^{(1)}$ and the other points:\n$$V = \\text{span}\\{x^{(2)} - x^{(1)}, x^{(3)} - x^{(1)}, x^{(4)} - x^{(1)}\\}.$$\nThe dimension of the affine hull is $\\dim(V)$. Let's compute these difference vectors:\n$$v^{(1)} = x^{(2)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n$$v^{(2)} = x^{(3)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n$$v^{(3)} = x^{(4)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe dimension of the affine hull is the dimension of the subspace spanned by $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}, v^{(3)}\\}$, which is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in this set. We observe the relationship between $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(3)}$:\n$$2 v^{(1)} = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = v^{(3)}.$$\nSince $v^{(3)}$ is a scalar multiple of $v^{(1)}$, it is linearly dependent on $v^{(1)}$. Thus, the set of spanning vectors can be reduced to $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}$:\n$$V = \\text{span}\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}, v^{(3)}\\} = \\text{span}\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}.$$\nThe dimension of $V$ is at most $2$. To determine if it is exactly $2$, we must check if $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ are linearly independent. We seek scalars $c_1, c_2$ such that $c_1 v^{(1)} + c_2 v^{(2)} = 0$:\n$$c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis vector equation corresponds to a system of linear equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $-3c_1 - 5c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $-c_1 + c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $2c_1 + 2c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $c_1 + 3c_2 = 0$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom equation (2), we have $c_2 = c_1$. Substituting this into equation (3) gives $2c_1 + 2c_1 = 4c_1 = 0$, which implies $c_1 = 0$. Since $c_2 = c_1$, we must also have $c_2 = 0$. This solution $(c_1, c_2)=(0,0)$ satisfies all four equations. Since the only solution is the trivial one, the vectors $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe set $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}$ forms a basis for the subspace $V$. The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in its basis. Therefore, $\\dim(V) = 2$.\nThe smallest affine set containing $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ is the affine hull, which can be expressed as:\n$$ \\text{aff}\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\} = x^{(1)} + V = \\left\\{ x^{(1)} + c_1 v^{(1)} + c_2 v^{(2)} \\mid c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}. $$\nThe dimension of this affine hull is $\\dim(V)$.\nBased on our analysis, the dimension is $2$.\nThis is consistent with the fact that the affine hull of the points is a subset of the affine set $\\{x: Ax=b\\}$. The dimension of $\\{x: Ax=b\\}$ is the dimension of the null space of $A$, which is $4 - \\text{rank}(A) = 4 - 2 = 2$. Since the affine hull has dimension $2$ and is contained within an affine set of dimension $2$, the two sets must be identical.\n\nThe dimension of the affine hull of $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ is $2$.",

            "problem": "You are given finite sets of sample points in a real Euclidean space and a single query point per set. Your task is to compute the smallest affine subspace that contains the sample points using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and to assess how far the query point lies from that affine subspace. Use the following definitions as the fundamental base: an affine set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is any translation of a linear subspace; the affine hull of a set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, denoted $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$, is the smallest affine set containing $S$.

            "solution": "We start from the fundamental definitions in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. An affine set is any translate of a linear subspace. For a finite set $S = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, the affine hull $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$ is the smallest affine set containing $S$. A classical characterization is that $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$ equals $x_c + \\mathrm{span}\\{x_i - x_c : i = 1,\\dots,m\\}$ for any fixed $x_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ (for instance, the empirical mean). This follows because any point in the affine hull can be written as an affine combination of the points, and differences relative to a fixed center generate the direction subspace.\n\nTo identify the direction subspace algorithmically, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides orthonormal directions capturing variance in centered data. Formally, form the centered data matrix $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ whose $i$-th row is $(x_i - x_c)^\\top$. Compute the singular value decomposition $Z = U \\Sigma V^\\top$, where $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$, $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ has non-negative diagonal entries (the singular values), and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is orthogonal. The right singular vectors (columns of $V$) associated with strictly positive singular values span the column space of $Z^\\top$, which is precisely $\\mathrm{span}\\{x_i - x_c\\}$. Therefore, the direction subspace of $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$ is spanned by the subset of columns of $V$ corresponding to singular values that are numerically deemed non-zero. If we let $r$ denote the number of singular values strictly greater than a threshold $\\tau$, then the affine dimension is $r$, and an orthonormal basis for the direction subspace is given by $V_r \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times r}$, the matrix formed by the first $r$ columns of $V$.\n\nTo compute the distance from a query point $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to the affine hull, we note that $\\mathrm{aff}(S) = x_c + \\mathrm{span}(V_r)$, where $V_r$ has orthonormal columns. Consider the vector $v = y - x_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The orthogonal projection of $v$ onto $\\mathrm{span}(V_r)$ is $V_r (V_r^\\top v)$, because $V_r^\\top V_r = I_r$ when columns are orthonormal. Therefore, the projection of $y$ onto the affine hull is $x_c + V_r (V_r^\\top (y - x_c))$. The residual vector orthogonal to the affine hull is\n$$\nr_{\\perp} = (y - x_c) - V_r (V_r^\\top (y - x_c)),\n$$\nand the Euclidean distance from $y$ to $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$ is $\\|r_{\\perp}\\|_2$. In the special case when $r = 0$ (all singular values are zero), the direction subspace is trivial, and $\\mathrm{aff}(S)$ reduces to the single point $\\{x_c\\}$; the distance becomes $\\|y - x_c\\|_2$.\n\nNumerical rank determination requires a threshold to decide which singular values are effectively non-zero. To respect scale invariance, we set the threshold as\n$$\n\\tau = 10^{-10} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\max},\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\max}$ is the largest singular value. If $\\sigma_{\\max} = 0$, then all singular values are zero by definition, and the affine dimension is $0$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n- Construct the sample matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, compute $x_c = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$, and form the centered matrix $Z$ with rows $x_i - x_c$.\n- Compute $U, \\Sigma, V^\\top = \\mathrm{svd}(Z)$ using singular value decomposition; extract singular values $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\cdots$.\n- Define $\\tau = 10^{-10} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\max}$ if $\\sigma_{\\max} > 0$ and otherwise set the affine dimension to $0$.\n- Let $r$ be the count of $\\sigma_j$ such that $\\sigma_j > \\tau$. Form $V_r$ by taking the first $r$ right singular vectors.\n- Compute $v = y - x_c$, residual $r_{\\perp} = v - V_r(V_r^\\top v)$ if $r > 0$, else $r_{\\perp} = v$.\n- The distance is $\\delta = \\|r_{\\perp}\\|_2$.\n- Output $[r,\\ \\delta]$ with $\\delta$ rounded to six decimal places.\n\nNow consider the provided test suite:\n- Test Case $1$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with points lying on a single affine line and a query point on the same line; the affine dimension should be $1$ and the distance should be $0$.\n- Test Case $2$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with points lying on a plane described by $z = x + 2y$ and a query point on that plane; the affine dimension should be $2$ and the distance should be $0$.\n- Test Case $3$ repeats the same point in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, making the affine hull a single point; the affine dimension should be $0$, and the distance equals the Euclidean norm from the query point to $x_c$, which is $\\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n- Test Case $4$ places points on the plane $z = 0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with a query point having $z = 1$; the affine dimension should be $2$ and the distance should be $1$.\n- Test Case $5$ places points on a line in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with direction $\\left(1, 2, 3\\right)$ and a query point not on that line; the affine dimension should be $1$, and the computed distance will be a positive value determined by the orthogonal projection formula above.\n\nThe program implements these steps and prints a single line containing the list $\\left[\\left[d_1,\\ \\delta_1\\right],\\left[d_2,\\ \\delta_2\\right],\\left[d_3,\\ \\delta_3\\right],\\left[d_4,\\ \\delta_4\\right],\\left[d_5,\\ \\delta_5\\right]\\right]$ with each $\\delta_i$ rounded to six decimal places.",

This practice explores that question by contrasting the optimization of a linear function over a bounded convex hull versus its unbounded affine hull. By analyzing how the solution to an optimization problem changes, you will gain a crucial insight: relaxing inequality constraints to leave only affine equality constraints can fundamentally alter a problem's behavior, potentially making a bounded problem unbounded. This exercise illustrates a core principle in the formulation and analysis of optimization models .",

Let $f(x) = c^\\top x$ be a linear functional with $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. In the context of optimization methods, one is often interested in how the feasible region changes the behavior of solutions.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for soundness and completeness.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A finite set of points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- The convex hull of these points, $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$.\n- The affine hull of these points, $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$.\n- A linear functional $f(x) = c^\\top x$ with $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- A specific instance in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with points $x_1 = (0,0)$, $x_2 = (2,2)$, and $x_3 = (3,3)$.\n- For these points, the problem states that the convex hull is the line segment from $x_1$ to $x_3$, and the affine hull is the line $\\{(t,t) : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n- Two specific linear functionals are provided:\n    - $f_1(x) = c_1^\\top x$ with $c_1 = (1,-1)$.\n    - $f_2(x) = c_2^\\top x$ with $c_2 = (1,0)$.\n- The task is to evaluate statements about maximizing these functionals over the convex and affine hulls.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The concepts of convex hulls, affine hulls, and linear functionals are fundamental to convex analysis and optimization. They are well-defined mathematical objects. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks to evaluate the truth of four distinct mathematical statements based on a given setup. Each statement is a falsifiable claim, making the problem well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise and mathematical, free of subjective content.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided points $x_1=(0,0)$, $x_2=(2,2)$, and $x_3=(3,3)$ are collinear, lying on the line $y=x$.\n    - The convex hull of these points is the set of convex combinations. For collinear points, this is the line segment connecting the outermost points. Here, $x_1$ and $x_3$ are the outermost points, as $x_2 = \\frac{1}{3}x_1 + \\frac{2}{3}x_3$. Thus, $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ is the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,3)$. The problem statement is correct on this.\n    - The affine hull is the set of all affine combinations. For collinear points, this is the entire line passing through them. The line through $(0,0)$ and $(3,3)$ is indeed $\\{(t,t) : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. The problem statement is also correct on this.\n    The problem setup is self-consistent and provides all necessary information to analyze the options.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. The analysis may proceed.\n\n**Problem Analysis**\n\nLet the set of points be $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ where $x_1 = (0,0)$, $x_2 = (2,2)$, and $x_3 = (3,3)$.\nThe convex hull of $S$ is $\\mathcal{C} = \\operatorname{conv}(S)$. As established, this is the line segment connecting $x_1$ and $x_3$. Any point $x \\in \\mathcal{C}$ can be written as $x = (t,t)$ for $t \\in [0,3]$.\nThe affine hull of $S$ is $\\mathcal{A} = \\operatorname{aff}(S)$. This is the line passing through the points. Any point $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$ can be written as $x = (t,t)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe two linear functionals are $f_1(x) = c_1^\\top x$ with $c_1 = (1,-1)$ and $f_2(x) = c_2^\\top x$ with $c_2 = (1,0)$.\n\nLet's evaluate the functionals on a general point $x = (t,t) \\in \\mathcal{A}$:\n- For $f_1(x)$: $f_1((t,t)) = c_1^\\top (t,t) = (1, -1) \\cdot (t, t) = 1 \\cdot t + (-1) \\cdot t = t - t = 0$.\n- For $f_2(x)$: $f_2((t,t)) = c_2^\\top (t,t) = (1, 0) \\cdot (t, t) = 1 \\cdot t + 0 \\cdot t = t$.\n\nWe can now evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For $f_1$, maximizing over $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ yields the same optimal value as maximizing over $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$, and every point of $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ is an optimizer when maximizing $f_1$ over $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$.**\n\n- **Maximizing $f_1$ over $\\mathcal{A} = \\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$**: As calculated above, $f_1(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$. The function is constant over the entire feasible set. The maximum value is $0$. Since the function value is the same everywhere, every point $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is a maximizer.\n- **Maximizing $f_1$ over $\\mathcal{C} = \\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$**: Since $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{A}$, the function $f_1(x)$ is also constant and equal to $0$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{C}$. The maximum value is $0$.\n- **Comparison**: The optimal value for maximization over $\\mathcal{A}$ is $0$. The optimal value for maximization over $\\mathcal{C}$ is also $0$. They are the same. The second part of the statement, that every point of $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ is an optimizer for the maximization over $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$, is also true.\n\nThus, statement A is **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $f_2$, maximizing over $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ is unbounded above, while maximizing over $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$ attains a finite maximum at $x_3$.**\n\n- **Maximizing $f_2$ over $\\mathcal{A} = \\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$**: The problem is to maximize $f_2((t,t)) = t$ over the domain $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As $t$ can be arbitrarily large, the value of the function is not bounded above.\n- **Maximizing $f_2$ over $\\mathcal{C} = \\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$**: The problem is to maximize $f_2((t,t)) = t$ over the domain $t \\in [0,3]$. The maximum value is $3$, which is attained at $t=3$. The point corresponding to $t=3$ is $(3,3)$, which is the point $x_3$. So, the maximization attains a finite maximum at $x_3$.\n- Both parts of the statement are accurate.\n\nThus, statement B is **Correct**.\n\n**C. For any linear functional $f(x) = c^\\top x$, the maximum over $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$ cannot occur at an extreme point; it must occur at a point in the relative interior of $\\operatorname{conv}\\{x_i\\}$.**\n\nThis statement is a general claim about linear optimization over a convex hull. The fundamental theorem of linear programming states that the maximum (if it exists) of a linear function over a compact convex set (such as a polytope, which is the convex hull of a finite number of points) is always attained at one of its extreme points (vertices).\nIn our specific case, the convex hull $\\mathcal{C}$ is a line segment. Its extreme points are $x_1=(0,0)$ and $x_3=(3,3)$. The relative interior is the open segment between them, i.e., $\\{(t,t) : t \\in (0,3)\\}$.\n- As a counterexample, consider the maximization of $f_2(x)$ over $\\mathcal{C}$. We found in the analysis for B that the maximum occurs at $x_3$, which is an extreme point. This directly contradicts the statement.\n- Another counterexample: consider minimizing $f_2(x)$ over $\\mathcal{C}$. The minimum is $0$, attained at $x_1$, another extreme point.\nThe statement makes a claim that is the opposite of established theory.\n\nThus, statement C is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $c$ is orthogonal to the direction subspace of $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$, then maximizing $c^\\top x$ over $\\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ has a unique optimizer equal to the centroid (arithmetic mean) of the points $\\{x_i\\}$.**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A} = \\operatorname{aff}\\{x_i\\}$ be an affine set. It can be written as $\\mathcal{A} = x_0 + V$, where $x_0 \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $V$ is the direction subspace. The direction subspace for our problem is $V = \\operatorname{span}\\{(1,1)\\}$, since $\\mathcal{A}$ is the line passing through the origin with direction vector $(1,1)$.\nThe condition is that $c$ is orthogonal to $V$, which means $c^\\top v = 0$ for all $v \\in V$.\nLet's evaluate $f(x) = c^\\top x$ for any two points $x_a, x_b \\in \\mathcal{A}$. We can write $x_b = x_a + v$ for some $v \\in V$. Then, $f(x_b) = c^\\top x_b = c^\\top(x_a + v) = c^\\top x_a + c^\\top v$. Since $c^\\top v = 0$, we have $f(x_b) = c^\\top x_a$. This shows that the function $f(x)$ is constant on the entire affine hull $\\mathcal{A}$.\nIf the function is constant on $\\mathcal{A}$, then every point in $\\mathcal{A}$ is a maximizer. The set of optimizers is $\\mathcal{A}$ itself. An optimizer is unique only if the set $\\mathcal{A}$ consists of a single point, which is not true in this problem.\nThe centroid is $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{3}(x_1+x_2+x_3) = \\frac{1}{3}((0,0)+(2,2)+(3,3)) = (\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{3})$. This point is in $\\mathcal{A}$. It is an optimizer, but it is not unique. For instance, $x_1=(0,0)$ is also an optimizer.\nThe vector $c_1=(1,-1)$ from the problem statement is orthogonal to $V=\\operatorname{span}\\{(1,1)\\}$, since $c_1^\\top (1,1) = 1-1=0$. As shown in the analysis for A, $f_1(x)$ is constant on $\\mathcal{A}$, and every point is an optimizer. This provides a direct counterexample to the claim of uniqueness.\n\nThus, statement D is **Incorrect**.",
