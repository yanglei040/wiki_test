            "solution": "The problem is analyzed in two parts as requested. First, we verify if the given points lie within the specified affine set. Second, we determine the affine hull of these points and its dimension from first principles.\n\nAn affine set is a subset of a vector space that is closed under affine combinations. A set $S$ is affine if for any $x, y \\in S$, the point $\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y$ is also in $S$ for any scalar $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The set of solutions to a system of linear equations, $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : Ax=b\\}$, constitutes an affine set.\n\nPart 1: Verification of points in the affine set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4} : A x = b\\}$.\n\nWe are given the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the vector $b = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.

That is, for any affine set $S$ containing a point $x_0$, the set $V = \\{x - x_0 \\mid x \\in S\\}$ is a vector subspace. The dimension of the affine set $S$ is defined as the dimension of this associated subspace $V$.\n\nTo find the dimension of the affine hull of $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$, we first construct the associated vector subspace. We can choose any of the points as the origin of the translation, for instance $x^{(1)}$. The subspace $V$ is spanned by the difference vectors between $x^{(1)}$ and the other points:\n$$V = \\text{span}\\{x^{(2)} - x^{(1)}, x^{(3)} - x^{(1)}, x^{(4)} - x^{(1)}\\}.$$\nThe dimension of the affine hull is $\\dim(V)$. Let's compute these difference vectors:\n$$v^{(1)} = x^{(2)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n$$v^{(2)} = x^{(3)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n$$v^{(3)} = x^{(4)} - x^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe dimension of the affine hull is the dimension of the subspace spanned by $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}, v^{(3)}\\}$, which is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in this set. We observe the relationship between $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(3)}$:\n$$2 v^{(1)} = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = v^{(3)}.$$\nSince $v^{(3)}$ is a scalar multiple of $v^{(1)}$, it is linearly dependent on $v^{(1)}$. Thus, the set of spanning vectors can be reduced to $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}$:\n$$V = \\text{span}\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}, v^{(3)}\\} = \\text{span}\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}.$$\nThe dimension of $V$ is at most $2$. To determine if it is exactly $2$, we must check if $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ are linearly independent. We seek scalars $c_1, c_2$ such that $c_1 v^{(1)} + c_2 v^{(2)} = 0$:\n$$c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis vector equation corresponds to a system of linear equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $-3c_1 - 5c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $-c_1 + c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $2c_1 + 2c_2 = 0$\n    \\item $c_1 + 3c_2 = 0$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom equation (2), we have $c_2 = c_1$. Substituting this into equation (3) gives $2c_1 + 2c_1 = 4c_1 = 0$, which implies $c_1 = 0$. Since $c_2 = c_1$, we must also have $c_2 = 0$. This solution $(c_1, c_2)=(0,0)$ satisfies all four equations. Since the only solution is the trivial one, the vectors $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe set $\\{v^{(1)}, v^{(2)}\\}$ forms a basis for the subspace $V$. The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in its basis. Therefore, $\\dim(V) = 2$.\nThe smallest affine set containing $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ is the affine hull, which can be expressed as:\n$$ \\text{aff}\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\} = x^{(1)} + V = \\left\\{ x^{(1)} + c_1 v^{(1)} + c_2 v^{(2)} \\mid c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}. $$\nThe dimension of this affine hull is $\\dim(V)$.\nBased on our analysis, the dimension is $2$.\nThis is consistent with the fact that the affine hull of the points is a subset of the affine set $\\{x: Ax=b\\}$. The dimension of $\\{x: Ax=b\\}$ is the dimension of the null space of $A$, which is $4 - \\text{rank}(A) = 4 - 2 = 2$. Since the affine hull has dimension $2$ and is contained within an affine set of dimension $2$, the two sets must be identical.\n\nThe dimension of the affine hull of $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ is $2$.",
