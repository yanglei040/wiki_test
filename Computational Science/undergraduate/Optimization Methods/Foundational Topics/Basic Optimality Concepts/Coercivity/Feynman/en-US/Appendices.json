A function is separately convex (or coordinate-wise convex) if, for each variable, the one-variable function obtained by fixing the other variables is convex. For a twice-differentiable one-variable function $g(t)$, a core result in convex analysis states that $g$ is convex on an interval if and only if its second derivative $g''(t)$ is non-negative on that interval.\n\nFirst, let's fix $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and analyze the convexity of the mapping $x_1 \\mapsto f(x_1, x_2)$. Let's define the one-variable function $g_{x_2}(x_1) = f(x_1, x_2) = x_2^2 x_1^2$. Here, $x_2$ is treated as a constant. The function $g_{x_2}$ is a polynomial in $x_1$ and is thus infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute its first and second derivatives with respect to $x_1$:\n$$\ng_{x_2}'(x_1) = \\frac{d}{dx_1}(x_2^2 x_1^2) = 2x_2^2 x_1\n$$\n$$\ng_{x_2}''(x_1) = \\frac{d^2}{dx_1^2}(x_2^2 x_1^2) = 2x_2^2\n$$\nFor any real number $x_2$, the term $x_2^2$ is non-negative, i.e., $x_2^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, the second derivative $g_{x_2}''(x_1) = 2x_2^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since its second derivative is non-negative everywhere, the function $x_1 \\mapsto f(x_1, x_2)$ is convex on $\\mathbb{R}$ for any fixed $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, we fix $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and analyze the convexity of the mapping $x_2 \\mapsto f(x_1, x_2)$. Let's define the one-variable function $h_{x_1}(x_2) = f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$. Here, $x_1$ is treated as a constant. This function is also infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute its first and second derivatives with respect to $x_2$:\n$$\nh_{x_1}'(x_2) = \\frac{d}{dx_2}(x_1^2 x_2^2) = 2x_1^2 x_2\n$$\n$$\nh_{x_1}''(x_2) = \\frac{d^2}{dx_2^2}(x_1^2 x_2^2) = 2x_1^2\n$$\nFor any real number $x_1$, the term $x_1^2$ is non-negative, i.e., $x_1^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, the second derivative $h_{x_1}''(x_2) = 2x_1^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As the second derivative is non-negative, the function $x_2 \\mapsto f(x_1, x_2)$ is convex on $\\mathbb{R}$ for any fixed $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the verification that $f$ is separately convex.\n\n**2) Demonstration of Non-Coercivity**\n\nA function $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is defined as coercive if $\\lim_{\\|x\\|\\to\\infty} f(x)=+\\infty$. To demonstrate that $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$ is not coercive, we must find an unbounded sequence of points $\\{z_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\\|z_k\\|\\to\\infty$ as $k\\to\\infty$, but the sequence of function values $\\{f(z_k)\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ does not tend to $+\\infty$.\n\nThe function $f(x_1, x_2)$ takes the value $0$ whenever $x_1=0$ or $x_2=0$. These correspond to the coordinate axes in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These axes represent \"valleys\" along which the function remains at a constant low value. Let's consider a path along the $x_1$-axis.\n\nLet's define a sequence of points $z_k = (k, 0)$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The norm of these points is given by $\\|z_k\\| = \\sqrt{k^2 + 0^2} = k$. As $k\\to\\infty$, we have $\\|z_k\\|\\to\\infty$, so the sequence of points is unbounded.\n\nNow, we evaluate the function $f$ at these points:\n$$\nf(z_k) = f(k, 0) = k^2 \\cdot 0^2 = 0\n$$\nThe sequence of function values is $f(z_k)=0$ for all $k$. The limit of this sequence is $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(z_k) = 0$, which is not $+\\infty$.\n\nSince we have found a path along which $\\|z_k\\|\\to\\infty$ but $f(z_k)$ does not approach $+\\infty$, the function $f$ is not coercive. Another such path would be along the $x_2$-axis, for example with points $(0, k)$.\n\n**3) Computation of the Limit Inferior**\n\nWe are asked to compute the value $L = \\liminf_{\\|(x_1,x_2)\\|\\to\\infty} f(x_1,x_2)$. The definition of this limit inferior is:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\left( \\inf_{\\|(x_1,x_2)\\|  R} f(x_1,x_2) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\|(x_1,x_2)\\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm $\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$.\n\nFirst, we observe that $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2 \\ge 0$ for all $(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, since it is a product of squares. This implies that the infimum of $f$ over any subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ must be greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nLet's consider the infimum of $f$ on the set $S_R = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|(x_1, x_2)\\|  R\\}$ for an arbitrary $R  0$. We want to determine $\\inf_{(x_1,x_2) \\in S_R} f(x_1,x_2)$.\n\nFrom our analysis of coercivity, we know there are points arbitrarily far from the origin where $f$ evaluates to $0$. For any given $R  0$, let's choose the point $p_R = (R+1, 0)$. The norm of this point is $\\|p_R\\| = \\sqrt{(R+1)^2 + 0^2} = R+1$. Since $R+1  R$, the point $p_R$ belongs to the set $S_R$.\n\nThe value of the function at this point is:\n$$\nf(p_R) = f(R+1, 0) = (R+1)^2 \\cdot 0^2 = 0\n$$\nSo, for any $R  0$, there exists a point in $S_R$ at which $f$ is $0$. Since $f(x_1, x_2) \\ge 0$ for all points, the greatest lower bound (infimum) of $f$ on the set $S_R$ must be $0$.\n$$\n\\inf_{\\|(x_1,x_2)\\|  R} f(x_1,x_2) = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any choice of $R  0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the limit inferior $L$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\left( \\inf_{\\|(x_1,x_2)\\|  R} f(x_1,x_2) \\right) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the value of the limit inferior is $0$.",

The behavior of $f_{\\alpha}(x)$ as $\\|x\\| \\to \\infty$ depends only on the magnitude of the vector $x$, which is its norm $\\|x\\|$. Let us introduce a variable $r = \\|x\\|$, where $r \\ge 0$. The condition $\\|x\\| \\to \\infty$ is equivalent to $r \\to \\infty$. In terms of $r$, the function can be expressed as:\n$$\ng_{\\alpha}(r) = r^2 - \\alpha \\ln(1+r^2)\n$$\nThe function $f_{\\alpha}$ is coercive if and only if $\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} g_{\\alpha}(r) = +\\infty$.\nThe function $f_{\\alpha}$ is not coercive if this limit is not $+\\infty$; that is, if the limit is a finite real number or $-\\infty$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis of the limit, let us make the substitution $u = r^2 = \\|x\\|^2$. As $\\|x\\| \\to \\infty$, we have $r \\to \\infty$, and thus $u \\to \\infty$. The function in terms of $u$ (for $u \\ge 0$) is:\n$$\nh_{\\alpha}(u) = u - \\alpha \\ln(1+u)\n$$\nWe need to determine for which values of $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ the following limit is not $+\\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} h_{\\alpha}(u) = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\left[ u - \\alpha \\ln(1+u) \\right]\n$$\nWe analyze this limit by considering different cases for the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha \\le 0$\nIf $\\alpha = 0$, the function is $h_{0}(u) = u$. The limit is $\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} u = +\\infty$. Thus, $f_{0}$ is coercive.\nIf $\\alpha  0$, we can write $\\alpha = -c$ for some constant $c  0$. The function becomes:\n$$\nh_{-c}(u) = u - (-c) \\ln(1+u) = u + c \\ln(1+u)\n$$\nAs $u \\to \\infty$, both terms $u$ and $c \\ln(1+u)$ tend to $+\\infty$. Their sum must also tend to $+\\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\left[ u + c \\ln(1+u) \\right] = +\\infty\n$$\nTherefore, for all $\\alpha \\le 0$, the function $f_{\\alpha}$ is coercive. This implies that the set $A$ of $\\alpha$ for which $f_\\alpha$ is not coercive must be a subset of the positive real numbers, i.e., $A \\subseteq (0, \\infty)$.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha  0$\nIn this case, the limit $\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} [u - \\alpha \\ln(1+u)]$ presents an indeterminate form of the type $\\infty - \\infty$. This requires a comparison of the growth rates of the functions $u$ and $\\ln(1+u)$. As per the problem's hint to use \"well-tested growth comparisons\", we know that a polynomial function grows faster than a logarithmic function. To show this formally, we can factor out the dominant term $u$:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\left[ u - \\alpha \\ln(1+u) \\right] = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} u \\left( 1 - \\alpha \\frac{\\ln(1+u)}{u} \\right)\n$$\nNow we evaluate the limit of the term $\\frac{\\ln(1+u)}{u}$ as $u \\to \\infty$. This is an indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$, so we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(1+u)}{u} = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{du}\\ln(1+u)}{\\frac{d}{du}u} = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+u}}{1} = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the limit of $h_{\\alpha}(u)$:\n$$\n\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} u \\left( 1 - \\alpha \\frac{\\ln(1+u)}{u} \\right) = \\left(\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} u\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\alpha \\frac{\\ln(1+u)}{u}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= (+\\infty) \\cdot (1 - \\alpha \\cdot 0) = (+\\infty) \\cdot 1 = +\\infty\n$$\nThis result holds for any value of $\\alpha  0$.

Is the description of the challenge for gradient descent accurate?\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- Function: $f_A(\\mathbf{x})=\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2$. For $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, this is $f_A(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.\n- **Coercivity:** As $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\to \\infty$, it is clear that $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2 \\to \\infty$. Thus, $f_A$ is coercive.\n- **Flat Region:** The gradient is $\\nabla f_A(\\mathbf{x}) = 2\\mathbf{x}$. The gradient is the zero vector, $\\nabla f_A(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$, if and only if $2\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, which means $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$.

For $f_B$, when $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  6$, the function value is constant at $36$. Therefore, $\\lim_{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|\\to\\infty} f_B(\\mathbf{x}) = 36$, which is not $+\\infty$.

For $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\ge 8$, the function is $f_C(\\mathbf{x})=\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2-28$. The limit is $\\lim_{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|\\to\\infty} (\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2-28) = +\\infty$.

In the open annulus defined by $6\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|8$, the function has a constant value of $36$. The gradient $\\nabla f_C(\\mathbf{x})$ is the zero vector for all $\\mathbf{x}$ in this annulus. This region is clearly away from the minimizer at the origin. Thus, the function has a flat region away from its minimizer.\n- **Challenge Description:** The standard gradient descent update rule is $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$, where $\\alpha  0$ is a fixed step size. If an iterate $\\mathbf{x}_k$ is initialized in or enters the open annulus $6\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|8$, then $\\nabla f_C(\\mathbf{x}_k)=\\mathbf{0}$. The update becomes $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha(\\mathbf{0}) = \\mathbf{x}_k$. All subsequent iterates will be identical, and the algorithm stalls, failing to reach the minimizer at $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$. The description of this challenge is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- Function: $f_D(\\mathbf{x})=\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|$.\n- **Coercivity:** As $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\to \\infty$, $f_D(\\mathbf{x})=\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\to \\infty$. Thus, $f_D$ is coercive.\n- **Flat Region:** The question asks for a function that *has* a flat region away from its minimizer. The minimizer of $f_D$ is at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. For any $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, the gradient is $\\nabla f_D(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}$. The norm of the gradient is $\\|\\nabla f_D(\\mathbf{x})\\| = \\|\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}\\| = 1$. Since the gradient is never the zero vector for any $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, the function has no flat regions away from its minimizer. The premise of the problem—to find a function *with* such a region—is not met by $f_D$.\n- **Challenge Description:** The claim is that \"gradient descent must converge from any starting point\". This is a very strong claim and is not generally true for a fixed step size. If the step size $\\alpha$ is chosen poorly (e.g., $\\alpha  2\\|\\mathbf{x}_k\\|$), the algorithm can overshoot the minimum and fail to converge. Regardless of this claim's correctness, the function itself does not fit the problem's primary criteria.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option C provides a function that is coercive, has a flat region away from the minimizer, and correctly describes the associated pitfall for gradient descent.",
