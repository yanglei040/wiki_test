This exercise  takes a function defined by its canonical form—a direct list of all input conditions that yield a true output—and challenges you to reduce it to its minimal SOP expression. This fundamental skill is essential because a simpler expression corresponds directly to a more efficient digital circuit, using fewer logic gates and operating faster.",

            "problem": "A digital logic function $F$ with three input variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ is specified using its canonical Sum of Products (SOP) form. The function is defined by the set of minterms for which its output is true (1): $F(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 2, 3)$. The variables are ordered such that $A$ is the Most Significant Bit (MSB). Find the minimal standard SOP expression that is logically equivalent to this function.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the simplification of a given Boolean function in its canonical Sum of Products (SOP) form. The function is $F(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 2, 3)$.\n\nFirst, we need to write out the full canonical SOP expression by expanding the minterm list. A minterm is a product term that includes every variable in the function, either in its complemented or uncomplemented form. The variables are ordered with $A$ as the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and $C$ as the Least Significant Bit (LSB).\n\nThe minterms are identified by their decimal equivalents:\n- Minterm $m_0$ corresponds to the binary value $000$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}$.\n- Minterm $m_1$ corresponds to the binary value $001$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}C$.\n- Minterm $m_2$ corresponds to the binary value $010$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}B\\overline{C}$.\n- Minterm $m_3$ corresponds to the binary value $011$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}BC$.\n\nThe full canonical SOP expression is the sum of these minterms:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C + \\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC$$\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression using the rules of Boolean algebra. We look for adjacent terms that differ by only one variable.\n\nLet's group the terms strategically:\n$$F(A,B,C) = (\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C) + (\\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC)$$\n\nFor the first pair of terms, $(\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C)$, we can factor out the common part $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}$:\n$$\\overline{A}\\overline{B}(\\overline{C} + C)$$\nUsing the Boolean identity $X + \\overline{X} = 1$, we have $\\overline{C} + C = 1$. So, the expression simplifies to $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}(1) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}$.\n\nFor the second pair of terms, $(\\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC)$, we can factor out the common part $\\overline{A}B$:\n$$\\overline{A}B(\\overline{C} + C)$$\nAgain, using the identity $\\overline{C} + C = 1$, this simplifies to $\\overline{A}B(1) = \\overline{A}B$.\n\nNow, substitute these simplified parts back into the main expression for $F$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B} + \\overline{A}B$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression further. The common term is $\\overline{A}$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}(\\overline{B} + B)$$\n\nApplying the identity $X + \\overline{X} = 1$ one more time, we get $\\overline{B} + B = 1$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}(1)$$\n\nThis yields the final minimal standard SOP expression:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}$$\n\nAlternatively, one could use a Karnaugh map (K-map) for simplification. For a 3-variable function, we set up a $2 \\times 4$ grid. We place '1's in the cells corresponding to the minterms $0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nThe K-map is as follows (with $A$ for rows and $BC$ for columns):\n```\n       BC\n      00  01  11  10\n    +---+---+---+---+\nA=0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  (cells for m0, m1, m3, m2)\n    +---+---+---+---+\nA=1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  (cells for m4, m5, m7, m6)\n    +---+---+---+---+\n```\nWe can form the largest possible group of adjacent '1's. In this case, there is a group of four '1's that covers the entire top row. To find the term for this group, we identify the variable(s) that remain constant within the group.\n- For this group, the variable $A$ is always $0$.\n- The variable $B$ takes on values $0$ and $1$.\n- The variable $C$ takes on values $0$ and $1$.\n\nSince $B$ and $C$ change within the group, they are eliminated. The only variable that remains constant is $A=0$. Therefore, the simplified term for this group is $\\overline{A}$. As this group covers all the '1's in the map, the minimal expression is simply $F = \\overline{A}$. Both methods yield the same result.",

This practice  moves from abstract theory to a practical application by asking you to design the control logic for a memory alignment checker in a processor.

            "problem": "Consider a load/store unit in a 32-bit processor that enforces alignment constraints at the level of the two least significant address bits. Let $L \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the control signal that is asserted for a memory load, and $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the control signal that is asserted for a memory store. Let $A_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $A_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the two least significant bits of the byte address. The unit must raise a misaligned-access detect signal $M \\in \\{0,1\\}$ whenever a requested access violates alignment, with the following precise semantics:\n- For a load ($L = 1$), alignment requires $A_1 A_0 = 00$ in binary. Equivalently, the load is misaligned if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\neq (0,0)$.\n- For a store ($S = 1$), alignment permits $A_1 A_0 \\in \\{00,10\\}$ in binary. Equivalently, the store is misaligned if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\notin \\{(0,0),(1,0)\\}$.\n\nAssume the control signals satisfy $L,S \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and that in correctly orchestrated memory access cycles they will not be asserted simultaneously. However, your logic must be functionally correct for all Boolean inputs. Use the standard Boolean algebra over $\\{0,1\\}$ with sum-of-products form defined as a logical disjunction ($+$) of product terms (logical conjunctions) of literals (variables or their complements). Starting from the fundamental definitions of Boolean operations, minterms, and set inclusion, derive a minimal sum-of-products expression for $M$ in terms of $L$, $S$, $A_1$, and $A_0$ that exactly detects misalignment as specified.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form Boolean expression using $+$ for logical disjunction and juxtaposition for logical conjunction. Do not introduce any additional variables. No numerical rounding is required. The final answer must be a single analytical expression.",
            "solution": "The user wants to find a minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression for the misaligned-access detect signal $M$.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Input variables:\n    - $L \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Control signal for memory load.\n    - $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Control signal for memory store.\n    - $A_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Address bit 1.\n    - $A_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Address bit 0.\n- Output variable:\n    - $M \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Misaligned-access detect signal.\n- Conditions for misalignment ($M=1$):\n    1. For a load ($L=1$): Misalignment occurs if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\neq (0,0)$.\n    2. For a store ($S=1$): Misalignment occurs if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\notin \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\}$.\n- Constraints: The logic for $M$ must be correct for all combinations of the Boolean inputs $L, S, A_1, A_0$.\n- Goal: Derive a minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression for $M$ in terms of $L, S, A_1, A_0$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a standard exercise in digital logic design based on Boolean algebra, a foundational topic in computer engineering. It is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of input variables and conditions to define the output function. A unique minimal SOP expression is known to exist (up to the ordering of terms). The problem is stated objectively and precisely, with no ambiguities. All terms are standard within the field. Therefore, the problem is **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Boolean Expression\n\nThe misalignment signal $M$ must be asserted if a load is active and its address is misaligned, OR if a store is active and its address is misaligned. This can be expressed as a logical disjunction:\n$$M = (\\text{Load Active} \\land \\text{Load Misaligned}) \\lor (\\text{Store Active} \\land \\text{Store Misaligned})$$\n\nLet us formalize each component of this expression.\n\n**Load Misalignment:**\nA load is active when $L=1$. The problem states that a load is misaligned if $(A_1, A_0) \\neq (0,0)$. This is the logical negation of the condition for an aligned address, which is $(A_1, A_0) = (0,0)$.\nIn Boolean algebra, the condition $(A_1, A_0) = (0,0)$ is represented by the product term $\\overline{A_1}\\overline{A_0}$.\nThe condition for misalignment is the negation of this, $\\neg(\\overline{A_1}\\overline{A_0})$. By De Morgan's laws, this simplifies to $\\overline{\\overline{A_1}} + \\overline{\\overline{A_0}} = A_1 + A_0$.\nThus, the condition for a misaligned load is $L \\land (A_1 + A_0)$, which is written as $L(A_1+A_0)$ in SOP preparatory form.\n\n**Store Misalignment:**\nA store is active when $S=1$. The problem states that a store is misaligned if $(A_1, A_0) \\notin \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\}$.\nThe set of allowed addresses for a store is $\\{(0,0), (1,0)\\}$. An access is aligned if its address falls into this set.\nThe condition for an aligned store address can be written as $(\\overline{A_1}\\overline{A_0}) + (A_1\\overline{A_0})$.\nUsing the distributive law, this simplifies to $(\\overline{A_1}+A_1)\\overline{A_0} = 1 \\cdot \\overline{A_0} = \\overline{A_0}$. So, a store is aligned if $A_0=0$.\nConsequently, a store is misaligned if the opposite is true, which is $\\neg(\\overline{A_0}) = A_0$.\nThus, the condition for a misaligned store is $S \\land A_0$, written as $S A_0$.\n\n**Complete Expression for M:**\nCombining the conditions for load and store misalignment with a disjunction ($+$) gives the complete Boolean function for $M$:\n$$M(L, S, A_1, A_0) = L(A_1 + A_0) + S A_0$$\nTo obtain a sum-of-products form, we apply the distributive law to the first term:\n$$M = L A_1 + L A_0 + S A_0$$\nThis expression is in SOP form. We must now verify that it is minimal.\n\n### Step 4: Minimization using a Karnaugh Map\n\nTo find the minimal SOP expression, we can use a $4$-variable Karnaugh map with inputs $L, S, A_1, A_0$. The function $M$ produces a $1$ for any minterm where the conditions derived above are met.\n\nThe truth table for $M$ can be constructed from the expression $M = L(A_1+A_0) + SA_0$:\n- If $L=0, S=0$: $M = 0$.\n- If $L=0, S=1$: $M = A_0$.\n- If $L=1, S=0$: $M = A_1+A_0$.\n- If $L=1, S=1$: $M = (A_1+A_0) + A_0 = A_1+A_0$.\n\nThe Karnaugh map is as follows, with rows indexed by $LS$ and columns by $A_1A_0$ in Gray code order:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n\\mathbf{LS \\backslash A_1A_0} & \\mathbf{00} & \\mathbf{01} & \\mathbf{11} & \\mathbf{10} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\mathbf{00} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{01} & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{11} & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{10} & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe minterms (represented by $1$s) are at indices corresponding to binary $(LS A_1 A_0)$:\n$m_5(0101)$, $m_7(0111)$, $m_9(1001)$, $m_{10}(1010)$, $m_{11}(1011)$, $m_{13}(1101)$, $m_{14}(1110)$, $m_{15}(1111)$.\n\nWe identify all prime implicants (PIs) by forming the largest possible rectangular groups of $1$s (with sizes being powers of $2$):\n1.  A group of four $1$s covering minterms $m_9, m_{11}, m_{13}, m_{15}$. For this group, $L=1$, $S$ varies, $A_1$ varies, and $A_0=1$. This gives the prime implicant $P_1 = L A_0$.\n2.  A group of four $1$s covering minterms $m_{10}, m_{11}, m_{14}, m_{15}$. For this group, $L=1$, $S$ varies, $A_1=1$, and $A_0$ varies. This gives the prime implicant $P_2 = L A_1$.\n3.  A group of four $1$s covering minterms $m_5, m_7, m_{13}, m_{15}$. For this group, $L$ varies, $S=1$, $A_1$ varies, and $A_0=1$. This gives the prime implicant $P_3 = S A_0$.\n4.  A group of two $1$s covering minterms $m_{10}, m_{14}$. For this group, $L=1$, $S$ varies, $A_1=1$, and $A_0=0$. This gives the prime implicant $P_4 = L A_1 \\overline{A_0}$.\n\nNext, we identify the essential prime implicants (EPIs), which cover at least one minterm not covered by any other PI.\n- Minterm $m_9 (1001)$ is covered only by $P_1 = L A_0$. Therefore, $L A_0$ is an EPI.\n- Minterm $m_5 (0101)$ is covered only by $P_3 = S A_0$. Therefore, $S A_0$ is an EPI.\n\nThe EPIs $L A_0$ and $S A_0$ must be in our minimal expression. They cover the set of minterms $\\{m_5, m_7, m_9, m_{11}, m_{13}, m_{15}\\}$.\nThe minterms that remain to be covered are $m_{10}$ and $m_{14}$.\nWe must select additional PIs to cover these. We can use either $P_2 = L A_1$ or $P_4 = L A_1 \\overline{A_0}$. Both cover $m_{10}$ and $m_{14}$.\nTo achieve a minimal SOP, we select the PI with the fewest literals.\n- $P_2 = L A_1$ has $2$ literals.\n- $P_4 = L A_1 \\overline{A_0}$ has $3$ literals.\n\nWe choose $P_2 = L A_1$ as it is more minimal.\nThe final minimal SOP expression is the sum of the selected PIs: the two EPIs ($P_1, P_3$) and the selected remaining PI ($P_2$).\n$$M = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = L A_0 + L A_1 + S A_0$$\nThus, the minimal sum-of-products expression for the misalignment signal $M$ is $L A_1 + L A_0 + S A_0$. This confirms that the expression derived from the direct translation of the problem's logic is already in its minimal SOP form.",

A static-1 hazard can occur in a two-level AND-OR logic circuit when an input variable changes, causing a transition between two adjacent minterms for which the function's value is $1$. If these two adjacent minterms are covered by different product terms (AND gates) in the SOP expression, and there is no single product term that covers both minterms, a momentary $1 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow 1$ glitch can appear at the output due to gate delays.
