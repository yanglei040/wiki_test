            "problem": "In digital logic design, universal gates like NAND are fundamental building blocks because any Boolean function can be implemented using only this type of gate. An engineer is tasked with designing a logic module for a comparator circuit. The core of this module is the two-variable Boolean function $F(A, B) = (A \\oplus B)'$, where $\\oplus$ denotes the Exclusive OR (XOR) operation and the prime symbol (') denotes the NOT (inversion) operation. This function $F$ is also known as the XNOR or logical equivalence function.\n\nThe design is constrained to use only 2-input NAND gates. The only available input signals are the direct, uncomplemented variables $A$ and $B$. What is the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates required to implement the function $F(A, B)$?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 6\n\nE. 7",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates required to implement the XNOR function, $F(A, B) = (A \\oplus B)'$, given only the inputs $A$ and $B$. A 2-input NAND gate with inputs $X$ and $Y$ produces the output $(XY)'$.\n\nFirst, let's express the XNOR function in a standard Boolean algebra form. The XOR function is $A \\oplus B = A'B + AB'$. Therefore, the XNOR function is:\n$$F = (A'B + AB')'$$\nUsing De Morgan's laws, we can transform this expression:\n$$F = (A'B)' \\cdot (AB')'$$\n$$F = (A + B') \\cdot (A' + B)$$\nExpanding this product-of-sums form gives:\n$$F = AA' + AB + B'A' + B'B$$\nSince $AA' = 0$ and $B'B = 0$, the expression simplifies to the sum-of-products form for XNOR:\n$$F = AB + A'B'$$\nNow, we need to implement this function, $F = AB + A'B'$, using only 2-input NAND gates.\n\nA common technique to implement a sum-of-products expression is to use a two-level NAND-NAND structure. By applying De Morgan's theorem twice (involution), we can write $F$ as:\n$$F = (F')' = ((AB + A'B')')'$$\nApplying De Morgan's law to the inner term:\n$$F = ((AB)' \\cdot (A'B')')'$$\nThis expression is in a form that can be directly implemented with NAND gates. Let's identify the required operations and count the gates:\n1.  **Calculate $(AB)'$**: This is one NAND gate with inputs $A$ and $B$.\n    *   $G_1 = (A \\cdot B)'$ (1 gate)\n2.  **Calculate $(A'B')'$**: This requires the inputs $A'$ and $B'$. Since only $A$ and $B$ are available, we must first generate their complements. A NOT gate can be created from a NAND gate by tying its inputs together, i.e., $X' = (X \\cdot X)'$.\n    *   $G_2 = (A \\cdot A)' = A'$ (1 gate)\n    *   $G_3 = (B \\cdot B)' = B'$ (1 gate)\n    *   Now, we can calculate $(A'B')'$. This requires a NAND gate with inputs $A'$ (from $G_2$) and $B'$ (from $G_3$).\n    *   $G_4 = (A' \\cdot B')' = ((A \\cdot A)' \\cdot (B \\cdot B)')'$ (1 gate)\n3.  **Calculate the final output**: The final expression is $F = ((AB)' \\cdot (A'B')')'$. This is a NAND operation on the outputs from step 1 ($G_1$) and step 2 ($G_4$).\n    *   $G_5 = (G_1 \\cdot G_4)' = ((A \\cdot B)' \\cdot (A' \\cdot B')')'$ (1 gate)\n\nSumming up the gates used: $G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4, G_5$. This gives a total of 5 gates.\n\nLet's consider another common implementation to verify if 5 is the minimum. It is well-known that the XOR function can be implemented with 4 NAND gates as follows:\n*   $G_a = (A \\cdot B)'$\n*   $G_b = (A \\cdot G_a)' = (A \\cdot (AB)')'$\n*   $G_c = (B \\cdot G_a)' = (B \\cdot (AB)')'$\n*   $Y_{XOR} = (G_b \\cdot G_c)' = ((A \\cdot (AB)')' \\cdot (B \\cdot (AB)')')'$\n\nLet's verify this expression produces XOR:\n$G_b = (A \\cdot (A'+B'))' = (AA' + AB')' = (AB')' = A'+B$\n$G_c = (B \\cdot (A'+B'))' = (BA' + BB')' = (A'B)' = A+B'$\n$Y_{XOR} = ((A'+B)(A+B'))' = (A'A + A'B' + AB + BB')' = (A'B' + AB)'$\nThe term $A'B' + AB$ is the XNOR function. Therefore, $(A'B' + AB)'$ is the XOR function. So, this 4-gate circuit correctly implements XOR.\n\nTo obtain the XNOR function, $F = (A \\oplus B)'$, we must invert the output of the XOR circuit. This requires one additional NAND gate configured as an inverter:\n*   $G_d = (Y_{XOR} \\cdot Y_{XOR})' = (Y_{XOR})'$\n\nThis brings the total number of gates for this implementation to $4 (\\text{for XOR}) + 1 (\\text{for NOT}) = 5$ gates.\n\nBoth optimized methods result in a 5-gate implementation. The 4-gate structure (option B) implements XOR, not XNOR. Therefore, the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates required is 5.",

The Boolean expression for an XNOR gate is $A'B' + AB$.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of two-input NOR gates required to construct a circuit that is functionally equivalent to a single two-input XNOR gate.",
            "solution": "A two-input NOR gate implements the operation $(X + Y)'$. Using this, we construct a four-NOR network (the dual of the standard four-NAND XOR network) that yields the XNOR function and verify it algebraically.\n\nDefine intermediate signals using only two-input NOR gates:\n1. $D = A \\ \\text{NOR} \\ B = (A + B)'$.\n2. $E = A \\ \\text{NOR} \\ D = (A + D)'$.

Final output:\n$$Y = E \\ \\text{NOR} \\ F = (E + F)' = (A' B + A B')'.$$\n\nSince $A \\oplus B = A' B + A B'$, we have $Y = (A \\oplus B)'$, which is precisely the XNOR function. To show the canonical equivalence form explicitly,\n$$(A' B + A B')' = (A' B)' (A B')' = (A + B') (A' + B) = A A' + A B + A' B' + B' B = A B + A' B'.$$\nThus $Y = A B + A' B'$, confirming that four two-input NOR gates suffice.\n\nTo see that fewer than four two-input NOR gates are insufficient, note that realizing $A B + A' B'$ requires availability of both complemented and uncomplemented literals in distinct product terms. Producing $A'$ and $B'$ from $A$ and $B$ requires at least two NOR gates (each used as an inverter via tied inputs), leaving at most one gate for any further combination if the total count were three; a single remaining NOR can only form one complement of an OR, which cannot realize the required sum of two products. Hence, three or fewer two-input NOR gates cannot implement XNOR.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of two-input NOR gates required is four.",

            "introduction": "Having mastered the synthesis of basic logic functions, we now scale up to a fundamental component of a computer's processor: the full adder. This hands-on practice guides you through designing a 1-bit full adder using only NAND gates and then analyzing the performance of a multi-bit adder built from it. By examining the critical concept of carry propagation delay, you will see how low-level gate decisions directly influence the speed of high-level arithmetic operations. ",

            "problem": "A full adder has three Boolean inputs $A$, $B$, and $C_{\\text{in}}$ and produces a sum output $S$ and a carry-out output $C_{\\text{out}}$. You may use only $2$-input NAND gates, and each $2$-input NAND gate has an identical propagation delay $t_g$. Neglect wire delays and loading effects.\n\nTasks:\n- Starting only from the Boolean definition of sum and carry for a full adder and the facts that the NAND gate is functionally complete and De Morgan’s laws hold, derive a realization of a $1$-bit full adder using only $2$-input NAND gates. Your derivation must explicitly produce a NAND-only construction for $C_{\\text{out}}$ and $S$.\n- Construct an $n$-bit Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA) by cascading $n$ copies of your $1$-bit full adder so that $C_i$ is the carry-in to bit $i$ and $C_{i+1}$ is its carry-out.\n- Under the worst-case carry-propagation condition (no carry is generated internally and each stage propagates the incoming carry), determine the worst-case delay from the primary carry-in $C_0$ to the final carry-out $C_n$ of the $n$-bit RCA as a closed-form analytical expression in terms of $n$ and $t_g$.\n\nGive your final answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $n$ and $t_g$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for three tasks: first, to derive a realization of a $1$-bit full adder using only $2$-input NAND gates; second, to describe an $n$-bit Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA) built from these full adders; and third, to determine the worst-case carry propagation delay for this $n$-bit RCA.\n\nThe first step is to establish the Boolean logic for a $1$-bit full adder. A full adder has three inputs, $A$, $B$, and a carry-in $C_{\\text{in}}$, and produces two outputs, a sum $S$ and a carry-out $C_{\\text{out}}$. The standard Boolean expressions are:\n$$S = A \\oplus B \\oplus C_{\\text{in}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{out}} = AB + AC_{\\text{in}} + BC_{\\text{in}}$$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes the Exclusive-OR (XOR) operation.\n\nFor an efficient NAND-only implementation, it is advantageous to find expressions for $S$ and $C_{\\text{out}}$ that share common sub-expressions. We can rewrite the expression for $C_{\\text{out}}$ by factoring:\n$$C_{\\text{out}} = AB + C_{\\text{in}}(A+B)$$\nAnother, more useful, form for shared logic is $C_{\\text{out}} = AB + C_{\\text{in}}(A \\oplus B)$. Let's verify this equivalence:\n$$AB + C_{\\text{in}}(A \\oplus B) = AB + C_{\\text{in}}(A'B + AB') = AB + A'BC_{\\text{in}} + AB'C_{\\text{in}}$$\nThe minterm expansion of the standard expression $AB + AC_{\\text{in}} + BC_{\\text{in}}$ is $ABC'_{in} + ABC_{in} + A'BC_{in} + ABC_{in} + AB'C_{in} + ABC_{in} = ABC'_{in} + A'BC_{in} + AB'C_{in} + ABC_{in}$.\nThe minterm expansion of our factored form is $AB(C_{in}+C'_{in}) + A'BC_{in} + AB'C_{in} = ABC_{in} + ABC'_{in} + A'BC_{in} + AB'C_{in}$.\nThe two expressions are logically equivalent. Thus, we will work with the following set of equations, which share the term $A \\oplus B$:\n$$S = (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C_{\\text{in}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{out}} = AB + C_{\\text{in}}(A \\oplus B)$$\n\nNext, we derive a $2$-input XOR gate using only $2$-input NAND gates. The expression for $X \\oplus Y$ is $X'Y + XY'$. This can be implemented with $4$ NAND gates as follows:\n$$X \\oplus Y = ((XY')'(X'Y)')'$$\nLet's find the NAND expressions for the inner terms. The most efficient realization is based on the structure $X \\oplus Y = ((X(XY)')' (Y(XY)')')'$.\nLet $G_1 = (X \\cdot Y)'$.\nThen $G_2 = (X \\cdot G_1)' = (X \\cdot (XY)')' = (X(X'+Y'))' = (XY')'$.\nAnd $G_3 = (Y \\cdot G_1)' = (Y \\cdot (XY)')' = (Y(X'+Y'))' = (X'Y)'$.\nThe final output is $G_4 = (G_2 \\cdot G_3)' = ((XY')' \\cdot (X'Y)')' = XY' + X'Y = X \\oplus Y$.\nThis confirms that a $2$-input XOR function can be built from $4$ two-input NAND gates.\n\nNow, we construct the full adder. Let $H = A \\oplus B$.\nUsing the $4$-gate XOR structure, we can compute $H$:\n1. $N_1 = (A \\cdot B)'$\n2. $N_2 = (A \\cdot N_1)'$\n3. $N_3 = (B \\cdot N_1)'$\n4. $H = (N_2 \\cdot N_3)'$\n\nThe sum output is $S = H \\oplus C_{\\text{in}}$. We use a second $4$-gate XOR structure to compute $S$:\n5. $N_5 = (H \\cdot C_{\\text{in}})'$\n6. $N_6 = (H \\cdot N_5)'$\n7. $N_7 = (C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot N_5)'$\n8. $S = (N_6 \\cdot N_7)'$\n\nThe sum output $S$ is the output of the $8$-th NAND gate in this sequence.\n\nFor the carry-out, $C_{\\text{out}} = AB + C_{\\text{in}}H$. Using De Morgan's laws, any sum-of-products can be converted to a NAND-NAND structure: $X+Y = ((X')'(Y')') = ((X')'(Y')')'' = (X'Y')'$. Let's apply this:\n$$C_{\\text{out}} = ((AB)' \\cdot (C_{\\text{in}}H)')'$$\nWe observe that the required terms have already been computed as intermediate signals in our logic for $S$:\nThe term $(AB)'$ is the output of the first gate, $N_1$.\nThe term $(C_{\\text{in}}H)'$ is the output of the fifth gate, $N_5$.\nTherefore, $C_{\\text{out}}$ can be computed with one additional NAND gate:\n9. $C_{\\text{out}} = (N_1 \\cdot N_5)'$\n\nThis completes the derivation of a $1$-bit full adder using $9$ two-input NAND gates. $S$ is the output of gate $8$, and $C_{\\text{out}}$ is the output of gate $9$.\n\nThe second task is to construct an $n$-bit Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA). This is achieved by cascading $n$ instances of the $1$-bit full adder (FA) circuit derived above. Let the $i$-th stage be $FA_i$, for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. $FA_i$ takes inputs $A_i$, $B_i$, and a carry-in $C_i$. It produces outputs $S_i$ and a carry-out $C_{i+1}$. The cascading is done by connecting the carry-out of one stage to the carry-in of the next stage: the output $C_{i+1}$ from $FA_i$ becomes the input $C_{in}$ for $FA_{i+1}$. The primary inputs to the RCA are the two $n$-bit numbers $A=A_{n-1}...A_0$ and $B=B_{n-1}...B_0$, and the initial carry-in $C_0$. The outputs are the $n$-bit sum $S=S_{n-1}...S_0$ and the final carry-out $C_n$.\n\nThe third task is to determine the worst-case delay from the primary carry-in $C_0$ to the final carry-out $C_n$. This delay is the time it takes for a change in $C_0$ to propagate through the entire chain of $n$ full adders. The total delay is the sum of the carry propagation delays of each stage. We must find the delay from $C_{\\text{in}}$ to $C_{\\text{out}}$ for a single full adder, which we denote as $T_{C_{\\text{in}} \\to C_{\\text{out}}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies the worst-case carry-propagation condition, where inputs $A_i$ and $B_i$ are stable and set such that the carry is propagated, not generated locally. This corresponds to $A_i \\oplus B_i = 1$. When analyzing the delay from $C_i$ to $C_{i+1}$, we assume $A_i$ and $B_i$ are stable.\n\nLet's trace the signal path from $C_i$ to $C_{i+1}$ in our $9$-gate full adder design for stage $i$.\nThe expression for the carry-out of stage $i$ is $C_{i+1} = (N_{1,i} \\cdot N_{5,i})'$.\nThe inputs to this final NAND gate are $N_{1,i} = (A_i \\cdot B_i)'$ and $N_{5,i} = (H_i \\cdot C_i)'$, where $H_i = A_i \\oplus B_i$.\n\nSince we assume $A_i$ and $B_i$ are stable, any signal that depends only on them is also stable. This includes:\n- $N_{1,i} = (A_i \\cdot B_i)'$\n- $H_i = A_i \\oplus B_i$ (which is the output of a 4-gate sub-circuit depending on $A_i, B_i$).\n\nA change in the carry-in signal $C_i$ affects the following gates in the path to $C_{i+1}$:\n1. The signal $C_i$ is an input to gate $N_{5,i} = (H_i \\cdot C_i)'$. The other input, $H_i$, is stable. A change in $C_i$ will propagate through this NAND gate, and the output $N_{5,i}$ will become stable after one gate delay, $t_g$.\n2. The now-changed output $N_{5,i}$ is an input to the final carry gate, which computes $C_{i+1} = (N_{1,i} \\cdot N_{5,i})'$. The other input to this gate, $N_{1,i}$, is stable. The change in $N_{5,i}$ will propagate through this gate, and the final output $C_{i+1}$ will become stable after another gate delay, $t_g$.\n\nThe critical path for the carry to propagate through one stage is $C_i \\to N_{5,i} \\to C_{i+1}$. This path traverses two NAND gates. Therefore, the carry propagation delay for a single stage is:\n$$T_{C_i \\to C_{i+1}} = t_g + t_g = 2t_g$$\n\nFor an $n$-bit RCA, the total worst-case delay from $C_0$ to $C_n$ is the sum of the delays through the $n$ stages in the ripple chain:\n$$T_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} T_{C_i \\to C_{i+1}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2t_g = n \\cdot (2t_g)$$\nThe resulting closed-form analytical expression for the delay is $2nt_g$.",
