This problem challenges you to think like a system architect by analyzing a common hardware task: detecting if an entire data bus is zero. By deriving the POS representation for an 'all-zero' detect signal and analyzing its complexity, you will uncover the critical trade-offs between a theoretically complete representation and a practical, scalable hardware implementation.

            "problem": "Consider an $n$-bit data bus with Boolean lines $\\{x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1}\\}$, where $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $+$ denotes Boolean logical disjunction (OR), while $\\cdot$ denotes Boolean logical conjunction (AND). The system requires a single-cycle “all-zero” detect signal $Z$ that asserts $Z = 1$ if and only if the bus value is the all-zero vector, and otherwise $Z = 0$. In a typical datapath, an “any-one” detect is implemented as the logical OR-reduction of the bus, namely $A = x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}$, so that “all-zero” detect can be obtained as the logical complement $Z = \\overline{A}$. Using only the foundational Boolean algebra identities (including De Morgan’s laws) and the canonical-form definitions, reason from first principles to express $Z$ in Product-of-Sums (POS) form by complementing the Sum-of-Products (SOP) “any-one” OR-reduction, and then analyze the degree of expansion required for a canonical POS representation of $Z$ (in terms of the number of maxterms and the number of literals per maxterm). Finally, justify when and why a POS implementation may be inefficient in a bus-level design compared to directly using a single $n$-input NOR gate that computes $Z$.\n\nWhich option correctly states the POS representation and the expansion analysis?\n\nA. $Z$ equals the product of complements, $Z = \\displaystyle\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\overline{x_i}$, which is a POS with one literal per sum. The canonical Product-of-Sums uses $\\left(2^n - 1\\right)$ maxterms, each containing $n$ literals, since $Z = 0$ for all input assignments except the all-zero vector.

Express $Z$ in Product-of-Sums (POS) form by complementing the \"any-one\" OR-reduction.\n    2. Analyze the degree of expansion for a canonical POS representation of $Z$ in terms of the number of maxterms and literals per maxterm.\n    3. Justify the inefficiency of a POS implementation compared to a single $n$-input NOR gate.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is rooted in fundamental principles of Boolean algebra and digital logic design, which are core to computer organization and architecture. All definitions, such as SOP/POS forms, canonical forms, maxterms, and NOR gates, are standard and correct.\n- **Posedness and Consistency**: The problem is well-posed. The function $Z$ is unambiguously defined. The relationship $Z = \\overline{A}$ is consistent with the definitions of \"all-zero\" and \"any-one\" detection. The questions asked have unique, derivable answers based on these definitions.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity**: The language is precise and uses standard technical terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution can be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**1. Expressing $Z$ in POS Form**\n\nThe \"any-one\" detect signal $A$ is given as the OR-reduction of the bus lines:\n$$A = x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i$$\nThis expression is a sum of literals, which is a standard Sum-of-Products (SOP) form, albeit a simple one where each product term consists of a single literal.\n\nThe \"all-zero\" detect signal $Z$ is the complement of $A$:\n$$Z = \\overline{A} = \\overline{x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}}$$\n\nTo convert this into a Product-of-Sums (POS) form, we apply De Morgan’s laws. De Morgan's law for disjunction states that $\\overline{P+Q} = \\overline{P} \\cdot \\overline{Q}$. Applying this law iteratively to the expression for $Z$:\n$$Z = \\overline{x_0} \\cdot \\overline{x_1} \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot \\overline{x_{n-1}} = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\overline{x_i}$$\nThis resulting expression is a product of terms, where each term is a sum of literals (in this specific case, a sum containing only one literal, $\\overline{x_i}$). Therefore, this is a valid, minimal POS representation of the function $Z$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Canonical POS Representation**\n\nA canonical POS form of a function is the product of all maxterms for which the function's output is $0$.\n\nAn $n$-variable maxterm is a sum of all $n$ variables, with each variable being either in its true form ($x_i$) or complemented form ($\\overline{x_i}$). Each maxterm evaluates to $0$ for exactly one unique input combination.\n\nThe function $Z$ is defined to be $1$ only for the single input combination where all inputs are zero: $(x_{n-1}, \\ldots, x_0) = (0, \\ldots, 0)$.\nFor all other $2^n - 1$ input combinations, the function $Z$ evaluates to $0$.\n\nTherefore, the canonical POS representation of $Z$ must be the logical product (AND) of the $2^n - 1$ maxterms corresponding to these input combinations.\n- The number of maxterms in the canonical POS form is $2^n - 1$.\n- Each maxterm for an $n$-variable function contains exactly $n$ literals.\n\nFor example, for $n=3$, $Z=1$ only for $(x_2, x_1, x_0) = (0,0,0)$. $Z=0$ for the other $7$ combinations. The canonical POS form would be the product of $7$ maxterms:\n$Z = (x_2+x_1+\\overline{x_0}) \\cdot (x_2+\\overline{x_1}+x_0) \\cdot (x_2+\\overline{x_1}+\\overline{x_0}) \\cdot (\\overline{x_2}+x_1+x_0) \\cdot \\ldots$\n\nThe size of this canonical form, determined by the number of maxterms ($2^n - 1$), grows exponentially with the number of bits $n$.\n\n**3. Efficiency Comparison**\n\nThe problem asks to compare the efficiency of a POS implementation with a single $n$-input NOR gate.\n\n- **Canonical POS Implementation**: Implementing the canonical POS form requires a circuit that computes the AND of $2^n - 1$ terms, where each term is an OR of $n$ literals. The size and complexity of such a circuit grow exponentially with $n$, making it extremely inefficient and impractical for even moderately large $n$.\n\n- **Direct NOR Gate Implementation**: The function for $Z$ was derived as $Z = \\overline{x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}}$. This is precisely the definition of an $n$-input NOR gate. A single $n$-input NOR gate implements this function directly. The physical implementation of such a gate typically scales much more favorably with $n$ (linearly or sub-linearly in terms of transistor count) compared to the exponential growth of the canonical POS implementation.\n\nTherefore, implementing the canonical POS representation is grossly inefficient compared to using a single, dedicated $n$-input NOR gate. Even the minimal POS form, $Z = \\prod \\overline{x_i}$, which is logically equivalent to the NOR gate, would be implemented as $n$ inverters followed by an $n$-input AND gate. While better than the canonical form, a direct NOR gate is generally a more compact and faster primitive component. The key point of comparison is the exponential blow-up of the canonical form.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $Z$ equals the product of complements, $Z = \\displaystyle\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\overline{x_i}$, which is a POS with one literal per sum. The canonical Product-of-Sums uses $\\left(2^n - 1\\right)$ maxterms, each containing $n$ literals, since $Z = 0$ for all input assignments except the all-zero vector. Therefore, canonical POS grows exponentially in $n$, and implementing it is inefficient relative to a single $n$-input NOR that computes $Z = \\overline{x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}}$.**\nThis option is entirely correct.\n- The expression $Z = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\overline{x_i}$ is correctly derived via De Morgan's law.\n- It correctly identifies this as a POS form.\n- It correctly states that the canonical POS form has $2^n - 1$ maxterms.\n- It correctly states that each maxterm has $n$ literals.\n- It provides the correct reasoning for the number of maxterms (i.e., $Z=0$ for all but one input combination).\n- It correctly concludes that this exponential growth makes the canonical POS implementation inefficient compared to a single $n$-input NOR gate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $Z$ equals the sum of complements, $Z = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\overline{x_i}$, which is a POS and requires only $n$ maxterms in canonical form. Hence, POS is more efficient than an $n$-input NOR for “all-zero” detect.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n- The expression for $Z$ is wrong. $Z$ is a product of complements, not a sum. $\\sum \\overline{x_i}$ is the function $\\overline{\\prod x_i}$ (NAND), not $\\overline{\\sum x_i}$ (NOR).\n- The expression shown, $\\sum \\overline{x_i}$, is a Sum-of-Products (SOP), not a Product-of-Sums (POS).\n- The canonical POS form for $Z$ has $2^n - 1$ maxterms, not $n$.\n- The conclusion that POS is more efficient is based on these false premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The minimal POS is $Z = \\displaystyle\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\left(x_i + \\overline{x_i}\\right)$, and the canonical POS has $\\left(n\\right)$ maxterms with $\\left(n-1\\right)$ literals each. Thus, POS avoids exponential blow-up.**\nThis option contains several fundamental errors.\n- The expression $x_i + \\overline{x_i}$ is a tautology, always evaluating to $1$. The product of these terms would be $1$, which is not the function $Z$.\n- The canonical POS has $2^n - 1$ maxterms, not $n$.\n- A maxterm for an $n$-variable function contains $n$ literals, not $n-1$.\n- The conclusion that exponential blow-up is avoided is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. De Morgan’s law implies $Z = \\displaystyle\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i$, and the canonical POS requires $\\left(2^n\\right)$ maxterms. Consequently, the POS is only mildly larger than the NOR implementation and remains efficient for large $n$.**\nThis option is also incorrect.\n- The expression for $Z$ is wrong. $Z = \\prod \\overline{x_i}$, not $\\prod x_i$. The expression $\\prod x_i$ is the AND-reduction, which is $1$ only when all inputs are $1$.\n- A function cannot have $2^n$ maxterms unless it is the constant $0$ function, which is not the case here. The correct count is $2^n - 1$.\n- The conclusion about efficiency is false; the canonical form grows exponentially and is highly inefficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The binary inputs are in the order $\\langle A,B,C \\rangle$.

The map is populated with $1$s at the positions corresponding to the minterms in the $1$-set. The K-map for $f(A,B,C)$ is as follows, with $A$ as the row variable and $BC$ as the column variables:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{c|cccc}  BC    \\\\ A  00  01  11  10 \\\\ \\hline 0  0  0  1_{m_3}  1_{m_2} \\\\ 1  0  1_{m_5}  1_{m_7}  0 \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nWe group adjacent $1$s to form prime implicants.\n1.  A group of two $1$s is formed by $m_2(\\bar{A}B\\bar{C})$ and $m_3(\\bar{A}BC)$. In the K-map, these are the cells $(A=0, BC=10)$ and $(A=0, BC=11)$. They are adjacent. The variable $A$ is $0$ ($\\bar{A}$) and $B$ is $1$ ($B$), while $C$ changes. This group gives the prime implicant $\\bar{A}B$.\n2.  A second group of two $1$s is formed by $m_5(A\\bar{B}C)$ and $m_7(ABC)$. In the K-map, these are the cells $(A=1, BC=01)$ and $(A=1, BC=11)$. They are adjacent. The variable $A$ is $1$ ($A$) and $C$ is $1$ ($C$), while $B$ changes. This group gives the prime implicant $AC$.\n\nThese two prime implicants, $\\bar{A}B$ and $AC$, cover all the $1$s in the K-map. Thus, the minimal SOP expression for $f$ is the sum of these prime implicants.\nFinal minimal SOP expression: $f(A,B,C) = \\bar{A}B + AC$.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal Product-of-Sums (POS) Expression for $f(A,B,C)$**\n\nTo find the minimal POS expression for $f$, we can find the minimal SOP expression for its complement, $\\bar{f}$, and then apply De Morgan's laws.\nThe $0$-set of $f$ is the set of minterm indices where $f$ is $0$. This is the complement of the $1$-set, so the $0$-set is $\\{0, 1, 4, 6\\}$.\nThe function $\\bar{f}$ can be written as the sum of these minterms:\n$$ \\bar{f}(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 4, 6) $$\nThe K-map for $\\bar{f}$ is:\n$$ \\begin{array}{c|cccc}  BC    \\\\ A  00  01  11  10 \\\\ \\hline 0  1_{m_0}  1_{m_1}  0  0 \\\\ 1  1_{m_4}  0  0  1_{m_6} \\\\ \\end{array} $$\nWe group the $1$s in the K-map for $\\bar{f}$:\n1.  A group of two $1$s is formed by $m_0(\\bar{A}\\bar{B}\\bar{C})$ and $m_1(\\bar{A}\\bar{B}C)$. This corresponds to the term $\\bar{A}\\bar{B}$.\n2.  A group of two $1$s is formed by $m_4(A\\bar{B}\\bar{C})$ and $m_6(AB\\bar{C})$. This corresponds to the term $A\\bar{C}$.\nThe minimal SOP for $\\bar{f}$ is $\\bar{f}(A,B,C) = \\bar{A}\\bar{B} + A\\bar{C}$. Note that the consensus term, $\\bar{B}\\bar{C}$ (from grouping $m_0$ and $m_4$), is redundant and thus omitted for a minimal expression.\n\nNow, we obtain $f$ by complementing $\\bar{f}$ and applying De Morgan's laws:\n$$ f(A,B,C) = \\overline{\\bar{f}(A,B,C)} = \\overline{\\bar{A}\\bar{B} + A\\bar{C}} = (\\overline{\\bar{A}\\bar{B}}) \\cdot (\\overline{A\\bar{C}}) = (A+B)(\\bar{A}+C) $$\nFinal minimal POS expression: $f(A,B,C) = (A+B)(\\bar{A}+C)$.\n\n**Part 3: Hazard Analysis**\n\nWe need to determine which implementation of $R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\overline{f}$ is less prone to negative-going spurious pulses ($1 \\to 0 \\to 1$) when $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ should remain high. A $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ glitch is a static-1 hazard. The condition \"when $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ should remain high\" means we are analyzing transitions where $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ starts and ends at logic $1$. This corresponds to transitions where $f$ starts and ends at logic $0$.\n\nLet's analyze the two implementation paths for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$:\n- **Path 1**: Implement $f$ as minimal SOP and then invert.\n  $$ R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\overline{f_{SOP}} = \\overline{\\bar{A}B + AC} $$\n  Applying De Morgan's laws, we get:\n  $$ R_{\\mathrm{n}} = (A+\\bar{B})(\\bar{A}+\\bar{C}) $$\n  This is a Product-of-Sums (POS) realization for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$, typically implemented with a two-level OR-AND logic structure. According to hazard theory, OR-AND circuits are susceptible to static-0 hazards but are inherently free from static-1 hazards.\n\n- **Path 2**: Implement $f$ as minimal POS and then invert.\n  $$ R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\overline{f_{POS}} = \\overline{(A+B)(\\bar{A}+C)} $$\n  Applying De Morgan's laws, we get:\n  $$ R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\overline{(A+B)} + \\overline{(\\bar{A}+C)} = \\bar{A}\\bar{B} + A\\bar{C} $$\n  This is a Sum-of-Products (SOP) realization for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$, typically implemented with a two-level AND-OR logic structure. AND-OR circuits are susceptible to static-1 hazards.\n\nA static-1 hazard can occur in a SOP implementation if two adjacent minterms (which are $1$s on the K-map) are not covered by the same prime implicant. The problem states there is reconvergent fanout on $A$, making transitions involving a change in $A$ susceptible to hazards.\n\nLet's examine the K-map for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$. The $1$-set of $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is the $0$-set of $f$, which is $\\{0, 1, 4, 6\\}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{n}}(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 4, 6) $$\nThe K-map for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is identical to the K-map for $\\bar{f}$ we drew in Part 2. The minimal SOP expression is $R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\bar{A}\\bar{B} + A\\bar{C}$, which is exactly the expression from Path 2.\n\nConsider a transition where $A$ changes from $0$ to $1$ while $B=0$ and $C=0$. The input changes from $(0,0,0)$ to $(1,0,0)$.\n- At $(0,0,0)$, $R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\bar{0}\\bar{0} + 0\\bar{0} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1$.\n- At $(1,0,0)$, $R_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\bar{1}\\bar{0} + 1\\bar{0} = 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe output $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ should remain high at $1$.\nThe minterms for this transition are $m_0$ and $m_4$. On the K-map for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$, $m_0$ is covered by the prime implicant $\\bar{A}\\bar{B}$, while $m_4$ is covered by the prime implicant $A\\bar{C}$. Since these two adjacent $1$s are not covered by a common prime implicant, a static-1 hazard exists. Due to the delay in inverting $A$ to get $\\bar{A}$, for a moment both terms $\\bar{A}\\bar{B}$ and $A\\bar{C}$ can evaluate to $0$, causing $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ to glitch to $0$.\n\nThe implementation from Path 1, which results in a POS form for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$, is not susceptible to this static-1 hazard. Therefore, Path 1 is the less hazard-prone realization for the specified requirement.\n\n**Part 4: Indicator Value $I$**\n\nThe indicator $I$ is defined as:\n$I=1$ if the path “minimal SOP for $f$ then invert to obtain $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$” is less hazard-prone.\n$I=0$ otherwise.\n\nOur analysis in Part 3 concluded that this path (Path 1) yields a POS circuit for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ that is free of static-1 hazards, whereas the alternative path (Path 2) yields a SOP circuit for $R_{\\mathrm{n}}$ that exhibits a static-1 hazard.\nTherefore, the first path is less prone to the specified hazard.\nThis means $I=1$.",
