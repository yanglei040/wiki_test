            "problem": "A synchronous shared bus is driven by identical tri-state output drivers. When enabled and driving a logic high, each driver can be modeled by a Thevenin equivalent consisting of an ideal voltage source of value $V_{OH,\\min}$ in series with an output resistance $R_{out}$. When enabled and driving a logic low, each driver can be modeled by an ideal voltage source of value $V_{OL,\\max}$ in series with the same $R_{out}$. Only one driver is enabled at a time. The bus is loaded by $N$ receiving devices whose combined worst-case static load is captured by a single equivalent current source of magnitude $I_{load}$ connected between the bus node and a reference rail as follows: in the driven-high state the load draws a current of magnitude $I_{load}$ from the bus toward ground, while in the driven-low state the load sources a current of the same magnitude $I_{load}$ from the supply toward the bus.\n\nYou are given the following guaranteed parameters for the driver and receivers:\n- Minimum high-level open-circuit output voltage $V_{OH,\\min} = 3.0 \\text{ V}$.\n- Maximum low-level open-circuit output voltage $V_{OL,\\max} = 0.12 \\text{ V}$.\n- Output resistance $R_{out} = 14.7 \\, \\Omega$.\n- Worst-case static load current magnitude $I_{load} = 0.016 \\text{ A}$.\n- Receiver minimum high-level input threshold $V_{IH,\\min} = 2.30 \\text{ V}$.\n- Receiver maximum low-level input threshold $V_{IL,\\max} = 1.00 \\text{ V}$.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s laws, Ohm’s law, and the Thevenin equivalent model described above, derive expressions for the worst-case direct current bus voltage $V_{bus}$ in the driven-high and driven-low states under the specified loading, then evaluate them numerically.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in fundamental circuit theory (Kirchhoff’s laws, Ohm’s law), uses standard and appropriate models for digital logic components (Thevenin equivalents for drivers, current source for loads), is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. A unique, meaningful solution can be derived through formal analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the worst-case DC bus voltage levels, $V_{bus}$, for a shared bus system in two states: driven-high and driven-low. This is a classic signal integrity analysis to determine if logic-level requirements are met under specified loading conditions.\n\n**Analysis of the Driven-High State**\n\nIn the driven-high state, a single tri-state driver is enabled and asserts a logic high. According to the problem, this driver can be modeled as a Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of an ideal voltage source of value $V_{OH,\\min}$ in series with an output resistance $R_{out}$. The bus itself is loaded by a set of receivers, whose combined effect is modeled as a single current source of magnitude $I_{load}$ drawing current from the bus node toward ground. This represents the worst-case scenario, as the minimum guaranteed driver output voltage ($V_{OH,\\min}$) is used, and the load current acts to pull the bus voltage down.\n\nLet $V_{bus,\\text{high}}$ be the voltage at the bus node. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at this node, the current supplied by the driver must equal the current drawn by the load. The current supplied by the driver, flowing through its output resistance $R_{out}$, is given by Ohm's Law:\n$$I_{driver} = \\frac{V_{OH,\\min} - V_{bus,\\text{high}}}{R_{out}}$$\nThe load current is given as $I_{load}$. Setting the currents equal as per KCL:\n$$\\frac{V_{OH,\\min} - V_{bus,\\text{high}}}{R_{out}} = I_{load}$$\nWe can now solve this equation for $V_{bus,\\text{high}}$:\n$$V_{OH,\\min} - V_{bus,\\text{high}} = I_{load} R_{out}$$\n$$V_{bus,\\text{high}} = V_{OH,\\min} - I_{load} R_{out}$$\n\n**Analysis of the Driven-Low State**\n\nIn the driven-low state, a single driver asserts a logic low. This driver is modeled as a Thevenin equivalent with an ideal voltage source of value $V_{OL,\\max}$ in series with the same output resistance $R_{out}$. The load in this state sources a current of magnitude $I_{load}$ from the supply toward the bus node. This represents the worst-case scenario for a logic low, as the maximum guaranteed driver output voltage ($V_{OL,\\max}$) is used, and the load current acts to pull the bus voltage up.\n\nLet $V_{bus,\\text{low}}$ be the voltage at the bus node. Applying KCL at this node, the current sourced by the load must be sunk by the driver. The current being sunk by the driver is:\n$$I_{driver} = \\frac{V_{bus,\\text{low}} - V_{OL,\\max}}{R_{out}}$$\nThe load current is given as $I_{load}$. Equating the currents:\n$$I_{load} = \\frac{V_{bus,\\text{low}} - V_{OL,\\max}}{R_{out}}$$\nSolving for $V_{bus,\\text{low}}$:\n$$I_{load} R_{out} = V_{bus,\\text{low}} - V_{OL,\\max}$$\n$$V_{bus,\\text{low}} = V_{OL,\\max} + I_{load} R_{out}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $V_{OH,\\min} = 3.0$ V\n- $V_{OL,\\max} = 0.12$ V\n- $R_{out} = 14.7$ $\\Omega$\n- $I_{load} = 0.016$ A\n- $V_{IH,\\min} = 2.30$ V\n- $V_{IL,\\max} = 1.00$ V\n\nFirst, let's calculate the voltage drop (for the high state) or rise (for the low state) across the driver's output resistance due to the load current. This term is $I_{load} R_{out}$:\n$$I_{load} R_{out} = (0.016)(14.7) = 0.2352 \\text{ V}$$\nNow we can compute the bus voltages. For the driven-high state:\n$$V_{bus,\\text{high}} = V_{OH,\\min} - I_{load} R_{out} = 3.0 - 0.2352 = 2.7648 \\text{ V}$$\nFor the driven-low state:\n$$V_{bus,\\text{low}} = V_{OL,\\max} + I_{load} R_{out} = 0.12 + 0.2352 = 0.3552 \\text{ V}$$\n\n**Verification of Logic Levels**\n\nTo ensure reliable operation, the calculated worst-case bus voltages must satisfy the receiver's input thresholds.\nFor a logic high, the condition is $V_{bus,\\text{high}} \\ge V_{IH,\\min}$.\n$$2.7648 \\text{ V} \\ge 2.30 \\text{ V}$$\nThis condition is satisfied. The high-level noise margin is $V_{NH} = V_{bus,\\text{high}} - V_{IH,\\min} = 2.7648 - 2.30 = 0.4648$ V.\n\nFor a logic low, the condition is $V_{bus,\\text{low}} \\le V_{IL,\\max}$.\n$$0.3552 \\text{ V} \\le 1.00 \\text{ V}$$\nThis condition is also satisfied. The low-level noise margin is $V_{NL} = V_{IL,\\max} - V_{bus,\\text{low}} = 1.00 - 0.3552 = 0.6448$ V.\nSince both conditions are met, the system will function correctly under the specified worst-case static loading.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(V_{bus,\\text{high}},\\,V_{bus,\\text{low}})$ with values rounded to four significant figures.\n$V_{bus,\\text{high}} = 2.7648$ V. Rounded to four significant figures, this becomes $2.765$ V.\n$V_{bus,\\text{low}} = 0.3552$ V. This value already has four significant figures.\nThe resulting ordered pair is $(2.765, 0.3552)$.",

A momentary, unintended de-assertion of an active $OE$ signal—a 'glitch' caused by a logic hazard—can lead to bus contention, where multiple devices attempt to drive the bus simultaneously, potentially causing permanent damage.

            "problem": "A synchronous Central Processing Unit (CPU) reads from a shared tri-state data bus. The data bus is driven by memory-mapped devices whose outputs are gated by an Output Enable (OE) signal and connected via tri-state buffers. The OE for a device must be generated from the following four binary inputs: $A$, $S$, $D$, and $R$, where $A$ denotes a high-order address region select ($A=1$ if the current address is in the device’s primary region, $A=0$ otherwise), $S$ denotes a sub-block selector derived from lower-order address bits, $D$ denotes a dynamic mirror-enable for the device’s shadow region, and $R$ denotes the read control ($R=1$ if the CPU is in a read cycle and expects the device to drive the bus). All signals use positive logic.\n\nThe device specification is:\n- During read cycles ($R=1$), the device shall drive the bus if either the primary region and the required sub-block are selected ($A=1$ and $S=1$), irrespective of $D$, or the shadow region is enabled while the primary region is not selected ($A=0$ and $D=1$), irrespective of $S$.\n- During non-read cycles ($R=0$), the device shall not drive the bus.\n\nAssume the address and control signals may change without a guaranteed phase relationship, but individual input changes are single-bit transitions dominated by gate propagation delays consistent with combinational hazards. To prevent bus contention caused by transient misassertion of OE, the OE logic must be hazard-free for any single-variable input change.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using a Karnaugh map (K-map) for the four-variable function $O(A,S,D,R)$ that encodes the above behavior, derive the minimal sum-of-products expression for $O$.\n2. Considering bus contention modeled as a static-$1$ hazard when $A$ transitions between $0$ and $1$ while $S=1$, $D=1$, and $R=1$, redesign the OE logic to be hazard-free for single-variable input changes by adding appropriate consensus terms. Use the consensus theorem, but do not assume any specific gate delays beyond the existence of nonzero propagation delay.\n3. Provide the final hazard-free Boolean expression for $O$ in closed form using only the variables $A$, $S$, $D$, and $R$ and standard Boolean operators. Your final answer must be a single analytical expression. No rounding is required, and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is formally sound and well-posed within the discipline of digital logic design and computer architecture. It describes a realistic scenario of designing interface logic for a memory-mapped peripheral on a shared bus, where preventing bus contention caused by logic hazards is a critical design requirement. All provided information is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to derive a hazard-free Boolean expression for the Output Enable (OE) signal, which we denote as the function $O(A,S,D,R)$. The function's behavior is specified by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we translate the English-language specification into a Boolean algebraic expression.\nThe device must not drive the bus during non-read cycles, which means the output $O$ must be $0$ when the read control signal $R$ is $0$. This implies that $R$ is a necessary component of any term in the sum-of-products (SOP) expression for $O$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $O(A,S,D,R) = R \\cdot f(A,S,D)$ for some function $f$.\n\nDuring read cycles ($R=1$), the device drives the bus ($O=1$) under two conditions:\n1. The primary region and the required sub-block are selected, which corresponds to $A=1$ and $S=1$. This gives the term $A \\cdot S$.\n2. The shadow region is enabled while the primary region is not selected, which corresponds to $D=1$ and $A=0$. This gives the term $\\bar{A} \\cdot D$.\n\nCombining these two conditions with an OR operation, the behavior for $R=1$ is $A \\cdot S + \\bar{A} \\cdot D$.\nIncorporating the dependency on $R$, the complete Boolean expression for the output is:\n$$O(A,S,D,R) = R \\cdot (A \\cdot S + \\bar{A} \\cdot D)$$\nExpanding this into a sum-of-products form, we get:\n$$O(A,S,D,R) = A \\cdot S \\cdot R + \\bar{A} \\cdot D \\cdot R$$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Minimal Sum-of-Products Expression**\n\nTo confirm if this expression is minimal, we utilize a four-variable Karnaugh map (K-map). We assign the variables $A$ and $S$ to the rows and $D$ and $R$ to the columns, following the Gray code ordering ($00, 01, 11, 10$). The minterms for which $O=1$ are derived from the two product terms:\n- From $A \\cdot S \\cdot R$: This term is $1$ when $A=1, S=1, R=1$. $D$ can be $0$ or $1$. This corresponds to minterms $m_{13}$ ($1101_2$) and $m_{15}$ ($1111_2$).\n- From $\\bar{A} \\cdot D \\cdot R$: This term is $1$ when $A=0, D=1, R=1$. $S$ can be $0$ or $1$. This corresponds to minterms $m_3$ ($0011_2$) and $m_7$ ($0111_2$).\n\nThe resulting K-map for $O(A,S,D,R)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n\\text{AS} \\setminus \\text{DR}  00  01  11  10 \\\\\n\\hline\n00  0  0  1_{m_3}  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n01  0  0  1_{m_7}  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n11  0  1_{m_{13}}  1_{m_{15}}  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n10  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWe form groups of adjacent $1$s to find the prime implicants:\n- A group of two $1$s covers minterms $m_3$ and $m_7$. For this group, $A=0$, $D=1$, $R=1$, while $S$ varies. The corresponding prime implicant is $\\bar{A}DR$.\n- A group of two $1$s covers minterms $m_{13}$ and $m_{15}$. For this group, $A=1$, $S=1$, $R=1$, while $D$ varies. The corresponding prime implicant is $ASR$.\n\nBoth of these prime implicants are essential, as $m_3$ and $m_7$ are uniquely covered by $\\bar{A}DR$, and $m_{13}$ is uniquely covered by $ASR$. The minimal sum-of-products expression is the sum of all essential prime implicants.\n$$O_{min}(A,S,D,R) = ASR + \\bar{A}DR$$\n\n**2. Hazard Analysis and Redesign for Hazard-Free Operation**\n\nA static-1 hazard may occur in an SOP circuit when a single input variable changes, causing the output to momentarily go to $0$ when it should remain at $1$. This happens if two adjacent $1$s in the K-map are covered by different product terms.\n\nThe problem specifies examining the transition of $A$ between $0$ and $1$ while $S=1$, $D=1$, and $R=1$.\n- When $A=0$, $S=1$, $D=1$, $R=1$: The input combination is $0111_2$, corresponding to minterm $m_7$. The output is $O = (0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) = 1$. The term $\\bar{A}DR$ evaluates to $1$.\n- When $A=1$, $S=1$, $D=1$, $R=1$: The input combination is $1111_2$, corresponding to minterm $m_{15}$. The output is $O = (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) = 1$. The term $ASR$ evaluates to $1$.\n\nIn the K-map, minterms $m_7$ and $m_{15}$ are adjacent. However, $m_7$ is covered by the implicant $\\bar{A}DR$, and $m_{15}$ is covered by the implicant $ASR$. Because they are covered by different terms, a hazard exists. When $A$ transitions from $0$ to $1$, the term $\\bar{A}DR$ turns off. Due to gate propagation delays, the term $ASR$ may not yet have turned on. During this transient interval, both terms can be $0$, causing a glitch where the output $O$ momentarily drops to $0$. This could cause bus contention.\n\nTo eliminate this hazard, we add a consensus term that covers the hazardous transition. The consensus theorem states that for an expression of the form $XY + \\bar{X}Z$, the consensus term is $YZ$. The hazard-free form is $XY + \\bar{X}Z + YZ$.\nOur two product terms creating the hazard are $P_1 = ASR$ and $P_2 = \\bar{A}DR$.\nLet's apply the consensus theorem:\n- The variable that appears in both complemented and uncomplemented form is $A$.\n- The remaining literals in $P_1$ form the product $SR$.\n- The remaining literals in $P_2$ form the product $DR$.\nThe consensus term is the product of these remaining parts: $(SR) \\cdot (DR) = SDRR = SDR$.\n\nBy adding this logically redundant term $SDR$ to the minimal SOP expression, we create a new product term that remains high during the entire transition of $A$ (given $S=D=R=1$), thus holding the output $O$ at a stable $1$. This new term corresponds to a grouping of minterms $m_7$ and $m_{15}$ on the K-map.\n\n**3. Final Hazard-Free Boolean Expression**\n\nThe final hazard-free expression for the Output Enable signal $O$ is the sum of the original prime implicants and the consensus term derived above. This ensures that every pair of adjacent $1$s in the K-map is covered by a common product term, eliminating all static-1 hazards for single-variable input changes.\n\nThe hazard-free expression is:\n$$O_{hf}(A,S,D,R) = ASR + \\bar{A}DR + SDR$$\nThis expression guarantees that the OE signal will not be de-asserted incorrectly due to combinational hazards during single-bit address or control signal changes, thereby preventing bus contention.",

The system comprises a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a synchronous static random-access memory (SRAM) device, and a Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller sharing a single $32$-bit data bus. Only one device may actively drive the data bus at a time; inactive devices must place their outputs in the high-impedance state, denoted $Z$. Each device’s drivers are controlled by an Output Enable (OE) signal. When $OE$ is asserted, the device eventually drives the bus after a finite enable delay; when $OE$ is deasserted, the device eventually releases the bus to $Z$ after a finite disable delay. To ensure scientific realism and safe bus operation, there must be a nonzero bus turn-around guard time wherein the bus remains at $Z$ after one driver releases it and before the next driver begins to drive it. All components are clocked synchronously with clock period $T$.\n\nAssume the following organization and timing parameters:\n- The CPU executes a five-stage pipeline with stages Fetch ($F$), Decode ($D$), Execute ($E$), Memory ($M$), and Writeback ($W$), each of duration $T$. All data bus activity initiated by the CPU occurs during the $M$ stage.\n- On a memory read, the memory device asserts its $OE$ at the start of the CPU’s $M$ stage and deasserts at the end of that $M$ stage. The memory’s data outputs begin driving the bus after a delay of $t_{\\text{enMEM}}$ following assertion and cease driving after a delay of $t_{\\text{disMEM}}$ following deassertion.\n- On a CPU write, the CPU’s data drivers assert $OE$ at the start of the CPU’s $M$ stage and deassert at the end of that $M$ stage. The CPU begins driving after $t_{\\text{enCPU}}$ following assertion and fully releases after $t_{\\text{disCPU}}$ following deassertion.\n- The DMA controller performs bus transfers in a single-cycle bus stage, aligned to the system clock. It asserts $OE$ at the start of its bus stage and deasserts at the end. The DMA begins driving after $t_{\\text{enDMA}}$ following assertion and releases after $t_{\\text{disDMA}}$ following deassertion.\n- The required bus turn-around guard time is $t_{\\text{TA}}$, which must be satisfied as a window in which the bus is held at $Z$ between the time the previous driver actually stops driving and the time the next driver actually begins driving.\n\nYou are to construct a test scenario that exercises changes in bus ownership among the memory, CPU, and DMA, and then determine the minimum number of full clock cycles that the data bus must be held at $Z$ during each turn-around to guarantee no contention while satisfying $t_{\\text{TA}}$.

No rounding is required beyond the inherent integer nature of cycle counts. No units should be included in the final answer box.",
            "solution": "The problem requires determining the minimum number of idle clock cycles, $N$, that must be inserted between consecutive bus owners to guarantee safe bus operation. Safe operation is defined by the absence of bus contention and the satisfaction of a minimum bus turn-around guard time, $t_{\\text{TA}}$.\n\nLet us establish a formal timing model. The system operates on a synchronous clock with period $T$. A clock cycle $k$ begins at time $t = kT$ and ends at time $t = (k+1)T$.\n\nConsider a general transition of bus ownership from a device denoted \"Prev\" to a device denoted \"Next\". According to the problem description, the device \"Prev\" is allocated the bus for one clock cycle, say cycle $k$. Its Output Enable signal, $OE_{\\text{Prev}}$, is asserted at the beginning of this cycle, $t=kT$, and deasserted at the end, $t=(k+1)T$.\n\nThe problem states that there is a disable delay, $t_{\\text{disPrev}}$, between the deassertion of $OE_{\\text{Prev}}$ and the moment the device's drivers actually release the bus into the high-impedance state ($Z$). Therefore, the bus is fully released by the \"Prev\" device at time $t_{\\text{release,Prev}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{release,Prev}} = (k+1)T + t_{\\text{disPrev}}$$\n\nAfter the cycle in which \"Prev\" owns the bus, $N$ idle clock cycles are inserted. This means the bus is not allocated to any device during cycles $k+1, k+2, \\dots, k+N$. The next bus owner, \"Next\", is scheduled to use the bus during cycle $k+N+1$.\n\nThe $OE_{\\text{Next}}$ signal for the \"Next\" device is asserted at the beginning of its allocated cycle, which is at time $t=(k+N+1)T$. There is an enable delay, $t_{\\text{enNext}}$, between the assertion of $OE_{\\text{Next}}$ and the moment the device's drivers actually begin to drive the bus. Thus, the \"Next\" device begins driving the bus at time $t_{\\text{drive,Next}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{drive,Next}} = (k+N+1)T + t_{\\text{enNext}}$$\n\nTo prevent bus contention, the \"Prev\" device must have stopped driving the bus before the \"Next\" device begins. The interval between these two events is the bus turn-around guard time, $t_{\\text{guard}}$. This interval must be at least $t_{\\text{TA}}$.\n$$t_{\\text{guard}} = t_{\\text{drive,Next}} - t_{\\text{release,Prev}} \\ge t_{\\text{TA}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{\\text{release,Prev}}$ and $t_{\\text{drive,Next}}$ into this inequality gives:\n$$((k+N+1)T + t_{\\text{enNext}}) - ((k+1)T + t_{\\text{disPrev}}) \\ge t_{\\text{TA}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression to derive a constraint on $N$. The term $kT$ cancels out:\n$$(N+1)T - T + t_{\\text{enNext}} - t_{\\text{disPrev}} \\ge t_{\\text{TA}}$$\n$$NT + t_{\\text{enNext}} - t_{\\text{disPrev}} \\ge t_{\\text{TA}}$$\n\nSolving for $N$, we obtain the general formula for the minimum number of idle cycles required for a transition from any device \"Prev\" to any device \"Next\":\n$$NT \\ge t_{\\text{TA}} + t_{\\text{disPrev}} - t_{\\text{enNext}}$$\n$$N \\ge \\frac{t_{\\text{TA}} + t_{\\text{disPrev}} - t_{\\text{enNext}}}{T}$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this constraint for all four bus ownership transition scenarios specified in the problem, using the provided timing constants:\n- $T = 2\\,\\text{ns}$\n- $t_{\\text{TA}} = 0.6\\,\\text{ns}$\n- Memory delays: $t_{\\text{enMEM}} = 1.8\\,\\text{ns}$, $t_{\\text{disMEM}} = 3.0\\,\\text{ns}$\n- CPU delays: $t_{\\text{enCPU}} = 1.1\\,\\text{ns}$, $t_{\\text{disCPU}} = 1.6\\,\\text{ns}$\n- DMA delays: $t_{\\text{enDMA}} = 1.7\\,\\text{ns}$, $t_{\\text{disDMA}} = 1.5\\,\\text{ns}$\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n1.  **Memory to CPU (MEM $\\rightarrow$ CPU)**\n    Here, Prev = MEM and Next = CPU.\n    $t_{\\text{disPrev}} = t_{\\text{disMEM}} = 3.0\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $t_{\\text{enNext}} = t_{\\text{enCPU}} = 1.1\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $$N \\ge \\frac{0.6 + 3.0 - 1.1}{2} = \\frac{2.5}{2} = 1.25$$\n\n2.  **Memory to DMA (MEM $\\rightarrow$ DMA)**\n    Here, Prev = MEM and Next = DMA.\n    $t_{\\text{disPrev}} = t_{\\text{disMEM}} = 3.0\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $t_{\\text{enNext}} = t_{\\text{enDMA}} = 1.7\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $$N \\ge \\frac{0.6 + 3.0 - 1.7}{2} = \\frac{1.9}{2} = 0.95$$\n\n3.  **DMA to CPU (DMA $\\rightarrow$ CPU)**\n    Here, Prev = DMA and Next = CPU.\n    $t_{\\text{disPrev}} = t_{\\text{disDMA}} = 1.5\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $t_{\\text{enNext}} = t_{\\text{enCPU}} = 1.1\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $$N \\ge \\frac{0.6 + 1.5 - 1.1}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5$$\n\n4.  **CPU to Memory (CPU $\\rightarrow$ MEM)**\n    Here, Prev = CPU and Next = MEM.\n    $t_{\\text{disPrev}} = t_{\\text{disCPU}} = 1.6\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $t_{\\text{enNext}} = t_{\\text{enMEM}} = 1.8\\,\\text{ns}$\n    $$N \\ge \\frac{0.6 + 1.6 - 1.8}{2} = \\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$$\n\nWe have four conditions on $N$: $N \\ge 1.25$, $N \\ge 0.95$, $N \\ge 0.5$, and $N \\ge 0.2$. To ensure that the guard time constraint is met for all possible transitions, $N$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these lower bounds.\n$$N \\ge \\max(1.25, 0.95, 0.5, 0.2)$$\n$$N \\ge 1.25$$\n\nSince $N$ represents a number of full clock cycles, it must be an integer. The smallest integer value of $N$ that satisfies the condition $N \\ge 1.25$ is $2$. This value of $N$ guarantees that even in the worst-case timing scenario (Memory to CPU transition), the bus turn-around guard time constraint is satisfied.\nTherefore, a minimum of $2$ idle cycles must be inserted between any two consecutive bus accesses to ensure no bus contention.",
