            "introduction": "The fundamental purpose of a demultiplexer (DEMUX) is to act as a data router, channeling a single input to one of many outputs. This exercise solidifies your understanding of this core principle by asking you to determine the exact input conditions—for both the select lines and the data line—needed to activate a specific output. Mastering this is the first step toward using demultiplexers effectively in any digital circuit .",

            "problem": "A digital control system is designed to manage a linear array of eight special-purpose Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), indexed from $L_0$ to $L_7$. The system employs a single 1-to-8 demultiplexer (DEMUX) to achieve this control. A DEMUX is a digital circuit that routes a single input line to one of several output lines.\n\nThis specific DEMUX has one data input line, denoted as $D_{in}$, three select lines, $S_2, S_1, S_0$, and eight output lines, $Y_0$ through $Y_7$. Each output line $Y_i$ is connected to the corresponding LED $L_i$. An LED will illuminate if and only if its connected DEMUX output is at a logic '1' state; otherwise, it remains off (logic '0').\n\nThe functionality of the DEMUX is as follows: the three select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$ are interpreted as a 3-bit binary number, where $S_2$ is the most significant bit (MSB) and $S_0$ is the least significant bit (LSB). If the decimal equivalent of the binary number $S_2S_1S_0$ is $k$, then the output line $Y_k$ is set to the logic level of the data input, $D_{in}$. All other output lines $Y_j$ (where $j \\neq k$) are maintained at a logic '0' state, regardless of the value of $D_{in}$.\n\nTo perform a specific diagnostic test, the control system must illuminate only the LED labeled $L_6$, ensuring all other seven LEDs remain off. To achieve this state, what must be the logic levels for the data input $D_{in}$ and the select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$?\n\nA.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\n\nB.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=0, S_0=1$\n\nC.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\n\nD.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$\n\nE.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the state of the data input ($D_{in}$) and the three select lines ($S_2, S_1, S_0$) for a 1-to-8 demultiplexer (DEMUX) to make output $Y_6$ equal to logic '1' while all other outputs are logic '0'.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for the outputs. To illuminate only LED $L_6$, we need the output line $Y_6$ to be at logic '1'. To keep all other LEDs off, we need all other output lines ($Y_0, Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, Y_4, Y_5, Y_7$) to be at logic '0'.\n\nThe DEMUX's operation is defined by its select lines. The select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$ form a 3-bit binary number whose decimal value selects which output line will be connected to the data input $D_{in}$. All other outputs are automatically set to '0'.\n\nTo affect the output line $Y_6$, we must select it. This means the decimal value of the binary number formed by the select lines must be 6. We need to find the 3-bit binary representation of the decimal number 6.\n\nThe select lines are given with $S_2$ as the most significant bit (MSB) and $S_0$ as the least significant bit (LSB). The value is calculated as $S_2 \\times 2^2 + S_1 \\times 2^1 + S_0 \\times 2^0$.\nTo get a value of 6, we can express it in terms of powers of 2:\n$6 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0$.\n\nComparing this with the weighted sum of the select lines, we can determine the required logic levels:\n$S_2 = 1$\n$S_1 = 1$\n$S_0 = 0$\n\nSo, the select lines must be set to $S_2S_1S_0 = 110$.\n\nWith these select line settings, the DEMUX ensures that output $Y_6$ is connected to the data input $D_{in}$, so $Y_6 = D_{in}$. It also ensures that all other outputs $Y_j$ (for $j \\neq 6$) are set to logic '0'. This satisfies the condition that all other LEDs are off.\n\nNow, we must satisfy the condition that LED $L_6$ is on. This requires $Y_6$ to be logic '1'. Since $Y_6 = D_{in}$ with our chosen select lines, we must set the data input to logic '1'.\nTherefore, $D_{in} = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the required input configuration is:\n$D_{in}=1$, $S_2=1$, $S_1=1$, and $S_0=0$.\n\nWe now compare this result with the given multiple-choice options.\nA.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\nB.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=0, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_5$)\nC.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$ (selects $Y_6$ but sets it to 0, so $L_6$ is off)\nD.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_3$)\nE.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_3$ but sets it to 0)\n\nThe correct configuration matches option A.",
