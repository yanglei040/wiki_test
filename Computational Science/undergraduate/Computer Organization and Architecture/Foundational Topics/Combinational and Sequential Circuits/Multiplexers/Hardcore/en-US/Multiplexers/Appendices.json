This first practice  grounds our understanding by having you derive the specific logical expression for a 4-to-1 MUX with fixed inputs. By working through this, you'll see exactly how the select lines gate the data inputs to produce the final output, solidifying the core principle of multiplexing.",

            "problem": "A 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) is a digital logic circuit that selects one of four data input lines and forwards it to a single output line. The selection is controlled by a 2-bit binary address.\n\nConsider a 4-to-1 MUX with two select lines, $B$ and $A$, and four data inputs, $D_0, D_1, D_2, D_3$. The select input $B$ is the most significant bit (MSB), and $A$ is the least significant bit (LSB). When the select lines $BA$ form the binary equivalent of an integer $i$, the data input $D_i$ is selected. The data inputs are connected to a third variable, $C$, and constant logic levels as follows: $D_0 = C$, $D_1 = \\bar{C}$, $D_2 = 1$ (logic high), and $D_3 = 0$ (logic low). The overbar notation (e.g., $\\bar{C}$) represents the logical NOT operation.\n\nDetermine the simplified Boolean expression for the output $F$ in terms of the inputs $A, B,$ and $C$.",
