This exercise explores the timing of such a system, where a fast-changing inner counter enables a slower outer counter. The core principle is analyzing how the \"carry\" signal propagates between counters, as this inter-counter path often becomes the bottleneck that limits the entire system's speed. By calculating the maximum clock frequency for this lexicographic sequence generator , you will practice identifying the critical path in a modular, synchronous design.",

            "problem": "A computing system must generate a lexicographic sequence of tuples $(i,j)$ in hardware using synchronous counters, where $j$ is the inner (fastest changing) counter and $i$ is the outer (slower changing) counter. The sequence advances one tuple per clock cycle through $j = 0, 1, \\dots, 7$ for each fixed $i$, and when $j$ rolls from $7$ to $0$ on the next clock, $i$ increments by one. When $i$ rolls from $9$ to $0$ concurrently with $j$ rolling from $7$ to $0$, the sequence restarts at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe design uses two binary counters implemented with synchronous combinational next-state logic feeding D-type flip-flops (DFFs). The inner counter $j$ is a $3$-bit synchronous up-counter with a binary incrementer. The outer counter $i$ is a $4$-bit synchronous up-counter with a binary incrementer, enabled only when a terminal-count detector asserts a signal indicating $j=7$. The terminal-count detector for $j=7$ is a three-input logic block that asserts if and only if all three bits of $j$ are $1$. The enable for the $i$ counter is the logical conjunction of the terminal-count detector output and a global enable signal that is always asserted. All elements are clocked synchronously by a single global clock. Assume zero clock skew and that hold-time constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet the following worst-case propagation and setup parameters hold:\n- The clock-to-$Q$ delay of the $j$-counter DFFs is $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The worst-case propagation delay of the $j$-counter binary incrementer is $t_{\\mathrm{inc},j} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The setup time of the $j$-counter DFFs is $t_{\\mathrm{setup},j} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The worst-case propagation delay of the terminal-count detector $j=7$ is $t_{\\mathrm{cmp}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The worst-case propagation delay of the enable gating feeding the $i$-counter is $t_{\\mathrm{gate}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The worst-case propagation delay of the $i$-counter binary incrementer is $t_{\\mathrm{inc},i} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n- The setup time of the $i$-counter DFFs is $t_{\\mathrm{setup},i} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nUsing first principles about synchronous sequential circuit timing, determine the maximum clock frequency $f_{\\max}$ for which the counters can operate reliably to produce the correct lexicographic sequence, considering the critical paths in both counters. Express the final frequency in $\\mathrm{MHz}$, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the maximum operating clock frequency, $f_{\\max}$, for a synchronous digital system composed of two cascaded counters. The maximum frequency is the reciprocal of the minimum clock period, $T_{\\min}$, which is dictated by the critical path of the circuit.\n\nThe fundamental timing constraint for any path in a synchronous sequential circuit is that the clock period, $T$, must be greater than or equal to the sum of the clock-to-Q delay ($t_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$) of the source flip-flop, the worst-case propagation delay of the combinational logic path ($t_{\\mathrm{comb}}$), and the setup time ($t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$) of the destination flip-flop.\n$$T \\ge t_{\\mathrm{CQ}} + t_{\\mathrm{comb}} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\nTo find $T_{\\min}$, we must identify all relevant paths in the circuit and calculate their required minimum periods. The overall $T_{\\min}$ for the system will be the maximum of these individual path-required periods.\n\nThe system consists of two counters, $i$ and $j$. We must analyze the timing paths within each counter and between the counters.\n\nPath 1: The internal feedback loop of the inner counter, $j$.\nThe counter $j$ is a $3$-bit synchronous up-counter that increments on every clock cycle. The next state of the $j$ counter, $D_j$, depends only on its current state, $Q_j$. The signal path originates from the outputs of the $j$-counter's D-type flip-flops (DFFs), propagates through the binary incrementer logic, and must arrive at the inputs of the same DFFs meeting the setup time requirement.\nThe combinational logic delay for this path is the propagation delay of the $j$-counter's incrementer, $t_{\\mathrm{comb}(j \\to j)} = t_{\\mathrm{inc},j}$.\nThe minimum period required for this path, $T_{j \\to j}$, is:\n$$T_{j \\to j} = t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j} + t_{\\mathrm{inc},j} + t_{\\mathrm{setup},j}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{j \\to j} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.45\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.08\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nPath 2: The path from the inner counter ($j$) to the outer counter ($i$).\nThe outer counter, $i$, increments only when it is enabled by the condition $j=7$. This creates a signal path that starts at the $j$-counter's DFFs and ends at the $i$-counter's DFFs. This path is often the critical one in cascaded counter designs. The sequence of events within one clock cycle for this path is as follows:\n1. After a clock edge, the output of the $j$-counter DFFs, $Q_j$, becomes stable. This takes $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j}$.\n2. The value of $Q_j$ is processed by the terminal-count detector to check if $j=7$. The propagation delay for this is $t_{\\mathrm{cmp}}$.\n3. The detector's output propagates through the enable gating logic. The delay is $t_{\\mathrm{gate}}$.\n4. The resulting enable signal is fed to the $i$-counter's binary incrementer logic. This logic computes the next state of $i$. The problem states the delay for the incrementer is $t_{\\mathrm{inc},i}$. This implies a serial chain of delays where the enable signal must resolve before the incrementer's output is valid.\n5. The final computed next state for $i$, $D_i$, must arrive at the inputs of the $i$-counter's DFFs and be stable for the duration of the setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup},i}$, before the next clock edge.\n\nThe total combinational logic delay for this inter-counter path is the sum of the delays of the components in the chain: $t_{\\mathrm{comb}(j \\to i)} = t_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + t_{\\mathrm{gate}} + t_{\\mathrm{inc},i}$.\nThe minimum period required for this path, $T_{j \\to i}$, is therefore:\n$$T_{j \\to i} = t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j} + t_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + t_{\\mathrm{gate}} + t_{\\mathrm{inc},i} + t_{\\mathrm{setup},i}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{j \\to i} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.55\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 1.07\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nThere also exists a feedback path within the $i$-counter itself ($Q_i \\to D_i$). The delay for this path would be $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},i} + t_{\\mathrm{inc},i} + t_{\\mathrm{setup},i}$. Although $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},i}$ is not provided, the logic of the problem's construction points to the inter-counter path being critical. The path generating the enable signal from counter $j$ involves several logic stages ($t_{\\mathrm{cmp}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{gate}}$) before the signal even reaches the $i$-counter's logic. The time for this enable signal to propagate from the clock edge to the $i$-counter's logic is $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j} + t_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + t_{\\mathrm{gate}} = 0.12 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.42\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. Assuming a reasonable value for $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},i}$ (e.g., comparable to $t_{\\mathrm{CQ},j} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns}$), the enable signal from $j$ is the last-arriving input to the $i$-counter's next-state logic, confirming that the path starting from $j$ is the critical one for updating $i$.\n\nTo ensure reliable operation of the entire system, the clock period $T$ must be greater than or equal to the delay of all paths. Thus, the minimum clock period $T_{\\min}$ is the maximum of the individual path delays.\n$$T_{\\min} = \\max(T_{j \\to j}, T_{j \\to i})$$\n$$T_{\\min} = \\max(0.65\\,\\mathrm{ns}, 1.07\\,\\mathrm{ns}) = 1.07\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nThe maximum clock frequency $f_{\\max}$ is the reciprocal of the minimum clock period:\n$$f_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\min}} = \\frac{1}{1.07\\,\\mathrm{ns}} = \\frac{1}{1.07 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 934579439.25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nConverting to megahertz ($\\mathrm{MHz}$):\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 934.57943925\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 934.6\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$",

This frequency is limited by the timing constraints of the digital logic, specifically the setup and hold times of the D-type flip-flops (DFFs) used in its construction. We must analyze the critical timing paths to find the minimum clock period, $T_{\\min}$, from which $f_{\\max}$ is derived as $f_{\\max} = 1/T_{\\min}$.\n\nThe analysis involves two fundamental timing requirements for synchronous sequential circuits.\n\nFirst, the setup time requirement ensures that the data at a flip-flop's input is stable for a minimum duration, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, before the active clock edge arrives. For a data path between a launching flip-flop and a capturing flip-flop, the clock period $T$ must be long enough to accommodate the clock-to-Q delay of the launching flip-flop, the propagation delay of the combinational logic between them, and the setup time of the capturing flip-flop. Clock skew, $t_{\\mathrm{skew}}$, which is the variation in clock arrival times at different flip-flops, must also be considered. The problem specifies that for setup analysis, the capturing clock arrives earlier, which is the worst-case scenario as it reduces the available time for data propagation. This leads to the setup time constraint:\n$$T \\ge t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,max}} + t_{\\mathrm{logic,max}} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}} + t_{\\mathrm{skew}}$$\nwhere $t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,max}}$ is the maximum clock-to-Q delay, and $t_{\\mathrm{logic,max}}$ is the maximum delay of the combinational logic path. The minimum clock period, $T_{\\min}$, is determined by the path with the largest sum on the right-hand side.\n\nSecond, the hold time requirement ensures that the data at a flip-flop's input remains stable for a minimum duration, $t_{\\mathrm{hold}}$, after the active clock edge. This prevents the new data from the current cycle from propagating too quickly and corrupting the input of the next stage during its hold window. The condition is that the sum of the minimum clock-to-Q delay, $t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,min}}$, and the minimum logic path delay, $t_{\\mathrm{logic,min}}$, must be greater than or equal to the hold time. The problem specifies that for hold analysis, the capturing clock arrives later, which is the worst-case scenario as it increases the chance of a hold violation. The skew is therefore added to the hold time requirement:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,min}} + t_{\\mathrm{logic,min}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{hold}} + t_{\\mathrm{skew}}$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for all paths. Unlike the setup constraint, a hold violation cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period.\n\nWe will now apply these principles to the specified paths in the BCD counter.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,max}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,min}} = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{hold}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{skew}} = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{gate,max}} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{gate,min}} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{ns}$\n\n**Setup Time Analysis (to determine $T_{\\min}$)**\n\nWe must analyze the longest delay paths to find the overall minimum clock period.\n\n1.  **LSD to LSD path**: This path is internal to the least significant digit's counter.

The longest logic path consists of $6$ gate levels.\n    The maximum logic delay for this path is:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{logic,max,LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} = 6 \\times t_{\\mathrm{gate,max}} = 6 \\times 0.12\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n    The minimum clock period required for this path, $T_{\\mathrm{LSD\\rightarrow MSD}}$, is:\n    $$T_{\\mathrm{LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,max}} + t_{\\mathrm{logic,max,LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}} + t_{\\mathrm{skew}}$$\n    $$T_{\\mathrm{LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} \\ge 0.30\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.72\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.04\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 1.26\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nThe minimum clock period for the entire system, $T_{\\min}$, must satisfy the requirements of all paths.

There is no hold violation on this path.\n\n2.  **LSD to MSD path**: The shortest logic path consists of $4$ gate levels.\n    The minimum logic delay for this path is:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{logic,min,LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} = 4 \\times t_{\\mathrm{gate,min}} = 4 \\times 0.06\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 0.24\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n    We check the hold condition:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{clk\\rightarrow Q,min}} + t_{\\mathrm{logic,min,LSD\\rightarrow MSD}} \\ge t_{\\mathrm{hold}} + t_{\\mathrm{skew}}$$\n    $$0.18\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.24\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\ge 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ns} + 0.04\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n    $$0.42\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\ge 0.14\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\n    The condition is satisfied. There is no hold violation on this path.\n\nSince both setup and hold requirements are satisfied, with the former dictating the minimum clock period, we can now calculate the maximum clock frequency.\n\n**Maximum Clock Frequency Calculation**\n\nThe maximum clock frequency $f_{\\max}$ is the reciprocal of the minimum clock period $T_{\\min}$:\n$$f_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\min}} = \\frac{1}{1.26\\,\\mathrm{ns}} = \\frac{1}{1.26 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 793.65079...\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 793.65079...\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result in $\\mathrm{MHz}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 793.7\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$",
