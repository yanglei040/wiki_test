All components (flip-flops, counters, Gray codes) and concepts are well-established. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem specifies the state variables, the control input, the desired state transitions for both modes of operation, and the type of flip-flops to be used. This information is sufficient to uniquely determine the required logic functions for the flip-flop inputs. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous technical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information and contains no internal contradictions.

This table lists every possible combination of the current state ($Q_1$, $Q_0$) and the control input ($U$), and specifies the corresponding next state ($Q_1^+$, $Q_0^+$).\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n-   For $U=1$ (Up): $00 \\rightarrow 01 \\rightarrow 11 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 00$.\n-   For $U=0$ (Down): $00 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 11 \\rightarrow 01 \\rightarrow 00$.\n\nThe excitation equation for a $T$ flip-flop determines the input $T$ required to achieve a transition from state $Q$ to $Q^+$.
