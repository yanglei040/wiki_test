Maximum Allowable Delay for Flip-Flop Boundary ($d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff}}$)**\n\nFor a pipeline stage between two positive-edge-triggered D-type flip-flops (a launching flip-flop FF1 and a capturing flip-flop FF2), the setup time constraint dictates the maximum delay of the combinational logic. The signal launched by FF1 on a clock edge must propagate through the combinational logic and arrive at the input of FF2, where it must be stable for a duration of at least the setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, before the next clock edge arrives at FF2.\n\nThe total clock period is $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$. The path starts at a clock edge (let's say at $t=0$). The data appears at the output of FF1 after the clock-to-Q delay, $t_{\\mathrm{clk-q}}$. It then traverses the combinational logic, taking a time $d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff}}$. The total time taken is $t_{\\mathrm{clk-q}} + d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff}}$. This signal must arrive at FF2's input no later than $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$ before the next clock edge at $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$. Furthermore, any timing uncertainty, $t_{\\mathrm{uncert}}$ (due to clock skew and jitter), reduces the usable portion of the clock cycle.\n\nThe governing timing equation is therefore:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clk-q}} + d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff}} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}} \\le T_{\\mathrm{clk}} - t_{\\mathrm{uncert}}$$\nSolving for the maximum allowable combinational delay, $d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff,max}}$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff,max}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} - t_{\\mathrm{clk-q}} - t_{\\mathrm{setup}} - t_{\\mathrm{uncert}}$$\nSubstituting the given values for the flip-flop based design:\n- Clock period, $T_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 2.0 \\text{ ns}$\n- Clock-to-Q delay, $t_{\\mathrm{clk-q}} = 0.10 \\text{ ns}$\n- Setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 0.05 \\text{ ns}$\n- Aggregate timing uncertainty, $t_{\\mathrm{uncert}} = 0.08 \\text{ ns}$\n\n$$d_{\\mathrm{comb,ff,max}} = 2.0 - 0.10 - 0.05 - 0.08 = 1.77 \\text{ ns}$$\n\n**2. Maximum Allowable Delay for Latch-Based Boundary ($d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch}}$)**\n\nIn the latch-based design, the boundary consists of a high-phase latch (L1) followed by a low-phase latch (L2). This architecture allows for \"time borrowing,\" where a long combinational path can use a time budget that spans across the transparent phases of both latches.\n\nThe critical path for setup time analysis extends from the data input of L1, through L1's internal delay, through the combinational logic, to the data input of L2, where it must meet the setup time requirement before L2 closes.\n\nLet the start of the cycle be $t=0$.\n- L1 (high-phase) is transparent from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.96 \\text{ ns}$.\n- L2 (low-phase) is transparent from $t=T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g = 0.97 \\text{ ns}$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}} = 1.99 \\text{ ns}$.\n\nThe total time available for the signal to propagate from the input of L1 to be captured by L2 spans from the beginning of the high phase to the end of the low phase. We must account for all overheads within this window.\n\nLet's establish the worst-case timeline for the setup constraint:\n- The clock signal enabling L1 (the launching latch) may be delayed, causing a late opening. This pushes the launch time forward. The latest launch time for the signal at the output of L1 occurs at $t = t_{\\mathrm{uncert,open}} + t_{\\mathrm{clk-q,latch}}$, assuming data is ready at L1's input at the start of the cycle.\n- The signal then propagates through the combinational logic, taking a time $d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch}}$.\n- The arrival time at the input of L2 is $T_{\\mathrm{arrival}} = t_{\\mathrm{uncert,open}} + t_{\\mathrm{clk-q,latch}} + d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch}}$.\n- The clock signal disabling L2 (the capturing latch) may arrive early, shortening the available time. The effective closing time of L2 is $(T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}}) - t_{\\mathrm{uncert,close}}$.\n- To satisfy the setup constraint, the signal must be stable at L2's input at least $t_{\\mathrm{setup,latch}}$ before this early closing.\n- The required arrival time is $T_{\\mathrm{required}} = (T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}}) - t_{\\mathrm{uncert,close}} - t_{\\mathrm{setup,latch}}$.\n\nThe timing constraint is $T_{\\mathrm{arrival}} \\le T_{\\mathrm{required}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{uncert,open}} + t_{\\mathrm{clk-q,latch}} + d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch}} \\le (T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}}) - t_{\\mathrm{uncert,close}} - t_{\\mathrm{setup,latch}}$$\nSolving for the maximum allowable combinational delay, $d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch,max}}$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch,max}} = (T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}}) - t_{\\mathrm{clk-q,latch}} - t_{\\mathrm{setup,latch}} - t_{\\mathrm{uncert,open}} - t_{\\mathrm{uncert,close}}$$\nSubstituting the given values for the latch-based design:\n- High-phase transparency, $T_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.96 \\text{ ns}$\n- Non-overlap gap, $g = 0.01 \\text{ ns}$\n- Low-phase transparency, $T_{\\mathrm{L}} = 1.02 \\text{ ns}$\n- Latch clock-to-Q delay, $t_{\\mathrm{clk-q,latch}} = 0.02 \\text{ ns}$\n- Latch setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup,latch}} = 0.04 \\text{ ns}$\n- Late opening uncertainty, $t_{\\mathrm{uncert,open}} = 0.02 \\text{ ns}$\n- Early closing uncertainty, $t_{\\mathrm{uncert,close}} = 0.02 \\text{ ns}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total time window: $T_{\\mathrm{H}} + g + T_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.96 + 0.01 + 1.02 = 1.99 \\text{ ns}$.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{comb,latch,max}} = 1.99 - 0.02 - 0.04 - 0.02 - 0.02 = 1.89 \\text{ ns}$$\n\n**3.

The active-high source latch is transparent when CLK is high, and the active-low destination latch is transparent when CLK is low. Assume perfect complementary phases without intentional non-overlap. There is clock skew between the source and destination latch clocks: the destination latch clock transitions occur a fixed time $s$ later than the source latch clock transitions (positive $s$ means the destination phase lags the source phase).

Subsequently, the minimum feasible clock period, $T_{\\min}$, must be computed for a given set of parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish a precise timeline of events based on the problem description. Let us define the time reference $t=0$ as the moment the rising edge of the main clock, CLK, arrives at the source latch, L1. The clock has a period $T$ and a duty cycle $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **Source Latch (L1) Timing**:\n    L1 is an active-high latch. It is transparent when its clock input is high. Based on our time reference, its clock is high during the interval $[nT, nT + \\alpha T]$ for any integer cycle number $n$.\n    - L1 opens (becomes transparent) at times $t = nT$.\n    - L1 closes (becomes opaque) at times $t = nT + \\alpha T$.\n\n2.  **Destination Latch (L2) Timing**:\n    L2 is an active-low latch, and the problem states it is transparent \"when CLK is low\". This defines its functional behavior. The duration of the low phase of CLK is $(1-\\alpha)T$.\n    There is a clock skew $s$, where the destination latch clock transitions occur a time $s$ later than the source latch clock transitions. Since $s$ is positive, the clock events at L2 are delayed.\n    - The CLK falling edge, which initiates the low phase, occurs at $t = nT + \\alpha T$ at L1. It arrives at L2 at $t = nT + \\alpha T + s$. This is when L2 opens.\n    - The CLK rising edge, which ends the low phase, occurs at $t = (n+1)T$ at L1. It arrives at L2 at $t = (n+1)T + s$. This is when L2 closes and latches the data.\n    - Therefore, for a given cycle $n$, L2's transparent window is $[nT + \\alpha T + s, (n+1)T + s]$.\n\nWith the timing of both latches established, we can derive the two fundamental timing constraints: the setup time constraint and the hold time constraint for the destination latch L2. We will analyze the data path for a single cycle of operation, considering $n=0$.\n\n**Setup Time Constraint**\n\nThe setup time constraint ensures that the data signal at the input of L2 is stable for at least a duration $t_{\\text{setup}}$ *before* L2 closes.\n- L2 closes at the end of its transparent window, at time $t_{\\text{close}} = T + s$.\n- The data must be stable at L2's input no later than $t_{\\text{close}} - t_{\\text{setup}} = (T + s) - t_{\\text{setup}}$.\n- Now, we must determine the latest possible arrival time of the data at L2's input. The data path originates from L1. Since L1 is a transparent latch, its output (the input to the combinational logic) can change throughout its transparent phase, $[0, \\alpha T]$. The latest a stable data value is launched into the combinational logic is at the moment L1 closes, at $t = \\alpha T$.\n- This signal then propagates through the combinational logic, which has a maximum delay of $d_{\\max}$.\n- Therefore, the latest arrival time of the data at the input of L2 is $t_{\\text{arrival,max}} = \\alpha T + d_{\\max}$.\n- To satisfy the setup requirement, the latest arrival must occur on or before the required setup time:\n$$ \\alpha T + d_{\\max} \\le (T + s) - t_{\\text{setup}} $$\n- We rearrange this inequality to solve for the clock period $T$:\n$$ d_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - s \\le T - \\alpha T $$\n$$ d_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - s \\le T(1 - \\alpha) $$\n- This gives the first constraint on $T$:\n$$ T \\ge \\frac{d_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - s}{1 - \\alpha} $$\n\n**Hold Time Constraint**\n\nThe hold time constraint ensures that the data signal at the input of L2 remains stable for at least a duration $t_{\\text{hold}}$ *after* L2 closes.\n- L2 closes at $t_{\\text{close}} = T+s$.\n- The data being latched must remain stable at L2's input until at least $t_{\\text{close}} + t_{\\text{hold}} = (T + s) + t_{\\text{hold}}$.\n- A hold violation occurs if new data from the *next* clock cycle arrives too early and corrupts the data currently being latched. This is often called a race condition.\n- New data for the next cycle is launched when L1 opens again at $t = T$.\n- This new data propagates through the now-transparent L1 (with negligible delay) and the combinational logic. The fastest path through the logic has a delay of $d_{\\min}$.\n- The earliest this new, potentially corrupting, data can arrive at L2's input is $t_{\\text{arrival,min}} = T + d_{\\min}$.\n- To satisfy the hold requirement, this earliest new arrival must not occur before the hold time window closes:\n$$ T + d_{\\min} \\ge (T + s) + t_{\\text{hold}} $$\n- We can simplify this inequality by subtracting $T$ from both sides:\n$$ d_{\\min} \\ge s + t_{\\text{hold}} $$\nThis second constraint is independent of the clock period $T$. It is a fundamental condition on the circuit's physical parameters. For the circuit to be functional at any clock speed, this inequality must hold true.\n\n**Evaluation of $T_{\\min}$**\n\nNow we evaluate the constraints with the given numerical parameters:\n- $t_{\\text{setup}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{\\text{hold}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $d_{\\max} = 620\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $d_{\\min} = 90\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.4$\n- $s = 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n\nFirst, we check the hold time constraint:\n$$ d_{\\min} \\ge s + t_{\\text{hold}} $$\n$$ 90\\,\\mathrm{ps} \\ge 20\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 30\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n$$ 90\\,\\mathrm{ps} \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\nThe condition is satisfied, so the circuit is physically feasible.\n\nThe minimum clock period, $T_{\\min}$, is thus determined by the setup time constraint. The smallest value $T$ can take is the lower bound of the inequality:\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{d_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - s}{1 - \\alpha} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{620\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 80\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}}{1 - 0.4} $$\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{700\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}}{0.6} $$\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{680\\,\\mathrm{ps}}{0.6} $$\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{6800}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ps} = \\frac{3400}{3}\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx 1133.333... \\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanoseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ 1\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ps} $$\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx 1.133333... \\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx 1.133\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nThis value represents the shortest possible clock period under which the pipeline stage can operate correctly without setup violations.",
