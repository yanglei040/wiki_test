Because a finite number of bits can only represent a finite number of values, any real-world signal must be \"snapped\" to the nearest representable grid point, introducing a small error. This practice explores how to mathematically model and quantify this error for two common rounding modes, providing a crucial link between the number of fractional bits ($n$) and the resulting signal quality.

            "problem": "Consider a signed fixed-point system implemented in two’s complement with exactly $0$ integer bits and $n$ fractional bits. Real-valued inputs $x \\in [-1,1)$ are mapped to representable fixed-point values on the lattice $\\mathcal{L} = \\{k \\Delta : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cap [-1, 1)$, where $\\Delta$ is the quantization step and the hardware performs a memoryless quantization of each input sample independently. Define the quantization noise for an input $x$ and a quantizer $Q$ as $q(x) = Q(x) - x$. Two rounding modes are available:\n- Truncation toward zero: for $x \\ge 0$, the mapping is $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = \\Delta \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{\\Delta} \\right\\rfloor$, and for $x < 0$, the mapping is $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = \\Delta \\left\\lceil \\frac{x}{\\Delta} \\right\\rceil$.\n- Round-to-nearest-even: the mapping is $Q_{\\mathrm{rne}}(x) = \\Delta \\cdot \\operatorname{RoundToNearestEven}\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\Delta}\\right)$, where ties at exactly half a step are broken toward the even integer.\n\nAssume the following modeling conditions, which are standard in quantization theory and arise from the fundamental definitions above together with the assumption of a sufficiently “busy” input: the random input $X$ is a continuous random variable supported on $[-1,1)$ with a probability density function that is symmetric about $0$ and varies slowly on the scale of $\\Delta$. Under these conditions, within any quantization cell, the conditional distribution of $X$ can be taken approximately uniform, and events of exact midpoint ties have probability $0$.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and assumptions, derive the root-mean-square quantization noise $\\sigma_q = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[q(X)^2]}$ as a function of $n$ for each rounding mode. Express your final answer as the ordered pair $(\\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}}(n), \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{rne}}(n))$ in closed form. No numerical rounding is required, and no units are needed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the root-mean-square (RMS) quantization noise for two different rounding modes in a signed fixed-point number system. The validation steps confirm that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with a formal derivation.\n\n**1. Determine the Quantization Step $\\Delta$**\n\nThe fixed-point system has $0$ integer bits and $n$ fractional bits. It uses two's complement representation. The representable values are integer multiples of the weight of the least significant bit (LSB). For a format with $n$ fractional bits, the LSB has a weight of $2^{-n}$. Therefore, the quantization step size $\\Delta$, which is the distance between adjacent representable numbers, is:\n$$ \\Delta = 2^{-n} $$\nThe total range of representable numbers for a signed Q0.n format is $[-1, 1 - 2^{-n}]$, which is consistent with the specified input range of $x \\in [-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Truncation Toward Zero**\n\nThe quantization noise is defined as $q(x) = Q(x) - x$. For truncation toward zero, the quantizer $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x)$ is defined piecewise. Let $E_{\\mathrm{trunc}} = q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(X)$ be the random variable for the quantization noise.\n\nFor a non-negative input $x \\ge 0$, the quantizer is $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = \\Delta \\lfloor x/\\Delta \\rfloor$.\nConsider an input $x$ in a quantization interval $[k\\Delta, (k+1)\\Delta)$ where $k \\ge 0$ is an integer.\nFor any $x$ in this interval, $\\lfloor x/\\Delta \\rfloor = k$, so $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = k\\Delta$.\nThe noise is $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = k\\Delta - x$. As $x$ ranges from $k\\Delta$ to $(k+1)\\Delta$, the noise $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x)$ ranges from $0$ to $-\\Delta$.\nUnder the assumption that the input $X$ is approximately uniformly distributed within any quantization cell, the noise $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(X)$ for $X \\ge 0$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $(-\\Delta, 0]$. Let's denote this conditional error as $E_{trunc,+}$.\n\nFor a negative input $x < 0$, the quantizer is $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = \\Delta \\lceil x/\\Delta \\rceil$.\nConsider an input $x$ in a quantization interval $(-(k+1)\\Delta, -k\\Delta]$ where $k \\ge 0$ is an integer.\nFor any $x$ in this interval, $\\lceil x/\\Delta \\rceil = -k$, so $Q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = -k\\Delta$.\nThe noise is $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x) = -k\\Delta - x$. As $x$ ranges from $-(k+1)\\Delta$ to $-k\\Delta$, the noise $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(x)$ ranges from $\\Delta$ to $0$.\nSimilarly, under the uniform distribution assumption, the noise $q_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(X)$ for $X < 0$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, \\Delta)$. Let's denote this conditional error as $E_{trunc,-}$.\n\nThe problem states that the probability density function (PDF) of the input $X$, $f_X(x)$, is symmetric about $0$. For a continuous random variable, this implies $P(X \\ge 0) = P(X < 0) = 1/2$. The overall noise $E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}$ is a mixture of $E_{trunc,+}$ and $E_{trunc,-}$.\n\nWe need to compute the RMS noise, $\\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2]}$.\nFirst, we find the mean noise $\\mu_q = \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}]$.\n$$ \\mu_q = \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}} | X \\ge 0]P(X \\ge 0) + \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}} | X < 0]P(X < 0) $$\nThe mean of a uniform distribution on $(a,b)$ is $(a+b)/2$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[E_{trunc,+}] = (-\\Delta + 0)/2 = -\\Delta/2$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[E_{trunc,-}] = (0 + \\Delta)/2 = \\Delta/2$.\nThus, the total mean is:\n$$ \\mu_q = \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{\\Delta}{4} + \\frac{\\Delta}{4} = 0 $$\nSince the mean is $0$, the RMS noise is the square root of the mean-square error, $\\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2]}$. We use the law of total expectation for the second moment:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2 | X \\ge 0]P(X \\ge 0) + \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2 | X < 0]P(X < 0) $$\nThe second moment of a uniform distribution on $(a,b)$ is $\\frac{1}{b-a}\\int_a^b x^2 dx = \\frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{3}$.\nFor $E_{trunc,+}$ uniform on $(-\\Delta, 0)$: $\\mathbb{E}[E_{trunc,+}^2] = \\frac{(-\\Delta)^2 + (-\\Delta)(0) + 0^2}{3} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{3}$.\nFor $E_{trunc,-}$ uniform on $(0, \\Delta)$: $\\mathbb{E}[E_{trunc,-}^2] = \\frac{0^2 + (0)(\\Delta) + \\Delta^2}{3} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{3}$.\nThe total mean-square error is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{trunc}}^2] = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta^2}{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta^2}{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{3} $$\nThe RMS noise for truncation is:\n$$ \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^2}{3}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSubstituting $\\Delta = 2^{-n}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}}(n) = \\frac{2^{-n}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\n**3. Analysis of Round-to-Nearest-Even**\n\nFor round-to-nearest quantization, an input $x$ is mapped to the closest representable value $k\\Delta$. The quantization cell for the value $k\\Delta$ is the interval $[k\\Delta - \\Delta/2, k\\Delta + \\Delta/2)$. The tie-breaking rule for midpoints (e.g., $k\\Delta - \\Delta/2$) is specified, but the problem states that events of exact midpoint ties have probability $0$ for a continuous input $X$, so this rule does not affect the statistical properties of the noise.\n\nLet $E_{\\mathrm{rne}} = q_{\\mathrm{rne}}(X)$ be the noise random variable. For any $x$ in the cell $[k\\Delta - \\Delta/2, k\\Delta + \\Delta/2)$, the quantized value is $Q_{\\mathrm{rne}}(x) = k\\Delta$.\nThe noise is $q_{\\mathrm{rne}}(x) = k\\Delta - x$.\nAs $x$ ranges from $k\\Delta - \\Delta/2$ to $k\\Delta + \\Delta/2$, the noise $q_{\\mathrm{rne}}(x)$ ranges from $\\Delta/2$ to $-\\Delta/2$.\nGiven the assumption that $X$ is locally uniform, the quantization noise $E_{\\mathrm{rne}}$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $(-\\Delta/2, \\Delta/2)$.\n\nWe compute the RMS noise $\\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{rne}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{rne}}^2]}$.\nThe PDF of $E_{\\mathrm{rne}}$ is $f_E(e) = 1/\\Delta$ for $e \\in (-\\Delta/2, \\Delta/2)$ and $0$ otherwise.\nThe mean noise is:\n$$ \\mu_q = \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{rne}}] = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} e \\frac{1}{\\Delta} de = 0 $$\nThe integral is zero because the integrand is an odd function over a symmetric interval.\nSince the mean is $0$, the RMS noise is the square root of the mean-square error:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{rne}}^2] = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} e^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta} de = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[\\frac{e^3}{3}\\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{rne}}^2] = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} + \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{2\\Delta^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12} $$\nThe RMS noise for round-to-nearest is:\n$$ \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{rne}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSubstituting $\\Delta = 2^{-n}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{rne}}(n) = \\frac{2^{-n}}{2\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\n**4. Final Result**\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(\\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{trunc}}(n), \\sigma_{q,\\mathrm{rne}}(n))$.

A common source of perplexing bugs arises from mismatched \"endianness,\" or byte order, between communicating systems. This exercise demonstrates how a simple byte-swapping error can transform a fixed-point number in a dramatic but predictable way, turning a value of one into a tiny fraction by effectively shifting the binary point across the entire word.

            "problem": "A $32$-bit signed fixed-point field is communicated between a sensor and a host. The sensor encodes real values using two’s complement $Qm.n$ with $m=7$ and $n=24$, so there are $1$ sign bit, $m=7$ integer bits, and $n=24$ fractional bits (total width $1+m+n=32$). The real value represented by a bit pattern with signed integer interpretation $I$ is $r=I/2^{n}$.\n\nDue to a mixed-endian implementation bug, the host reverses the order of the $4$ bytes in each received field before interpreting it, even though the sensor already sends bytes in the host’s native order. In other words, the host applies a $4$-byte reversal to the transmitted $32$-bit pattern.\n\nTo diagnose the problem, you command the sensor to emit the exact real value $x=1$ (that is, the real number one). Let $y$ be the real value that the host computes from the byte-reversed $32$-bit pattern under the same $Q7.24$ interpretation.\n\nStarting only from the definitions above and bit-index reasoning, derive the ratio $y/x$ and show that it is a power of two. Let $s$ be the signed integer such that $y/x=2^{s}$. What is $s$?\n\nYour final answer must be the single integer $s$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an integer $s$ such that the ratio of two fixed-point numbers, $y/x$, is equal to $2^s$. The value $x$ is the number encoded by a sensor, and $y$ is the number decoded by a host after a byte-reversal error. The number format is a $32$-bit signed two's complement $Qm.n$ representation with $m=7$ and $n=24$.\n\nFirst, we determine the $32$-bit binary representation for the real value $x=1$. In a fixed-point system, a real value $r$ is represented by a scaled integer $I$. The relationship is given by $r = I / 2^n$. For the $Q7.24$ format, the number of fractional bits is $n=24$.\nTo represent the real value $x=1$, we must find the corresponding integer $I_x$:\n$$x = \\frac{I_x}{2^{n}} \\implies 1 = \\frac{I_x}{2^{24}}$$\nSolving for $I_x$, we find:\n$$I_x = 2^{24}$$\nThe next step is to represent this integer, $I_x = 2^{24}$, in $32$-bit two's complement binary format. Let the bits of the $32$-bit word be indexed from $b_0$ (Least Significant Bit, LSB) to $b_{31}$ (Most Significant Bit, MSB). The integer value of a positive binary number is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{30} b_k 2^k$. The value $2^{24}$ is represented by a word where only the bit at position $24$ is set to $1$, and all other bits are $0$.\nThe bit pattern, let's call it $W_x$, is:\n$$W_x = \\underbrace{0000000}_{b_{31}-b_{25}}1_{b_{24}}\\underbrace{000000000000000000000000}_{b_{23}-b_0}$$\nThe sign bit $b_{31}$ is $0$, which is consistent with a positive number.\n\nThis $32$-bit word is composed of four $8$-bit bytes. Let's denote the bytes from most significant to least significant as $B_3, B_2, B_1, B_0$.\n$B_3$ contains bits $b_{31}, b_{30}, \\ldots, b_{24}$.\n$B_2$ contains bits $b_{23}, b_{22}, \\ldots, b_{16}$.\n$B_1$ contains bits $b_{15}, b_{14}, \\ldots, b_8$.\n$B_0$ contains bits $b_7, b_6, \\ldots, b_0$.\n\nThe only non-zero bit in $W_x$ is $b_{24}$. This bit is the least significant bit of the most significant byte, $B_3$.\nThe values of the four bytes are:\n$$B_3 = (00000001)_2 = 1$$\n$$B_2 = (00000000)_2 = 0$$\n$$B_1 = (00000000)_2 = 0$$\n$$B_0 = (00000000)_2 = 0$$\n\nAccording to the problem, the host reverses the order of these four bytes. If the transmitted byte stream is conceptually $(B_3, B_2, B_1, B_0)$, the host reassembles them into a new $32$-bit word, $W_y$, with the byte order $(B_0, B_1, B_2, B_3)$.\nThe bytes of the new word $W_y$ are:\nNew most significant byte, $B'_3 = B_0 = (00000000)_2$.\nNew second byte, $B'_2 = B_1 = (00000000)_2$.\nNew third byte, $B'_1 = B_2 = (00000000)_2$.\nNew least significant byte, $B'_0 = B_3 = (00000001)_2$.\n\nThe resulting $32$-bit pattern $W_y$ in the host is:\n$$W_y = \\underbrace{00000000}_{B'_3}\\underbrace{00000000}_{B'_2}\\underbrace{00000000}_{B'_1}\\underbrace{00000001}_{B'_0}$$\nThis bit pattern has a single $1$ at the LSB position, $b_0$.\n\nThe host interprets this pattern $W_y$ to obtain an integer value $I_y$. Since the sign bit $b'_{31}$ is $0$, the number is positive. The integer value is:\n$$I_y = 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 1$$\nThe host then converts this integer $I_y$ to the real value $y$ using the same $Q7.24$ format:\n$$y = \\frac{I_y}{2^n} = \\frac{1}{2^{24}}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $y/x$. We have $x=1$ and $y=1/2^{24}$.\n$$\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{1/2^{24}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2^{24}} = 2^{-24}$$\nThe problem states that this ratio is $2^s$. By equating the expressions, we get:\n$$2^s = 2^{-24}$$\nTherefore, the integer $s$ is $-24$.\nThe logic used relies solely on the definitions of fixed-point representation and the specified bit/byte manipulation, as required. The ratio is indeed a power of two.",
