This exercise addresses the critical issue of hold time violations, which occur when data from a new clock cycle arrives at a register before the previous data has been properly captured.

            "problem": "A two-stage pipeline in a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is clocked by a single global clock network. The first stage contains a source register $R_{0}$ implemented as an edge-triggered D flip-flop (DFF), and the second stage contains a destination register $R_{1}$, also a DFF. Between $R_{0}$ and $R_{1}$ there is an ALU block with an enable-controlled bypass. When the bypass is enabled, the datapath from $R_{0}.\\mathrm{Q}$ to $R_{1}.\\mathrm{D}$ traverses only a $2$-to-$1$ multiplexer (MUX) and a short local wire, creating a very short datapath.\n\nAssume the following measured or characterized best-case Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) conditions for this bypass path:\n- The minimum clock-to-Q delay of $R_{0}$ is $t_{cq,min} = 35\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- The minimum propagation delay of the combinational bypass path (MUX plus wire) is $t_{pd,min} = 12\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- The hold time of the destination DFF $R_{1}$ is $t_{hold} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- The best-case clock skew, defined as destination clock arrival time minus source clock arrival time under the same best-case PVT, is $t_{skew,best} = +25\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\nYou are allowed to insert a dedicated delay element in the bypass datapath that contributes an additional propagation delay $d_{fix}$ to the minimum datapath delay without affecting the clock network. Using only fundamental definitions of setup and hold times for edge-triggered DFFs and the notion of relative clock arrival time (skew), determine the smallest nonnegative $d_{fix}$ that guarantees the receiving register $R_{1}$ does not suffer a hold-time violation when the bypass is enabled under these best-case conditions.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single real-valued number in picoseconds.

The earliest time that new data, launched by the source register on its active clock edge, can arrive at the destination input is the sum of the minimum clock-to-Q delay of the source, $t_{cq,min}$, the minimum propagation delay of the combinational datapath, $t_{pd,min}$, and any intentional additional delay, $d_{fix}$.\n\nLet the source clock active edge define time $t=0$ at the source register. The destination clock active edge occurs at time $t = t_{skew,best}$ relative to the source edge. A positive $t_{skew,best}$ means the destination clock edge arrives later than the source clock edge.\n\nTo avoid a hold violation, the earliest possible arrival of the new data at the destination input must be no earlier than the end of the destination’s hold window. The destination's hold window ends at time $t_{skew,best} + t_{hold}$ relative to the source clock edge. The earliest arrival of new data occurs at time $t_{cq,min} + t_{pd,min} + d_{fix}$. Therefore, the hold-time safety condition is:\n$$\nt_{cq,min} + t_{pd,min} + d_{fix} \\ge t_{hold} + t_{skew,best}\n$$\nWe solve for the minimum additional delay $d_{fix}$ required:\n$$\nd_{fix} \\ge (t_{hold} + t_{skew,best}) - (t_{cq,min} + t_{pd,min})\n$$\nThe least non-negative $d_{fix}$ that satisfies this inequality is:\n$$\nd_{fix} = \\max\\{0, (t_{hold} + t_{skew,best}) - (t_{cq,min} + t_{pd,min})\\}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n(t_{hold} + t_{skew,best}) - (t_{cq,min} + t_{pd,min}) = (60\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 25\\,\\mathrm{ps}) - (35\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 12\\,\\mathrm{ps}) = 85\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 47\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 38\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nSince this value is positive, the minimal nonnegative delay that must be added is:\n$$\nd_{fix} = 38\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\nNo rounding is required.",

            "problem": "A synchronous datapath uses three stages separated by two pipeline registers built from D-type flip-flops (DFF). The datapath between the input register and the output register is a strictly feed-forward chain of six combinational sub-blocks, labeled in order as $B_1 \\rightarrow B_2 \\rightarrow B_3 \\rightarrow B_4 \\rightarrow B_5 \\rightarrow B_6$. Each sub-block $B_k$ has a worst-case (maximum) propagation delay $t_{pd,k,max}$ and a best-case (minimum) propagation delay $t_{pd,k,min}$, given in nanoseconds, as follows:\n- $B_1$: $t_{pd,1,max} = 0.35$, $t_{pd,1,min} = 0.09$\n- $B_2$: $t_{pd,2,max} = 0.26$, $t_{pd,2,min} = 0.07$\n- $B_3$: $t_{pd,3,max} = 0.41$, $t_{pd,3,min} = 0.10$\n- $B_4$: $t_{pd,4,max} = 0.29$, $t_{pd,4,min} = 0.07$\n- $B_5$: $t_{pd,5,max} = 0.38$, $t_{pd,5,min} = 0.09$\n- $B_6$: $t_{pd,6,max} = 0.31$, $t_{pd,6,min} = 0.08$\n\nThere are three pipeline stages separated by two registers that must be placed at sub-block boundaries. Initially, the two registers are placed after $B_1$ and after $B_4$, so the three stages are $(B_1)$, $(B_2,B_3,B_4)$, and $(B_5,B_6)$.\n\nThe D-type flip-flops have the following timing parameters (nanoseconds):\n- clock-to-$Q$ worst-case delay $t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,max} = 0.11$\n- clock-to-$Q$ best-case delay $t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,min} = 0.07$\n- setup time $t_{setup} = 0.05$\n- hold time $t_{hold} = 0.06$\n\nThe clock distribution exhibits bounded skew between any launching and capturing registers. Define clock skew as $t_{skew} = t_{clk}^{dst} - t_{clk}^{src}$, where $t_{clk}^{dst}$ is the destination register’s clock arrival time relative to the source. The skew is known to lie within $[s_{min}, s_{max}] = [-0.03, +0.04]$ nanoseconds for all register pairs in this datapath.\n\nYou may perform only retiming by relocating the two pipeline registers to different boundaries between sub-blocks; you must preserve exactly three pipeline stages and you may not split any sub-block. Your goal is to minimize the per-stage critical path (that is, the maximum over the three stages of the sum of the involved $t_{pd,k,max}$), while ensuring that, after retiming, the hold requirement is satisfied at each register boundary when evaluated with the corresponding per-stage sum of $t_{pd,k,min}$ and the given DFF and skew parameters.

            "solution": "To solve this retiming problem, we first establish the governing timing constraints for any single pipeline stage.\n\n**1. Timing Constraints**\n\nThe **setup time constraint** determines the minimum clock period ($T_{clk}$). The clock period must be long enough for a signal to travel from the launch register, through the combinational logic, and arrive at the capture register before its setup window begins. This is a \"long path\" problem, so we use maximum delays and the worst-case (most harmful) skew.\n$$T_{clk} + t_{clk}^{dst} \\ge t_{clk}^{src} + t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,max} + t_{comb,max} + t_{setup}$$\nRearranging and using $t_{skew} = t_{clk}^{dst} - t_{clk}^{src}$, we get:\n$$T_{clk} \\ge t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,max} + t_{comb,max} + t_{setup} - t_{skew}$$\nTo find the minimum $T_{clk}$, we must satisfy this for the worst-case skew that shortens the available time, which is $s_{min}$.\n$$T_{clk} \\ge t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,max} + t_{comb,max} + t_{setup} - s_{min}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{clk} \\ge 0.11 + t_{comb,max} + 0.05 - (-0.03) \\implies T_{clk} \\ge t_{comb,max} + 0.19\\,\\text{ns}$$\n\nThe **hold time constraint** ensures a new signal does not arrive too quickly and corrupt the current capture. This is a \"short path\" problem, so we use minimum delays and the worst-case skew that tightens the hold requirement.\n$$t_{clk}^{src} + t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,min} + t_{comb,min} \\ge t_{clk}^{dst} + t_{hold}$$\nRearranging:\n$$t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,min} + t_{comb,min} \\ge t_{hold} + t_{skew}$$\nThis must be satisfied for the worst-case skew that extends the hold window, which is $s_{max}$.\n$$t_{clk\\rightarrow Q,min} + t_{comb,min} \\ge t_{hold} + s_{max}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$0.07 + t_{comb,min} \\ge 0.06 + 0.04 \\implies t_{comb,min} \\ge 0.03\\,\\text{ns}$$\nThis means any valid pipeline stage must have a minimum combinational delay of at least $0.03$ ns.\n\n**2. Optimal Register Placement (Retiming)**\n\nThe goal is to minimize $T_{clk}$ by minimizing the pipeline's overall critical path, which is the largest $t_{comb,max}$ among all stages. We must evaluate all 10 possible placements of the two registers at the five boundaries and find the one that yields the smallest maximum stage delay, while ensuring all stages meet the $t_{comb,min} \\ge 0.03\\,\\text{ns}$ hold constraint.\n\nAfter evaluating all 10 placements, the configuration that minimizes the maximum stage delay is found by placing registers after blocks $B_2$ and $B_4$. This creates three stages: $S_1 = (B_1, B_2)$, $S_2 = (B_3, B_4)$, and $S_3 = (B_5, B_6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the delays for this optimal placement:\n- **Stage 1 ($B_1, B_2$):** $t_{comb,max} = 0.35 + 0.26 = 0.61\\,\\text{ns}$; $t_{comb,min} = 0.09 + 0.07 = 0.16\\,\\text{ns}$\n- **Stage 2 ($B_3, B_4$):** $t_{comb,max} = 0.41 + 0.29 = 0.70\\,\\text{ns}$; $t_{comb,min} = 0.10 + 0.07 = 0.17\\,\\text{ns}$\n- **Stage 3 ($B_5, B_6$):** $t_{comb,max} = 0.38 + 0.31 = 0.69\\,\\textns$; $t_{comb,min} = 0.09 + 0.08 = 0.17\\,\\text{ns}$\n\nThe minimum delay for any stage is $0.16$ ns, which is well above the required $0.03$ ns, so the hold constraint is satisfied everywhere.\n\nThe maximum delay across these stages is $0.70$ ns (from Stage 2). This becomes the critical path delay of the retimed pipeline, so $t_{comb,crit}^{\\max} = 0.70\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n**3. Minimum Clock Period**\n\nWe now use the setup inequality for this critical path to find the minimum clock period:\n$$T_{clk,min} = t_{comb,crit}^{\\max} + 0.19\\,\\text{ns}$$\n$$T_{clk,min} = 0.70 + 0.19 = 0.89\\,\\text{ns}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimum feasible clock period is $0.8900$ ns.",
