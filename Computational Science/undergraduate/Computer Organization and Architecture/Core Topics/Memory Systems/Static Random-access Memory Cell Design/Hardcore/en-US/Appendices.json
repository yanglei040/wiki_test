            "introduction": "The heart of a 6T SRAM cell is a pair of cross-coupled inverters that form a bistable latch. The stability of this latch during a read operation is not guaranteed; it depends critically on the relative strengths of the transistors. This exercise  explores the fundamental concept of read stability by having you calculate the 'cell ratio'—the ratio of the pull-down transistor's strength to the access transistor's strength—required to prevent the cell from accidentally flipping its state during a read. This analysis connects transistor sizing, a key design choice, directly to the cell's data integrity.",

            "problem": "A six-transistor Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell stores data using two cross-coupled complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) inverters and two access transistors connected to a wordline (WL) and bitlines (BL). During a read operation of a stored logical zero, the internal storage node $Q$ connected to the asserted WL and a precharged BL can rise above $0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to an equilibrium disturbance level $V_{R}$ due to current flowing through the access transistor; this may trigger a flip if the cross-coupled inverter on the opposite side switches. Read stability can be analyzed with the inverter's Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC): a read disturb is avoided if the disturbed node voltage $V_{R}$ remains less than or equal to the inverter's switching threshold $V_{M}$.\n\nAssume:\n- The supply voltage is $V_{DD}=1.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- Near the switching threshold, each inverter transistor operates in saturation under the long-channel square-law model without body effect or channel-length modulation. For an $n$-channel MOSFET, the drain current is $I_{n}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}\\big(V_{GS}-V_{THn}\\big)^{2}$ in saturation, and for a $p$-channel MOSFET, $I_{p}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}\\big(V_{SG}-|V_{THp}|\\big)^{2}$ in saturation.\n- The inverter switching threshold $V_{M}$ occurs at $V_{\\text{in}}=V_{\\text{out}}=V_{M}$ where $I_{n}=I_{p}$.\n- The inverter sizing is characterized by the ratio $r=\\beta_{n}/\\beta_{p}$.\n- The nominal thresholds satisfy $V_{THn}=|V_{THp}|=V_{TH}=0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- A measured equilibrium read disturbance level on the zero-storing node is $V_{R}=0.35\\ \\mathrm{V}$ under the given wordline and bitline biasing.\n\nStarting from the above transistor current laws and the definition of the inverter switching threshold, derive the condition on $r$ such that read disturb is avoided, expressed in terms of $V_{DD}$, $V_{R}$, and $V_{TH}$. Then, compute the limiting value $r^{\\star}$ at nominal threshold $V_{TH}=0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$ such that the cell avoids read disturb if $r\\leq r^{\\star}$, and compute the new limiting value when the thresholds for both $n$-channel and $p$-channel devices increase by $\\Delta V_{TH}=+0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$. Round both numerical values to three significant figures. Provide your final answer as a two-entry row matrix containing $r^{\\star}$ at nominal $V_{TH}$ and $r^{\\star}$ at $V_{TH}+0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$, in that order, with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the constraint on the inverter sizing ratio $r = \\beta_{n}/\\beta_{p}$ that ensures read stability. The condition for read stability is given as $V_{R} \\le V_{M}$, where $V_{R}$ is the measured voltage disturbance on the storage node and $V_{M}$ is the switching threshold of the cross-coupled inverter. We will first derive an expression for $V_{M}$ and then apply the stability condition to find the constraint on $r$.\n\nThe inverter's switching threshold, $V_{M}$, is defined as the point on the voltage transfer characteristic where the input voltage equals the output voltage, $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{\\text{out}} = V_{M}$. At this operating point, the currents flowing through the n-channel MOSFET (nMOS) and p-channel MOSFET (pMOS) are equal, $I_{n} = I_{p}$. The problem states that both transistors operate in saturation.\n\nFor the nMOS transistor, the gate is connected to the input $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{M}$ and the source is connected to ground ($0\\ \\mathrm{V}$). Thus, its gate-to-source voltage is $V_{GS,n} = V_{M}$. The saturation current is given by:\n$$I_{n} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{GS,n}-V_{THn})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{M}-V_{THn})^{2}$$\n\nFor the pMOS transistor, the gate is also connected to the input $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{M}$ and the source is connected to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$. Thus, its source-to-gate voltage is $V_{SG,p} = V_{DD} - V_{M}$. The saturation current is given by:\n$$I_{p} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{SG,p}-|V_{THp}|)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{DD}-V_{M}-|V_{THp}|)^{2}$$\n\nWe are given that the threshold voltages are equal in magnitude, $V_{THn} = |V_{THp}| = V_{TH}$. Setting $I_{n} = I_{p}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}$ and substituting the definition of the sizing ratio $r = \\beta_{n}/\\beta_{p}$, we obtain:\n$$r(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2} = (V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}$$\n\nSolving for $r$ yields the sizing ratio as a function of the switching threshold $V_{M}$:\n$$r = \\frac{(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}}{(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH}}{V_{M}-V_{TH}} \\right)^{2}$$\nThis equation is valid for $V_{TH} < V_{M} < V_{DD}-V_{TH}$, which ensures both transistors are in saturation and the arguments of the squares are positive.\n\nThe read stability condition is $V_{R} \\le V_{M}$. To ensure stability, the inverter's switching threshold $V_{M}$ must be greater than or equal to the disturbance voltage $V_{R}$. We examine the relationship between $r$ and $V_{M}$. The numerator $(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})$ is a decreasing function of $V_{M}$, while the denominator $(V_{M}-V_{TH})$ is an increasing function of $V_{M}$. Therefore, their ratio, and consequently $r$, is a strictly decreasing function of $V_{M}$. This means that to achieve a higher switching threshold $V_{M}$, a smaller sizing ratio $r$ is required.\n\nThe condition $V_{M} \\ge V_{R}$ is thus equivalent to requiring that the cell's sizing ratio $r$ be less than or equal to the sizing ratio calculated at the limiting case where $V_{M} = V_{R}$. Let this limiting value be $r^{\\star}$.\n$$r \\le r^{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}-V_{R}-V_{TH}}{V_{R}-V_{TH}} \\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the general condition on $r$ required to avoid a read disturb.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values as requested.\n\nFirst, for the nominal threshold voltage $V_{TH} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The other parameters are $V_{DD}=1.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{R}=0.35\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The limiting value $r^{\\star}_{\\text{nom}}$ is:\n$$r^{\\star}_{\\text{nom}} = \\left( \\frac{1.0 - 0.35 - 0.25}{0.35 - 0.25} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{0.40}{0.10} \\right)^{2} = (4)^{2} = 16$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $r^{\\star}_{\\text{nom}} = 16.0$.\n\nSecond, we consider the case where the threshold voltages for both devices increase by $\\Delta V_{TH}=+0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The new threshold voltage is $V_{TH, \\text{new}} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V} + 0.05\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{V}$. All other parameters remain unchanged. The new limiting value $r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}}$ is:\n$$r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}} = \\left( \\frac{1.0 - 0.35 - 0.30}{0.35 - 0.30} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{0.35}{0.05} \\right)^{2} = (7)^{2} = 49$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}} = 49.0$.\n\nThe two limiting values for the sizing ratio $r$, corresponding to the nominal and increased threshold voltages, are $16.0$ and $49.0$, respectively. For the cell to be stable against read disturb, its sizing ratio must satisfy $r \\le r^{\\star}$.",

Substituting this into the constraint:\n$$N_{r} \\left(\\frac{N_{r}}{A}\\right) = W \\implies \\frac{N_{r}^2}{A} = W \\implies N_{r}^2 = W A$$\nNow substitute the expressions for $N_{r}^2$ and $N_{c}^2$ into the total access time equation to get a function of a single variable, $A$:\n$$T_{\\text{access}}(A) = \\frac{1}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2 (W A) + \\frac{1}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2 \\left(\\frac{W}{A}\\right)$$\nTo find the aspect ratio $A$ that minimizes $T_{\\text{access}}$, we take the derivative of $T_{\\text{access}}(A)$ with respect to $A$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{dT_{\\text{access}}}{dA} = \\frac{d}{dA} \\left( \\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2 A + \\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2 A^{-1} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dT_{\\text{access}}}{dA} = \\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2 - \\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2 A^{-2}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2 = \\frac{W}{2} R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2 A^{-2}$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $W/2$:\n$$R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2 = \\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2}{A^2}$$\nSolving for $A^2$:\n$$A^2 = \\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2}{R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2}$$\nSince the aspect ratio $A = N_r/N_c$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$A = \\sqrt{\\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} p_{x}^2}{R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} p_{y}^2}} = \\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}} \\sqrt{\\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} C'_{\\mathrm{wl}}}{R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} C'_{\\mathrm{bl}}}}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the optimal aspect ratio. Now, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $R'_{\\mathrm{wl}} = 1.5\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $C'_{\\mathrm{wl}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $p_{x} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $R'_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 0.25\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $C'_{\\mathrm{bl}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $p_{y} = 0.40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\nThe units for resistance, capacitance, and pitch are consistent and will cancel out appropriately within the formula, resulting in a dimensionless aspect ratio.\n$$A = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.5)(0.15)}{(0.25)(0.30)}}$$\n$$A = 0.5 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.225}{0.075}}$$\n$$A = 0.5 \\sqrt{3}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$A \\approx 0.5 \\times 1.7320508... = 0.8660254...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$A \\approx 0.8660$$\nThis optimal aspect ratio balances the wordline delay and the bitline delay. In fact, setting the derivative to zero is equivalent to setting the two delay components equal: $T_{\\mathrm{wl}} = T_{\\mathrm{bl}}$.",
