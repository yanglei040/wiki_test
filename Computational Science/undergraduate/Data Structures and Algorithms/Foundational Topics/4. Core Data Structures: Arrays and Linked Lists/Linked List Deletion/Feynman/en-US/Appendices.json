You will implement the three most essential deletion operations: removing the head, the tail, and a node at a specific index. This exercise  is designed to solidify your understanding of pointer manipulation and to highlight the performance implications of the singly linked list's structure, where the constant-time $O(1)$ head deletion contrasts sharply with the linear-time $O(n)$ operations for tail and indexed deletion.",

            "problem": "You are given the definition of a singly linked list as a finite sequence of nodes, where each node stores a nonnegative integer key and a reference to the next node, and the last node stores a null reference. A deletion operation mutates the list by removing a node and re-linking references as needed. Using first principles from the definition of a singly linked list as an Abstract Data Type (ADT), design and implement the following operations that transform a list with head pointer $H$:\n- Operation $delete\\_head(H)$: Remove the head node if it exists, and return a pair comprising the new head pointer and the removed key. If the list is empty, return the unchanged null head and the integer $-1$.\n- Operation $delete\\_tail(H)$: Remove the tail node if it exists, and return a pair comprising the (possibly updated) head pointer and the removed key. If the list is empty, return the unchanged null head and the integer $-1$.\n- Operation $delete\\_index(H,i)$ for integer index $i \\ge 0$: Remove the node at zero-based position $i$ if it exists, and return a pair comprising the (possibly updated) head pointer and the removed key. If no such node exists, return the unchanged head and the integer $-1$.\n\nYour implementation must follow purely the core definition of a singly linked list: each node has only a reference to its successor, and no predecessor references. You must reason from this base to design the algorithms, including determining whether a predecessor node must be discovered by traversal before a deletion can be performed. You must ensure that the following properties hold:\n- For $delete\\_head(H)$, the operation runs in time $O(1)$, because only $H$ and at most the next reference are touched.\n- For $delete\\_tail(H)$, the operation runs in time $O(n)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of nodes, because the unique predecessor of the last node must be found by traversal.\n- For $delete\\_index(H,i)$, the operation runs in time $O(n)$ in the worst case, because the unique predecessor of the node at index $i$ must be found by traversal when $i \\ge 1$.\n\nTo make the results quantifiable and machine-checkable, your program must apply sequences of operations to specified initial lists and report two artifacts for each test case:\n- The ordered list of removed keys, one per operation, using the integer $-1$ whenever no deletion was possible.\n- The final list as a plain array of integers (the keys from head to tail). All keys in all initial lists are nonnegative integers, so the integer $-1$ is an unambiguous sentinel for “no deletion performed.”\n\nThe input is fixed in the program; there is no external input. Use the following test suite, where each test case consists of an initial list and a sequence of operations. Use the following operation codes: $H$ for $delete\\_head$, $T$ for $delete\\_tail$, and $I$ with an integer parameter for $delete\\_index$.\n- Test case 1: initial list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, operations `[(H), (I, 2), (T)]`.\n- Test case 2: initial list `[10]`, operations `[(H), (T), (I, 0)]`.\n- Test case 3: initial list `[7, 8]`, operations `[(I, 0), (I, 1), (T)]`.\n- Test case 4: initial list `[9, 9, 9]`, operations `[(T), (I, 1), (H)]`.\n- Test case 5: initial list `[0, 1, 2]`, operations `[(I, 5), (T), (I, 1), (H)]`.\n- Test case 6: initial list `[]`, operations `[(H), (T), (I, 0)]`.\n\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each test case, the result is a two-element list: the first element is the list of removed keys (using $-1$ when applicable), and the second element is the final list. Concretely, the overall output format is a single line of the form\n`[case_1_result,case_2_result,...,case_6_result]`,\nwhere each `case_k_result` has the form `[removed_keys, final_list]`.\n\nNo physical units, angles, or percentages are involved in this problem. All outputs are integers or lists of integers. The program must not read any input and must print exactly one line in the format described above.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of three fundamental deletion operations for a singly linked list: deleting the head node, the tail node, and a node at a specific zero-based index $i$. The design must be derived from first principles, acknowledging that in a singly linked list, each node only contains a reference to its successor, not its predecessor.\n\nA singly linked list is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) defined as a sequence of nodes. Each node contains two fields: a value (in this case, a non-negative integer key) and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The list is accessed via a head pointer, $H$, which references the first node. The last node's `next` reference is null, signifying the end of the list. An empty list is represented by a null head pointer $H$.\n\nLet us define a node structure as `Node(key, next)`.\n\n**1. Operation $delete\\_head(H)$**\n\nThis operation removes the first node of the list.\n\n*   **Principle and Design**: The head node is directly accessible via the pointer $H$. To delete it, we must update $H$ to point to the second node in the list. The original second node's reference is stored in the `next` field of the original head node.\n*   **Algorithm**:\n    1.  Check if the list is empty (i.e., if $H$ is null). If it is, no deletion can be performed. As per the problem specification, we return the unchanged null head pointer and the sentinel value $-1$.\n    2.  If the list is not empty, the node to be removed is the one pointed to by $H$. We store its key, let's call it $k_{removed}$, for the return value.\n    3.  The new head of the list will be the successor of the current head. We update the head pointer by assigning $H = H.next$.\n    4.  Return the new head pointer and the removed key $k_{removed}$.\n*   **Complexity Analysis**: This operation involves a null check, retrieving a key, and one pointer reassignment. These are all elementary, constant-time operations. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(1)$, meeting the problem's requirement.\n\n**2. Operation $delete\\_tail(H)$**\n\nThis operation removes the last node of the list.\n\n*   **Principle and Design**: The tail node is defined as the node whose `next` pointer is null. To remove it, we must modify its predecessor, setting the predecessor's `next` pointer to null. Since a singly linked list provides no direct way to access a node's predecessor, we must find the predecessor of the tail by traversing the list from the head, $H$.\n*   **Algorithm**:\n    1.  Handle the empty list case: If $H$ is null, return $(H, -1)$.\n    2.  Handle the single-node list case: If $H.next$ is null, then the head is also the tail. This reduces to deleting the head. We store the key, set $H$ to null, and return the new null head and the stored key.\n    3.  For a list with $n > 1$ nodes, we must find the predecessor of the tail. We can use a two-pointer traversal. Let `current` be a pointer that traverses the list, and `previous` be a pointer that always lags one step behind `current`.\n    4.  Initialize `previous = H` and `current = H.next`.\n    5.  Traverse the list until `current.next` is null. In each step, advance both pointers: `previous = current`, `current = current.next`.\n    6.  When the loop terminates, `current` points to the tail node and `previous` points to its predecessor (the new tail).\n    7.  Store the key of the tail node, `current.key`.\n    8.  Update the new tail's `next` reference to be null: `previous.next = null`.\n    9.  Return the original head pointer $H$ (which is unchanged unless the list had only one node) and the removed key.\n*   **Complexity Analysis**: For a list of size $n$, finding the predecessor of the tail requires traversing $n-1$ nodes in the worst case (for $n > 1$). The traversal dominates the runtime. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n)$, as required.\n\n**3. Operation $delete\\_index(H, i)$**\n\nThis operation removes the node at a given zero-based index $i \\ge 0$.\n\n*   **Principle and Design**:\n    *   If the index $i$ is $0$, this operation is identical to $delete\\_head(H)$.\n    *   If the index $i$ is greater than $0$, we must remove the node at position $i$. To do this, we need to connect the node at position $i-1$ to the node at position $i+1$. This requires finding the node at position $i-1$ (the predecessor) by traversing the list from the head.\n*   **Algorithm**:\n    1.  Validate the index and list state. If $H$ is null or $i  0$, the index is invalid or the list is empty. We can return $(H, -1)$. The problem statement guarantees $i \\ge 0$.\n    2.  Handle the case $i=0$: This is equivalent to deleting the head. We can simply call our $delete\\_head(H)$ logic and return its result.\n    3.  Handle the case $i > 0$: We need to find the predecessor node at index $i-1$.\n    4.  Initialize a pointer `previous = H` and a counter `count = 0`.\n    5.  Traverse the list, advancing `previous` and incrementing `count`, until `count` reaches $i-1$. The loop condition should be `count  i - 1` and `previous.next` is not null. The `previous.next` check is crucial to gracefully handle an index $i$ that is out of bounds.\n    6.  After the loop, check if the traversal was successful. If `previous` is null or `previous.next` is null, it means we reached the end of the list before finding a node at index $i$. Thus, the index is out of bounds. Return $(H, -1)$.\n    7.  If the predecessor was found, let `node_to_delete = previous.next`.\n    8.  Store the key of `node_to_delete`.\n    9.  Bypass the node by updating the predecessor's `next` pointer: `previous.next = node_to_delete.next`.\n    10. Return the (unchanged) head pointer $H$ and the removed key.\n*   **Complexity Analysis**:\n    *   For $i=0$, the complexity is $O(1)$.\n    *   For $i > 0$, the algorithm must perform a traversal of $i-1$ steps to find the predecessor. In the worst case, $i$ could be $n-1$, requiring a traversal of $n-2$ steps. Thus, the worst-case time complexity is proportional to $n$, which is $O(n)$, satisfying the problem requirements.\n\nThese designs strictly adhere to the constraints of a singly linked list and provide the foundation for the following implementation.",

            "introduction": "Building upon the basics, this next challenge introduces a powerful algorithmic pattern known as the \"two-pointer\" or \"runner\" technique. You are tasked with deleting the $k$-th node from the end of the list in a single pass, a problem that at first seems to require knowing the list's total length. This practice  will teach you how to maintain a relative distance between two pointers to solve this and similar problems efficiently, without the need for a preliminary pass to count the nodes.",
            "id": "3245572",
            "problem": "You are given the core definitions of a singly linked list and pointer manipulation as the foundational base. A singly linked list is a finite sequence of nodes, each node storing a data value and a pointer to the next node. Formally, a list may be represented as a sequence $L = \\langle x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1} \\rangle$ of length $n$, where each node $x_i$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ contains a reference to $x_{i+1}$ for $i \\le n-2$, and $x_{n-1}$ contains a reference to a null sentinel indicating the end of the list. Deletion of a node at position $i$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ requires updating the pointer stored in the node at position $i-1$ (or adjusting the head pointer if $i=0$) so that it references the node at position $i+1$ (or null if $i=n-1$). Pointer movement along a singly linked list follows the rule that advancing one step moves from node $x_i$ to node $x_{i+1}$ when $i \\le n-2$ and to null when $i=n-1$.\n\nTask: Implement a single-pass algorithm to delete the $k$-th node from the end of the list. Given a head pointer to the list $L$ and an integer $k \\ge 0$, your algorithm must perform at most one traversal from the head to the end (visiting each node at most once overall) and use $O(1)$ auxiliary space. The required behavior is:\n- If $k = 0$, no node is removed and the original list is returned unchanged.\n- If $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$, remove the node at index $n - k$ (where the head has index $0$).\n- If $k  n$, no node is removed and the original list is returned unchanged.\n- If $n = 0$ (the list is empty), return the empty list for any $k$.\n\nYou must derive your algorithm logically from the core definitions above, without relying on unexplained shortcuts. The algorithm must be implementable in a single pass by maintaining an invariant that correctly identifies the predecessor of the node to delete when the end of the list is reached.\n\nInput format for your program is fixed internally; there is no external input. Your program should embed and run the following test suite, where each test case consists of a list and a value of $k$. Each list is written as a mathematical sequence, and $k$ is an integer. For clarity, the lists below are to be interpreted as sequences of integers in the same order:\n- Test 1: L = 1,2,3,4,5, k=2.\n- Test 2: L = 10, k=1.\n- Test 3: L = , k=1.\n- Test 4: L = 7,8,9, k=3.\n- Test 5: L = 1,2,3, k=4.\n- Test 6: L = 1,1,1,1, k=1.\n- Test 7: L = 5,6, k=2.\n- Test 8: L = 2,3,4,5, k=0.\n- Test 9: L = 1,2,3, k=2.\n- Test 10: L = 9,8,7,6,5, k=5.\n\nFor each test, your program must compute the resulting list after applying the deletion rule above. The final output must aggregate all results in a single line as follows: a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself the resulting list written with square brackets and without spaces. For example, if the first two results were 1,3,5 and , they would appear as `[[1,3,5],[]]` without spaces inside any brackets. Concretely, your program must print exactly one line whose content is a single bracketed list of bracketed lists with no spaces inside any brackets, that is, of the form `[[a_1,...],[],[b_1,b_2],...]` but with all spaces removed within brackets.\n\nYour program must be a complete, runnable implementation that executes the test suite and prints the aggregated single-line result as specified. The answer for each test case is a list of integers.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a well-defined algorithmic task concerning data structures, specifically the deletion of a node from a singly linked list under strict performance constraints. The problem is scientifically grounded in fundamental computer science principles, provides a complete and consistent set of rules, and uses objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to design a single-pass algorithm that uses $O(1)$ auxiliary space to delete the $k$-th node from the end of a singly linked list $L$ of length $n$. The list is given by its head pointer. The rules for deletion are specified for all non-negative integer values of $k$.\n\nLet the list be $L = \\langle x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1} \\rangle$. The node to be deleted is the $k$-th from the end, which corresponds to the node at index $n-k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. To perform the deletion, we must modify the `next` pointer of its predecessor, the node at index $n-k-1$. Locating this predecessor node in a single pass without first computing the length $n$ is the central challenge. The constraints of a single traversal and $O(1)$ space rule out a naive two-pass approach (first pass to find $n$, second pass to iterate to node $n-k-1$).\n\nThe problem can be solved by maintaining a fixed-distance separation between two pointers as they traverse the list. This is commonly known as the two-pointer technique. Let us formalize the derivation of the algorithm.\n\nTo transparently handle edge cases, such as deleting the head of the list (when $k=n$) or dealing with an empty list, we introduce a sentinel node, which we shall call `dummy`. This `dummy` node is placed before the actual head of the list, such that `dummy.next` points to the original head, $x_0$. Our algorithm will return `dummy.next` as the new head of the list.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Checks**: Per the problem specification, if $k=0$, no deletion occurs. The algorithm should immediately return the original list. If the list is empty ($n=0$), the `head` pointer is `null`, and the algorithm should return a `null` pointer.\n\n2.  **Pointer Initialization**: We initialize two pointers, which we will call `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the `dummy` node.\n    $$ \\text{slow} \\leftarrow \\text{dummy} $$\n    $$ \\text{fast} \\leftarrow \\text{dummy} $$\n\n3.  **Establishing the Gap**: The core idea is to create a gap of $k$ nodes between the `slow` and `fast` pointers. We achieve this by advancing the `fast` pointer $k$ steps forward from its initial position.\n    $$ \\text{for } i \\text{ from } 1 \\text{ to } k: $$\n    $$ \\quad \\text{fast} \\leftarrow \\text{fast.next} $$\n    During this phase, we must handle the case where $k  n$. If `fast` becomes `null` at any point, it means the list has fewer than $k$ nodes. In this scenario, as specified, the list remains unchanged. Thus, we check for `fast` being `null` within the loop and return the original `head` if the condition is met.\n\n4.  **Simultaneous Traversal**: After the `fast` pointer has been advanced $k$ steps, we begin moving both pointers forward in unison, one step at a time, until the `fast` pointer reaches the last node of the list. The condition for the loop to terminate is when `fast.next` is `null`.\n    $$ \\text{while fast.next is not null}: $$\n    $$ \\quad \\text{slow} \\leftarrow \\text{slow.next} $$\n    $$ \\quad \\text{fast} \\leftarrow \\text{fast.next} $$\n\n    Let us analyze the final positions of the pointers to confirm the correctness of this procedure. Let the list have length $n$. The pointer `slow` starts at an effective index of $-1$ (`dummy`), and `fast` starts at index $k-1$ (after its initial $k$ advancements). Both pointers then advance an equal number of steps, let's say $m$ steps, until `fast` reaches the last node at index $n-1$. The final index of `fast` is $(k-1) + m$. Equating this to the index of the last node, we have:\n    $$ (k-1) + m = n-1 \\implies m = n-k $$\n    The `slow` pointer also moves $m = n-k$ steps from its starting position at index $-1$. Its final position is therefore:\n    $$ \\text{index}(\\text{slow}) = -1 + m = -1 + (n-k) = n-k-1 $$\n    This is precisely the index of the predecessor of the node to be deleted (which is at index $n-k$). The invariant—that `fast` is $k$ nodes ahead of `slow`—ensures that when `fast` has traversed to the end, `slow` is positioned correctly.\n\n5.  **Node Deletion**: With `slow` pointing to the predecessor of the target node, the deletion is a simple pointer manipulation. The `next` pointer of `slow` is updated to bypass the target node:\n    $$ \\text{slow.next} \\leftarrow \\text{slow.next.next} $$\n\n6.  **Return Value**: The final, possibly modified, list is headed by `dummy.next`. This pointer is returned.\n\nThis algorithm correctly processes all specified cases. For $k=n$, the `fast` pointer lands on the last node after its initial $k$ advancements, so the `while` loop does not execute. The `slow` pointer remains at the `dummy` node.

The challenge is to delete a node given only a reference to that node itself, with no access to the list's head or the node's predecessor.

This exercise  deepens your understanding of what \"deletion\" fundamentally means by distinguishing between a node's fixed identity in memory and the mutable value it holds in the sequence.",
            "id": "3245621",
            "problem": "You are given the definition of a singly linked list: each node stores an integer value and a reference to the next node, or a null reference if it is the last node. You have a reference to a node that lies somewhere inside such a list, but you do not have a direct reference to the head of the list or to the previous node. Your goal is to implement a function that attempts to delete the node identified by that single reference. The function must operate under the following fundamental constraints and invariants:\n\n- A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node has a field for a value and a field that references the next node. There is no backward reference. Formally, a list is a sequence of nodes $\\langle n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{k-1} \\rangle$ where each $n_i.\\text{next} = n_{i+1}$ for $0 \\le i  k-1$, and $n_{k-1}.\\text{next} = \\text{null}$.\n- You are provided only a reference to one node $n_i$ for some index $i$, with $0 \\le i \\le k-1$. You do not have $n_{i-1}$ or the head $n_0$ unless $i = 0$.\n- You may read and write the fields of the provided node and its successor if it exists. You may not traverse to any earlier node because there is no backward reference.\n\nTask: Implement a function that, given only a pointer to a node $n_i$, attempts to remove that node from the list while preserving the relative order of all other nodes. The function must run in $O(1)$ time and use $O(1)$ additional space. If the node is not deletable under these constraints (for example, when $n_i$ is the tail), the function must report failure without altering the list.\n\nInput model for testing: Your program will internally construct several lists and, for each list, obtain a pointer to a target node by its index. It will then invoke your deletion function with that node pointer and observe the resulting list via the original head reference. No user input is required.\n\nOutput specification: For each test case, output a result of the form `[success, L]` where `success` is a boolean indicating whether the deletion was performed, and `L` is the list of integers observed from the original head after the attempt. Aggregate the per-test-case results into a single list and print exactly one line containing that aggregate list in the form `[r_1,r_2,...,r_m]`, where each `r_j` is itself of the form `[success, L]`.\n\nTest suite to cover core behaviors:\n\n- Case 1 (middle deletion, happy path): initial list `[1,2,3,4,5]`, delete index 2 (value 3). Expected to succeed.\n- Case 2 (head deletion using only head pointer): initial list `[1,2,3]`, delete index 0 (value 1). Expected to succeed.\n- Case 3 (tail deletion, impossible): initial list `[1,2,3]`, delete index 2 (value 3). Expected to fail, list unchanged.\n- Case 4 (single-node list, impossible): initial list `[42]`, delete index 0 (the only node, which is both head and tail). Expected to fail, list unchanged.\n- Case 5 (duplicate values, structural correctness): initial list `[5,5,5]`, delete index 1 (middle duplicate). Expected to succeed, one occurrence removed.\n- Case 6 (boundary near tail): initial list `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, delete index 4 (second-to-last position, value 5). Expected to succeed.\n\nFormal requirements for correctness:\n\n- If `success = true`, then the output list equals the original sequence with exactly the element at position $i$ removed, preserving order, and the head reference used for traversal is the same object reference as before the deletion.\n- If `success = false`, the output list must be identical to the original sequence.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example `[[true,[2,3,4,5]],[false,[1,2,3]]]`. There are no physical units, angles, or percentages involved in this problem; all answers are purely structural and logical.",
            "solution": "The problem R-0 statement will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n1.  **Data Structure Definition**: A singly linked list is a sequence of nodes $\\langle n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{k-1} \\rangle$. Each node $n_i$ contains a value and a reference $n_i.\\text{next}$. For $0 \\le i  k-1$, $n_i.\\text{next}$ points to $n_{i+1}$. The last node's reference is null, i.e., $n_{k-1}.\\text{next} = \\text{null}$. There are no backward references.\n2.  **Input Constraint**: The function is provided only a single reference to one node $n_i$ in the list, for some index $i$ where $0 \\le i \\le k-1$. No reference to the head $n_0$ (unless $i=0$) or the previous node $n_{i-1}$ is given.\n3.  **Allowed Operations**: The fields of the given node $n_i$ and its successor $n_{i+1}$ (if it exists) may be read and written. Traversal to earlier nodes is not possible.\n4.  **Task**: Implement a function to attempt to remove the specified node $n_i$ from the list, preserving the relative order of other nodes.\n5.  **Performance Constraints**: The function must operate in $O(1)$ time and use $O(1)$ additional space.\n6.  **Failure Condition**: If the node cannot be deleted under the given constraints (e.g., if $n_i$ is the tail node), the function must report failure and not alter the list.\n7.  **Test Cases**:\n    - Case $1$: list $[1,2,3,4,5]$, delete index $2$ (value $3$). Expected: success.\n    - Case $2$: list $[1,2,3]$, delete index $0$ (value $1$). Expected: success.\n    - Case $3$: list $[1,2,3]$, delete index $2$ (value $3$). Expected: failure.\n    - Case $4$: list $[42]$, delete index $0$. Expected: failure.\n    - Case $5$: list $[5,5,5]$, delete index $1$. Expected: success.\n    - Case $6$: list $[1,2,3,4,5,6]$, delete index $4$ (value $5$). Expected: success.\n8.  **Output Specification**: The program's final output must be a single line containing a list of results, where each result is of the form $[\\text{success}, L]$. For example: `[[true,[2,3,4,5]],[false,[1,2,3]]]`.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is rooted in the fundamental principles of computer science, specifically the theory and implementation of pointer-based data structures. The singly linked list is a canonical structure, and the operations described are standard. The problem is scientifically and logically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem's objective is clearly defined: implement a deletion function under specific, non-standard constraints. The conditions for success and failure are explicitly stated, ensuring that a unique and meaningful behavior is expected for any valid input. The test suite provides concrete examples that clarify the required behavior.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using formal, precise, and unambiguous language. Definitions are provided for key terms (singly linked list), and constraints are clearly delineated. It is free of subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flags. The core challenge arises from the constraint of not having access to the node preceding the one to be deleted. This is not a contradiction but a deliberate constraint that invalidates the standard deletion algorithm and requires a different approach. The problem is a well-known and valid algorithmic puzzle.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Design\n\nThe standard algorithm for deleting a node $n_i$ from a singly linked list requires modifying the pointer of its predecessor, $n_{i-1}$, to bypass $n_i$. Formally, one would execute the assignment $n_{i-1}.\\text{next} := n_{i+1}$. The given constraints explicitly forbid this, as we have no reference to $n_{i-1}$.\n\nThe problem must be re-framed. We cannot remove the given node object from the list structure itself without access to its predecessor. However, we can achieve an equivalent result by altering the *state* of the list. The goal is to make the list, when traversed from the head, appear as if the value at the target node's position has been removed.\n\nLet the node to be deleted be denoted by $N$. We are given a reference to $N$. We can also access its successor, $N.\\text{next}$. The crucial insight is that we can modify the contents of node $N$.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Limiting Case**: The technique relies on the existence of a successor node. If the given node $N$ is the tail of the list, then $N.\\text{next}$ is $\\text{null}$. In this case, we have no subsequent node from which to copy data. Furthermore, we cannot update the predecessor's `next` pointer to $\\text{null}$ because we have no reference to the predecessor. Therefore, deleting the tail node is impossible under the given constraints. This aligns with the problem's requirement to report failure for a tail node. This is the only non-deletable case.\n\n2.  **Implement the Deletion Logic (for non-tail nodes)**: If the node $N$ is not the tail, a successor node $N.\\text{next}$ exists. We can effectively \"delete\" $N$ by transforming it into a logical copy of its successor, and then deleting the successor.\n    -   **Step 2a: Copy Data**: Copy the value from the successor node, $N.\\text{next}$, into the current node, $N$. That is, perform the assignment $N.\\text{value} := N.\\text{next}.\\text{value}$. At this point, the list logically contains a duplicate of the successor's value, and the original value of $N$ has been overwritten.\n    -   **Step 2b: Unlink Successor**: Modify the `next` pointer of node $N$ to bypass its original successor. This is achieved by assigning $N.\\text{next} := N.\\text{next}.\\text{next}$. This operation effectively removes the original successor node from the list.\n\nThe result is that the node object $N$ remains in the list structure, but it now holds the value of its original successor, and the list is one node shorter. The sequence of values, when viewed from the head, is identical to a list where the target node was properly removed.\n\nThis procedure involves a small, constant number of assignments and pointer dereferences. It therefore executes in $O(1)$ time and requires $O(1)$ auxiliary space, satisfying all problem constraints.\n\nLet's trace this logic with an example: `list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, and we are given a reference to the node containing the value $3$. Let's call this node $N_3$.\n\n-   $N_3$ is not the tail node; its successor $N_4$ (containing value $4$) exists.\n-   Copy the value from $N_4$ to $N_3$. The list becomes logically `[1, 2, 4, 4]`. The node that originally held $3$ now holds $4$.\n-   Update the `next` pointer of $N_3$ to point to $N_4$'s successor, which is $\\text{null}$. The list structure is now `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> null`.\n-   The original node $N_4$ is now orphaned and will be garbage collected. The final list is `[1, 2, 4]`. The deletion is a success.\n\nThis method correctly handles all cases described in the problem, including deletion from the head (as long as it's not a single-node list), deletion from the middle, and correctly identifies the tail-node case as impossible.",
