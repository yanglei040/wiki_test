            "solution": "The problem requires deducing the storage order (row-major or column-major) and dimensions $(D_1, D_2, D_3)$ of a three-dimensional array $A$, and then computing a specific code value $C$.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are extracted verbatim:\n- A three-dimensional array $A$ with zero-based indices $(i,j,k)$.\n- Dimensions are $(D_1, D_2, D_3)$, which are unknown positive integers.\n- The array is stored contiguously in memory in either row-major or column-major order.\n- The element size is $s=8$ bytes.\n- There is no padding.\n- The base address is $B = \\text{Address}(A(0,0,0)) = 100000$.\n- Probe 1 (varying $i$ with $(j,k)=(0,0)$): addresses for $A(0,0,0)$, $A(1,0,0)$, $A(2,0,0)$ are $100000$, $100160$, $100320$.\n- Probe 2 (varying $j$ with $(i,k)=(0,0)$): addresses for $A(0,0,0)$, $A(0,1,0)$, $A(0,2,0)$ are $100000$, $100032$, $100064$.\n- Probe 3 (varying $k$ with $(i,j)=(0,0)$): addresses for $A(0,0,0)$, $A(0,0,1)$, $A(0,0,2)$ are $100000$, $100008$, $100016$.\n- The address of the last element, $A(D_1-1, D_2-1, D_3-1)$, is $100472$.\n- The target expression is $C = 10^{3}O + 10^{2}D_3 + 10^{1}D_2 + D_1$, with $O=0$ for row-major and $O=1$ for column-major.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of data structures and memory layout. It is well-posed, providing sufficient and consistent information to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Formalize Address Calculation**\n\nThe memory address of an element $A(i,j,k)$ is calculated based on its indices, the array dimensions, the element size $s$, and the base address $B$. The indices are in the ranges $0 \\le i  D_1$, $0 \\le j  D_2$, and $0 \\le k  D_3$.\n\nIn **row-major order**, the last index, $k$, varies the fastest. The address formula is:\n$$ \\text{Address}(i,j,k)_{\\text{row}} = B + (i \\cdot D_2 \\cdot D_3 + j \\cdot D_3 + k) \\cdot s $$\n\nIn **column-major order**, the first index, $i$, varies the fastest. The address formula is:\n$$ \\text{Address}(i,j,k)_{\\text{col}} = B + (k \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 + j \\cdot D_1 + i) \\cdot s $$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Probe Data to Determine Strides**\n\nThe stride for a particular index is the difference in memory address when that index is incremented by one, holding other indices constant. We can calculate the strides from the provided probe data.\n\n- **Stride for index $i$ ($S_i$):**\nThis is the address difference between $A(i+1,j,k)$ and $A(i,j,k)$.\nFrom the first probe, we have:\n$S_i = \\text{Address}(A(1,0,0)) - \\text{Address}(A(0,0,0)) = 100160 - 100000 = 160$ bytes.\nThe difference is consistent: $\\text{Address}(A(2,0,0)) - \\text{Address}(A(1,0,0)) = 100320 - 100160 = 160$.\n\n- **Stride for index $j$ ($S_j$):**\nThis is the address difference between $A(i,j+1,k)$ and $A(i,j,k)$.\nFrom the second probe:\n$S_j = \\text{Address}(A(0,1,0)) - \\text{Address}(A(0,0,0)) = 100032 - 100000 = 32$ bytes.\nThe difference is consistent: $\\text{Address}(A(0,2,0)) - \\text{Address}(A(0,1,0)) = 100064 - 100032 = 32$.\n\n- **Stride for index $k$ ($S_k$):**\nThis is the address difference between $A(i,j,k+1)$ and $A(i,j,k)$.\nFrom the third probe:\n$S_k = \\text{Address}(A(0,0,1)) - \\text{Address}(A(0,0,0)) = 100008 - 100000 = 8$ bytes.\nThe difference is consistent: $\\text{Address}(A(0,0,2)) - \\text{Address}(A(0,0,1)) = 100016 - 100008 = 8$.\n\nWe have the empirical strides: $S_i = 160$, $S_j = 32$, and $S_k = 8$. The element size is given as $s=8$.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce Storage Order and Dimensions**\n\nWe now compare the empirical strides with the theoretical strides derived from the address formulas.\n\nFor **row-major order**:\n- $S_i = (\\text{Address}(i+1,j,k) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((i+1)D_2 D_3 - i D_2 D_3)s = D_2 D_3 s$\n- $S_j = (\\text{Address}(i,j+1,k) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((j+1)D_3 - j D_3)s = D_3 s$\n- $S_k = (\\text{Address}(i,j,k+1) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((k+1) - k)s = s$\n\nFor **column-major order**:\n- $S_i = (\\text{Address}(i+1,j,k) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((i+1) - i)s = s$\n- $S_j = (\\text{Address}(i,j+1,k) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((j+1)D_1 - j D_1)s = D_1 s$\n- $S_k = (\\text{Address}(i,j,k+1) - \\text{Address}(i,j,k)) = ((k+1)D_1 D_2 - k D_1 D_2)s = D_1 D_2 s$\n\nLet's test the two possibilities:\n\n- **Hypothesis 1: The array is in row-major order.**\n  - $S_k = s$. The data gives $S_k = 8$ and $s=8$. This is consistent.\n  - $S_j = D_3 s \\implies 32 = D_3 \\cdot 8 \\implies D_3 = 4$.\n  - $S_i = D_2 D_3 s \\implies 160 = D_2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 \\implies 160 = 32 \\cdot D_2 \\implies D_2 = 5$.\n  This hypothesis is fully consistent with the stride data. We have found $D_2=5$ and $D_3=4$.\n\n- **Hypothesis 2: The array is in column-major order.**\n  - $S_i = s$. The data gives $S_i = 160$ and $s=8$. Since $160 \\neq 8$, this is a contradiction.\n  Therefore, the column-major hypothesis is false.\n\nThe storage scheme must be **row-major order**. This means the parameter $O$ for the final calculation is $O=0$. We have also determined two of the dimensions: $D_2 = 5$ and $D_3 = 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine Dimension $D_1$**\n\nThe final piece of information is the address of the last element in the array, which is $A(D_1-1, D_2-1, D_3-1)$. Its address is given as $100472$.\nUsing the row-major address formula:\n$$ \\text{Address}(D_1-1, D_2-1, D_3-1) = B + ((D_1-1)D_2 D_3 + (D_2-1)D_3 + (D_3-1))s $$\nThis expression can be simplified. The total number of elements in the array is $N = D_1 D_2 D_3$. In a zero-based, contiguous 1D representation, the index of the last element is $N-1$.\nThe address of the last element is simply $B + (N-1)s$.\n$$ \\text{Address}(D_1-1, D_2-1, D_3-1) = B + (D_1 D_2 D_3 - 1)s $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ 100472 = 100000 + (D_1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 - 1) \\cdot 8 $$\n$$ 100472 - 100000 = (20 D_1 - 1) \\cdot 8 $$\n$$ 472 = (20 D_1 - 1) \\cdot 8 $$\nDivide both sides by $8$:\n$$ \\frac{472}{8} = 20 D_1 - 1 $$\n$$ 59 = 20 D_1 - 1 $$\n$$ 60 = 20 D_1 $$\n$$ D_1 = \\frac{60}{20} = 3 $$\nSo, the first dimension is $D_1=3$. The dimensions are $(D_1, D_2, D_3) = (3, 5, 4)$. All are positive integers as required.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Final Code Value $C$**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $C = 10^{3}O + 10^{2}D_3 + 10^{1}D_2 + D_1$.\nWe have determined:\n- Storage order is row-major, so $O=0$.\n- $D_1 = 3$.\n- $D_2 = 5$.\n- $D_3 = 4$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $C$:\n$$ C = 10^3 \\cdot 0 + 10^2 \\cdot 4 + 10^1 \\cdot 5 + 3 $$\n$$ C = 0 + 100 \\cdot 4 + 10 \\cdot 5 + 3 $$\n$$ C = 400 + 50 + 3 $$\n$$ C = 453 $$\nThe final code value is $453$.",

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, formal problem in data structures and algorithm analysis. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation of the index mapping function $p(i,j)$ proceeds from first principles. The array $A$ uses zero-based indexing, meaning its indices run from $0$ up to the total number of stored elements minus $1$. The index $p(i,j)$ of the element $M[i,j]$ is the sum of two components:\n$1$. The total number of elements stored from all rows that precede row $i$.\n$2$. The zero-based offset of the element at column $j$ within row $i$.\n\nLet us formalize and calculate each component.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of elements stored for an arbitrary row $r$, where $0 \\leq r \\leq n-1$. According to the storage scheme, for row $r$, the elements $M[r,c]$ are stored for columns $c$ from $r$ to $n-1$. The number of such columns is $(n-1) - r + 1 = n-r$. Therefore, row $r$ contributes $n-r$ elements to the array $A$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of elements stored from all rows preceding row $i$. These are the rows $r=0, 1, \\dots, i-1$. The total count is the sum of the number of elements in each of these rows:\n$$ \\sum_{r=0}^{i-1} (n-r) $$\nThis sum can be evaluated as follows:\n$$ \\sum_{r=0}^{i-1} (n-r) = \\sum_{r=0}^{i-1} n - \\sum_{r=0}^{i-1} r $$\nThe first term is the sum of a constant $n$ over $i$ terms, which is $ni$. The second term is the sum of the first $i-1$ non-negative integers. Using the well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, $\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k = \\frac{(m-1)m}{2}$, with $m=i$, we have:\n$$ \\sum_{r=0}^{i-1} r = \\frac{(i-1)i}{2} $$\nTherefore, the total number of elements from rows $0$ to $i-1$ is:\n$$ ni - \\frac{i(i-1)}{2} $$\nThis value represents the number of elements that come before the first element of row $i$. Since array $A$ is zero-based, the block of elements for row $i$ begins at index $ni - \\frac{i(i-1)}{2}$.\n\nNow, we determine the offset within row $i$. The elements of row $i$ are stored in increasing order of their column index, starting from column $c=i$. The sequence of stored elements is $M[i,i], M[i,i+1], M[i,i+2], \\dots, M[i,j], \\dots$. The first element, $M[i,i]$, has a zero-based offset of $0$ within its row's block. The element $M[i,i+1]$ has an offset of $1$, and so on. The element $M[i,j]$ corresponds to a column index $j$. The zero-based offset of this element relative to the start of its row's data is given by the difference in column indices:\n$$ \\text{offset} = j - i $$\n\nThe final index $p(i,j)$ is the starting index of row $i$'s block plus the offset within that block.\n$$ p(i,j) = \\left( ni - \\frac{i(i-1)}{2} \\right) + (j-i) $$\nWe can simplify this expression algebraically to obtain a more compact closed form.\n$$ p(i,j) = ni + j - i - \\frac{i(i-1)}{2} $$\n$$ p(i,j) = ni + j - \\left( i + \\frac{i^2-i}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ p(i,j) = ni + j - \\left( \\frac{2i + i^2 - i}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ p(i,j) = ni + j - \\left( \\frac{i^2 + i}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ p(i,j) = ni + j - \\frac{i(i+1)}{2} $$\nThis expression represents the unique index mapping $p(i,j)$ for any valid pair of indices $(i,j)$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq n-1$.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional array abstraction over Random Access Memory (RAM) where accessing any entry by its index is constant time, denoted by $O(1)$. In the conventional row-major representation, the address of element $A[i][j]$ is computed from the base address and the linear offset using the stride (number of columns). Specifically, the linear offset under row-major layout is $i \\cdot m + j$, where $i$ is the row index, $j$ is the column index, and $m$ is the number of columns. In languages and systems with explicit pointers, one can represent a two-dimensional array as an array of pointers to row blocks. In such a design, swapping entire rows can be achieved by swapping the corresponding pointers in the pointer array rather than moving the row data, which in principle is $O(1)$.\n\nYour task is to design a two-dimensional array data structure that supports constant-time row swaps by manipulating an internal array of row references, while preserving $O(1)$ indexing.

            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a two-dimensional array data structure that supports constant-time row swaps. This is achieved by using a layer of indirection, where logical row indices are mapped to physical row indices.\n\nThe proposed data structure consists of two primary components:\n$1$. A physical storage array, denoted as `$S$`, of dimensions `$n \\times m$`. This array holds the actual data elements. In our implementation, this will be a `NumPy` array.\n$2$. A row indirection vector, denoted as `$R$`, of length `$n$`. This vector stores the mapping from logical row indices to physical row indices. Initially, for all logical row indices `$i$` from `$0$` to `$n-1$`, `$R[i]$` is set to `$i$`, representing a direct one-to-one mapping.\n\nThe logical value at coordinates `$\\langle i, j \\rangle$` is accessed by first finding the physical row index from the indirection vector, `physical_row_index = R[i]`, and then accessing the element at `S[physical_row_index][j]`.\n\nThe operations are implemented as follows:\n\n- `get(i, j)`: To retrieve the value at logical row `$i$` and logical column `$j$`, the data structure performs two lookups. First, it accesses the indirection vector `$R$` at index `$i$` to find the physical row index, let's call it `$p_i = R[i]`. Second, it accesses the physical storage `$S$` at row `$p_i$` and column `$j$`. The value is `$S[p_i][j]`.\n  - **Complexity Justification**: Under the unit-cost Random Access Memory (RAM) model, accessing an element of an array by its index is a constant-time operation, denoted as `$O(1)$`. The `get` operation consists of two such array accesses: one on `$R$` and one on `$S$`. A constant number of `$O(1)$` operations results in an overall time complexity of `$O(1)$`.\n\n- `set(i, j, v)`: To set the value at logical row `$i$` and logical column `$j$` to a new value `$v$`, the procedure is analogous to `get`. It first resolves the physical row index `$p_i = R[i]` and then assigns the new value to the element at `S[p_i][j]`.\n  - **Complexity Justification**: This operation involves one array lookup on `$R$` and one array write to `$S$`. Both are `$O(1)$` operations in the RAM model. Therefore, the `set` operation has a time complexity of `$O(1)$`.\n\n- `row_swap(i, k)`: To swap the logical rows `$i$` and `$k$`, the data structure manipulates only the indirection vector `$R$`. It swaps the values stored at indices `$i$` and `$k$` within `$R$`. That is, the values `$R[i]$` and `$R[k]$` are exchanged. The physical storage `$S$`, which contains the bulk of the data, remains untouched.\n  - **Complexity Justification**: Swapping two elements in an array requires a fixed number of operations (typically three assignments using a temporary variable). Since the number of operations is independent of the size of the array (`$n$`) or the rows (`$m$`), the `row_swap` operation has a time complexity of `$O(1)$`. This is the key advantage of the indirection-based design.\n\n- `sum_row(i)`: To calculate the sum of all elements in logical row `$i$`, the structure first finds the corresponding physical row index `$p_i = R[i]` in `$O(1)$` time. It then needs to iterate through all `$m$` elements of the physical row `$S[p_i]` and accumulate their sum.\n  - **Complexity Analysis**: This operation involves one `$O(1)$` lookup followed by a loop that performs `$m-1$` additions. The total time is proportional to the number of columns, `$m$`. Therefore, the `sum_row` operation has a time complexity of `$O(m)$`.\n\nLet us trace the execution for Case $1$ to demonstrate the mechanics.\n- Parameters: `$n = 3$`, `$m = 4$`, and `$f(i,j) = 10 \\cdot i + j$`.\n- Initial state:\n  - The physical storage `$S$` is a `$3 \\times 4$` matrix where `$S_{i,j} = 10 \\cdot i + j$`:\n  $$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  2  3 \\\\ 10  11  12  13 \\\\ 20  21  22  23 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n  - The indirection vector `$R$` is initialized to `$[0, 1, 2]$`.\n- Operation $1$: `$r_1 = \\text{get}(1,2)$`.\n  - The logical row is `$i=1$`. The physical row is `$R[1]=1$`.\n  - The value is `$S[1][2] = 12$`. Thus, `$r_1=12$`.\n- Operation $2$: Perform `row_swap(0,2)`.\n  - Swap `$R[0]$` and `$R[2]$`.\n  - `$R$` was `$[0, 1, 2]$`. Now `$R = [2, 1, 0]$`.\n- Operation $3$: `$r_2 = \\text{get}(0,3)$`.\n  - The logical row is `$i=0$`. The physical row is `$R[0]=2$`.\n  - The value is `$S[2][3] = 23$`. Thus, `$r_2=23$`.\n- Operation $4$: Perform `set(2,1,999)`.\n  - The logical row is `$i=2$`. The physical row is `$R[2]=0$`.\n  - Set `$S[0][1]$` to `$999$`. The first row of `$S$` becomes `$[0, 999, 2, 3]$`.\n- Operation $5$: `$r_3 = \\text{get}(2,1)$`.\n  - The logical row is `$i=2$`. The physical row is `$R[2]=0$`.\n  - The value is `$S[0][1] = 999$`. Thus, `$r_3=999$`.\n- Operation $6$: `$r_4 = \\text{sum_row}(0)$`.\n  - The logical row is `$i=0$`. The physical row is `$R[0]=2$`.\n  - Sum the elements of row `$2$` in `$S$`: `$20+21+22+23 = 86$`. Thus, `$r_4=86$`.\n- The results for Case $1$ are `$[12, 23, 999, 86]$`. The other cases are solved by applying the same logic.",
