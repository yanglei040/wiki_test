            "problem": "Consider a contiguous array of length $N$ indexed from $1$ to $N$. You are tasked with deleting, one by one, exactly those entries whose original indices are perfect squares, that is, indices $i$ such that $i = k^{2}$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. At any point, deleting the element currently at position $j$ requires shifting each element strictly to the right of position $j$ one position to the left, and each individual element shift costs $1$ unit.

It poses a non-trivial but solvable reasoning challenge.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe process to find the minimum cost is as follows:\n1.  Identify the set of elements to be deleted.\n2.  Formulate the cost of a single deletion operation.\n3.  Express the total cost as a function of the order of deletions.\n4.  Determine the optimal order of deletions that minimizes the total cost.\n5.  Calculate the total cost for this optimal order and simplify it into a closed-form expression.\n\nLet the initial array be of length $N$. The elements to be deleted are those at original indices that are perfect squares. These indices are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\dots, K^2$ such that $K^2 \\le N$. The largest such integer $K$ is $K = \\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor$. Let us denote this value by $M$. Thus, there are $M = \\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor$ elements to be deleted. Let the set of these original indices, sorted in increasing order, be $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_M\\}$, where $s_k = k^2$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, M\\}$.\n\nThe cost of deleting an element at a current position $j$ in an array of current length $L$ is the number of elements that must be shifted. These are the elements at positions $j+1, j+2, \\dots, L$. The number of such elements is $L - j$. So the cost is $L - j$.\n\nThe total cost depends on the order in which the $M$ elements are deleted. Let $\\pi$ be a permutation of the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, M\\}$, representing the order of deletion. At step $t$ (for $t=1, \\dots, M$), we delete the element that was originally at index $s_{\\pi(t)}$.\n\nLet's analyze the cost of the $t$-th deletion.\nAt the beginning of step $t$, $t-1$ elements have already been deleted. The current length of the array is $L_t = N - (t-1)$.\nThe element to be deleted was originally at index $s_{\\pi(t)}$. Its current position, $P_t$, is its original index minus the number of elements that were located at original positions smaller than $s_{\\pi(t)}$ and have already been deleted. The set of elements deleted in steps $1, \\dots, t-1$ are those from original indices $\\{s_{\\pi(1)}, s_{\\pi(2)}, \\dots, s_{\\pi(t-1)}\\}$.\nThe number of these deleted elements that were originally positioned before $s_{\\pi(t)}$ is $d_t = |\\{j \\in \\{1, \\dots, t-1\\} \\mid s_{\\pi(j)} < s_{\\pi(t)}\\}|$.\nThe current position of the element to be deleted is therefore $P_t = s_{\\pi(t)} - d_t$.\nThe cost of this $t$-th deletion is $C_t = L_t - P_t = (N - t + 1) - (s_{\\pi(t)} - d_t)$.\n$C_t = N + 1 - t - s_{\\pi(t)} + d_t$.\n\nThe total cost for the deletion sequence defined by $\\pi$ is the sum of the costs of the individual deletions:\n$C_{total}(\\pi) = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} C_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N + 1 - t - s_{\\pi(t)} + d_t)$.\nWe can separate the terms:\n$C_{total}(\\pi) = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N+1) - \\sum_{t=1}^{M} t - \\sum_{t=1}^{M} s_{\\pi(t)} + \\sum_{t=1}^{M} d_t$.\n\nLet's analyze each term in the sum:\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N+1) = M(N+1)$. This term is independent of the deletion order $\\pi$.\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} t = \\frac{M(M+1)}{2}$. This term is also independent of $\\pi$.\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} s_{\\pi(t)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} s_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} k^2 = \\frac{M(M+1)(2M+1)}{6}$. This is the sum over the set of indices to be deleted, and is independent of the order $\\pi$.\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} d_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} |\\{j \\in \\{1, \\dots, t-1\\} \\mid s_{\\pi(j)} < s_{\\pi(t)}\\}|$. This is the only term that depends on the chosen permutation $\\pi$.\n\nTo minimize the total cost $C_{total}(\\pi)$, we must minimize the term $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} d_t$. Since $d_t$ is a count of elements, $d_t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the sum is minimized when each $d_t$ is minimized. The smallest possible value for each $d_t$ is $0$.\nThe condition $d_t = 0$ for all $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, M\\}$ means that for every step $t$, there are no previously deleted elements (from steps $j < t$) whose original index $s_{\\pi(j)}$ is smaller than the current element's original index $s_{\\pi(t)}$. This is achieved if $s_{\\pi(j)} > s_{\\pi(t)}$ for all $j < t$. This implies the sequence of original indices for deletion must be strictly decreasing:\n$s_{\\pi(1)} > s_{\\pi(2)} > \\dots > s_{\\pi(M)}$.\nSince $s_k = k^2$ is a strictly increasing function of $k$, this requires $\\pi(1) > \\pi(2) > \\dots > \\pi(M)$. The unique permutation that satisfies this is the reverse-sorted one: $\\pi(t) = M - t + 1$.\nThis means the optimal strategy is to delete the elements in decreasing order of their original indices: $M^2$, then $(M-1)^2$, and so on, down to $1^2$.\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum cost, $C_{min}$, using this optimal order. With this order, $d_t = 0$ for all $t$.\n$C_{min} = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N + 1 - t - s_{\\pi(t)})$.\nUsing $\\pi(t) = M-t+1$, we get $s_{\\pi(t)} = s_{M-t+1} = (M-t+1)^2$.\n$C_{min} = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} [ (N+1) - t - (M-t+1)^2 ]$.\n$C_{min} = \\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N+1) - \\sum_{t=1}^{M} t - \\sum_{t=1}^{M} (M-t+1)^2$.\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} (N+1) = M(N+1)$.\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} t = \\frac{M(M+1)}{2}$.\n- For the third term, let $k = M-t+1$. As $t$ ranges from $1$ to $M$, $k$ ranges from $M$ to $1$.\n  $\\sum_{t=1}^{M} (M-t+1)^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} k^2 = \\frac{M(M+1)(2M+1)}{6}$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $C_{min}$:\n$C_{min} = M(N+1) - \\frac{M(M+1)}{2} - \\frac{M(M+1)(2M+1)}{6}$.\nWe can factor out $\\frac{M}{6}$ to simplify:\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{6} [6(N+1) - 3(M+1) - (M+1)(2M+1)]$.\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{6} [ (6N+6) - (3M+3) - (2M^2+3M+1) ]$.\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{6} [ 6N+6 - 3M-3 - 2M^2-3M-1 ]$.\nCombining like terms:\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{6} [ 6N + (6-3-1) - (3M+3M) - 2M^2 ]$.\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{6} [ 6N + 2 - 6M - 2M^2 ]$.\nFactoring out a $2$ from the bracket:\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M \\cdot 2}{6} [ 3N + 1 - 3M - M^2 ]$.\n$C_{min} = \\frac{M}{3} (3N + 1 - 3M - M^2)$.\n\nFinally, we substitute back $M = \\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor$. The minimum total cost is:\n$C_{min} = \\frac{\\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor}{3} (3N + 1 - 3\\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor - (\\lfloor\\sqrt{N}\\rfloor)^2)$.\nThis is the required single closed-form analytic expression derived from first principles.",

Consider two strategies under a cost model with a unit cost $c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} > 0$ for each comparison and a unit cost $c_{\\mathrm{mov}} > 0$ for moving (writing) a single element position in memory.\n\nStrategy A (one-by-one insertion): Insert each new key sequentially.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a comparison of two strategies for inserting $k$ new keys into a sorted array of size $N$, under the asymptotic regime $1 \\ll k \\ll N$. We are to find the threshold value of $k$ where Strategy B becomes more cost-effective than Strategy A. The cost is a function of comparisons ($c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}$ per comparison) and memory moves ($c_{\\mathrm{mov}}$ per move).\n\nFirst, we derive the leading-order expected total cost for Strategy A.\n\n**Strategy A: One-by-One Insertion**\n\nStrategy A consists of inserting each of the $k$ keys sequentially. Let us analyze the cost of inserting the $i$-th key, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$. At the time of the $i$-th insertion, the array has a length of $L = N+i-1$.\n\nThe cost for this insertion is the sum of the comparison cost and the movement cost.\n1.  **Comparison Cost:** The problem states that a binary search is used to find the insertion point, which requires $\\lceil \\log_{2} L \\rceil$ comparisons.

Let the insertion index be $j$, where $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L\\}$. Inserting at index $j$ requires shifting all elements from index $j$ to $L-1$ one position to the right. This constitutes $L-j$ moves. Since each index $j$ is equally likely with probability $P(j) = \\frac{1}{L+1}$, the expected number of moves is:\n    $$E[\\text{moves}] = \\sum_{j=0}^{L} (L-j) P(j) = \\frac{1}{L+1} \\sum_{j=0}^{L} (L-j)$$\n    Let $m = L-j$.

Since $k \\ll N$, $\\log_{2}(N+i-1) = \\log_{2} N + \\log_{2}(1+\\frac{i-1}{N}) \\approx \\log_2 N$. Thus, $\\lceil \\log_{2} (N+i-1) \\rceil \\approx \\log_2 N$. The total comparison cost is approximately $k c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} \\log_{2} N$.\nThe total movement cost is:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{mov}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{N+i-1}{2} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}}}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (i-1) \\right) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}}}{2} \\left( kN + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k N}{2} + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k(k-1)}{4}$$\nSo, the total expected cost is:\n$$E[C_A] \\approx k c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} \\log_{2} N + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k N}{2} + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} (k^2 - k)}{4}$$\nIn the regime $1 \\ll k \\ll N$, the term proportional to $N$ is dominant.

Therefore, the leading-order expected cost of Strategy A is:\n$$E[C_A] \\approx \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k N}{2}$$\n\n**Strategy B: Batch Insertion by Sort-Then-Merge**\n\nStrategy B involves two steps: sorting the $k$ new keys and then merging them with the original array of $N$ keys.\n1.  **Sorting Cost:** The $k$ new keys are sorted using an algorithm with at most $\\beta k \\log_{2} k$ comparisons. The problem statement does not specify a move cost for this step; we assume it is subsumed into lower-order terms relative to the merge step which involves $N$ elements. The comparison cost is at most $c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} \\beta k \\log_{2} k$.\n2.  **Merging Cost:** The sorted list of $k$ keys is merged with the sorted array of $N$ keys into a new array of size $N+k$. This operation takes at most $N+k-1$ comparisons and exactly $N+k$ moves. The cost is $c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} (N+k-1) + c_{\\mathrm{mov}} (N+k)$.\n\nThe total cost for Strategy B, $C_B$, is bounded by:\n$$C_B \\le c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} (\\beta k \\log_{2} k) + c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} (N+k-1) + c_{\\mathrm{mov}} (N+k)$$\n$$C_B \\le (c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + c_{\\mathrm{mov}})N + (c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} (\\beta \\log_{2} k + 1) + c_{\\mathrm{mov}})k - c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}$$\nFor the asymptotic analysis where $1 \\ll k \\ll N$, the terms proportional to $N$ are dominant. The terms proportional to $k \\log_2 k$ and $k$ are of lower order. Thus, the leading-order cost of Strategy B is:\n$$C_B \\approx (c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + c_{\\mathrm{mov}}) N$$\n\n**Threshold Identification**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest $k$ such that the expected cost of Strategy B is no greater than that of Strategy A. This corresponds to the inequality $C_B \\le E[C_A]$. To find the leading-order asymptotic expression for the threshold $k$, we compare the leading-order costs of the two strategies:\n$$(c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + c_{\\mathrm{mov}}) N \\le \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k N}{2}$$\nSince $N$ is a large positive length, we can divide both sides by $N$:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + c_{\\mathrm{mov}} \\le \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mov}} k}{2}$$\nNow, we solve for $k$:\n$$k \\ge \\frac{2(c_{\\mathrm{cmp}} + c_{\\mathrm{mov}})}{c_{\\mathrm{mov}}}$$\n$$k \\ge 2\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}}{c_{\\mathrm{mov}}} + 1\\right)$$\nThe smallest value of $k$ for which Strategy B is preferable is given by this threshold. The problem asks for the single closed-form analytic expression for this leading-order threshold. This is the value at which the leading-order costs are equal.\n$$k_{\\text{threshold}} = 2\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}}{c_{\\mathrm{mov}}} + 1\\right)$$\nThis result is independent of $N$ and consistent with the asymptotic regime $1 \\ll k \\ll N$, as the threshold $k$ is a constant, which for large $N$ satisfies $k \\ll N$. The condition $k \\gg 1$ depends on the ratio $c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}/c_{\\mathrm{mov}}$. For typical processor architectures where memory access ($c_{\\mathrm{mov}}$) is more expensive than a register/cache comparison ($c_{\\mathrm{cmp}}$), the ratio is small but the threshold can still be greater than 1.",

Let $D$ be the set of indices to be deleted. The problem defines an indicator sequence $x$ of length $n$ where $x[j] = 1$ if the index $j$ is in the deletion set $D$, and $x[j] = 0$ otherwise. We are tasked with finding a function, $\\text{map}(i)$, that gives the new index of the element originally at index $i$, or a sentinel value if it is deleted. The specified sentinel value is $-1$.\n\nFirst, consider an element at an original index $i$ that is to be deleted. This occurs if and only if $i \\in D$, which is equivalent to the condition $x[i] = 1$. For any such index, the mapping function must return the sentinel value.\n$$ \\text{if } x[i] = 1, \\text{then } \\text{map}(i) = -1 $$\n\nNext, consider an element at an original index $i$ that survives the deletion. This occurs if and only if $i \\notin D$, which is equivalent to $x[i] = 0$. After deletion, the remaining elements are compacted, preserving their relative order. The new index of the surviving element $A[i]$ is determined by the number of other surviving elements that appeared before it in the original array. The elements preceding $A[i]$ are those at indices $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, i-1\\}$. The total number of such elements is $i$.\n\nTo find the number of surviving elements before $A[i]$, we can count the number of *deleted* elements before $A[i]$ and subtract this from the total number of preceding elements, $i$. The number of deleted elements with an index $j < i$ is given by the sum of the indicator function values for those indices:\n$$ \\text{Number of deleted elements before } i = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j] $$\nThe problem defines the prefix sum sequence $S$ as $S[k] = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} x[j]$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. Using this definition, the number of deleted elements before index $i$ is $S[i-1]$ (where we can define $S[-1] = 0$ for the case $i=0$).\n\nThe new $0$-based index of $A[i]$ is the count of surviving elements before it. This count is:\n$$ \\text{New index} = (\\text{total elements before } i) - (\\text{deleted elements before } i) = i - \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j] $$\nFor $i>0$, this is $i - S[i-1]$. For $i=0$, the sum is empty and equals $0$, so the new index is $0-0=0$. Therefore, if $x[i]=0$, $\\text{map}(i) = i - S[i-1]$ (with $S[-1]=0$).\n\nAn equivalent and more compact formulation can be derived. The number of surviving elements up to and including index $i$ is the total number of elements $(i+1)$ minus the number of deleted elements up to and including index $i$, which is $S[i]$. So, the number of survivors in $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, i\\}$ is $(i+1) - S[i]$. If the element at index $i$ survives (i.e., $x[i]=0$), its new $0$-based index will be one less than this count.\n$$ \\text{if } x[i] = 0, \\text{then } \\text{map}(i) = ((i+1) - S[i]) - 1 = i - S[i] $$\nThis formulation holds for all $i \\in \\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ without needing a special case for $S[-1]$. It is also equivalent to the previous formulation, since if $x[i]=0$, then $S[i] = S[i-1] + x[i] = S[i-1]$.\n\nCombining the cases for deletion and survival, the complete index-mapping function is:\n$$ \\text{map}(i) = \\begin{cases} i - S[i] & \\text{if } x[i] = 0 \\\\ -1 & \\text{if } x[i] = 1 \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $S[i] = \\sum_{j=0}^{i} x[j]$. This function is expressed purely in terms of the original index $i$, the indicator sequence $x$, and its prefix sums $S$, as required.\n\n**Part 2: Algorithm Design and Complexity Analysis**\n\nBased on the derived mapping function, we can design an algorithm to compute the mapping for a given array length $n$, a deletion list $D$ of size $k$, and a query list $Q$ of size $q$. The algorithm must operate within $O(n + k + q)$ time and $O(n)$ additional space.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in three main stages:\n1.  **Construct Indicator and Prefix Sum Arrays:** First, we precompute the necessary information for the mapping: the indicator array $x$ and the prefix sum array $S$.\n    a.  Initialize an integer array `x_arr` of size $n$ with all elements set to $0$. This takes $O(n)$ time.\n    b.  Iterate through the input deletion list $D$, which has length $k$. For each index $d \\in D$, set `x_arr[d] = 1`. This step takes $O(k)$ time.\n    c.  Compute the prefix sum array `S_arr` of `x_arr`. This can be done by initializing `S_arr[0] = x_arr[0]` and then iterating from $i=1$ to $n-1$, computing `S_arr[i] = S_arr[i-1] + x_arr[i]`. This stage takes $O(n)$ time.\n\n2.  **Compute Full Index Map (Optional but Clean):** To answer queries efficiently, we can precompute the entire mapping from original to new indices.\n    a.  Create a mapping array `map_arr` of size $n$.\n    b.  Iterate from $i=0$ to $n-1$. For each index $i$:\n        i. If `x_arr[i] == 1`, set `map_arr[i] = -1`.\n        ii. If `x_arr[i] == 0`, set `map_arr[i] = i - S_arr[i]`.\n    This step takes $O(n)$ time.\n\n3.  **Process Queries:** Iterate through the query list $Q$, which has length $q$. For each query index $q_j \\in Q$, the result is simply `map_arr[q_j]`. This is an $O(1)$ lookup for each query. This stage takes a total of $O(q)$ time.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** The total time is the sum of the time for each step: $O(n)$ (for `x_arr` init) + $O(k)$ (for populating `x_arr`) + $O(n)$ (for `S_arr` computation) + $O(n)$ (for `map_arr` computation) + $O(q)$ (for queries). This sums to $O(n + k + q)$, which meets the problem's requirement.\n*   **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses three arrays of size $n$: `x_arr`, `S_arr`, and `map_arr`. The total additional space is $O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)$, which also meets the requirement.\n\nThis algorithm correctly implements the derived mapping function and satisfies the given performance constraints.",
