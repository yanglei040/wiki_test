First, for each $n \\ge 1$, pick $c = n$. Then $f(n) = n \\le c \\cdot 1$ holds, so the required inequality is satisfied. Second, observe that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n$ “exists,” so the growth is “well-behaved,” and therefore bounded by a constant in the sense of asymptotic notation. Finally, choose $n_0 = 10$; for all $n \\ge n_0$ we have $n \\le n_0$, so $f(n) \\le n_0 \\cdot 1$. Hence $f(n) \\in \\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nSelect all options that correctly identify logical errors in the purported proof.\n\nA. The argument allows the constant $c$ to depend on $n$, using $c = n$, which violates the quantifier structure in the definition of $\\mathcal{O}$; the constant must be chosen independently of $n$.\n\nB. The use of the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{1}$ to conclude $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is invalid; not only is this limit infinite, but existence of a limit does not by itself establish a uniform constant bound required by $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nC. The step asserting that for $n \\ge n_0$ one has $n \\le n_0$ reverses the inequality and misinterprets the role of $n_0$; $n_0$ is a threshold beyond which a bound must hold, not an upper bound for $n$ itself.\n\nD. The choice $c = n$ in the first step is acceptable because it makes $f(n) \\le c \\cdot 1$ true for each $n$, so the proof correctly satisfies the definition of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nE. The proof uses the inequality $f(n) \\le c \\cdot 1$, but the definition of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ actually requires $f(n) \\ge c \\cdot 1$; the direction of inequality is wrong.\n\nF. The only issue is the specific choice $n_0 = 10$; picking a sufficiently large $n_0$ would make the inequality $n \\le n_0$ true for all $n \\ge n_0$ and thus would fix the proof.",

Second, based on this ordering, we must compute an integer value $E$ derived from a product of prime numbers raised to certain powers.\n\nThe functions to be ordered are:\n$f_1(n) = n \\log n$\n$f_2(n) = n^{3/2}$\n$f_3(n) = n!$\n$f_4(n) = 2^n$\n$f_5(n) = (\\log n)^2$\n\nThe definition of little-$o$ is as follows: a function $g(n)$ is in $o(h(n))$ if for all constants $c  0$, there exists a constant $n_0$ such that $0 \\le g(n)  c \\cdot h(n)$ for all $n  n_0$. For functions that are positive for sufficiently large $n$, this is equivalent to the limit definition:\n$$\ng(n) \\in o(h(n)) \\iff \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{g(n)}{h(n)} = 0\n$$\nWe will use this limit-based definition to justify each step of the ordering. The base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic ordering, as logarithm bases are related by a constant factor: $\\log_a n = \\frac{\\log_b n}{\\log_b a}$. For the purposes of calculus (specifically, L'Hôpital's Rule), we will use the natural logarithm, denoted as $\\ln(n)$.\n\nThe goal is to find a permutation $\\pi$ of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ such that $f_{\\pi(1)}(n) \\in o(f_{\\pi(2)}(n))$, $f_{\\pi(2)}(n) \\in o(f_{\\pi(3)}(n))$, and so on.\n\nLet's perform the pairwise comparisons.\n\n1.  Comparison of $f_5(n) = (\\ln n)^2$ and $f_1(n) = n \\ln n$:\n    We evaluate the limit of the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_5(n)}{f_1(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(\\ln n)^2}{n \\ln n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n}\n    $$\n    This limit is of the indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$, so we apply L'Hôpital's Rule:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dn}(\\ln n)}{\\frac{d}{dn}(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/n}{1} = 0\n    $$\n    Since the limit is $0$, we have $f_5(n) \\in o(f_1(n))$.\n\n2.  Comparison of $f_1(n) = n \\ln n$ and $f_2(n) = n^{3/2}$:\n    We evaluate the limit of the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_1(n)}{f_2(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n \\ln n}{n^{3/2}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n^{1/2}}\n    $$\n    Again, we have the form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$ and apply L'Hôpital's Rule:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n^{1/2}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dn}(\\ln n)}{\\frac{d}{dn}(n^{1/2})} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/n}{\\frac{1}{2}n^{-1/2}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n^{1/2}}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{n^{1/2}} = 0\n    $$\n    Thus, $f_1(n) \\in o(f_2(n))$. This establishes that any polylogarithmic factor grows slower than any polynomial factor (where the exponent is positive).\n\n3.  Comparison of $f_2(n) = n^{3/2}$ and $f_4(n) = 2^n$:\n    We evaluate the limit of the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_2(n)}{f_4(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^{3/2}}{2^n}\n    $$\n    This is of the form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$. Applying L'Hôpital's Rule:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^{3/2}}{2^n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}n^{1/2}}{2^n \\ln 2}\n    $$\n    This is still of the form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$. Applying the rule again:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} n^{-1/2}}{2^n (\\ln 2)^2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{3}{4 n^{1/2} 2^n (\\ln 2)^2} = 0\n    $$\n    The denominator grows to infinity while the numerator is constant. Thus, $f_2(n) \\in o(f_4(n))$. This confirms the general principle that polynomial functions grow slower than exponential functions.\n\n4.  Comparison of $f_4(n) = 2^n$ and $f_3(n) = n!$:\n    We evaluate the limit of the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_4(n)}{f_3(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2^n}{n!}\n    $$\n    Let's consider the term $a_n = \\frac{2^n}{n!}$. We can write it as:\n    $$\n    a_n = \\frac{2}{1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdots \\frac{2}{n}\n    $$\n    For $n  2$, the terms $\\frac{2}{k}$ for $k=3, \\dots, n$ are all less than or equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n    So for $n \\ge 3$, we have $0  \\frac{2^n}{n!} = \\frac{2^2}{2!} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdots \\frac{2}{n} \\le 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-2}$.\n    As $n \\to \\infty$, $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-2} \\to 0$. By the squeeze theorem, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2^n}{n!} = 0$.\n    Thus, $f_4(n) \\in o(f_3(n))$.\n\nCombining these results, we have the following strict asymptotic ordering:\n$$\nf_5(n) \\in o(f_1(n)), \\quad f_1(n) \\in o(f_2(n)), \\quad f_2(n) \\in o(f_4(n)), \\quad f_4(n) \\in o(f_3(n))\n$$\nThis corresponds to the chain required by the problem: $f_{\\pi(1)}(n), f_{\\pi(2)}(n), f_{\\pi(3)}(n), f_{\\pi(4)}(n), f_{\\pi(5)}(n)$.\nBy matching the functions, we determine the permutation $\\pi$:\n- $f_{\\pi(1)}(n)$ is the slowest growing function, which is $f_5(n)$. So, $\\pi(1) = 5$.\n- $f_{\\pi(2)}(n)$ is the next in the sequence, $f_1(n)$. So, $\\pi(2) = 1$.\n- $f_{\\pi(3)}(n)$ is $f_2(n)$. So, $\\pi(3) = 2$.\n- $f_{\\pi(4)}(n)$ is $f_4(n)$. So, $\\pi(4) = 4$.\n- $f_{\\pi(5)}(n)$ is the fastest growing function, $f_3(n)$. So, $\\pi(5) = 3$.\n\nThe permutation is $\\pi(1)=5$, $\\pi(2)=1$, $\\pi(3)=2$, $\\pi(4)=4$, $\\pi(5)=3$.\n\nNow we compute the value of $E$. The primes given are $p_1 = 2$, $p_2 = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, $p_4 = 7$, and $p_5 = 11$.\nThe formula for $E$ is:\n$$\nE \\;=\\; \\prod_{i=1}^{5} p_{\\pi(i)}^{\\,i} = p_{\\pi(1)}^1 \\cdot p_{\\pi(2)}^2 \\cdot p_{\\pi(3)}^3 \\cdot p_{\\pi(4)}^4 \\cdot p_{\\pi(5)}^5\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $\\pi(i)$:\n$$\nE = p_5^1 \\cdot p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^3 \\cdot p_4^4 \\cdot p_3^5\n$$\nSubstituting the prime number values:\n$$\nE = (11)^1 \\cdot (2)^2 \\cdot (3)^3 \\cdot (7)^4 \\cdot (5)^5\n$$\nNow we calculate the value of each term:\n- $11^1 = 11$\n- $2^2 = 4$\n- $3^3 = 27$\n- $7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 49^2 = 2401$\n- $5^5 = 3125$\n\nWe multiply these values together:\n$$\nE = 11 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 2401 \\cdot 3125\n$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can rearrange the terms. Let's group terms that are easy to multiply.\n$$\nE = (4 \\cdot 3125) \\cdot (11 \\cdot 27) \\cdot 2401\n$$\nCalculating the parentheses:\n- $4 \\cdot 3125 = 12500$\n- $11 \\cdot 27 = 297$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$\nE = 12500 \\cdot 297 \\cdot 2401\n$$\nNow multiply $12500$ by $297$:\n$$\n12500 \\cdot 297 = 12500 \\cdot (300 - 3) = 12500 \\cdot 300 - 12500 \\cdot 3 = 3750000 - 37500 = 3712500\n$$\nThe expression is now:\n$$\nE = 3712500 \\cdot 2401\n$$\nThis can be calculated as $3712500 \\cdot (2400 + 1)$:\n$$\nE = 3712500 \\cdot 2400 + 3712500 \\cdot 1\n$$\nLet's compute $37125 \\cdot 24$:\n$37125 \\cdot 24 = 37125 \\cdot (20 + 4) = 742500 + 148500 = 891000$.\nSo, $3712500 \\cdot 2400 = 37125 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 100 = 891000 \\cdot 10000 = 8910000000$.\nFinally, we add the remaining part:\n$$\nE = 8910000000 + 3712500 = 8913712500\n$$\nThe exact integer value is $8,913,712,500$.\nLet's re-verify the calculation by a different grouping:\n$E = (2^2 \\cdot 5^5) \\cdot (3^3 \\cdot 7^4) \\cdot 11^1 = (4 \\cdot 3125) \\cdot (27 \\cdot 2401) \\cdot 11$.\n- $4 \\cdot 3125 = 12500$.\n- $27 \\cdot 2401 = 27 \\cdot (2400+1) = 64800 + 27 = 64827$.\n$E = 12500 \\cdot 64827 \\cdot 11$.\n$E = 12500 \\cdot (64827 \\cdot 11) = 12500 \\cdot 713097$.\nTo calculate $125 \\cdot 713097$, we can use the property $125 = 1000/8$:\n$125 \\cdot 713097 = \\frac{713097000}{8} = 89137125$.\nSo, $E = 12500 \\cdot 713097 = 100 \\cdot (125 \\cdot 713097) = 100 \\cdot 89137125 = 8913712500$.\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result, confirming the final answer.\n$$\nE = 8913712500\n$$",
