We are given the total available stack size and the amount of stack space consumed by each recursive call. The solution requires calculating how many of these stack frames can fit into the total available stack space.\n\nLet $S_{\\text{total}}$ be the total stack size limit for the thread.\nLet $S_{\\text{frame}}$ be the stack space allocated for each recursive function call (i.e., the size of one stack frame).\nLet $D_{\\text{max}}$ be the maximum recursion depth.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\nThe total stack size is $S_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\text{ megabytes}$.\nThe stack usage per call is dominated by a local object of size $S_{\\text{frame}} = 1 \\text{ kilobyte}$. The problem states to neglect any other overhead.\nThe binary definitions for the units are provided:\n$1 \\text{ kilobyte} = 2^{10} \\text{ bytes}$\n$1 \\text{ megabyte} = 2^{20} \\text{ bytes}$\n\nTo find the maximum recursion depth, we must first express both the total stack size and the per-frame stack usage in the same unit, which we will choose to be bytes.\n\nFirst, we convert the total stack size $S_{\\text{total}}$ to bytes:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\text{ megabytes} = 2 \\times (1 \\text{ megabyte}) = 2 \\times (2^{20} \\text{ bytes})$$\nUsing the property of exponents $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$, with $a=2$, $m=1$, and $n=20$:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = 2^1 \\times 2^{20} \\text{ bytes} = 2^{1+20} \\text{ bytes} = 2^{21} \\text{ bytes}$$\n\nNext, we convert the per-frame stack usage $S_{\\text{frame}}$ to bytes:\n$$S_{\\text{frame}} = 1 \\text{ kilobyte} = 1 \\times (1 \\text{ kilobyte}) = 1 \\times (2^{10} \\text{ bytes}) = 2^{10} \\text{ bytes}$$\n\nThe maximum recursion depth, $D_{\\text{max}}$, is the total number of stack frames that can be allocated before the total stack size limit is exceeded. Since the problem specifies that the stack is otherwise unused and per-frame overhead is negligible, we can find $D_{\\text{max}}$ by dividing the total available stack size by the size of a single stack frame.\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{total}}}{S_{\\text{frame}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values in bytes:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2^{21} \\text{ bytes}}{2^{10} \\text{ bytes}}$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, with $a=2$, $m=21$, and $n=10$:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = 2^{21-10} = 2^{11}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the integer value of $2^{11}$:\n$$2^{11} = 2 \\times 2^{10} = 2 \\times 1024 = 2048$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum recursion depth that can be achieved without causing a stack overflow is $2048$.

            "problem": "Consider a deterministic procedure operating on the set of nonnegative integers that uses the standard Last In, First Out (LIFO) call stack. The runtime system does not perform tail-call optimization, so each procedure call pushes one new activation record (AR) onto the stack, and an AR remains on the stack until its call returns. Define a function $f$ on inputs $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ as follows: if $x = 0$ then $f$ immediately returns without making any further calls; if $x > 0$ then $f$ makes exactly one recursive call to $f(\\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor)$ and returns after that call returns. The maximum stack depth is defined to be the greatest number of activation records simultaneously present on the stack during the execution of a single call to $f(x)$, counting both the initial invocation and any recursive invocations, including the base-case frame if it is reached. Starting from the core definitions of integer division, the floor function, and the behavior of a call stack under recursion, determine the exact maximum stack depth for the input $x = 10^{9}$. Give your final answer as a single exact integer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "Let $D(x)$ denote the maximum stack depth for a call to the function $f(x)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$. The problem defines the behavior of the function $f$ and the call stack.\n\nAccording to the problem description:\n1.  A call to $f(x)$ pushes one new activation record (AR) onto the stack.\n2.  If $x=0$, the function returns. The maximum number of ARs on the stack during this call is $1$ (for $f(0)$ itself). Thus, the base case for the maximum depth is $D(0) = 1$.\n3.  If $x > 0$, the function $f(x)$ makes a single recursive call to $f(\\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor)$. The AR for $f(x)$ remains on the stack while the call to $f(\\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor)$ executes. The maximum stack depth for the execution of $f(x)$ will be the $1$ AR for $f(x)$ itself, plus the maximum depth achieved during the nested call to $f(\\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor)$.\n\nThis gives us the following recurrence relation for the maximum stack depth $D(x)$:\n$$\nD(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\\n1 + D(\\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor) & \\text{if } x > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTo find the maximum stack depth for $x = 10^9$, we need to solve this recurrence. We can unroll the recurrence for an arbitrary $x > 0$. Let $x_0 = x$, and define the sequence $x_{i+1} = \\lfloor x_i/2 \\rfloor$ for $i \\ge 0$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, this sequence will strictly decrease until it reaches $0$. Let $m$ be the number of steps required for the argument to become $0$, such that $x_m = 0$ and $x_{m-1} > 0$.\n\nUnrolling the recurrence:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD(x) &= 1 + D(x_1) \\\\\n&= 1 + (1 + D(x_2)) \\\\\n&= 1 + 1 + (1 + D(x_3)) \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{m \\text{ times}} + D(x_m) \\\\\n&= m + D(0)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nUsing the base case $D(0) = 1$, we find:\n$$D(x) = m + 1$$\nHere, $m$ is the number of times we must apply the transformation $n \\to \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ to get from $x$ to $0$.\n\nThe operation $n \\to \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ for an integer $n$ is equivalent to a right bit shift of its binary representation. The number of such operations required to reduce a positive integer $x$ to $0$ is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of $x$.\n\nFor any positive integer $x$, the number of bits in its binary representation, let's call it $k$, is given by $k = \\lfloor \\log_2(x) \\rfloor + 1$.\nSo, we have $m = k = \\lfloor \\log_2(x) \\rfloor + 1$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $D(x)$:\n$$D(x) = m + 1 = (\\lfloor \\log_2(x) \\rfloor + 1) + 1 = \\lfloor \\log_2(x) \\rfloor + 2$$\nThis formula is valid for any integer $x > 0$.\n\nWe need to calculate the maximum stack depth for the input $x = 10^9$. Using the derived formula:\n$$D(10^9) = \\lfloor \\log_2(10^9) \\rfloor + 2$$\nTo evaluate $\\lfloor \\log_2(10^9) \\rfloor$, we need to find the integer $k$ such that $2^k \\le 10^9 < 2^{k+1}$.\nLet's analyze the powers of $2$ relative to powers of $10$. We know that $2^{10} = 1024$, which is slightly greater than $10^3 = 1000$.\n\nFrom $10^3 < 2^{10}$, we can raise both sides to the power of $3$:\n$$(10^3)^3 < (2^{10})^3$$\n$$10^9 < 2^{30}$$\nTaking the base-$2$ logarithm, we get $\\log_2(10^9) < 30$. This implies that $\\lfloor \\log_2(10^9) \\rfloor \\le 29$.\n\nNow we must check if $\\log_2(10^9)$ is greater than or equal to $29$. This is equivalent to checking if $10^9 \\ge 2^{29}$.\n$$2^{29} = \\frac{2^{30}}{2} = \\frac{(2^{10})^3}{2} = \\frac{(1024)^3}{2}$$\nWe are comparing $10^9$ with $\\frac{1024^3}{2}$. Let's rearrange this comparison:\n$$2 \\cdot 10^9 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad 1024^3$$\n$$2 \\cdot (1000)^3 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad (1024)^3$$\nDivide both sides by $(1000)^3$:\n$$2 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad \\left(\\frac{1024}{1000}\\right)^3$$\n$$2 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad (1.024)^3$$\nLet's compute $(1.024)^3$:\n$(1.024)^2 = 1.048576$\n$(1.024)^3 = 1.048576 \\times 1.024 = 1.073741824$\nThe comparison is now:\n$$2 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad 1.073741824$$\nClearly, $2 > 1.073741824$.\nThis implies that $2 \\cdot 10^9 > 1024^3$, which means $10^9 > \\frac{1024^3}{2} = 2^{29}$.\n\nSo we have established the inequality:\n$$2^{29} < 10^9 < 2^{30}$$\nTaking the base-$2$ logarithm of all parts:\n$$\\log_2(2^{29}) < \\log_2(10^9) < \\log_2(2^{30})$$\n$$29 < \\log_2(10^9) < 30$$\nTherefore, the floor of $\\log_2(10^9)$ is $29$:\n$$\\lfloor \\log_2(10^9) \\rfloor = 29$$\nFinally, we can compute the maximum stack depth:\n$$D(10^9) = \\lfloor \\log_2(10^9) \\rfloor + 2 = 29 + 2 = 31$$\nThe exact maximum stack depth for the input $x = 10^9$ is $31$.",
