            "problem": "You are given an instance of the rod cutting problem in which some piece lengths have negative prices that represent disposal costs for undesirable lengths. A rod of total length $n$ must be partitioned into a multiset of positive integer lengths whose sum is exactly $n$. For each piece of length $i$, the revenue contributed is $p[i]$, which may be negative, zero, or positive. The objective is to maximize the total revenue obtained from partitioning the rod, where the total revenue is the sum of the prices of the chosen piece lengths. There is no per-cut fee, and the rod must be fully partitioned into integer lengths summing to $n$; the decomposition cannot leave any leftover segment.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- The principle of optimality (Bellman’s principle) for Dynamic Programming states that if a problem exhibits optimal substructure, then an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.\n- Optimal substructure: If an optimal decomposition of a rod of length $n$ ends with a piece of length $i$, then the remaining decomposition of length $n-i$ must itself be optimal for length $n-i$.\n- Overlapping subproblems: The subproblems for different decompositions reuse solutions to the same residual lengths.\n\nTask:\n- Derive, from the above fundamental base and definitions, the correct algorithmic strategy to compute the maximum achievable revenue for any given rod length $n$ and price list $p$, even when some entries $p[i]$ are negative.\n- Implement a complete, runnable program that evaluates the following test suite. For each test case, compute the maximum revenue and report it as an integer.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test $1$: $n = 8$, with prices $p[1] = 1$, $p[2] = 5$, $p[3] = -3$, $p[4] = 4$, $p[5] = -2$, $p[6] = 7$, $p[7] = 0$, $p[8] = 8$.\n- Test $2$: $n = 5$, with prices $p[1] = -5$, $p[2] = -1$, $p[3] = -4$, $p[4] = -3$, $p[5] = -2$.\n- Test $3$: $n = 0$, with prices $p[1] = 2$, $p[2] = -1$.

The list must contain the maximum revenues for Test $1$, Test $2$, Test $3$, Test $4$, and Test $5$, in that order.

Prices can be positive, negative, or zero.\n- **Objective**: Maximize the total revenue from partitioning a rod of length $n$ into an integer-length multiset of pieces whose lengths sum to exactly $n$.\n- **Constraints**: The entire rod must be partitioned. No \"per-cut\" cost.\n- **Fundamental Principles**: The solution must be derived from the principle of optimality and the properties of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.\n- **Test Suite**:\n  - Test $1$: $n = 8$, prices for lengths $1$ to $8$ are $p = [1, 5, -3, 4, -2, 7, 0, 8]$.\n  - Test $2$: $n = 5$, prices for lengths $1$ to $5$ are $p = [-5, -1, -4, -3, -2]$.\n  - Test $3$: $n = 0$, prices for lengths $1$ to $2$ are $p = [2, -1]$.

The introduction of negative prices (representing disposal costs) is a valid, logical extension and does not violate any mathematical or scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For any given $n$ and price list $p$, a set of valid partitions exists (e.g., cutting into $n$ pieces of length $1$), and therefore a maximum revenue value is guaranteed to exist. The objective is clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with precise, formalizable language (e.g., \"maximize total revenue\", \"partitioned into a multiset\", \"sum is exactly $n$\").\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem for which a solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Algorithmic Strategy\n\nThe problem seeks to maximize revenue, and it exhibits the properties of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems as defined in the problem statement, which are the hallmarks of a problem solvable with dynamic programming. The presence of negative prices does not invalidate this structure.\n\nLet $r(j)$ denote the maximum achievable revenue for a rod of length $j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer. Our goal is to compute $r(n)$.\n\n**Base Case:**\nFor a rod of length $j=0$, the only possible partition is the empty set of pieces. The sum of lengths is $0$, and the sum of revenues is also $0$. This aligns with the provided specification for Test $3$. Therefore, the base case for our recurrence is:\n$$r(0) = 0$$\n\n**Recursive Formulation:**\nFor a rod of length $j > 0$, we must make at least one cut. An optimal partition is formed by making a first cut to yield a piece of length $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le j$) and then optimally partitioning the remaining rod of length $j-i$. This is a direct application of the principle of optimality.\n\nIf we select a first piece of length $i$, we gain a revenue of $p_i$ (using $p_i$ to denote the price of a piece of length $i$, as in the problem text), and we are left with a subproblem of finding the maximum revenue for a rod of length $j-i$, which is $r(j-i)$. The total revenue for this choice of $i$ is $p_i + r(j-i)$.\n\nTo find the overall maximum revenue for length $j$, we must consider all possible first piece lengths $i$ from $1$ to $j$ and select the one that yields the maximum total revenue. This gives us the Bellman equation for this problem:\n$$r(j) = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le j} \\{ p_i + r(j-i) \\}$$\nThis recurrence relation holds irrespective of the sign of the prices $p_i$. The maximization operator $\\max(\\cdot)$ correctly identifies the best option, whether the resulting revenues are positive or negative. For example, $\\max(-5, -10) = -5$.\n\n**Algorithmic Design (Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming):**\nBased on the recurrence relation, we can compute the values of $r(j)$ iteratively, in increasing order of $j$, from $0$ to $n$. This avoids recomputing the solutions to overlapping subproblems.\n\n1.  Create a data structure, typically an array, let's call it $R$, of size $n+1$ to store the values of $r(0), r(1), \\dots, r(n)$.\n2.  Initialize the array. Set the base case $R[0] = 0$. For all other indices $j > 0$, initialize $R[j]$ to a value guaranteed to be less than any possible revenue, such as negative infinity ($-\\infty$).\n3.  Iterate with a variable $j$ from $1$ to $n$. In each iteration, compute $R[j]$ using the derived recurrence relation. This involves a nested loop for $i$ from $1$ to $j$:\n    $$R[j] = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le j} \\{ p_i + R[j-i] \\}$$\n    Here, $p_i$ corresponds to the price for length $i$ (from the input price list, e.g., `prices[i-1]` in a 0-indexed array), and $R[j-i]$ is the already computed optimal revenue for the remaining length.\n4.  After the outer loop completes, the value $R[n]$ will contain the maximum possible revenue for the rod of length $n$. This value is the solution.\n\nThis bottom-up dynamic programming approach correctly and efficiently solves the rod cutting problem, even with negative prices, by building upon optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an efficient algorithm for the rod cutting problem under the condition of a sparse price list. The standard dynamic programming solution has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which we must improve upon by exploiting the fact that many prices $p_i$ are zero. The target complexity is $O(n \\cdot m)$, where $m$ is the number of pieces with a non-zero price. The derivation must be grounded in the Bellman Optimality Principle.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation of the Sparse Algorithm\n\nThe rod cutting problem exhibits optimal substructure. Let $r_j$ be the maximum revenue obtainable for a rod of integer length $j$. To find the optimal way to cut a rod of length $j$, we can make a first cut of length $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le j$) and then optimally cut the remaining piece of length $j-i$. The revenue for this choice is $p_i + r_{j-i}$. The Bellman Optimality Principle dictates that we must choose the cut $i$ which maximizes this value. This gives the standard dynamic programming recurrence relation:\n$$r_j = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le j} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\}$$\nwith the base case $r_0 = 0$. The direct computation of this recurrence for $j=1, \\dots, n$ involves nested loops, leading to an $O(n^2)$ time complexity.\n\nTo exploit sparsity, we analyze the contribution of different cuts. We can partition the set of possible first cuts $\\{1, 2, \\dots, j\\}$ into two disjoint sets:\n1. $I_p(j) = \\{i \\mid 1 \\le i \\le j, p_i > 0\\}$: The set of available piece lengths with a positive price.\n2. $I_z(j) = \\{i \\mid 1 \\le i \\le j, p_i = 0\\}$: The set of available piece lengths with a zero price.\n\nThe recurrence can be rewritten by separating the maximization over these two sets:\n$$r_j = \\max \\left( \\max_{i \\in I_p(j)} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\}, \\max_{i \\in I_z(j)} \\{0 + r_{j-i}\\} \\right)$$\nLet's analyze the two terms in the outer $\\max$ function. The first term, $\\max_{i \\in I_p(j)} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\}$, considers all profitable first cuts. The number of such cuts for any $j$ is at most $m$, the total number of non-zero prices.\n\nThe second term is $\\max_{i \\in I_z(j)} \\{r_{j-i}\\}$. To simplify this, we first establish a key property of the revenue function $r_j$: it is non-decreasing with $j$.\nFor any rod of length $j \\ge 1$, one possible (though not necessarily optimal) cutting strategy is to cut a piece of length $1$ and then optimally cut the remaining piece of length $j-1$. The revenue for this specific strategy is $p_1 + r_{j-1}$. The optimal revenue $r_j$ must be at least as great as the revenue from any single strategy. Thus, $r_j \\ge p_1 + r_{j-1}$. Given the constraint that all prices are non-negative ($p_i \\ge 0$), we have $p_1 \\ge 0$, which implies $r_j \\ge r_{j-1}$. By induction, this holds for all $j \\ge 1$, so $r_0 \\le r_1 \\le r_2 \\le \\dots \\le r_n$.\n\nWith $r_j$ established as a non-decreasing function, we return to the term $\\max_{i \\in I_z(j)} \\{r_{j-i}\\}$. Since $i \\ge 1$ for any cut, we have $j-i \\le j-1$. Because $r_k$ is non-decreasing, it follows that $r_{j-i} \\le r_{j-1}$ for all $i \\ge 1$. Therefore, the maximum value in the set $\\{r_{j-i} \\mid i \\in I_z(j)\\}$ is bounded above by $r_{j-1}$.\nSo, we have:\n$$\\max_{i \\in I_z(j)} \\{r_{j-i}\\} \\le r_{j-1}$$\n\nThe complete recurrence for $r_j$ is thus bounded by:\n$$r_j \\le \\max \\left( \\max_{i \\in I_p(j)} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\}, r_{j-1} \\right)$$\nHowever, we also know that $r_j \\ge r_{j-1}$. This implies that the solution must be at least $r_{j-1}$. Any optimal solution for length $j$ is either an optimal solution for a smaller length, padded with zero-priced cuts (in which case its revenue is captured by the non-decreasing nature of $r_k$, bounded by $r_{j-1}$), or it involves making a new profitable cut. This leads to the exact, improved recurrence relation:\n$$r_j = \\max \\left( r_{j-1}, \\max_{i \\in I_p(j)} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\} \\right)$$\n\n### Justification of Correctness\nThis new recurrence correctly computes the maximum revenue while avoiding iteration over zero-priced cuts. Here is the justification:\nAn optimal solution for a rod of length $j$ arises from a partition $j = \\sum_k c_k$. The revenue is $\\sum_k p_{c_k}$.\n1.  **Case 1: The optimal solution for length $j$ is identical to an optimal solution for some length $j'  j$.** This occurs if the partition for $j$ is just the partition for $j'$ plus some pieces with zero price. For example, the max revenue for length $j$ is achieved by cutting it into a piece of length $1$ (with $p_1=0$) and an optimally-cut rod of length $j-1$. In this scenario, $r_j = r_{j-1}$. Our term `r_{j-1}` in the recurrence correctly captures the maximum possible revenue that can be \"carried over\" from a smaller rod length. Since $r_k$ is non-decreasing, $r_{j-1}$ is the highest possible revenue from any smaller length $j'  j$.\n\n2.  **Case 2: Every optimal solution for length $j$ involves at least one piece $i$ with $p_i  0$.** In this case, the optimal solution is found by making a first cut $i$ (with $p_i  0$) and optimally solving for the remainder $j-i$. The term $\\max_{i \\in I_p(j)} \\{p_i + r_{j-i}\\}$ in our recurrence explicitly finds the best such option among all profitable first cuts.\n\nBy taking the maximum of these two cases, we cover all possibilities and guarantee optimality. The algorithm correctly computes the maximum revenue because it considers all profitable cuts and also allows for the possibility that the optimal strategy for length $j$ is to simply extend an optimal solution for length $j-1$ with a zero-revenue piece.\n\n### Algorithmic Design and Complexity Analysis\nBased on the derived recurrence, we can formulate an efficient algorithm.\n\n1.  Initialize a one-dimensional array, `revenue`, of size $n+1$ to store the optimal revenues $r_0, r_1, \\dots, r_n$. Set `revenue[0] = 0$.\n2.  Pre-process the price list $p$ to create a list of pairs `(i, price)` for only those lengths $i$ where the price is positive. Let the size of this list be $m$.\n3.  Iterate with a loop for $j$ from $1$ to $n$ to compute `revenue[j]`.\n4.  For each $j$, compute `max_from_positive_cuts`, the maximum revenue from making a profitable first cut. Initialize it to $0$ (or a sufficiently small number). Iterate through the $m$ profitable cuts `(i, price)`. If $i \\le j$, update this maximum with `price + revenue[j-i]`.\n5.  Set `revenue[j] = max(revenue[j-1], max_from_positive_cuts)`.\n6.  The final answer is `revenue[n]`.\n\nThe time complexity is determined by the nested loops. The outer loop runs $n$ times (for $j=1, \\dots, n$). The inner loop iterates through the list of $m$ positive prices. Therefore, the total time complexity is $O(n \\cdot m)$, which is strictly better than $O(n^2)$ when $m \\ll n$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ to store the `revenue` array.",

            "introduction": "Finding the optimal value is a core goal of dynamic programming, but often we also need to know *how* to achieve that optimum. This final practice moves beyond merely calculating the maximum revenue to the important task of reconstructing all unique cutting patterns that generate it .

            "problem": "You are given the classical rod cutting task framed in purely mathematical terms. For an integer rod length $L \\ge 0$ and a price table $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_L$ where $P_i$ is the selling price for a single piece of integer length $i$, a cutting pattern is any multiset of positive integers whose sum is exactly $L$. The total revenue of a cutting pattern is the sum of prices of its constituent pieces. Your task is to reconstruct, for each specified instance, all unique cutting patterns (treated as multisets, so order is irrelevant) that achieve the maximum possible total revenue, together with that maximum revenue.\n\nBase your algorithmic design only on fundamental definitions and principles: the definition of optimal substructure in discrete optimization, the definition of dynamic programming (DP, Dynamic Programming), and the principle of optimality that any optimal solution is composed of optimal solutions to subproblems. Do not assume any shortcut formulas beyond these principles. Cuts are free, the number of pieces is unrestricted, and all pieces must have integer lengths. Each price $P_i$ is a nonnegative integer.\n\nRepresent each unique cutting pattern by its frequency vector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_L)$ where $c_i$ is the number of pieces of length $i$. Two cutting patterns are considered the same if and only if their frequency vectors are identical. For $L = 0$, there is exactly one pattern: the empty multiset, represented by the empty frequency vector of length $0$.\n\nYour program must solve the following test suite. Each test case consists of a pair $(\\mathbf{P}, L)$, where $\\mathbf{P}$ is a list $(P_1,P_2,\\dots,P_L)$.\n\n- Test case $1$: $L = 4$, $\\mathbf{P} = (1, 5, 8, 9)$.\n- Test case $2$: $L = 5$, $\\mathbf{P} = (2, 5, 7, 8, 10)$.\n- Test case $3$: $L = 0$, $\\mathbf{P} = ()$.\n- Test case $4$: $L = 7$, $\\mathbf{P} = (1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17)$.\n- Test case $5$: $L = 6$, $\\mathbf{P} = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)$.\n\nFor each test case, compute:\n- The maximum revenue $R^\\star$ over all cutting patterns of length $L$.\n- The complete set of all unique optimal frequency vectors $\\mathbf{c}$ achieving $R^\\star$.\n\nTo make the output fully deterministic and parseable, order the optimal frequency vectors in lexicographically ascending order with respect to $(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_L)$, and encode the answer for each test case as a single list of integers:\n- Place $R^\\star$ first.\n- Then place the number of optimal patterns $K$.\n- Then, for each of the $K$ patterns in the specified order, append its entire frequency vector $(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_L)$.\n\nYour program should aggregate the answers for all five test cases into a single line by printing a list of these per-test-case lists, with commas and no spaces, for example, $[[\\dots],[\\dots],\\dots]$. There are no physical units, no angles, and no percentages involved in this task. The only acceptable outputs for each test case are integers arranged exactly as specified above.",

It is mathematically rigorous and factually sound.

The objective to find this maximum and all corresponding patterns is clearly defined. This criterion is met.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity. This criterion is met.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary definitions (pattern, revenue, vector representation), constraints, and special cases (e.g., $L=0$) are provided. No contradictions are present. This criterion is met.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, as it requires a systematic algorithm (DP) to solve. It is not metaphorical, ill-posed, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n## ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION\n\nThe problem of finding the optimal revenue from cutting a rod is a classic discrete optimization problem that exhibits the property of optimal substructure. This property is the cornerstone of dynamic programming.\n\n**Principle of Optimality and Recurrence for Maximum Revenue**\n\nThe principle of optimality states that an optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. For the rod-cutting problem, an optimal set of cuts for a rod of length $L$ must contain an optimal set of cuts for the remaining piece(s).\n\nLet $R[j]$ denote the maximum revenue obtainable from a rod of length $j$, for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L\\}$. The base case is for a rod of length $0$, which has no pieces and thus yields a revenue of $R[0] = 0$. For any length $j > 0$, we can determine $R[j]$ by considering all possible first cuts. If we make a first cut of length $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le j$), we obtain one piece of length $i$ with price $P_i$ and a remaining rod of length $j-i$. The maximum revenue we can obtain from the remainder is, by definition, $R[j-i]$. The total revenue for this choice of first cut is $P_i + R[j-i]$. To find the optimal revenue for length $j$, we must maximize over all possible first cuts $i$:\n\n$$R[j] = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le j} (P_i + R[j-i])$$\n\nThis recurrence relation allows us to compute the maximum revenue for all lengths from $1$ up to $L$ in a bottom-up fashion.\n\n**Reconstruction of All Optimal Cutting Patterns**\n\nThe task requires not only the maximum revenue but also all unique cutting patterns that achieve it. To accomplish this, our dynamic programming state must store more than just a single numerical value. We define $S[j]$ as the set of all optimal frequency vectors for a rod of length $j$. A frequency vector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_L)$ represents a pattern with $c_i$ pieces of length $i$.\n\nThe state transition for these sets of patterns is as follows:\nFor a given length $j$, after computing the optimal revenue $R[j]$, we identify all first cuts $i$ that lead to this revenue, i.e., all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, j\\}$ such that $P_i + R[j-i] = R[j]$.\n\nFor each such optimal first cut $i$, we consider all the optimal patterns for the remaining subproblem of length $j-i$. Let $\\mathbf{c'} = (c'_1, \\dots, c'_L)$ be an optimal frequency vector in the set $S[j-i]$. By adding a piece of length $i$ to this pattern, we form a new pattern for length $j$. The corresponding new frequency vector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_L)$ is obtained by incrementing the $i$-th component of $\\mathbf{c'}$, i.e., $c_i = c'_i + 1$ and $c_k = c'_k$ for $k \\ne i$.\n\nThe set $S[j]$ is the union of all new patterns generated from all optimal first cuts $i$ and all corresponding optimal sub-patterns in $S[j-i]$. Using a set data structure for $S[j]$ naturally handles the elimination of duplicate patterns that may arise from different sequences of cuts (e.g., cutting $1+2$ vs. $2+1$).\n\n**Algorithmic Procedure**\n\n1.  Handle the base case for $L=0$. The maximum revenue is $R^\\star=0$, and there is one optimal pattern, the empty frequency vector, as per the problem description.\n2.  For $L>0$, initialize an array $R$ of size $L+1$ for revenues and a list of sets $S$ of size $L+1$ for the patterns.\n3.  Set the base case for the DP: $R[0] = 0$, and $S[0]$ contains a single frequency vector of all zeros, representing the \"empty\" set of cuts for a rod of length $0$.\n4.  Iterate $j$ from $1$ to $L$:\n    a. Determine the maximum revenue $R[j]$ by applying the recurrence relation, using the already computed values $R[0], \\dots, R[j-1]$.\n    b. Initialize an empty set for $S[j]$.\n    c. Iterate through all possible first cuts $i$ from $1$ to $j$.\n    d. If the cut $i$ is optimal (i.e., $P_i + R[j-i] = R[j]$), iterate through each pattern $\\mathbf{c'}$ in $S[j-i]$. For each $\\mathbf{c'}$, construct a new pattern $\\mathbf{c}$ by adding a piece of length $i$ and add it to the set $S[j]$.\n5.  After the loop completes, the maximum revenue for the original problem is $R[L]$. The set of all optimal cutting patterns is $S[L]$.\n6.  To meet the output specification, convert the set $S[L]$ to a list and sort its elements (the frequency vectors) lexicographically. Finally, construct the specified integer list format.\n\nThis DP-based algorithm systematically explores the solution space, guarantees optimality based on the Bellman principle, and correctly reconstructs all unique optimal solutions.",
