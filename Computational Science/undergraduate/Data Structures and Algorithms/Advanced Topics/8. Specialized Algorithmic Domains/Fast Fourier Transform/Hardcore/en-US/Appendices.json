            "introduction": "The remarkable efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform stems from its divide-and-conquer approach to computing the Discrete Fourier Transform. Many common iterative implementations, such as the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, begin not by calculating transforms directly, but by first reordering the input data in a very specific way. This practice focuses on mastering that initial step, the bit-reversal permutation, which arranges the data perfectly for the subsequent stages of the FFT computation .",

            "problem": "A common implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, specifically the decimation-in-time variant, requires an initial data reordering step. Consider an input data sequence of length $N=8$, denoted by $X = (x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7)$. The reordering is performed using a bit-reversal permutation.\n\nFor a sequence of length $N=2^m$, the bit-reversal of an index $k$ works as follows:\n1. Represent the index $k$ as an $m$-bit binary number. If the binary representation has fewer than $m$ bits, pad it with leading zeros.\n2. Reverse the order of these $m$ bits.\n3. The new integer value of the reversed binary string is the bit-reversed index, which we can denote as $\\text{rev}(k)$.\n\nThe permutation rule states that the data point originally at index $k$ is moved to the position with index $\\text{rev}(k)$. Your task is to determine the final, reordered sequence of data points after applying this permutation to the initial sequence $X$.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correctly reordered sequence?\n\nA. $(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7)$\n\nB. $(x_0, x_4, x_2, x_6, x_1, x_5, x_3, x_7)$\n\nC. $(x_7, x_6, x_5, x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1, x_0)$\n\nD. $(x_7, x_3, x_5, x_1, x_6, x_2, x_4, x_0)$",
            "solution": "We have $N=8$ and $N=2^{m}$, hence $m=3$. For each index $k \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, write its $3$-bit binary representation, reverse the $3$ bits, and interpret the result as $\\operatorname{rev}(k)$. Compute:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&k=0:\\ 000 \\mapsto 000 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(0)=0,\\\\\n&k=1:\\ 001 \\mapsto 100 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(1)=4,\\\\\n&k=2:\\ 010 \\mapsto 010 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(2)=2,\\\\\n&k=3:\\ 011 \\mapsto 110 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(3)=6,\\\\\n&k=4:\\ 100 \\mapsto 001 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(4)=1,\\\\\n&k=5:\\ 101 \\mapsto 101 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(5)=5,\\\\\n&k=6:\\ 110 \\mapsto 011 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(6)=3,\\\\\n&k=7:\\ 111 \\mapsto 111 \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{rev}(7)=7.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe permutation rule is: the data $x_{k}$ moves to index $\\operatorname{rev}(k)$. Let the reordered sequence be $Y=(Y_{0},Y_{1},\\dots,Y_{7})$, where $Y_{j}$ denotes the element at final index $j$. Since bit-reversal is an involution, i.e., $\\operatorname{rev}(\\operatorname{rev}(k))=k$, we have $Y_{j}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(j)}$. Using the computed values:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&Y_{0}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(0)}=x_{0},\\quad Y_{1}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(1)}=x_{4},\\quad Y_{2}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(2)}=x_{2},\\quad Y_{3}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(3)}=x_{6},\\\\\n&Y_{4}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(4)}=x_{1},\\quad Y_{5}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(5)}=x_{5},\\quad Y_{6}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(6)}=x_{3},\\quad Y_{7}=x_{\\operatorname{rev}(7)}=x_{7}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTherefore, the reordered sequence is $(x_{0},x_{4},x_{2},x_{6},x_{1},x_{5},x_{3},x_{7})$, which corresponds to option B.",

The signal is captured from an athlete's leg muscle using a surface electrode. The data is sampled at a constant rate of $f_s = 400$ Hz. For spectral analysis, a segment of the signal containing $N = 128$ consecutive data points is processed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.
