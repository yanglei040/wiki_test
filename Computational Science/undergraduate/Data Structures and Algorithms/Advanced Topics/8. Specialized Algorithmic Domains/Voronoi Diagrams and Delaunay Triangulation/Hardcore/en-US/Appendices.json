            "introduction": "The fundamental building blocks of a Voronoi diagram are its vertices, which are points of maximum clearance from their nearest generator sites. This exercise provides a concrete starting point by asking you to calculate the location of a single Voronoi vertex defined by three generator points. Mastering this calculation is key to understanding the geometric construction of the entire diagram, as it is equivalent to finding the circumcenter of a triangle, a central concept in computational geometry.

            "problem": "In computational astrophysics, Voronoi diagrams are employed to model regions of influence around celestial objects. An astronomer is analyzing a newly surveyed region of space and has identified three distinct, non-collinear pulsars: PSR-A, PSR-B, and PSR-C. On a 2D Cartesian coordinate chart where the units are in light-years, the locations of these pulsars are given as $P_A = (1, 7)$, $P_B = (9, 1)$, and $P_C = (-3, -3)$.\n\nA theoretical model suggests the existence of a unique point in this plane that is equidistant from all three pulsars. This point is geometrically significant as it represents the single Voronoi vertex defined by these three generator points. The identification of this point is crucial for calibrating a new type of gravitational wave detector.\n\nDetermine the coordinates $(x_V, y_V)$ of this Voronoi vertex.",
            "solution": "The Voronoi vertex is the point $(x_V, y_V)$ that is equidistant from the three given points $P_A = (1, 7)$, $P_B = (9, 1)$, and $P_C = (-3, -3)$. This point is the circumcenter of the triangle formed by $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$. The circumcenter can be found by determining the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle. We only need to find the equations for two of these bisectors and then solve the resulting system of linear equations.\n\nLet's find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the segment $P_A P_B$.\nFirst, we find the midpoint $M_{AB}$ of the segment connecting $P_A$ and $P_B$:\n$$\nM_{AB} = \\left( \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, \\frac{y_A + y_B}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1 + 9}{2}, \\frac{7 + 1}{2} \\right) = (5, 4)\n$$\nNext, we determine the slope $m_{AB}$ of the segment $P_A P_B$:\n$$\nm_{AB} = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{1 - 7}{9 - 1} = \\frac{-6}{8} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector, $m_{\\perp AB}$, is the negative reciprocal of $m_{AB}$:\n$$\nm_{\\perp AB} = -\\frac{1}{m_{AB}} = -\\frac{1}{-3/4} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nUsing the point-slope form of a linear equation with point $M_{AB}=(5,4)$ and slope $m_{\\perp AB} = 4/3$, we get the equation of the first perpendicular bisector:\n$$\ny - 4 = \\frac{4}{3}(x - 5)\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{20}{3} + 4 = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{20}{3} + \\frac{12}{3}\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\nTo eliminate fractions, we can write this as $3y = 4x - 8$, or $4x - 3y = 8$.

            "introduction": "Moving from a single vertex to a complete diagram, this practice explores the structure that emerges from a symmetric arrangement of points. By calculating the total length of the finite edges in the Voronoi diagram for a square-and-center configuration, you will gain insight into how the perpendicular bisectors between sites interact to form the boundaries of the Voronoi cells. This problem helps bridge the gap between the local definition of a bisector and the global structure of the resulting partition. ",

            "problem": "A technology company is designing a new wireless communication network for a large, flat, open area. The network consists of five powerful transmitter towers. Four of these towers, which we will call the \"corner towers,\" are placed at the vertices of a perfect square with a side length of $D$. A fifth tower, the \"central tower,\" is placed exactly at the geometric center of this square.\n\nAccording to the design protocol, the service region for any given tower is the set of all points in the plane that are closer to that tower than to any other. This method of partitioning the plane based on proximity to a set of points generates a structure known as a Voronoi diagram. The boundaries that separate the different service regions are called the edges of the Voronoi diagram.\n\nFor this specific five-tower configuration, some of the Voronoi edges are line segments of finite length, while others are rays that extend infinitely. Your task is to calculate the total combined length of all the *finite* edges in the Voronoi diagram. Express your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of $D$.",
            "solution": "Place coordinates so that the square’s corners are at $P_{1}=(a,a)$, $P_{2}=(-a,a)$, $P_{3}=(-a,-a)$, $P_{4}=(a,-a)$ with $a=\\frac{D}{2}$, and the central tower is at $O=(0,0)$.\n\nFor each corner $P$, the Voronoi boundary between $O$ and $P$ is the perpendicular bisector of segment $OP$, i.e., the locus of points equidistant to $O$ and $P$. Writing this condition explicitly:\n- For $P_{1}=(a,a)$: $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x-a)^{2}+(y-a)^{2}\\implies x+y=a$.\n- For $P_{2}=(-a,a)$: $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+a)^{2}+(y-a)^{2}\\implies x-y=-a$.\n- For $P_{3}=(-a,-a)$: $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+a)^{2}+(y+a)^{2}\\implies x+y=-a$.\n- For $P_{4}=(a,-a)$: $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x-a)^{2}+(y+a)^{2}\\implies x-y=a$.\n\nThe Voronoi cell of $O$ is the intersection of the half-planes on the $O$-side of these bisectors:\n$$\nx+y\\leq a,\\quad x-y\\geq -a,\\quad x+y\\geq -a,\\quad x-y\\leq a,\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to $|x|+|y| \\leq a$, a square (diamond) with vertices at the pairwise intersections of adjacent boundary lines:\n- $(a,0)$ from $x+y=a$ and $x-y=a$,\n- $(0,a)$ from $x+y=a$ and $x-y=-a$,\n- $(-a,0)$ from $x+y=-a$ and $x-y=-a$,\n- $(0,-a)$ from $x+y=-a$ and $x-y=a$.\n\nThus the Voronoi region of $O$ is a square whose four edges are the finite Voronoi edges shared with the four corner towers. Each such edge is the segment of the corresponding bisector between consecutive vertices. For example, on the line $x+y=a$, the finite edge is the segment between $(a,0)$ and $(0,a)$.\n\nCompute the length of one edge, say between $(a,0)$ and $(0,a)$:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\text{edge}}=\\sqrt{(a-0)^{2}+(0-a)^{2}}=a\\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nAll four edges are congruent, so the total length of all finite Voronoi edges is\n$$\nL_{\\text{finite}}=4\\,\\ell_{\\text{edge}}=4a\\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $a=\\frac{D}{2}$ gives\n$$\nL_{\\text{finite}}=4\\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{2}=2D\\sqrt{2}.\n$$\n\nTo confirm no other finite edges occur, consider bisectors between adjacent corners. For instance, the bisector of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ is $x=0$. Along $x=0$, for $|y|a$, the nearest site is $O$, so there is no Voronoi edge between $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ there; for $ya$ or $y-a$, the edge exists and extends to infinity as a ray. Similar behavior holds for other adjacent corner pairs. Opposite corner pairs do not generate Voronoi edges because other sites are closer along their bisectors. Hence the only finite edges are the four edges of the central square, whose total length is $2D\\sqrt{2}$.",
