            "problem": "Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. An ordered composition of $n$ is a finite sequence of positive integers whose sum is $n$, where order matters. Consider only those ordered compositions in which every part is either $1$ or $2$. Using principles from data structures and algorithms, start from the fundamental definition of ordered compositions and the method of counting by recursive decomposition, then derive a linear recurrence that captures the count of such compositions. Next, construct a first-order linear state-transition representation for this recurrence and use matrix exponentiation to obtain an exact, closed-form analytic expression for the number of ordered compositions of $n$ into $1$s and $2$s. Your final answer must be a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $n$. No numerical approximation is required, and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding an exact, closed-form analytic expression for the number of ordered compositions of a non-negative integer $n$ where each part is either $1$ or $2$. The derivation must follow a specific path: formulation of a recurrence relation, its representation as a linear state-transition system, and solution via matrix exponentiation.\n\nFirst, let's validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n- An ordered composition of $n$ is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to $n$.\n- The parts of the composition are restricted to be either $1$ or $2$.\n- The derivation must use a specific methodology: recursive decomposition to find a recurrence, state-transition representation, and matrix exponentiation for the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is mathematically well-defined and concerns a standard topic in enumerative combinatorics and its connection to algorithms for solving recurrences. The concepts of ordered compositions, linear recurrences, and matrix exponentiation are all standard in mathematics and computer science. The problem statement is self-contained, objective, and scientifically sound. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. For $n=0$, the only composition is the empty composition, which has a sum of $0$ and vacuously satisfies the condition on its parts; thus, the number of such compositions is $1$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed to the solution.\n\nLet $C_n$ denote the number of ordered compositions of the non-negative integer $n$ into parts of size $1$ or $2$.\n\nTo derive a recurrence relation, we employ recursive decomposition by considering the last part of a composition of $n$. The last part can be either $1$ or $2$.\n1.  If the last part is $1$, the sum of the preceding parts must be $n-1$. These preceding parts form a valid composition of $n-1$. The number of such compositions is $C_{n-1}$. This case is possible for $n \\geq 1$.\n2.  If the last part is $2$, the sum of the preceding parts must be $n-2$. These preceding parts form a valid composition of $n-2$. The number of such compositions is $C_{n-2}$. This case is possible for $n \\geq 2$.\n\nSince these two cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for any composition of $n \\ge 2$, we can write the recurrence relation for $C_n$ as:\n$$ C_n = C_{n-1} + C_{n-2} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 2 $$\nTo solve this second-order recurrence, we need two initial conditions. Let's determine $C_0$ and $C_1$ directly.\n- For $n=0$: The only composition is the empty sequence, whose sum is $0$. It contains no parts, so the condition that all parts must be $1$ or $2$ is vacuously true. Thus, $C_0 = 1$.\n- For $n=1$: The only composition is $(1)$. Thus, $C_1 = 1$.\n\nLet's check these base cases against the recurrence. For $n=2$, the compositions are $(1,1)$ and $(2)$, so $C_2 = 2$. Using the recurrence, $C_2 = C_1 + C_0 = 1 + 1 = 2$. The recurrence and base cases are consistent.\n\nNext, we construct a first-order linear state-transition representation. Let the state at step $n$ be defined by the vector $\\mathbf{v}_n = \\begin{pmatrix} C_n \\\\ C_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$. The recurrence $C_n = C_{n-1} + C_{n-2}$ can be written in matrix form. We also need an equation for $C_{n-1}$, which is trivially $C_{n-1} = 1 \\cdot C_{n-1} + 0 \\cdot C_{n-2}$. Combining these gives the state-transition equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_n = \\begin{pmatrix} C_n \\\\ C_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{n-1} \\\\ C_{n-2} \\end{pmatrix} = M \\mathbf{v}_{n-1} $$\nwhere $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This relation holds for $n \\ge 2$. To handle all $n \\ge 1$ with a single initial vector, we can extend the definition of $C_n$ by setting $C_k = 0$ for $k < 0$. Then the recurrence $C_n = C_{n-1} + C_{n-2}$ holds for $n \\ge 1$.\nThis allows us to write $\\mathbf{v}_n = M \\mathbf{v}_{n-1}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nBy repeated application, we get $\\mathbf{v}_n = M^{n-1} \\mathbf{v}_1$. The initial state vector is $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 \\\\ C_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo compute $M^{n-1}$, we diagonalize the matrix $M$. First, we find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - 1 = \\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 1 = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of this equation:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} $$\nLet these eigenvalues be $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ (the golden ratio) and $\\psi = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding eigenvectors.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = \\phi$: $(M - \\phi I)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\phi & 1 \\\\ 1 & -\\phi \\end{pmatrix}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. This gives $x-\\phi y = 0$. An eigenvector is $\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $\\lambda_2 = \\psi$: $(M - \\psi I)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\psi & 1 \\\\ 1 & -\\psi \\end{pmatrix}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. This gives $x-\\psi y = 0$. An eigenvector is $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe form the matrix $P$ from the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix $D$ from the eigenvalues:\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi & \\psi \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad D = \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\psi \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe inverse of $P$ is:\n$$ P^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(P)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\psi \\\\ -1 & \\phi \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\phi - \\psi} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\psi \\\\ -1 & \\phi \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\psi \\\\ -1 & \\phi \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe matrix power is $M^{n-1} = P D^{n-1} P^{-1}$:\n$$ M^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi & \\psi \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi^{n-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\psi^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\psi \\\\ -1 & \\phi \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ M^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi^n & \\psi^n \\\\ \\phi^{n-1} & \\psi^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\psi \\\\ -1 & \\phi \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi^n - \\psi^n & -\\phi^n\\psi + \\psi^n\\phi \\\\ \\phi^{n-1} - \\psi^{n-1} & -\\phi^{n-1}\\psi + \\psi^{n-1}\\phi \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute $\\mathbf{v}_n = M^{n-1} \\mathbf{v}_1$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} C_n \\\\ C_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi^n - \\psi^n & -\\phi^n\\psi + \\psi^n\\phi \\\\ \\phi^{n-1} - \\psi^{n-1} & -\\phi^{n-1}\\psi + \\psi^{n-1}\\phi \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe are interested in the top component, $C_n$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left[ (\\phi^n - \\psi^n) \\cdot 1 + (-\\phi^n\\psi + \\psi^n\\phi) \\cdot 1 \\right] $$\nUsing the property $\\phi \\psi = -1$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left[ \\phi^n - \\psi^n - (-\\phi^{n-1}) + (-\\psi^{n-1}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left[ \\phi^n + \\phi^{n-1} - (\\psi^n + \\psi^{n-1}) \\right] $$\nFrom the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2=\\lambda+1$, we know $\\phi^2 = \\phi+1$ and $\\psi^2 = \\psi+1$. Multiplying by $\\phi^{n-1}$ and $\\psi^{n-1}$ gives $\\phi^{n+1} = \\phi^n + \\phi^{n-1}$ and $\\psi^{n+1} = \\psi^n + \\psi^{n-1}$. Substituting these into the expression for $C_n$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} ( \\phi^{n+1} - \\psi^{n+1} ) $$\nThis formula was derived assuming $n \\ge 1$. Let's check if it also holds for $n=0$:\n$$ C_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} ( \\phi^{1} - \\psi^{1} ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left( \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} - \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) = 1 $$\nThis matches our established base case $C_0=1$. Therefore, the derived formula is valid for all non-negative integers $n$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $\\phi$ and $\\psi$, we obtain the final closed-form expression for $C_n$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1} - \\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the well-known Binet's formula for the $(n+1)$-th Fibonacci number $F_{n+1}$ (using the convention $F_0=0, F_1=1$).",

Provide your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the number of directed walks of a specific length between two vertices in a given directed graph, with the constraint that a particular edge must not be used.\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a directed graph with $n$ vertices, and let $A$ be its adjacency matrix, where $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. A fundamental principle in graph theory and algorithms states that the number of distinct walks of length $k$ from a source vertex $u$ to a target vertex $v$ is given by the entry $(u,v)$ of the matrix $A^k$. We can establish this principle by induction on the length $k$.\n\nBase case ($k=1$): A walk of length $1$ from $u$ to $v$ exists if and only if there is a directed edge $(u,v) \\in E$. The number of such walks is $1$ if $(u,v) \\in E$ and $0$ otherwise. This is precisely the definition of the adjacency matrix entry $A_{uv}$. Thus, the principle holds for $k=1$, as $(A^1)_{uv} = A_{uv}$.\n\nInductive step: Assume the principle holds for some length $m \\ge 1$. That is, the number of walks of length $m$ from any vertex $i$ to any vertex $j$ is given by $(A^m)_{ij}$. Now, consider a walk of length $m+1$ from $u$ to $v$. Any such walk consists of a walk of length $m$ from $u$ to some intermediate vertex $p \\in V$, followed by a single edge from $p$ to $v$. To find the total number of such walks, we can sum over all possible intermediate vertices $p$:\n$$\n\\text{Number of walks of length } m+1 \\text{ from } u \\text{ to } v = \\sum_{p \\in V} (\\text{Number of walks of length } m \\text{ from } u \\text{ to } p) \\times (\\text{Number of walks of length } 1 \\text{ from } p \\text{ to } v)\n$$\nUsing the inductive hypothesis and the base case, this sum can be written in terms of matrix entries:\n$$\n\\sum_{p=1}^{n} (A^m)_{up} \\cdot A_{pv}\n$$\nThis sum is, by the definition of matrix multiplication, the entry $(u,v)$ of the product matrix $A^m \\cdot A = A^{m+1}$. Thus, the number of walks of length $m+1$ from $u$ to $v$ is $(A^{m+1})_{uv}$. By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all integers $k \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem requires us to count walks that do not use the forbidden edge $e=(3,2)$. This is equivalent to counting walks in a modified graph $G'$ which is identical to the original graph $G$ but with the edge $e$ removed. The adjacency matrix of this new graph, let's call it $A'$, will be identical to the original matrix $A$ except for the entry corresponding to the forbidden edge, which will be set to $0$.\n\nThe given adjacency matrix is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe vertices are indexed in the order $(1, 2, 3)$. The forbidden edge $e=(3,2)$ corresponds to the entry in the $3$-rd row and $2$-nd column. We therefore construct the matrix $A'$ by setting this entry to $0$:\n$$\nA' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the source vertex $u=1$, the target vertex $v=2$, and the walk length $k=5$.
