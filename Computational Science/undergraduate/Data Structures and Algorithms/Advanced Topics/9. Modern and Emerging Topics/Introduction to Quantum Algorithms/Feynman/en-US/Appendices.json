A pure state is a unit vector in a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^{n}$, and in the computational basis it can be written as a column vector of $2^{n}$ complex probability amplitudes. To store this state vector exactly on a classical machine, you record each complex amplitude as two real-valued floating-point numbers of $b$ bytes each. Assume double precision, so $b = 8$.\n\nYou are given a machine with Random Access Memory (RAM) capacity $M = 256 \\times 2^{30}$ bytes (that is, $256$ gibibytes expressed in bytes).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: first, an expression for the total number of real-valued floating-point numbers needed to store the state vector of an $n$-qubit system, and second, the maximum integer number of qubits, $n$, that can be simulated given a specific memory capacity.\n\nLet's begin by deriving the expression for the number of floating-point numbers.\nA pure quantum state of an $n$-qubit register is described by a state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ in a complex Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. The dimension of this space, $D$, is given by $D = 2^n$. This is because each of the $n$ qubits has a $2$-dimensional state space, and the state space of the composite system is the tensor product of the individual spaces, so the dimension is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($n$ times), which equals $2^n$.\n\nIn the computational basis, the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is represented as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors:\n$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} c_k |k\\rangle$$\nwhere the coefficients $c_k$ are complex numbers known as probability amplitudes. The state is fully specified by the set of these $2^n$ complex amplitudes.\n\nTo store this state vector on a classical computer, we must store each of these $2^n$ complex numbers. A complex number $c_k$ can be written as $c_k = a_k + i b_k$, where $a_k$ and $b_k$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The problem states that each complex amplitude is stored as two real-valued floating-point numbers.\n\nLet $N_{fp}(n)$ be the total number of real-valued floating-point numbers required. This is the product of the number of complex amplitudes and the number of real numbers required per complex amplitude.\n$$N_{fp}(n) = (\\text{Number of complex amplitudes}) \\times (\\text{Real numbers per complex amplitude})$$\nThe number of complex amplitudes is the dimension of the state space, which is $2^n$. The number of real numbers per complex amplitude is given as $2$.\nTherefore, the expression for the total number of floating-point numbers as a function of $n$ is:\n$$N_{fp}(n) = 2^n \\times 2 = 2^{n+1}$$\n\nNext, we determine the maximum integer number of qubits, $n_{max}$, that can be stored in the given RAM.\nThe total memory size required to store the state vector, let's call it $S(n)$, is the total number of floating-point numbers multiplied by the memory size of each number.\nThe problem specifies that each floating-point number is of size $b=8$ bytes (double precision).\nSo, the total memory required in bytes is:\n$$S(n) = N_{fp}(n) \\times b = 2^{n+1} \\times 8$$\nSince $8 = 2^3$, we can express $S(n)$ as a single power of $2$:\n$$S(n) = 2^{n+1} \\times 2^3 = 2^{n+4} \\text{ bytes}$$\nThe available RAM capacity is given as $M = 256 \\times 2^{30}$ bytes. We need to express $M$ as a power of $2$ for easier comparison. The number $256$ is $2^8$.\n$$M = 256 \\times 2^{30} = 2^8 \\times 2^{30} = 2^{38} \\text{ bytes}$$\nTo find the maximum number of qubits $n$, we must find the largest integer $n$ for which the required memory $S(n)$ does not exceed the available memory $M$. This can be expressed as the inequality:\n$$S(n) \\le M$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S(n)$ and $M$:\n$$2^{n+4} \\le 2^{38}$$\nSince the base of the exponential function, $2$, is greater than $1$, the inequality holds for the exponents as well:\n$$n+4 \\le 38$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$n \\le 38 - 4$$\n$$n \\le 34$$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the maximum number of qubits that can be simulated under the given memory constraint is $n_{max} = 34$.\n\nThe two results are:\n1. The expression for the number of floating-point numbers is $2^{n+1}$.\n2. The maximum integer number of qubits is $34$.",

A single-qubit gate acting on qubit index $t$ (where the least significant bit is qubit index $0$) is represented by a $2\\times 2$ unitary matrix $U$ extended to the whole register by the Kronecker product with identities, and applied to the state by a matrix-vector product. A two-qubit controlled-NOT gate (control $c$, target $t$) permutes amplitudes as a linear operation that can also be realized by appropriate index swaps.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- The state-update rule is linear: if a gate with matrix $G$ acts on the register, then the new state is $G\\psi$, where $\\psi\\in\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$ is the current state.\n- The computational basis state $\\lvert q_{n-1}\\ldots q_1 q_0\\rangle$ corresponds to the integer index $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q_k 2^k$ in little-endian order, where $q_k\\in\\{0,1\\}$.\n- Single-qubit gates act locally as $2\\times 2$ matrix-vector multiplications over disjoint pairs of amplitudes that differ only in the target qubit.\n\nYour tasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum computation, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from ambiguity or contradiction. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to design a classical state-vector simulator for a $3$-qubit quantum system and analyze its performance for specific circuits. The simulation proceeds by explicitly updating a complex vector representing the quantum state.\n\nA pure quantum state of $n$ qubits is represented by a state vector $\\psi$ in a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$, i.e., $\\psi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The vector is normalized such that its $\\ell_2$-norm is $1$, $\\|\\psi\\|_2 = 1$. The computational basis states are denoted by $\\lvert q_{n-1} \\ldots q_1 q_0 \\rangle$, where each $q_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The problem specifies a little-endian mapping from these basis states to the indices of the state vector $\\psi$. The basis state $\\lvert q_{n-1} \\ldots q_1 q_0 \\rangle$ corresponds to the integer index $i = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q_k 2^k$. For our case of $n=3$, the state vector $\\psi$ has $2^3 = 8$ complex components, indexed from $0$ to $7$. The basis state $\\lvert q_2 q_1 q_0 \\rangle$ maps to index $i = 4q_2 + 2q_1 + q_0$. The initial state is specified as $\\lvert 000 \\rangle$, which corresponds to index $0$. The initial state vector is therefore $\\psi_{initial} = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nThe evolution of the state under a quantum gate with matrix representation $G$ is given by the matrix-vector product $\\psi' = G\\psi$. For an $n$-qubit system, $G$ is a $2^n \\times 2^n$ unitary matrix. We implement the gate applications as specified.\n\nThe cost of simulation is measured by counting primitive arithmetic operations according to the provided uniform cost model:\n- For a single-qubit gate on $n$ qubits: $4 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ complex multiplications and $2 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ complex additions.\n- For a $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ gate on $n$ qubits: $3 \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ scalar assignments.\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific basis state, e.g., $\\lvert 111 \\rangle$ (which corresponds to index $i=7$), is given by the squared magnitude of the corresponding amplitude in the final state vector: $P(\\lvert 111 \\rangle) = |\\psi_{final}[7]|^2$.\n\n**Single-Qubit Gate Application**\nA single-qubit gate with matrix $U = \\begin{pmatrix} U_{00} & U_{01} \\\\ U_{10} & U_{11} \\end{pmatrix}$ acting on qubit $t$ is represented by the $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $G = I^{\\otimes(n-1-t)} \\otimes U \\otimes I^{\\otimes t}$. Applying this large matrix directly is inefficient. Instead, we use the specified local update rule. The gate only affects pairs of amplitudes corresponding to basis states that differ only in qubit $t$.\nFor each integer index $i$ from $0$ to $2^n-1$ where the $t$-th bit is $0$, we find its paired index $j = i + 2^t$, where the $t$-th bit is $1$. The amplitudes at these indices, $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$, are updated according to the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $U$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\psi'_i \\\\ \\psi'_j \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} U_{00} & U_{01} \\\\ U_{10} & U_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_i \\\\ \\psi_j \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} U_{00}\\psi_i + U_{01}\\psi_j \\\\ U_{10}\\psi_i + U_{11}\\psi_j \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThere are $2^{n-1}$ such pairs of indices. The update for each pair requires $4$ complex multiplications and $2$ complex additions. This gives a total of $4 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ complex multiplications and $2 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ complex additions per single-qubit gate application, perfectly matching the specified cost model. For $n=3$, this is $4 \\cdot 2^2 = 16$ multiplications and $2 \\cdot 2^2 = 8$ additions.\n\nThe specific single-qubit gates are the Hadamard gate $H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the Pauli-X gate $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate Application**\nThe $\\mathrm{CNOT}(c \\to t)$ gate flips the target qubit $t$ if and only if the control qubit $c$ is $1$. In the computational basis, this translates to a permutation: $\\mathrm{CNOT} \\lvert \\dots q_c \\dots q_t \\dots \\rangle = \\lvert \\dots q_c \\dots (q_t \\oplus q_c) \\dots \\rangle$. This only has an effect when $q_c=1$. Therefore, the operation swaps the amplitudes of basis states $\\lvert \\dots 1_c \\dots 0_t \\dots \\rangle$ and $\\lvert \\dots 1_c \\dots 1_t \\dots \\rangle$.\nIn terms of state vector indices, we must identify all indices $i$ that have the $c$-th bit set to $1$ and the $t$-th bit set to $0$. For each such $i$, the corresponding index $j$ is $i + 2^t$. The simulation then swaps the amplitudes $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$. The number of such pairs to swap is the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-2$ bits, which is $2^{n-2}$. For $n=3$, this is $2^{3-2}=2$ pairs.\nThe cost model specifies that a swap requires $3$ scalar assignments. Thus, a $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ gate costs $3 \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ assignments. For $n=3$, this is $3 \\cdot 2^1 = 6$ assignments.\n\n**Asymptotic Runtime Analysis**\nThe state vector has a size of $N=2^n$. The cost of applying a single-qubit gate is $O(2^n)$. The cost of applying a two-qubit $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ gate is also $O(2^n)$. In general, simulating any gate acting on a constant number of qubits, $k$, requires updating tuples of $2^k$ amplitudes, across $2^{n-k}$ such tuples, leading to a computational cost of $O(2^n)$.\nFor a circuit with depth $d$ (here interpreted as total number of gates), the total simulation cost is the sum of costs for each gate. This results in a total runtime of $O(d \\cdot 2^n)$. This confirms the expected exponential dependence on the number of qubits $n$ and linear dependence on the circuit depth $d$.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\n**Case A: Empty Circuit**\n- Circuit: None. $n=3$, $d=0$.\n- Initial state: $\\psi = \\lvert 000 \\rangle = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n- Final state: Unchanged, $\\psi_{final} = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n- Probability of $\\lvert 111 \\rangle$: $P(\\lvert 111 \\rangle) = |\\psi_{final}[7]|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n- Operation Counts: No gates are applied.\n  - Complex multiplications: $0$.\n  - Complex additions: $0$.\n  - Swap assignments: $0$.\n- Result: $[0.0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]$.\n\n**Case B: Uniform Superposition**\n- Circuit: $H$ on qubit $0$, then $H$ on qubit $1$, then $H$ on qubit $2$. $n=3$, $d=3$.\n- State evolution:\n  - $\\psi_0 = \\lvert 000 \\rangle$.\n  - $\\psi_1 = H_0 \\psi_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\lvert 000 \\rangle + \\lvert 001 \\rangle)$.\n  - $\\psi_2 = H_1 \\psi_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lvert 000 \\rangle + \\lvert 001 \\rangle + \\lvert 010 \\rangle + \\lvert 011 \\rangle)$.\n  - $\\psi_{final} = H_2 \\psi_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\lvert i \\rangle$.\n- In the final state, all amplitudes are $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}$.\n- Probability of $\\lvert 111 \\rangle$: $P(\\lvert 111 \\rangle) = |\\psi_{final}[7]|^2 = |\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$.\n- Operation Counts: $3$ single-qubit gates are applied.\n  - Cost per gate: $16$ mults, $8$ adds.\n  - Total mults: $3 \\times 16 = 48$.\n  - Total adds: $3 \\times 8 = 24$.\n  - Total swaps: $0$.\n- Result: $[0.125, 48, 24, 0, 3, 3]$.\n\n**Case C: GHZ State Preparation**\n- Circuit: $H$ on qubit $0$, then $\\mathrm{CNOT}(0 \\to 1)$, then $\\mathrm{CNOT}(1 \\to 2)$. $n=3$, $d=3$.\n- State evolution:\n  - $\\psi_0 = \\lvert 000 \\rangle$.\n  - $\\psi_1 = H_0 \\psi_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\lvert 000 \\rangle + \\lvert 001 \\rangle)$.\n  - $\\psi_2 = \\mathrm{CNOT}(0 \\to 1) \\psi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\lvert 000 \\rangle + \\lvert 011 \\rangle)$.

The $\\lvert 000 \\rangle$ component is unchanged (control bit $1$ is $0$). The $\\lvert 011 \\rangle$ component has control bit $1$ equal to $1$, so target bit $2$ is flipped ($\\lvert 011 \\rangle \\to \\lvert 111 \\rangle$).\n- The final state vector has non-zero amplitudes $\\psi_{final}[0] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\psi_{final}[7] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n- Probability of $\\lvert 111 \\rangle$: $P(\\lvert 111 \\rangle) = |\\psi_{final}[7]|^2 = |\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Operation Counts: $1$ single-qubit gate and $2$ $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates.\n  - $H(0)$: $16$ mults, $8$ adds.\n  - $\\mathrm{CNOT}(0 \\to 1)$: $6$ swap assignments.\n  - $\\mathrm{CNOT}(1 \\to 2)$: $6$ swap assignments.\n  - Total mults: $16$.\n  - Total adds: $8$.\n  - Total swaps: $6 + 6 = 12$.\n- Result: $[0.5, 16, 8, 12, 3, 3]$.\n\n**Case D: Involution**\n- Circuit: $X$ on qubit $2$, then $X$ on qubit $2$. $n=3$, $d=2$.\n- State evolution: Since $X^2=I$ (the identity matrix), applying the gate twice is equivalent to doing nothing.\n  - $\\psi_0 = \\lvert 000 \\rangle$.\n  - $\\psi_1 = X_2 \\psi_0 = \\lvert 100 \\rangle$.\n  - $\\psi_{final} = X_2 \\psi_1 = X_2 \\lvert 100 \\rangle = \\lvert 000 \\rangle$.\n- The final state is the initial state $\\lvert 000 \\rangle$.\n- Probability of $\\lvert 111 \\rangle$: $P(\\lvert 111 \\rangle) = |\\psi_{final}[7]|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n- Operation Counts: $2$ single-qubit gates are applied.\n  - Cost per gate: $16$ mults, $8$ adds.\n  - Total mults: $2 \\times 16 = 32$.\n  - Total adds: $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n  - Total swaps: $0$.\n- Result: $[0.0, 32, 16, 0, 3, 2]$.",

Using the property of tensor products $(A \\otimes B)(C \\otimes D) = (AC) \\otimes (BD)$, we can rewrite the expression. The single-qubit operators $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$ act on the first qubit, and $I$, $Z$, and $H$ act on the second.\n$$\nU = (I \\otimes H)(|0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\otimes I)(I \\otimes H) + (I \\otimes H)(|1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\otimes Z)(I \\otimes H)\n$$\nApplying the tensor product multiplication rule:\n$$\nU = (I|0\\rangle\\langle 0|I) \\otimes (HIH) + (I|1\\rangle\\langle 1|I) \\otimes (HZH)\n$$\nSince $I$ is the identity operator, $I|0\\rangle\\langle 0|I = |0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ and $I|1\\rangle\\langle 1|I = |1\\rangle\\langle 1|$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nU = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\otimes (H I H) + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\otimes (H Z H)\n$$\nThe Hadamard gate $H$ is its own inverse, meaning $H^2 = I$. This can be explicitly verified:\n$$\nH^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+1 & 1-1 \\\\ 1-1 & 1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I\n$$\nThus, the term $HIH = H^2 = I$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the term $HZH$.\n$$\nHZH = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nHZH = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nHZH = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) + (1)(-1) & (1)(1) + (1)(1) \\\\ (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) & (1)(1) + (-1)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = X\n$$\nThis is a fundamental identity relating the Pauli matrices $X$ and $Z$ via the Hadamard gate.\n\nSubstituting $HIH = I$ and $HZH = X$ back into our expression for $U$:\n$$\nU = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\otimes I + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\otimes X\n$$\nThis is precisely the operator expression for the $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ gate we derived earlier.\nTherefore, we have demonstrated that $U = \\mathrm{CNOT}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the phase $\\phi$ in the relation $U = \\exp(i\\phi)\\mathrm{CNOT}$. Substituting our result $U = \\mathrm{CNOT}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CNOT} = \\exp(i\\phi)\\mathrm{CNOT}\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ is an invertible operator, we can multiply by its inverse from the right on both sides, which yields:\n$$\nI = \\exp(i\\phi)I\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix. This implies that the scalar factor $\\exp(i\\phi)$ must be equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\exp(i\\phi) = 1\n$$\nThis equation is satisfied for any $\\phi$ that is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, i.e., $\\phi = 2k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The problem asks for the \"unique\" global phase $\\phi$. By convention in physics and engineering, when a phase is requested, the principal value is implied. The standard interval for the principal value of an angle is $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. The only value within this interval that satisfies the condition is $\\phi = 0$.\n\nThus, the required global phase is $0$ radians.",
