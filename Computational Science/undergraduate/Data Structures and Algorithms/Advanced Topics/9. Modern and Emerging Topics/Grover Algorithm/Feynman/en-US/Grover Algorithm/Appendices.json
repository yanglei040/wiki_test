            "problem": "In the theory of quantum computation, Grover's algorithm provides a significant speedup for searching an unstructured database. A key component of the algorithm is a \"black-box\" operator called an oracle, $U_f$, which identifies the desired item(s).\n\nConsider a 3-qubit quantum register. The state of this system can be described as a vector in an 8-dimensional complex Hilbert space spanned by the computational basis states $\\{|000\\rangle, |001\\rangle, |010\\rangle, |011\\rangle, |100\\rangle, |101\\rangle, |110\\rangle, |111\\rangle\\}$, ordered according to their binary-to-integer value.\n\nThe oracle operator $U_f$ acts on a basis state $|x\\rangle$ according to the rule $U_f|x\\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle$, where $f(x)$ is a Boolean function such that $f(x)=1$ if $|x\\rangle$ is the marked state we are searching for, and $f(x)=0$ otherwise.\n\nFor this problem, we are searching for a single marked item, which is the state $|\\omega\\rangle = |101\\rangle$.\n\nWhich of the following expressions correctly represent the oracle operator $U_f$ for this specific search problem? Select all that apply.\n\nIn the options below:\n- $I$ denotes the $8 \\times 8$ identity matrix.\n- $X_k$ denotes the Pauli-X operator acting on the $k$-th qubit, where qubits are indexed from left to right as 0, 1, 2. For instance, $X_1$ is shorthand for the operator $I_0 \\otimes X_1 \\otimes I_2$.\n- $Z_k$ denotes the Pauli-Z operator acting on the $k$-th qubit.\n- $CCZ$ denotes the controlled-controlled-Z gate, which flips the sign of the basis state $|111\\rangle$ and leaves all other computational basis states unchanged.\n\nA. $I - 2 |101\\rangle\\langle 101|$\n\nB. $I - |101\\rangle\\langle 101|$\n\nC. $Z_0 \\otimes Z_2$\n\nD. $X_1 \\cdot CCZ \\cdot X_1$\n\nE. The $8 \\times 8$ diagonal matrix `diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1)`",
            "solution": "The oracle for a single marked state $|\\omega\\rangle=|101\\rangle$ is defined by $U_{f}|x\\rangle=(-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle$, where $f(x)=1$ if and only if $|x\\rangle=|101\\rangle$, and $f(x)=0$ otherwise. Therefore, $U_{f}$ flips the sign of $|101\\rangle$ and leaves all other computational basis states unchanged.\n\nOption A: Consider the operator $U=I-2|101\\rangle\\langle 101|$. For any state $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|101\\rangle+|\\psi_{\\perp}\\rangle$ with $\\langle 101|\\psi_{\\perp}\\rangle=0$, we have\n$$\nU|\\psi\\rangle=(I-2|101\\rangle\\langle 101|)(\\alpha|101\\rangle+|\\psi_{\\perp}\\rangle)=\\alpha|101\\rangle-2\\alpha|101\\rangle+|\\psi_{\\perp}\\rangle=-\\alpha|101\\rangle+|\\psi_{\\perp}\\rangle.\n$$\nThus, $U|101\\rangle=-|101\\rangle$ and $U|x\\rangle=|x\\rangle$ for all $|x\\rangle\\neq|101\\rangle$, which matches the required action. Hence A is correct.\n\nOption B: Consider $U=I-|101\\rangle\\langle 101|$. Acting on $|101\\rangle$ gives\n$$\nU|101\\rangle=(I-|101\\rangle\\langle 101|)|101\\rangle=|101\\rangle-|101\\rangle=0,\n$$\nwhich is not unitary and does not implement a phase flip. Hence B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: The operator $Z_{0}\\otimes Z_{2}$ acts on a basis state $|q_{0}q_{1}q_{2}\\rangle$ by the phase $(-1)^{q_{0}}(-1)^{q_{2}}=(-1)^{q_{0}+q_{2}}$. Evaluating on $|101\\rangle$ gives $(-1)^{1+1}=(-1)^{2}=1$, so $|101\\rangle$ is not phase-flipped, while states with $q_{0}\\neq q_{2}$ are flipped. This does not match the oracle. Hence C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Let $U=X_{1}\\cdot CCZ\\cdot X_{1}$. The $CCZ$ applies a $-1$ phase only to $|111\\rangle$. Conjugation by $X_{1}$ maps $|q_{0}q_{1}q_{2}\\rangle$ to $|q_{0}(q_{1}\\oplus 1)q_{2}\\rangle$ before $CCZ$, so a $-1$ is applied exactly when $q_{0}=1$, $q_{1}\\oplus 1=1$, and $q_{2}=1$, i.e., when $(q_{0},q_{1},q_{2})=(1,0,1)$. The final $X_{1}$ restores the middle qubit. Thus $U$ flips the sign of $|101\\rangle$ and leaves all other computational basis states unchanged. Hence D is correct.\n\nOption E: With the computational basis ordered as $|000\\rangle,|001\\rangle,|010\\rangle,|011\\rangle,|100\\rangle,|101\\rangle,|110\\rangle,|111\\rangle$, the diagonal matrix\n$$\n\\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,1,1,-1,1,1)\n$$\nimplements a $-1$ phase only on $|101\\rangle$ (the 6th basis state, corresponding to integer 5) and a $+1$ phase on all others, exactly matching the oracle. Hence E is correct.\n\nSince $I-2|101\\rangle\\langle 101|$ acts as the reflection that flips the sign of $|101\\rangle$ only, and the given diagonal matrix applies the corresponding phase pattern, and $X_{1}\\cdot CCZ\\cdot X_{1}$ implements the same phase flip via conjugation, the correct options are A, D, and E.",
