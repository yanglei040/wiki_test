By analyzing a simple, regular graph structure, you can directly apply the vertex degree condition to determine if a complete traversal is possible. This problem  demonstrates how a graph's most basic properties are often the most powerful tools for solving network pathing problems.",

            "problem": "A network architecture is being designed for a small, fault-tolerant system with 6 server nodes. The design mandates that the network topology must form a *simple graph*, meaning there are no self-loops on any node and no more than one connection (edge) between any two distinct nodes. Furthermore, the design specifies that every node must have a direct connection to exactly 3 other nodes; this is known as a 3-regular graph.\n\nA diagnostic routine is planned which must traverse every single connection in the network exactly once, starting from an arbitrary node and finishing at that same starting node. Such a traversal is called an Eulerian circuit.\n\nBased on the given design specifications for any such 6-node, 3-regular network, which of the following statements about the existence of an Eulerian circuit is correct?\n\nA. An Eulerian circuit is guaranteed to exist regardless of the specific connection layout, as long as the graph is connected.\nB. It is impossible for an Eulerian circuit to exist in any network that meets these specifications.\nC. The existence of an Eulerian circuit depends on the specific connection layout; some 3-regular configurations on 6 nodes will have one, while others will not.\nD. An Eulerian circuit exists if and only if the resulting graph is bipartite.\nE. An Eulerian circuit exists, but an Eulerian path (which starts and ends at different nodes) does not.",
            "solution": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph on $|V|=6$ vertices that is $3$-regular. By definition of $3$-regular, for every vertex $v\\in V$ we have $\\deg(v)=3$.\n\nA fundamental characterization of Eulerian circuits states: a finite graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if it is connected and every vertex has even degree. Equivalently, the necessary and sufficient degree condition is $\\deg(v)$ is even for all $v\\in V$.\n\nIn the given $3$-regular graph, each vertex has $\\deg(v)=3$, which is odd. Therefore, the even-degree condition for an Eulerian circuit is violated at every vertex. This conclusion is independent of the specific connection layout and independent of connectivity; even if the graph is connected, the existence of an Eulerian circuit is impossible because all degrees are odd.\n\nHence, for any simple $3$-regular graph on $6$ vertices, an Eulerian circuit cannot exist. Among the given statements, this corresponds to option B.",

            "introduction": "Moving beyond static analysis, this problem challenges you to think dynamically about how graph operations impact Eulerian properties. You will explore how connecting simple components—in this case, two cycle graphs—alters the vertex degrees and dictates the existence of an Eulerian trail. This practice  is key to developing intuition for graph design and understanding how network modifications can enable or disable specific types of traversals.",

            "problem": "A network engineer is designing a specialized network topology. The design begins with two separate, identical ring networks, Ring A and Ring B. Each ring consists of $m$ nodes (where $m \\ge 3$), arranged in a cycle graph $C_m$. In this configuration, every node within a single ring is connected to exactly two other nodes in the same ring.\n\nTo create a single, larger network, the engineer adds $k$ new, direct communication links between the two rings, where $1 \\le k \\le m$. These $k$ links are established by connecting $k$ distinct nodes from Ring A to $k$ distinct nodes from Ring B. Thus, each of these $k$ new links connects one node from Ring A to one node from Ring B, and no node is an endpoint of more than one such new link. Let's call the final combined network $G(m, k)$.\n\nThe engineer wants to run a diagnostic test that requires finding a path that traverses every single link (both original and new) in the network exactly once. In graph theory, such a path is called an Eulerian trail.\n\nFor which of the following pairs of parameters $(m, k)$ does the network $G(m, k)$ possess an Eulerian trail, but not an Eulerian circuit?\n\nA. $m = 8, k = 4$\nB. $m$ is any integer $\\ge 3$, $k = 2$\nC. $m = 9, k = 9$\nD. $m$ is any integer $\\ge 3$, and $k = 1$\nE. $m = 5, k = 5$",
            "solution": "Each ring is a cycle graph $C_{m}$, so before adding inter-ring links every vertex has degree $2$. Adding $k$ links between $k$ distinct vertices in Ring A and $k$ distinct vertices in Ring B increases the degree of exactly those $2k$ endpoints by $1$ each. Therefore:\n- The $2k$ chosen endpoints have degree $3$.\n- The remaining $2m-2k$ vertices retain degree $2$.\n\nHence the number of odd-degree vertices in $G(m,k)$ is\n$$\nN_{\\text{odd}}=2k.\n$$\n\nBy Euler’s characterization:\n- A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if all vertex degrees are even, i.e., $N_{\\text{odd}}=0$.\n- A connected graph has an Eulerian trail (but not a circuit) if and only if exactly two vertices have odd degree, i.e., $N_{\\text{odd}}=2$.\n\nConnectivity holds here for all $k\\ge 1$ because adding at least one link between the two cycles connects them into a single component.\n\nThus, $G(m,k)$ has an Eulerian circuit if and only if $2k=0$, i.e., $k=0$, which is excluded by $k\\ge 1$. It has an Eulerian trail but not a circuit if and only if $2k=2$, i.e., $k=1$, for any $m\\ge 3$.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A: $k=4\\Rightarrow N_{\\text{odd}}=8\\neq 2$.\n- B: $k=2\\Rightarrow N_{\\text{odd}}=4\\neq 2$.\n- C: $k=9\\Rightarrow N_{\\text{odd}}=18\\neq 2$.\n- D: $k=1\\Rightarrow N_{\\text{odd}}=2$, and no circuit since not all degrees even.\n- E: $k=5\\Rightarrow N_{\\text{odd}}=10\\neq 2$.\n\nTherefore, only option D is correct.",

This advanced problem  explores a powerful generalization for such cases, using a realistic scenario of routing multiple drones.

            "problem": "A futuristic city's automated logistics network is managed by a central system that routes delivery drones. The network consists of a set of transport hubs and dedicated aerial corridors connecting them. The network is composed of two types of hubs: 8 high-capacity 'Alpha' hubs and 8 lower-capacity 'Beta' hubs. The system of corridors is constructed according to the following strict design rules:\n\n1.  Every Alpha hub is connected by a direct corridor to every other Alpha hub.\n2.  There are no direct corridors connecting any two Beta hubs.\n3.  Each of the 8 Beta hubs is connected by direct corridors to exactly 6 distinct Alpha hubs.\n4.  The corridor layout is symmetric, such that each of the 8 Alpha hubs is connected by direct corridors to exactly 6 distinct Beta hubs.\n\nThe entire network of hubs and corridors is known to be connected. For a system-wide diagnostic, a fleet of inspection drones is deployed. Each drone must fly along a continuous path of corridors, and no two drones can traverse the same corridor. The goal is to have the drones collectively traverse every single corridor in the network exactly once. What is the absolute minimum number of inspection drones required to complete this task?",
            "solution": "Model the network as a connected graph with two vertex classes: 8 Alpha vertices and 8 Beta vertices. Corridors are edges.\n\nFrom rule 1, the Alpha vertices induce a complete graph on 8 vertices, so each Alpha has degree contributed by Alpha-Alpha edges equal to $7$. From rules 3 and 4, each Beta is adjacent to exactly $6$ Alphas and each Alpha is adjacent to exactly $6$ Betas. Therefore:\n- Degree of an Alpha vertex: $7+6=13$.\n- Degree of a Beta vertex: $6$.\n\nHence all 8 Alpha vertices have odd degree $13$, and all 8 Beta vertices have even degree $6$. Let $k$ denote the number of odd-degree vertices; then $k=8$.\n\nBy the Euler trail decomposition principle for connected graphs, the minimum number of edge-disjoint trails whose union covers all edges exactly once equals $\\max\\!\\left(1,\\frac{k}{2}\\right)$. This follows because any trail has at most two vertices of odd degree, so at least $\\frac{k}{2}$ trails are necessary, and conversely one can pair odd vertices to realize this bound in a connected graph.\n\nSubstituting $k=8$ gives the minimum number of trails (drones) as $\\frac{8}{2}=4$.\n\nAs a consistency check via the handshake lemma, the total degree sum is $8\\cdot 13+8\\cdot 6=8\\cdot 19=152$, which is even, as required.\n\nTherefore, the absolute minimum number of inspection drones required is $4$.",
