This practice focuses on computing the reflexive transitive closure using a highly optimized version of Warshall's algorithm that leverages bitwise operations . By representing matrix rows as integers, you will see how high-level relational algebra can be translated into fast, low-level machine instructions, a crucial skill for performance-critical applications.",

            "problem": "You are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices, represented in a dense form as an array of $n$ nonnegative integers. The integer at index $i$ encodes the presence of directed edges from vertex $i$ to other vertices using bit positions: the least significant bit at position $j$ of the integer is set if and only if there is a directed edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. The graph is $0$-indexed. You must compute the reflexive transitive closure of reachability, defined as the relation $R^{*}$ that contains all pairs $(i,j)$ such that there exists a path of length greater than or equal to $0$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. The closure must be computed using Warshall's algorithm realized with bitwise operations over the integer-encoded rows.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- A directed graph $G$ is defined by a set of vertices $V=\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ and a set of directed edges $E\\subseteq V\\times V$.\n- The adjacency matrix $A$ of $G$ is the $n\\times n$ matrix where $A_{ij}=1$ if and only if $(i,j)\\in E$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise.\n- The transitive closure $R^{+}$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(i,j)$ such that there exists a path of length greater than or equal to $1$ from $i$ to $j$.\n- The reflexive transitive closure $R^{*}$ augments $R^{+}$ by including all $(i,i)$ pairs for every $i\\in V$, corresponding to paths of length $0$.\n- Composition of relations is associative, and adjacency matrices over the Boolean semiring use logical disjunction and conjunction to represent union and composition of reachability along paths.\n\nYour program must:\n- Interpret each test case as an array of $n$ integers encoding the adjacency matrix rows as described above.\n- Compute $R^{*}$ using Warshall’s algorithm implemented with bitwise operations on these integers. Specifically, you must realize the algorithm by iteratively allowing intermediate vertices $k$ and updating the set of vertices reachable from each $i$ by performing integer bitwise operations consistent with Boolean matrix operations. You must treat self-reachability by setting the diagonal entries $A_{ii}$ to $1$ initially before performing the closure computation.\n- Produce the transitive closure in the same integer-encoded row form: output an array of $n$ integers, where the integer at index $i$ has bit $j$ set if and only if vertex $j$ is reachable from vertex $i$ via a path of length greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following set of test cases, each specified by the integer-encoded adjacency rows. Each adjacency input does not include reflexive edges initially; you must add them as required to compute $R^{*}$.\n- Test case $1$ (chain): $n=4$, rows $[2,4,8,0]$. This encodes edges $0\\to 1$, $1\\to 2$, $2\\to 3$.\n- Test case $2$ (almost complete dense graph without self-loops): $n=5$, rows $[30,29,27,23,15]$. For each $i$, there is an edge $i\\to j$ for all $j\\neq i$.\n- Test case $3$ (directed cycle): $n=6$, rows $[2,4,8,16,32,1]$. This encodes edges $i\\to (i+1)\\bmod 6$.\n- Test case $4$ (mixed components): $n=7$, rows $[2,4,0,16,8,0,0]$. There is a chain $0\\to 1\\to 2$, a bidirectional pair between $3$ and $4$, and isolated vertices $5$ and $6$.\n- Test case $5$ (single vertex): $n=1$, rows $[0]$.\n- Test case $6$ (empty graph): $n=0$, rows $[]$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each test case, output the reflexive transitive closure as an array of integers with the same indexing convention.\n- The final output format must be a single line containing a comma-separated list of the per-test-case results enclosed in square brackets, where each per-test-case result is itself a comma-separated list of integers enclosed in square brackets, with no spaces anywhere. For example, a valid format is $[[a_{1,1},\\dots,a_{1,n_1}],[a_{2,1},\\dots,a_{2,n_2}],\\dots]$ where $a_{t,i}$ are integers and $n_t$ is the number of vertices in test case $t$.\n\nYour task is to implement the computation and produce the single-line output matching this exact format for the provided test suite. The values in the output must be integers and lists of integers only, as specified.",

All definitions ($R^+$, $R^*$, adjacency matrix) are standard.\n        *   **Well-Posed?**: Yes. The input is clearly defined, the desired output is clearly defined, and the algorithm to be used is specified.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n3.  **Solution Generation**:\n    *   **Principle-Based Design**: I need to explain the connection between Warshall's algorithm, Boolean matrix multiplication, and the specified bitwise operations.\n        *   Start with the definition of Warshall's algorithm. The core idea is to iteratively build up the reachability matrix. Let $R^{(k)}$ be the matrix where $R^{(k)}_{ij} = 1$ if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ using only intermediate vertices from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$.\n        *   The recurrence relation is: $R^{(k)}_{ij} = R^{(k-1)}_{ij} \\lor (R^{(k-1)}_{ik} \\land R^{(k-1)}_{kj})$. The iteration runs from $k=0$ to $n-1$.\n        *   The base case is $R^{(-1)}$ which is the adjacency matrix $A$. The problem specifies computing the *reflexive* transitive closure, $R^*$. This is equivalent to finding paths of length $\\ge 0$. The simplest way to handle this is to start with a matrix $A'$ where $A'_{ij} = A_{ij} \\lor (i=j)$. This is the adjacency matrix of a graph with self-loops added to every vertex. The transitive closure of this modified graph is the reflexive transitive closure of the original graph. The problem statement explicitly instructs this: \"treat self-reachability by setting the diagonal entries $A_{ii}$ to $1$ initially before performing the closure computation.\"\n        *   So, let's call our evolving matrix `M`. Initially, `M` is the adjacency matrix from the input, but with diagonal elements set to 1.\n        *   Let's connect the matrix logic to the bitwise operations. The input is an array of integers, let's call it `adj`. `adj[i]` represents the $i$-th row of the adjacency matrix. The $j$-th bit of `adj[i]` is $A_{ij}$.\n        *   First step: Add self-loops. For each row `i`, we need to set the $i$-th bit. This can be done with a bitwise OR: `adj[i] = adj[i] | (1 << i)`. This creates our initial matrix `M` for the algorithm.\n        *   Now, let's implement the Warshall's recurrence: `M_ij = M_ij OR (M_ik AND M_kj)`. We iterate `k` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `k`, we update all pairs `(i, j)`.\n        *   Let's analyze the update for a fixed `i` and `k`. We want to update `M_i` (the $i$-th row). The update rule for the entire row `i` is: For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `M_ij` becomes `M_ij OR (M_ik AND M_kj)`.\n        *   This can be broken down. If `M_ik` is `0`, then `(M_ik AND M_kj)` is always `0`, so `M_ij` doesn't change.\n        *   If `M_ik` is `1`, then `M_ij` becomes `M_ij OR M_kj`. This update needs to happen for all `j`.\n        *   \"For all j\", `M_ij` becomes `M_ij OR M_kj` is equivalent to updating the entire row `i` with the bitwise OR of row `i` and row `k`.\n        *   So, the algorithm becomes:\n            1.  Initialize matrix `M` from the input `rows`. Let's call it `R`.\n            2.  For `i` from `0` to `n-1`: set the $i$-th bit of `R[i]` to `1`. `R[i] |= (1 << i)`.\n            3.  For `k` from `0` to `n-1`: (intermediate vertex)\n            4.  For `i` from `0` to `n-1`: (start vertex)\n            5.  Check if there is a path from `i` to `k`. This means checking if the $k$-th bit of `R[i]` is set. `if (R[i] & (1 << k))`.\n            6.  If there is a path from `i` to `k`, it means we can now reach anything reachable from `k`, starting from `i`. So, we update `i`'s reachability set with `k`'s reachability set. The new reachability set for `i` is the union of its old set and `k`'s set. In bitwise terms, this is `R[i] = R[i] | R[k]`.\n        *   This seems correct and directly maps the logic of Warshall's algorithm to bitwise operations on the rows. The nested loops are `k`, then `i`. The order of `i` and `j` in the original matrix formulation doesn't matter for the logic, but the `k` loop must be the outermost one. Here, the inner loop over `j` is implicitly handled by the bitwise `OR` over the entire integer row.\n        *   Let's trace this logic with Test Case 1: `n=4`, `rows=[2, 4, 8, 0]`.\n            *   Edges: $0 \\to 1$, $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 3$.\n            *   In binary (4 bits):\n                `R[0] = 0010`\n                `R[1] = 0100`\n                `R[2] = 1000`\n                `R[3] = 0000`\n            *   Step 1: Add self-loops.\n                `R[0] |= (1<<0) = 0001` -> `R[0] = 0011` (3)\n                `R[1] |= (1<<1) = 0010` -> `R[1] = 0110` (6)\n                `R[2] |= (1<<2) = 0100` -> `R[2] = 1100` (12)\n                `R[3] |= (1<<3) = 1000` -> `R[3] = 1000` (8)\n                So, `R` is now `[3, 6, 12, 8]`.\n            *   Step 2: Warshall's algorithm.\n                *   `k = 0`:\n                    *   `i = 0`: Path `0 -> 0` exists (bit 0 of `R[0]` is 1). `R[0] |= R[0]`. No change.\n                    *   `i = 1`: Path `1 -> 0`? No (bit 0 of `R[1]` is 0). No change.\n                    *   `i = 2`: Path `2 -> 0`? No (bit 0 of `R[2]` is 0).

Wait, `12|8 = 1100 | 1000 = 1100 = 12`.\n                        This is a bug in my manual trace. Let's be careful.\n                        Initial `R_refl = [3, 6, 12, 8]`. Rows represent reachability FROM `i`.\n                        `R[2]=12=1100_b` means from 2 I can reach 2 and 3. This is correct as `2->2` and `2->3`.\n                        Ah, my initial state was correct. `R_reflexive` was `[3, 6, 12, 8]`.\n                        Let's re-trace `k=3`.\n                        `R` before `k=3` is `[15, 14, 12, 8]`.\n                        `k=3`:\n                        `i=0`: Path `0->3`?

The problem is a standard task from algorithm and graph theory, involving the computation of the transitive closure. The use of Warshall's algorithm and its implementation via bitwise operations for dense adjacency matrices are well-established, correct, and efficient techniques.\n- **Well-Posed**: Yes. The inputs, required algorithm, and output format are specified unambiguously. For any given directed graph, the reflexive transitive closure is unique. Warshall's algorithm is a deterministic procedure guaranteed to find this closure.\n- **Objective**: Yes. The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free from any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws:\n1. **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness**: The provided definitions and algorithmic requirements are consistent with established computer science principles.\n2. **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is a formal and direct application of the specified algorithm to the topic of transitive closure.\n3. **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: All necessary information, including handling of reflexivity and explicit test cases, is provided. The instructions are internally consistent.\n4. **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The scale of the test cases is small and computationally trivial for modern hardware.\n5. **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-structured and leads to a unique, meaningful solution for each test case.\n6. **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires a non-trivial translation of a conceptual algorithm (Warshall's) into a specific, efficient implementation (bitwise operations), which is a substantive exercise.\n7. **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The results are deterministic and can be independently verified by calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the reflexive transitive closure, denoted $R^*$, for a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. The graph is provided in a compact bitwise format, where an array of $n$ integers represents the adjacency matrix $A$. The integer at index $i$ encodes the $i$-th row of $A$, with the $j$-th bit corresponding to the entry $A_{ij}$. We are mandated to use Warshall's algorithm, implemented with bitwise operations.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem. The reflexive transitive closure $R^*$ contains a pair $(i,j)$ if there exists a path of length $0$ or more from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. A path of length $0$ exists from any vertex to itself. Therefore, $R^*$ must include all pairs $(i,i)$ for all $i \\in V$. The problem statement correctly directs us to achieve this by ensuring all diagonal entries of the reachability matrix are $1$ before the main computation. This is equivalent to starting with the matrix representing the relation $A \\cup I$, where $A$ is the adjacency relation and $I$ is the identity relation. In our bitwise representation, for each row index $i$ from $0$ to $n-1$, we must set the $i$-th bit of the integer at that index. This is accomplished by the bitwise OR operation: $M_i \\leftarrow M_i \\lor (1 \\ll i)$, where $M_i$ is the integer for row $i$, and $\\ll$ denotes the bitwise left-shift operator. Let us denote the resulting array of integers as $M$.\n\nThe core of the computation is Warshall's algorithm. It computes the transitive closure by systematically considering all possible intermediate vertices for all paths. Let $M^{(k)}_{ij}$ be a Boolean value indicating whether a path exists from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ using only intermediate vertices from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$. The algorithm begins with $M^{(0)}$ as the (reflexive) adjacency matrix and iterates from $k=0$ to $n-1$. The update rule is given by the recurrence over the Boolean semiring:\n$$M^{(k)}_{ij} = M^{(k-1)}_{ij} \\lor (M^{(k-1)}_{ik} \\land M^{(k-1)}_{kj})$$\nThis states that a path from $i$ to $j$ using intermediate vertices up to $k-1$ exists if either:\n1. A path from $i$ to $j$ already existed using intermediates up to $k-2$.\n2. A path exists from $i$ to $k$ and a path from $k$ to $j$, both using intermediates up to $k-2$.\n\nThe critical insight for implementation is that the loops can be ordered with the intermediate vertex $k$ in the outermost loop. The state can be updated in place. Let the single matrix being updated be $M$. The algorithm is:\n`for k from 0 to n-1:`\n  `for i from 0 to n-1:`\n    `for j from 0 to n-1:`\n      `M[i,j] := M[i,j] OR (M[i,k] AND M[k,j])`\n\nWe must translate this matrix formulation into bitwise operations on our integer-encoded rows. The integer $M_i$ represents the entire $i$-th row of the matrix, $(M_{i,0}, M_{i,1}, \\dots, M_{i,n-1})$. Let us analyze the update for a fixed row $i$ and intermediate vertex $k$. We examine the predicate $M_{ik}$, which tests for a path from $i$ to $k$.\n- If $M_{ik}$ is $0$ (false), then $(M_{ik} \\land M_{kj})$ is always $0$. The update rule simplifies to $M_{ij} \\leftarrow M_{ij}$. Thus, the $i$-th row does not change.\n- If $M_{ik}$ is $1$ (true), the update rule for row $i$ becomes $M_{ij} \\leftarrow M_{ij} \\lor M_{kj}$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$. This means that if we can get from $i$ to $k$, we can then get from $i$ to any vertex $j$ that is reachable from $k$. The new set of vertices reachable from $i$ is the union of the old set and the set of vertices reachable from $k$.\n\nThis union of reachability sets corresponds directly to a bitwise OR operation on the integer rows. The operation $M_{ij} \\leftarrow M_{ij} \\lor M_{kj}$ for all $j$ is equivalent to $M_i \\leftarrow M_i \\lor M_k$.\n\nThe complete bitwise implementation of Warshall's algorithm is therefore:\n1. Let $M$ be the array of integers representing the graph.\n2. For each vertex $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$, add a self-loop to ensure reflexivity: $M_i \\leftarrow M_i \\lor (1 \\ll i)$.\n3. For each intermediate vertex $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$:\n4.  For each starting vertex $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$:\n5.   Check if a path from $i$ to $k$ exists. This is true if the $k$-th bit of $M_i$ is set. This can be tested with the expression $(M_i \\land (1 \\ll k)) \\neq 0$.\n6.   If such a path exists, update the reachability of $i$ by taking the union with the reachability of $k$: $M_i \\leftarrow M_i \\lor M_k$.\n\nAfter these loops complete, the array $M$ will contain the integer-encoded rows of the final reflexive transitive closure matrix $R^*$. This procedure correctly and efficiently solves the problem as specified.",

You will work backwards from a given transitive closure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to uncover its essential \"skeleton,\" distinguishing direct edges from paths that are merely implied by transitivity.",

            "problem": "You are given the transitive closure matrix of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) on a finite set of vertices, and your task is to reconstruct the unique transitive reduction: the minimal directed graph on the same vertex set whose reachability relation matches the given transitive closure. Work purely in mathematical and algorithmic terms without any physical units.\n\nDefinitions that serve as the fundamental base:\n- Let a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) be a directed graph with no directed cycles. For a DAG on vertex set $V$ with edge set $E \\subseteq V \\times V$, define the reachability relation $R \\subseteq V \\times V$ by $(u,v) \\in R$ if and only if there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ of length at least one. The transitive closure of a DAG is exactly this reachability relation.\n- A binary relation $R$ on a finite set $V$ is transitive if for all $u,v,w \\in V$, whenever $(u,w) \\in R$ and $(w,v) \\in R$, then $(u,v) \\in R$. For the reachability relation of a DAG, $R$ is also antisymmetric: if $(u,v) \\in R$ and $(v,u) \\in R$, then $u=v$.\n- The transitive reduction of a DAG is the directed graph $G_{\\min}=(V,E_{\\min})$ with the fewest possible edges such that its reachability relation equals that of the original DAG. For a DAG this transitive reduction is unique.\n\nInput model for this problem:\n- You will be given a boolean matrix $T \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$ that represents the transitive closure (strict reachability) of some DAG on vertices indexed $0,1,\\dots,n-1$. The matrix $T$ satisfies $T[i][i]=0$ for all $i$ (no self-reachability via a path of length at least one), is antisymmetric in the sense that if $T[i][j]=1$ then $T[j][i]=0$, and is transitive in the sense that if $T[i][k]=1$ and $T[k][j]=1$ then $T[i][j]=1$.\n- Your goal is to compute the adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$ of the transitive reduction graph whose reachability relation equals $T$. The matrix $A$ must have $A[i][i]=0$ for all $i$.\n\nRequired derivation to be implemented:\n- Starting only from the definitions above, derive an algorithm that reconstructs the minimal edge set from $T$ so that its reachability relation is exactly $T$. The algorithm must be valid for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $T$ that satisfies the properties stated above, and it should run in polynomial time.\n\nProgram specification:\n- Implement a program that, for each provided test case $T$, computes the adjacency matrix $A$ of the transitive reduction and outputs the flattened $A$ in row-major order as a list of integers in $\\{0,1\\}$. For a matrix $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$, the flattened form is the list $[A[0][0],A[0][1],\\dots,A[0][n-1],A[1][0],\\dots,A[n-1][n-1]]$.\n- Your program must aggregate the outputs for all test cases into a single line in the following exact format: a single bracketed list whose elements are the flattened lists for each test case, with no spaces anywhere. For example, for two test cases whose flattened outputs are $[0,1]$ and $[1,0,0,1]$, the final output must be exactly [[0,1],[1,0,0,1]].\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case below, the input is a matrix $T$ representing the transitive closure of some DAG.\n\n- Test case $1$ ($n=4$): a total order (chain) on $4$ vertices, so $T[i][j]=1$ if and only if $i<j$.\n  $$\n  T_1=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\n- Test case $2$ ($n=4$): a diamond shape with one source and one sink.\n  $$\n  T_2=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\n- Test case $3$ ($n=3$): a case with a redundant long edge present in the closure (it will be excluded in the reduction).\n  $$\n  T_3=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\n- Test case $4$ ($n=5$): two disconnected components, one chain of length $3$ and one single edge.\n  $$\n  T_4=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\n- Test case $5$ ($n=1$): a single isolated vertex.\n  $$\n  T_5=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  $$\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case $T_k$, output the flattened adjacency matrix $A_k$ of the transitive reduction, as a list of $0$-$1$ integers.\n- The final output must be a single line containing the nested list for all test cases, with no spaces, in the exact format:\n  $$\\texttt{[[a\\_1\\_0,a\\_1\\_1,\\dots],[a\\_2\\_0,a\\_2\\_1,\\dots],\\dots]}$$\n  where $\\texttt{[a\\_k\\_0,a\\_k\\_1,\\dots]}$ is the flattened adjacency matrix for test case $k$.\n\nYour solution must be a complete, runnable program that performs this computation and prints exactly the specified single-line output.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem in the field of graph algorithms, based on standard definitions of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), transitive closure, and transitive reduction. All provided information is self-contained, consistent, and objective. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to reconstruct the adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$ of the unique transitive reduction of a DAG, given its transitive closure matrix $T \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$. The vertices are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$.\n\nBy definition, the transitive reduction of a DAG is the graph with the minimum number of edges that has the same reachability relation as the original DAG. An edge from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, denoted $(u,v)$, exists in the transitive reduction if and only if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in the original graph, and this path is of length exactly $1$. Any path of length greater than $1$ is considered \"reducible\" because the reachability it provides is a consequence of the transitivity of the path relation. For instance, if a path $u \\to w \\to v$ exists, the reachability from $u$ to $v$ is transitively implied by the reachability from $u$ to $w$ and from $w$ to $v$.\n\nWe are given the transitive closure matrix $T$, where $T[i][j]=1$ signifies that there is a path of length at least one from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. Our goal is to find the adjacency matrix $A$ of the transitive reduction, where $A[i][j]=1$ signifies a direct edge $(i,j)$ in this minimal graph.\n\nAn edge $(i,j)$ is present in the transitive reduction if and only if:\n$1$. There is a path from $i$ to $j$.\n$2$. There is no path from $i$ to $j$ of length greater than $1$.\n\nThe first condition is directly given by the input matrix $T$: a path from $i$ to $j$ exists if and only if $T[i][j]=1$.\n\nThe second condition requires closer examination. A path from $i$ to $j$ of length greater than $1$ must contain at least one intermediate vertex. That is, there must exist some vertex $k$ (where $k \\neq i$ and $k \\neq j$) such that the path can be decomposed into a path from $i$ to $k$ and a path from $k$ to $j$. Since the matrix $T$ contains all reachability information, the existence of such a composite path is equivalent to the existence of a vertex $k$ for which $T[i][k]=1$ and $T[k][j]=1$. Note that since the graph is a DAG, we cannot have $i=k$ or $j=k$ if a path from $i$ to $k$ and $k$ to $j$ exists (as this would imply $T[i][i]=1$ or $T[j][j]=1$, which is ruled out for paths of length $\\ge 1$).\n\nTherefore, an edge $(i,j)$ is part of the transitive reduction if and only if $T[i][j]=1$ and there exists no vertex $k$ such that $T[i][k]=1$ and $T[k][j]=1$.\n\nThis condition can be elegantly expressed using boolean matrix multiplication. Let us define the matrix $T^2$ as the boolean matrix product of $T$ with itself:\n$$\n(T^2)[i][j] = \\bigvee_{k=0}^{n-1} (T[i][k] \\land T[k][j])\n$$\nIn this expression, $\\lor$ represents the logical OR operation and $\\land$ represents the logical AND operation. The entry $(T^2)[i][j]$ is $1$ if and only if there exists at least one vertex $k$ that serves as an intermediate stop on a path from $i$ to $j$. In other words, $(T^2)[i][j]=1$ indicates the existence of a path of length at least $2$ from $i$ to $j$ (specifically, one formed by concatenating two paths recorded in $T$).\n\nWith this, we can formalize the condition for an edge $(i,j)$ to be in the transitive reduction. The corresponding entry $A[i][j]$ in the adjacency matrix is $1$ if and only if $T[i][j]=1$ and $(T^2)[i][j]=0$. This can be written as:\n$$\nA[i][j] = T[i][j] \\land \\neg((T^2)[i][j])\n$$\nwhere $\\neg$ is the logical NOT operator.\n\nIt is important to note that because $T$ is transitive, if $(T^2)[i][j]=1$, then $T[i][j]=1$ must also hold. This is because $(T^2)[i][j]=1$ implies the existence of a $k$ such that $T[i][k]=1$ and $T[k][j]=1$. By the transitivity property of $T$, this directly implies $T[i][j]=1$. Consequently, the set of relations in $T^2$ is a subset of the relations in $T$. Our task is to find the relations in $T$ that are not in $T^2$.\n\nThe algorithm is therefore as follows:\n$1$. Given the $n \\times n$ transitive closure matrix $T$.\n$2$. Compute the matrix $T^2 = T \\times T$ using boolean matrix multiplication. The standard algorithm for matrix multiplication can be used, which has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$.\n$3$. Construct the adjacency matrix $A$ of the transitive reduction. For each pair of indices $(i,j)$, set $A[i][j]=1$ if $T[i][j]=1$ and $(T^2)[i][j]=0$. Otherwise, set $A[i][j]=0$. This step takes $O(n^2)$ time.\n\nThe overall time complexity is dominated by the matrix multiplication, resulting in a polynomial time complexity of $O(n^3)$, which satisfies the problem requirements.

This exercise introduces you to the world of dynamic graph algorithms by asking you to derive and implement an incremental update for transitive closure when a single new edge is added . This challenges you to reason about how local changes propagate to update global reachability information efficiently.",

            "problem": "You are given a directed graph with vertex set $\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ represented by a binary adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$. For vertices $i$ and $j$, we say that $j$ is reachable from $i$ if there exists a directed path of length at least $1$ from $i$ to $j$. The transitive closure $T \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$ of $A$ records reachability: $T[i,j]=1$ if and only if there exists a directed path of length at least $1$ from $i$ to $j$ in the graph defined by $A$, and $T[i,j]=0$ otherwise. Note that $T[i,i]=1$ if and only if there exists a directed cycle through $i$.\n\nFrom the core definitions of directed paths and reachability, derive an incremental algorithm that updates $T$ to $T'$ when a single directed edge $(a,b)$ is added to the graph. Your derivation must reason from the following foundational base only:\n- The definition of adjacency matrix $A$ and transitive closure $T$ for directed graphs.\n- The definition of a directed path as a sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair corresponds to an edge present in the graph.\n- Elementary propositional logic on binary relations (for example, that reachability is the transitive closure of the adjacency relation).\n\nYou must not rely on, cite, or assume any specific pre-existing algorithmic formula for transitive closure or its update; instead, logically deduce what set of pairs can become newly reachable as a consequence of adding a single edge.\n\nAfter deriving the algorithm, implement it as a program that, for each test case below, performs the following steps:\n1. Construct the initial adjacency matrix $A$ of size $n \\times n$.\n2. Compute the initial transitive closure $T$ that encodes paths of length at least $1$.\n3. Apply your incremental update when adding the single edge $(a,b)$ to obtain the updated closure $T'$ without recomputing the closure from scratch.\n4. For each test case, compute the integer count of newly reachable ordered pairs, defined as the number of index pairs $(i,j)$ such that $T[i,j]=0$ and $T'[i,j]=1$.\n\nTest suite. Each test case is given as $(n,\\ \\text{edge list},\\ (a,b))$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, the edge list is the set of directed edges to include initially, and $(a,b)$ is the single edge to add. All vertices are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. Use exactly the following five test cases:\n- Test case $1$: $(n=5,\\ \\{(0,1),(1,2),(3,4)\\},\\ (2,3))$.\n- Test case $2$: $(n=4,\\ \\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)\\},\\ (0,3))$.\n- Test case $3$: $(n=3,\\ \\{(0,1),(1,0),(1,2)\\},\\ (0,1))$.\n- Test case $4$: $(n=2,\\ \\{(0,1)\\},\\ (1,1))$.\n- Test case $5$: $(n=3,\\ \\{(0,1),(1,2)\\},\\ (2,0))$.\n\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]$), where $x_k$ is the integer count of newly reachable ordered pairs for test case $k$.\n\nAll outputs are unitless integers. No external input is required; the program must embed the test suite above and print the single required line.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an incremental update algorithm for the transitive closure of a directed graph when a single edge is added. The derivation must be based on first principles. Subsequently, this algorithm is to be implemented and applied to a specific test suite.\n\nThe initial validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded in graph theory, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. No flaws were identified.\n\n**Derivation of the Incremental Update Algorithm**\n\nLet the directed graph be $G=(V, E)$, where $V = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. The graph is represented by its adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$, where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(i,j) \\in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe transitive closure of $G$ is represented by a matrix $T \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$. By definition, $T[i,j] = 1$ if and only if there exists a directed path of length at least $1$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. Otherwise, $T[i,j] = 0$.\n\nWe are to add a single directed edge $(a, b)$ to the graph $G$, resulting in a new graph $G' = (V, E \\cup \\{(a,b)\\})$. We need to find the transitive closure $T'$ of $G'$ by updating the original closure $T$, without recomputing it from scratch. The core task is to identify the set of ordered pairs $(i,j)$ that become newly reachable. A pair $(i,j)$ is newly reachable if $T[i,j]=0$ and $T'[i,j]=1$.\n\nBy definition, any path in $G$ is also a path in $G'$. Therefore, if $T[i,j] = 1$, it must be that $T'[i,j] = 1$. The new reachability connections, where $T'[i,j]=1$ but $T[i,j]=0$, can only arise from paths in $G'$ that utilize the newly added edge $(a,b)$.\n\nConsider a path from a vertex $i$ to a vertex $j$ in $G'$ that makes use of the edge $(a,b)$. Such a path must be a concatenation of three parts:\n1. A path from vertex $i$ to vertex $a$.\n2. The new edge $(a,b)$.\n3. A path from vertex $b$ to vertex $j$.\n\nLet us analyze the paths to $a$ and from $b$. These sub-paths must exist in the original graph $G$.\nA \"path\" from a vertex to itself can have length $0$. To formally handle these cases where $i=a$ or $j=b$, it is convenient to use the reflexive-transitive closure, denoted $T^*$. The matrix $T^*$ is defined as $T^*[i,j] = 1$ if there is a path of length $0$ or more from $i$ to $j$. It can be computed from $T$ by setting the diagonal entries to $1$, as a path of length $0$ exists from any vertex to itself. In matrix algebra, $T^* = T \\lor I$, where $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix and $\\lor$ denotes the element-wise logical OR operation.\n\nSo, the condition for the existence of a path $i \\to j$ in $G'$ that uses the edge $(a,b)$ can be stated as:\n- There exists a path of length $\\ge 0$ from $i$ to $a$ in $G$. This is equivalent to the logical condition $T^*[i,a]=1$.\n- AND, there exists a path of length $\\ge 0$ from $b$ to $j$ in $G$. This is equivalent to the logical condition $T^*[b,j]=1$.\n\nCombining these, a path from $i$ to $j$ via the new edge $(a,b)$ exists if and only if $(T^*[i,a] \\land T^*[b,j]) = 1$, where $\\land$ is the logical AND operation.\n\nThis expression captures all reachability created by the new edge. The complete transitive closure $T'$ for the new graph $G'$ can be expressed as the union of the old reachability and this new source of reachability:\n$$T'[i,j] = T[i,j] \\lor (T^*[i,a] \\land T^*[b,j])$$\n\nWe are interested in the count of *newly* reachable pairs. A pair $(i,j)$ is newly reachable if its entry in the old closure $T$ was $0$ and its entry in the new closure $T'$ is $1$. From the equation for $T'$, this occurs precisely when:\n$$T[i,j] = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (T^*[i,a] \\land T^*[b,j]) = 1$$\n\nThis derivation gives us a direct algorithm to find the newly reachable pairs:\n1.  Begin with the initial transitive closure matrix $T$.\n2.  Compute the reflexive-transitive closure $T^* = T \\lor I$.\n3.  Identify the set of all vertices $P_a$ that can reach $a$ in $G$ (including $a$ itself). This set is $P_a = \\{i \\in V \\mid T^*[i,a]=1\\}$. This corresponds to the indices of non-zero entries in the $a$-th column of $T^*$.\n4.  Identify the set of all vertices $S_b$ that are reachable from $b$ in $G$ (including $b$ itself). This set is $S_b = \\{j \\in V \\mid T^*[b,j]=1\\}$. This corresponds to the indices of non-zero entries in the $b$-th row of $T^*$.\n5.  The set of all potential new paths is the Cartesian product $P_a \\times S_b$.\n6.  To find the count of strictly new paths, iterate through all pairs $(i,j) \\in P_a \\times S_b$ and increment a counter if and only if $T[i,j]=0$.\n\nThis procedure correctly computes the number of newly reachable pairs by only considering the structural change introduced by the single edge $(a,b)$, as required. For the initial computation of $T$ from an adjacency matrix $A$, a standard algorithm such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is appropriate and efficient. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the transitive closure by iteratively considering each vertex as a potential intermediate node in all paths.\n\n**Application to Test Cases**\n\nFor each test case $(n, \\text{edge list}, (a,b))$:\n1.  An $n \\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$ is constructed from the given edge list.\n2.  The initial transitive closure $T$ is computed from $A$ using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.\n3.  The reflexive closure $T^*$ is obtained by taking the logical OR of $T$ and the identity matrix $I$.\n4.  The sets $P_a = \\{i \\mid T^*[i,a]=1\\}$ and $S_b = \\{j \\mid T^*[b,j]=1\\}$ are determined.\n5.  The number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $i \\in P_a$, $j \\in S_b$, and $T[i,j]=0$ is counted. This count is the final result for the test case.",
