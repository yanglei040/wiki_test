The problem must be solved in a purely algorithmic and mathematical way, starting from core definitions from constraint satisfaction and search, and using no domain-specific shortcuts beyond those definitions.\n\nA Sudoku instance consists of a square grid of size $9 \\times 9$, with variables $X_{r,c}$ for row $r \\in \\{1,\\ldots,9\\}$ and column $c \\in \\{1,\\ldots,9\\}$. Each variable $X_{r,c}$ has a domain $D_{r,c} \\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots,9\\}$. The constraints are that for each row $r$, all variables $X_{r,1},\\ldots,X_{r,9}$ must take pairwise distinct values; for each column $c$, all variables $X_{1,c},\\ldots,X_{9,c}$ must take pairwise distinct values; and for each $3 \\times 3$ subgrid indexed by $(R,C)$ where $R \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $C \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, all variables in rows $3R+1,\\ldots,3R+3$ and columns $3C+1,\\ldots,3C+3$ must take pairwise distinct values.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in algorithm design, specifically for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). It is scientifically grounded in established principles of artificial intelligence and discrete mathematics, is well-posed with a clear objective, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of a backtracking search algorithm for Sudoku, augmented with the Most Constrained Variable (MCV) and Least Constraining Value (LCV) heuristics, along with forward checking for constraint propagation.\n\n**1. Formalization of Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**\n\nA CSP is defined by a set of variables, a domain of possible values for each variable, and a set of constraints on the values of these variables. For the Sudoku problem on a $9 \\times 9$ grid, we define these components as follows:\n\n- **Variables:** The variables are the cells of the Sudoku grid. We denote the variable for the cell in row $r$ and column $c$ as $X_{r,c}$, where $r, c \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 8\\}$. There are $9 \\times 9 = 81$ such variables.\n\n- **Domains:** Each variable $X_{r,c}$ has a domain, $D_{r,c}$, which is the set of values it is allowed to take. For a standard Sudoku puzzle, the values are the integers from $1$ to $9$. An initial puzzle configuration specifies some values.\n  - If a cell $(r, c)$ is empty (given as '$0$' in the input), its initial domain is the full set of possibilities: $D_{r,c} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.\n  - If a cell $(r, c)$ is pre-filled with a value $v \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 9\\}$, its domain is a singleton set: $D_{r,c} = \\{v\\}$.\n\n- **Constraints:** The rules of Sudoku impose `all-different` constraints on three types of variable groups:\n  1.  **Row Constraint:** For each row $r \\in \\{0, \\ldots, 8\\}$, the values assigned to the variables $\\{X_{r,0}, X_{r,1}, \\ldots, X_{r,8}\\}$ must all be distinct.\n  2.  **Column Constraint:** For each column $c \\in \\{0, \\ldots, 8\\}$, the values assigned to the variables $\\{X_{0,c}, X_{1,c}, \\ldots, X_{8,c}\\}$ must all be distinct.\n  3.  **Subgrid Constraint:** For each of the nine $3 \\times 3$ subgrids, the values assigned to the variables within that subgrid must all be distinct.\n\nTo manage these constraints efficiently, we define the concept of \"neighbors.\" Two variables $X_{r,c}$ and $X_{r',c'}$ are neighbors if they are in the same row ($r=r'$), the same column ($c=c'$), or the same $3 \\times 3$ subgrid. The constraint can then be stated more simply: for any variable $X_{r,c}$, its value must be different from the values of all its neighbors. For each of the $81$ variables, we can pre-compute a set of its $20$ unique neighbors.\n\n**2. The Backtracking Algorithm with Heuristics and Inference**\n\nWe implement a recursive, depth-first backtracking algorithm to search for a valid assignment. The efficiency of this search is critically enhanced by the specified heuristics and inference mechanism.\n\nThe state of our search is represented by the collection of domains $\\{D_{r,c}\\}$ for all $81$ variables. A solution is found when every domain is a singleton, i.e., $|D_{r,c}|=1$ for all $r, c$.\n\nThe recursive function `backtrack(domains)` operates as follows:\n\n- **Base Case:** If all variables are assigned (i.e., there are no variables $X_{r,c}$ with $|D_{r,c}| > 1$), a complete and consistent assignment has been found. The current state represents a solution, which is then returned.\n\n- **Variable Selection (Most Constrained Variable - MCV):** The algorithm must select an unassigned variable to assign next. The MCV heuristic dictates choosing a variable with the minimum remaining domain size. That is, we select an $X_{r,c}$ such that $|D_{r,c}|$ is minimized over all variables with $|D_{r,c}| > 1$. This strategy, also known as \"fail-first,\" aims to identify inevitable failures early in the search tree, leading to faster pruning of impossible branches.\n\n- **Value Ordering (Least Constraining Value - LCV):** Once a variable $X_{r,c}$ is selected, the algorithm must decide the order in which to try the values in its domain $D_{r,c}$. The LCV heuristic prioritizes values that are \"least constraining\" on the remaining variables. For each candidate value $v \\in D_{r,c}$, we compute a score based on how many choices it would eliminate from the domains of its neighbors. The score for a value $v$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{score}(v) = \\sum_{(r', c') \\in \\text{neighbors}(r,c)} \\mathbb{I}(v \\in D_{r',c'}) $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise. The algorithm then iterates through the values in $D_{r,c}$ in increasing order of this score. This heuristic attempts to leave maximal flexibility for subsequent assignments, increasing the probability of finding a solution without backtracking.\n\n- **Recursive Step and Inference (Forward Checking with Propagation):** For each value $v$ in the LCV-ordered list for the chosen variable $X_{r,c}$:\n  1.  A tentative assignment is made by setting the domain of $X_{r,c}$ to $\\{v\\}$. This is done on a *copy* of the current state to allow for backtracking.\n  2.  This assignment triggers **constraint propagation**. The value $v$ is removed from the domain of every neighbor of $X_{r,c}$.\n  3.  If this removal causes any neighbor's domain to become empty, the assignment $X_{r,c} \\leftarrow v$ is invalid, and the algorithm immediately discards this path.\n  4.  If the removal causes a neighbor's domain to shrink to a singleton set, e.g., $D_{r',c'} = \\{v'\\}$, this constitutes a new assignment. This new assignment is recursively propagated: $v'$ is removed from the domains of all neighbors of $X_{r',c'}$. This propagation continues until no more domains can be reduced or a contradiction (an empty domain) is found.\n  5.  If propagation completes successfully without any domain becoming empty, the algorithm makes a recursive call: `backtrack(new_domains)`.\n  6.  If the recursive call returns a valid solution, that solution is propagated up the call stack and returned.\n  7.  If the recursive call returns a failure, it means the tentative assignment $X_{r,c} \\leftarrow v$ led to a dead end. The algorithm backtracks by undoing the assignment (which is implicit, as we operate on a copy) and tries the next value for $X_{r,c}$.\n\nIf all values for $X_{r,c}$ have been tried and none lead to a solution, the function returns a failure signal, indicating that the branch of the search tree leading to the current state is unsolvable.\n\n**3. Implementation Structure and Initial State Handling**\n\nThe overall process is initiated by a main solver function that prepares the initial state and invokes the backtracking search.\n\n- **Initialization:** The input string is parsed into a $9 \\times 9$ grid. The initial set of domains $\\{D_{r,c}\\}$ is constructed. For each pre-filled cell $(r, c)$ with value $v$, we perform an initial constraint propagation. This is identical to the propagation step within the backtracking search: we treat the pre-filled cells as a sequence of assignments and propagate their constraints.\n- **Inconsistency Detection:** If at any point during this initial propagation a domain becomes empty, it implies the initial puzzle is contradictory (e.g., two identical numbers in the same row). In this case, the puzzle is declared unsolvable without entering the main backtracking search. This correctly handles Test Case $3$.\n- **Final Output:** If the initial `backtrack` call returns a solution, the final $81$-element list is constructed from the solved domains. If it returns a failure signal, the puzzle is unsolvable, and the output is $-1$.\n\nThis structured approach correctly implements the specified CSP solution method, adhering to the principles of backtracking search, variable/value ordering heuristics, and constraint propagation.",

The task is to design and implement the data structures and search algorithm from first principles using the following foundational base.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Definition of exact cover: Given a finite universe set $\\mathcal{U}$ and a family $\\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $\\mathcal{U}$, an exact cover is a subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ such that every element of $\\mathcal{U}$ is contained in exactly one member of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n- Sudoku constraints: A standard Sudoku consists of a $9 \\times 9$ grid.

Each cell has one digit from $\\{1, ..., 9\\}$.\n    2. Each row has each digit from $\\{1, ..., 9\\}$ exactly once.\n    3. Each column has each digit from $\\{1, ..., 9\\}$ exactly once.\n    4. Each $3 \\times 3$ box has each digit from $\\{1, ..., 9\\}$ exactly once.\n- **Implementation Requirements:**\n    1.  Formulate Sudoku as an exact cover problem with $729$ rows (choices) and $324$ columns (constraints).\n    2.  Implement DLX from first principles.\n    3.  Handle initial non-zero digits (givens) by restricting candidate choices.\n- **Test Cases:**\n    - Test Case A: A standard solvable puzzle.\n    - Test Case B: A nearly complete puzzle.\n    - Test Case C: An unsolvable puzzle with a contradiction.\n- **Output Format:**\n    - For solvable cases, a flat list of $81$ integers representing the solved grid in row-major order.\n    - For unsolvable cases, an empty list.\n    - A single line of output, e.g., `[[...],[...],[]]`, containing all results.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in computer science, specifically in the domain of combinatorial search algorithms. The reduction of Sudoku to an exact cover problem is a classic, mathematically sound technique. Algorithm X and its DLX implementation are canonical methods for solving such problems. The problem adheres to established principles of algorithmics and discrete mathematics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The input is a set of $9 \\times 9$ grids. The task is to find a valid Sudoku solution for each. The conditions for a valid solution are explicitly stated. The output format for both solvable and unsolvable cases is precisely specified. A unique, meaningful answer exists for each test case (either a solution grid or a confirmation of unsolvability).\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is written in precise, unambiguous language. All constraints, data, and requirements are formal and objective. There are no subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined algorithmic task based on established computer science principles. The following solution provides a principled implementation of the required algorithm.\n\n### Solution Design\n\nThe solution is architected around the reduction of Sudoku to an exact cover problem, which is then solved using a custom implementation of Algorithm X with Dancing Links (DLX).\n\n**1. Sudoku as an Exact Cover Problem**\n\nThe core idea is to represent the Sudoku constraints as the universe $\\mathcal{U}$ of an exact cover problem, and the possible moves (placing a digit in a cell) as the family of subsets $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n-   **Universe of Constraints ($\\mathcal{U}$):** The $324$ game rules are the elements of our universe, which become the columns of a matrix.\n    1.  **Cell Occupancy:** For each of the $81$ cells $(r, c)$, the constraint is that it must contain exactly one digit. This gives $9 \\times 9 = 81$ columns. Column index: $c_{1} = 9r + c$.\n    2.  **Row-Digit:** For each of the $9$ rows and $9$ digits, the constraint is that digit $d$ must appear exactly once in row $r$. This gives $9 \\times 9 = 81$ columns. Column index: $c_{2} = 81 + 9r + (d-1)$.\n    3.  **Column-Digit:** For each of the $9$ columns and $9$ digits, the constraint is that digit $d$ must appear exactly once in column $c$. This gives $9 \\times 9 = 81$ columns. Column index: $c_{3} = 162 + 9c + (d-1)$.\n    4.  **Box-Digit:** For each of the $9$ boxes and $9$ digits, the constraint is that digit $d$ must appear exactly once in box $b$. This gives $9 \\times 9 = 81$ columns. Column index: $c_{4} = 243 + 9b + (d-1)$, where the box index $b$ is calculated as $b = 3(r // 3) + (c // 3)$.\n\n-   **Family of Subsets ($\\mathcal{S}$):** The candidate moves are the rows of the matrix. A single \"choice\" is to place a digit $d \\in \\{1,...,9\\}$ in a cell $(r, c)$. There are $9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$ such possible choices.\n    -   Each choice, such as placing digit $d$ in cell $(r,c)$, satisfies exactly four constraints: one cell constraint, one row-digit constraint, one column-digit constraint, and one box-digit constraint.\n    -   Therefore, each row in our $729 \\times 324$ matrix representation of the problem contains exactly four $1$s.\n\nFinding a Sudoku solution is equivalent to finding a subcollection of $81$ of these choices (rows) such that every one of the $324$ constraints (columns) is satisfied by exactly one chosen row. This is the definition of an exact cover.\n\n**2. Algorithm X and Dancing Links (DLX)**\n\nAlgorithm X is a recursive, backtracking algorithm for finding exact covers. Dancing Links (DLX) is an efficient implementation technique proposed by Donald Knuth that uses a specific data structure to represent the sparse matrix.\n\n-   **Data Structure:** The sparse $729 \\times 324$ matrix is represented using a toroidal doubly-linked list.\n    -   Each $1$ in the matrix becomes a `Node` object. Each node has four pointers: `L` (left), `R` (right), `U` (up), `D` (down).\n    -   Nodes in the same matrix row are linked horizontally into a circular list.\n    -   Nodes in the same matrix column are linked vertically into a circular list.\n    -   Each column has a special `Column` header node. These headers are themselves linked horizontally into a circular list, which also includes a master `root` node. This list keeps track of the currently active constraints.\n    -   Each `Column` header stores the `size` (number of $1$s) in its column, crucial for the search heuristic.\n\n-   **Search Algorithm (`search`):**\n    1.  **Base Case:** If the `root` node is its own right neighbor (i.e., `root.R == root`), all columns have been covered, and a solution has been found.\n    2.  **Column Selection:** Choose a column `c` to cover. The S-heuristic (shortest column) is used: select the column with the minimum `size`. This prunes the search tree effectively.\n    3.  **Cover Operation (`cover(c)`):** This is the core of DLX's efficiency. To cover column `c`:\n        -   It is unlinked from the horizontal list of column headers.\n        -   For each row `i` that has a node in column `c`, that entire row is \"removed\" from consideration by unlinking its *other* nodes from their respective columns. This is done by modifying the `U` and `D` pointers of their vertical neighbors.\n    4.  **Recursion  Backtracking:**\n        -   Iterate through each row `r` that was just \"removed\" by `cover(c)`.\n        -   For each `r`, tentatively add it to the solution.\n        -   For each node `j` in row `r` (other than the one in `c`), cover its column `j.col`.\n        -   Recursively call `search`. If it returns `True`, a solution is found; propagate `True` up the call stack.\n        -   If the recursive call fails, backtrack. Un-select row `r` and restore the matrix to its previous state by performing the `uncover` operations in the reverse order of the `cover` operations.\n    5.  **Uncover Operation (`uncover(c)`):** This operation perfectly reverses `cover(c)` by relinking all nodes and headers, restoring the matrix structure.\n\n**3. Handling Givens and Contradictions**\n\nThe initial puzzle state (the \"givens\") is handled by pre-processing the DLX structure.\n\n-   For each given digit $d$ at cell $(r, c)$, we are forced to make that choice.\n-   The matrix row corresponding to the choice $(r,c,d)$ is identified. This row is effectively \"selected\" as part of the solution from the start.\n-   Selecting this row means all constraints it satisfies must be fulfilled. This is achieved by iterating through the nodes of this row and calling the `cover` operation on each of their respective columns.\n-   If the givens are contradictory (e.g., two $5$s in the same row, as in Test Case C), this process will fail. For example, processing the first `5` will cover the `row-digit` constraint for \"5 in row 1\". When processing the second `5`, its corresponding row in the matrix will have already been eliminated by the previous `cover` operation. The program detects this impossibility and flags the puzzle as unsolvable without initiating the search.\n\nThis principled design translates the abstract Sudoku puzzle into a concrete mathematical structure and solves it using a highly efficient, specialized algorithm.",

            "problem": "You are to design and implement a complete, runnable program that generates Sudoku puzzles with a single unique solution, grounded in the formal framework of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). A Sudoku puzzle is a partially filled $9\\times 9$ grid over the digits $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ with the following constraints: each row must contain each digit exactly once, each column must contain each digit exactly once, and each $3\\times 3$ subgrid must contain each digit exactly once. A puzzle has a unique solution if there exists exactly one complete assignment of digits to all cells that satisfies all constraints. The goal is to generate such puzzles and verify uniqueness from first principles.\n\nFundamental base definitions to use:\n- A Sudoku instance is a finite domain Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where each cell is a variable with domain $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$, and constraints enforce all-different relations on rows, columns, and subgrids.\n- A solution to the CSP is an assignment mapping each variable to a value in its domain that satisfies all constraints.\n- Uniqueness requires exactly one solution; formally, the cardinality of the solution set is equal to $1$.\n\nYour program must:\n1. Construct valid solved Sudoku grids by applying structure-preserving transformations starting from any valid solved grid, ensuring the invariants that rows, columns, and subgrids remain permutations of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$.\n2. Derive Sudoku puzzles by removing clues (filled cells) from a solved grid while maintaining the property that the puzzle has exactly one solution. Uniqueness must be verified by counting the number of solutions using principled constraint propagation and backtracking. The solution counter must terminate early when it finds more than $1$ solution.\n3. Use deterministic pseudo-randomness via a seed to vary generated puzzles reproducibly.\n\nTest Suite:\nImplement and run the generator for the following parameter pairs $(s,k)$, where $s$ is the pseudo-random seed and $k$ is the target number of clues to attempt to retain:\n- Case $1$: $(s,k) = (17,30)$.\n- Case $2$: $(s,k) = (12345,26)$.\n- Case $3$: $(s,k) = (2024,38)$.\nYour generator should attempt to remove clues until either the puzzle would lose uniqueness or the number of remaining clues would drop below $k$, whichever occurs first.\n\nAnswer Specification:\nFor each test case, compute the following result:\n- The integer count of clues actually retained in the final puzzle.\n- A boolean indicating whether the final puzzle was verified to have exactly one solution via counting.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to one test case in the given order and is itself a two-element list $\\big[\\text{clue\\_count},\\text{is\\_unique}\\big]$. For example, the format is $[[a_1,b_1],[a_2,b_2],[a_3,b_3]]$, where each $a_i$ is an integer and each $b_i$ is a boolean.",
            "solution": "The problem of generating a Sudoku puzzle with a unique solution is a well-defined algorithmic challenge rooted in the theory of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). A Sudoku puzzle can be modeled as a CSP with $81$ variables, one for each cell in the $9 \\times 9$ grid. The domain for each variable is the set of digits $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$. The constraints are \"all-different\" constraints applied to the variables in each row, each column, and each of the nine $3 \\times 3$ subgrids. A solution to the puzzle is a complete and consistent assignment of values to all variables. The problem requires generating puzzles for which this solution is unique, meaning the cardinality of the solution set is exactly $1$.\n\nOur approach is systematic and grounded in these principles. It consists of three main stages: first, generating a complete and valid Sudoku grid; second, implementing a solver capable of verifying solution uniqueness; and third, using this solver to remove clues from the complete grid to form a minimal puzzle that adheres to the uniqueness and clue count constraints.\n\n**1. Generation of Solved Sudoku Grids via Structure-Preserving Transformations**\n\nInstead of solving a CSP from an empty grid, which is computationally intensive, we begin with a known, valid, solved Sudoku grid. From this base grid, a vast number of other valid solved grids can be generated by applying a sequence of transformations that preserve the Sudoku property (i.e., that every row, column, and $3 \\times 3$ subgrid is a permutation of $\\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}$). These transformations include:\n\n- **Digit Relabeling**: A permutation is applied to the digits $\\{1, ..., 9\\}$ across the entire grid. For example, every $1$ can be replaced by a $5$, every $5$ by a $1$, etc.\n- **Row and Column Permutations**:\n    - Rows can be permuted within their respective $3$-row bands (e.g., rows $0, 1, 2$ can be rearranged).\n    - Columns can be permuted within their respective $3$-column stacks (e.g., columns $3, 4, 5$ can be rearranged).\n    - The three bands of rows (rows $0-2$, $3-5$, $6-8$) can be permuted among themselves.\n    - The three stacks of columns (columns $0-2$, $3-5$, $6-8$) can be permuted among themselves.\n- **Grid Transposition**: The grid can be transposed along its main diagonal, swapping the roles of rows and columns.\n\nBy applying a series of these transformations, chosen based on a deterministic pseudo-random number generator initialized with a specific seed $s$, we can produce a wide variety of solved grids in a reproducible manner.\n\n**2. Uniqueness Verification via Backtracking with Early Termination**\n\nThe core of the problem is verifying that a puzzle has exactly one solution. This is a #P-complete problem, but for a $9 \\times 9$ grid, it is tractable with an efficient backtracking algorithm. The algorithm systematically explores the search space of possible assignments.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n- A recursive function is defined, which attempts to fill the grid cell by cell.\n- It identifies the next unassigned variable (cell). If all cells are assigned, a valid solution has been found, and the function returns $1$.\n- For the chosen unassigned cell, the function iterates through all possible values ($1$ to $9$) from its domain.\n- For each value, it checks if placing the value in the cell violates any of the Sudoku constraints (row, column, or subgrid).\n- If the value is valid, it is tentatively assigned to the cell, and the function recursively calls itself to solve the rest of the puzzle. The number of solutions found by the recursive call is added to a running total.\n- After the recursive call returns, the cell is unassigned (the value is reset to $0$) to allow the exploration of other branches of the search tree (this is \"backtracking\").\n\nA crucial optimization is employed for uniqueness verification. We are not interested in the total number of solutions if it is greater than $1$. Therefore, the counting process can be terminated as soon as two distinct solutions are found. The solver is implemented to return $0$ (no solution), $1$ (unique solution), or $2$ (representing at least two solutions). This \"early exit\" significantly prunes the search, making the process much more efficient than a full solution-counting algorithm.\n\n**3. Puzzle Derivation by Greedy Clue Removal**\n\nStarting with a fully solved grid generated in the first step, we derive a puzzle by removing clues (non-zero digits). The goal is to remove as many clues as possible while ensuring the puzzle maintains a unique solution and has a final clue count of at least $k$, a given target. The procedure is as follows:\n\n- A list of all $81$ cell positions is created and shuffled randomly (using the seeded generator for reproducibility).\n- The algorithm iterates through this shuffled list of cell positions.\n- For each cell, it checks if the current number of clues is greater than the target $k$. If not, the process terminates, as we cannot remove more clues without dropping below the target.\n- If the clue count is above $k$, the algorithm temporarily removes the digit from the current cell (sets its value to $0$).\n- It then invokes the backtracking solver described above to count the number of solutions for the modified grid, with a limit of $2$.\n- If the solver returns exactly $1$, the puzzle remains uniquely solvable. The removal is confirmed, and the clue count is decremented.\n- If the solver returns any other value ($0$ or $2$), removing the clue would destroy the uniqueness property. The removal is reverted by restoring the original digit to the cell.\n\nThis greedy process continues until all cell positions have been considered for removal or the clue count threshold $k$ is reached. The resulting puzzle is guaranteed to have a unique solution and at least $k$ clues. The final output for each test case consists of the actual number of clues retained in the generated puzzle and a boolean confirmation of its uniqueness.",
