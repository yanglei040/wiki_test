Define a single left-to-right pass of the optimized bubble sort as follows: for indices $i$ from $0$ to $n-2$, compare $A[i]$ and $A[i+1]$ and, if $A[i] > A[i+1]$, exchange their positions via a swap; if no swaps occur during the entire pass, the algorithm terminates early without performing further passes. Assume the pass performs the comparisons sequentially in increasing $i$, and that a comparison can perform at most one swap. Starting from the formal definitions of a permutation, an adjacent comparison, and a swap, and without appealing to any pre-derived results about bubble sort, determine the maximum possible number of swaps that can occur during a single pass for any initial permutation of $n$ elements.

            "solution": "The present task requires the determination of the maximum possible number of swaps that can occur during a single left-to-right pass of an optimized bubble sort algorithm, given an initial array $A$ that is a permutation of $n$ distinct elements. The solution must be derived from fundamental definitions without recourse to pre-established theorems about bubble sort.\n\nLet the array be denoted by $A$, with $0$-based indices from $0$ to $n-1$. A single pass is defined by a sequence of operations for indices $i$ from $0$ to $n-2$. For each $i$, the elements $A[i]$ and $A[i+1]$ are compared. If $A[i] > A[i+1]$, their values are exchanged through a swap operation. This process is sequential, meaning the comparison at index $i$ operates on the array state resulting from any swaps that may have occurred at indices $0, 1, \\dots, i-1$.\n\nLet us first establish an upper bound for the number of swaps. The pass consists of a loop that iterates for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-2$. In each of these $n-1$ iterations, a single comparison is performed. This comparison can lead to at most one swap. Let $S_i$ be a binary variable representing the outcome of the comparison at step $i$, where $S_i=1$ if a swap occurs and $S_i=0$ otherwise. The total number of swaps, $S$, in a single pass is the sum of swaps over all steps:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} S_i$$\nSince the maximum value for any $S_i$ is $1$, we can establish an upper bound on $S$:\n$$S \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} 1 = n-1$$\nThis demonstrates that no more than $n-1$ swaps can occur in a single pass, regardless of the initial permutation.\n\nTo determine if $n-1$ is the *maximum possible* number of swaps, we must show that this upper bound is achievable. This requires identifying at least one initial permutation for which every comparison in the pass results in a swap.\n\nLet the set of $n$ distinct elements be $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n\\}$, where they are ordered such that $e_1  e_2  \\dots  e_n$. We construct an initial permutation by arranging these elements in strictly decreasing order:\n$$A_0 = [e_n, e_{n-1}, e_{n-2}, \\dots, e_2, e_1]$$\nHere, $A_0$ denotes the initial state of the array. Let $A_i$ denote the state of the array after the comparison and potential swap at index $i$.\n\nWe now trace the pass with this initial permutation:\n\nStep $i=0$: The elements at $A_0[0]$ and $A_0[1]$ are compared. We have $A_0[0] = e_n$ and $A_0[1] = e_{n-1}$. Since $e_n > e_{n-1}$, a swap is performed. The number of swaps is $1$. The array state becomes $A_1 = [e_{n-1}, e_n, e_{n-2}, \\dots, e_1]$.\n\nStep $i=1$: The elements at $A_1[1]$ and $A_1[2]$ are compared. We have $A_1[1] = e_n$ and $A_1[2] = e_{n-2}$. Since $e_n$ is the maximal element in the set, we know $e_n > e_{n-2}$. A swap is performed. The cumulative number of swaps is $2$. The array state becomes $A_2 = [e_{n-1}, e_{n-2}, e_n, \\dots, e_1]$.\n\nGeneral Step $i=k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-2\\}$:\nWe can prove by induction that for the chosen initial permutation, a swap occurs at every step. At each step $j  k$, the element $e_n$ (the largest element) is compared with a smaller element and is swapped one position to the right. After $k$ steps (for $i=0, \\dots, k-1$), the element $e_n$ has been \"bubbled\" from its initial position $0$ to position $k$. The elements that were originally at positions $1, 2, \\dots, k$ have each been displaced one position to the left. The element at position $k+1$ has not yet been affected by the bubbling of $e_n$, so it remains $e_{n-k-1}$ from the initial permutation.\nThus, at the beginning of step $k$, the array elements to be compared are:\n$$A_k[k] = e_n$$\n$$A_k[k+1] = e_{n-k-1}$$\nSince $e_n$ is the maximal element of the entire set, the condition $e_n > e_{n-k-1}$ is true for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-2\\}$. Consequently, the comparison $A[k] > A[k+1]$ is true at every step $k$ of the pass.\n\nA swap is therefore performed at each of the $n-1$ steps. The total number of swaps for this initial permutation is exactly:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} 1 = n-1$$\n\nWe have shown that the number of swaps is bounded above by $n-1$ and that this bound is achieved for the reverse-ordered permutation. Therefore, the maximum possible number of swaps that can occur during a single pass is $n-1$.",

            "introduction": "To truly master an algorithm, it's instructive to think about its operations in reverse. This practice presents a \"reverse engineering\" challenge: given the final sorted array and a complete record of the swaps performed, your task is to reconstruct the original, unsorted array.

            "problem": "You are given the chronological record of adjacent swaps performed by an optimized bubble sort on an unknown array of integers, together with the final sorted output of that array. The optimized bubble sort variant reduces the comparison boundary after each pass because the largest element in the remaining unsorted prefix is moved to the end, and it terminates early if a pass performs zero swaps. Each recorded swap is the index $i$ of the adjacent pair $(A[i], A[i+1])$ that was swapped at that moment. Indices are $0$-based. All values are integers and may include duplicates. Your task is to reconstruct the original array before sorting.\n\nFundamental base definitions to use:\n- Bubble sort, in ascending order, repeatedly compares adjacent pairs $(A[i], A[i+1])$ and swaps them when $A[i] > A[i+1]$. After each full pass, the algorithm reduces the effective range by one because the largest remaining element has reached its final position. The optimized variant terminates when a pass completes with zero swaps.\n- An adjacent swap at index $i$ is the function $t_i$ that exchanges the elements at positions $i$ and $i+1$.\n- The chronological swap record $S = [i_0, i_1, \\dots, i_{k-1}]$ corresponds to composing adjacent transpositions on the evolving array. If $A_0$ denotes the unknown original array and $B$ denotes the final sorted array, then there exists a permutation $P$ such that $B = P(A_0)$, where $P$ is the composition of the adjacent transpositions induced by the swap record. The inverse permutation $P^{-1}$ recovers $A_0$ from $B$.\n\nYour program must implement an algorithm that, given:\n- the array length $n$,\n- the final sorted array $B$,\n- and the chronological list of swap indices $S$ produced by an optimized bubble sort,\n\nreturns the original array $A_0$ that, when sorted by the optimized bubble sort, would yield exactly the swap record $S$ and the final sorted array $B$.\n\nUse purely mathematical and logical reasoning to design your algorithm from the above base definitions. Do not rely on any shortcut formulas; derive the reconstruction process from first principles about permutations and adjacent transpositions.\n\nTest suite and required output:\n- Apply your algorithm to the following five test cases. Each test case provides $(n, B, S)$ and expects the reconstructed original array $A_0$ as the result.\n    1. $n = 5$, $B = [1,2,4,5,8]$, $S = [0,1,2,1]$.\n    2. $n = 4$, $B = [1,2,3,4]$, $S = []$.\n    3. $n = 5$, $B = [1,2,3,4,5]$, $S = [0,1,2,3,0,1,2,0,1,0]$.\n    4. $n = 4$, $B = [1,1,2,3]$, $S = [0,1,2,1]$.\n    5. $n = 1$, $B = [42]$, $S = []$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the reconstructed arrays for the five test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each array printed in bracketed, comma-separated form and no spaces. For example, the output should look like $[[a_{0,0},a_{0,1},\\dots],[a_{1,0},a_{1,1},\\dots],\\dots]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the reconstruction of an original integer array, denoted as $A_0$, from which a final sorted array $B$ and a chronological record of swap indices $S$ were produced by an optimized bubble sort algorithm. The core of the task is to reverse the sorting process to recover the initial state $A_0$. This can be accomplished by applying the inverse of the permutation defined by the swap record to the final array $B$.\n\nLet us formalize the process based on the provided definitions. The original array is $A_0$. The sorting process involves a sequence of $k$ adjacent swaps, where $k$ is the total number of swaps recorded in $S = [i_0, i_1, \\dots, i_{k-1}]$. Let $t_i$ represent the adjacent transposition operator that swaps the elements at indices $i$ and $i+1$ in an array.\n\nThe sorting process transforms the array step-by-step. Let $A^{(j)}$ be the state of the array after the $j$-th swap (using $1$-based indexing for the sequence of swaps for clarity in derivation, so $j$ from $1$ to $k$).\nThe initial state is $A^{(0)} = A_0$.\nThe state after the first swap (at index $i_0$) is $A^{(1)} = t_{i_0}(A^{(0)})$.\nThe state after the second swap (at index $i_1$) is $A^{(2)} = t_{i_1}(A^{(1)})$.\nThis continues for all $k$ swaps. The final sorted array $B$ is the state after the last swap:\n$$B = A^{(k)} = t_{i_{k-1}}(A^{(k-1)})$$\nBy repeatedly substituting the expressions for the previous states, we can express $B$ as a composition of all transposition operators applied to the original array $A_0$:\n$$B = t_{i_{k-1}}(t_{i_{k-2}}(\\dots(t_{i_0}(A_0))\\dots))$$\nIn the language of function composition, this is written as:\n$$B = (t_{i_{k-1}} \\circ t_{i_{k-2}} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_0})(A_0)$$\nLet us define the total permutation $P$ produced by the entire sorting process as this composition of transpositions:\n$$P = t_{i_{k-1}} \\circ t_{i_{k-2}} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_0}$$\nThe relationship between the original array $A_0$ and the final array $B$ is thus $B = P(A_0)$.\n\nOur goal is to find $A_0$. To do this, we must apply the inverse permutation $P^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation:\n$$P^{-1}(B) = P^{-1}(P(A_0))$$\n$$P^{-1}(B) = (P^{-1} \\circ P)(A_0)$$\nSince $P^{-1} \\circ P$ is the identity permutation, we get:\n$$A_0 = P^{-1}(B)$$\nNow, we must find the inverse permutation $P^{-1}$. The inverse of a composition of operators $(g \\circ f)^{-1}$ is $f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}$. Applying this rule to $P$:\n$$P^{-1} = (t_{i_{k-1}} \\circ t_{i_{k-2}} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_0})^{-1} = t_{i_0}^{-1} \\circ t_{i_1}^{-1} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_{k-1}}^{-1}$$\nAn adjacent transposition $t_i$ is an operation that swaps two elements. Applying the same swap twice restores the elements to their original positions. Therefore, any adjacent transposition is its own inverse: $t_i \\circ t_i = \\text{identity}$, which implies $t_i^{-1} = t_i$.\n\nSubstituting $t_i^{-1} = t_i$ into the expression for $P^{-1}$, we obtain:\n$$P^{-1} = t_{i_0} \\circ t_{i_1} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_{k-1}}$$\nFinally, we can express the reconstruction of $A_0$ as:\n$$A_0 = (t_{i_0} \\circ t_{i_1} \\circ \\dots \\circ t_{i_{k-1}})(B)$$\nThis composition dictates that to obtain $A_0$, we must start with the final array $B$ and apply the transpositions in the order $t_{i_{k-1}}$, then $t_{i_{k-2}}$, and so on, ending with $t_{i_0}$. This is equivalent to iterating through the given swap record $S = [i_0, i_1, \\dots, i_{k-1}]$ in reverse chronological order and applying each swap.\n\nThe algorithm for reconstructing $A_0$ is as follows:\n1. Create a mutable copy of the final sorted array $B$. Let this be `current_array`.\n2. Iterate through the list of swap indices $S$ from the last index $k-1$ down to the first index $0$.\n3. For each swap index $i_j$ encountered in this reverse iteration, perform an adjacent swap on `current_array` at index $i_j$. That is, exchange the elements `current_array`$[i_j]$ and `current_array`$[i_j+1]$.\n4. After the loop completes, `current_array` will hold the state of the original array, $A_0$.\n\nThis algorithm is derived entirely from the first principles of permutations and their inverses, as required. It correctly reverses the recorded transformation to recover the initial state.",

This relation is non-transitive because $R \\prec P$ and $P \\prec S$ do not imply $R \\prec S$ (indeed $S \\prec R$ holds). A comparison function for sorting is given by testing $x \\prec y$ (interpreted as “$x$ should come before $y$”); the sorting goal is that for an array $A$ of length $n$, adjacent positions satisfy $A[i] \\prec A[i+1]$ or $A[i] = A[i+1]$ for all indices $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$.\n\nAn implementation of optimized bubble sort is used, defined as the classical adjacent-swap bubble sort with two common optimizations: (i) an “early exit” flag that terminates the algorithm after any pass with zero swaps, and (ii) shrinking the inner-loop boundary on each pass to the index of the last swap.

Correct.** Our exhaustive trace confirms that for any of the 6 initial permutations, the algorithm terminates and the final array is one of the three specified stable configurations.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. The \"last-swap\" optimization ensures that the boundary of the inner loop is a non-increasing non-negative integer. If any swaps occur, this boundary strictly decreases. A strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers must eventually reach 0, at which point the inner loop no longer executes and the algorithm terminates.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** A total order must be transitive. The relation $\\prec$ is cyclic and non-transitive ($R \\prec P$ and $P \\prec S$, but $R \\not\\prec S$). It is mathematically impossible for a total order to \"extend\" a non-transitive relation in this way, as it would lead to contradictions (e.g., $R  S$ from transitivity, but the rules state $S \\prec R$).\n\n**D. Correct.** For the specific case of $n=3$ with this comparator, the final state is determined entirely within the first pass. The optimizations (early exit and shrinking boundary) only affect the number of subsequent redundant comparisons and passes. They prune unnecessary work but do not alter the final permutation reached. A non-optimized bubble sort would yield the same final arrays, just less efficiently.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** The early-exit condition (a pass with zero swaps) is a definitive proof that the array is sorted *according to the comparator*. If a pass over the active range of indices finds no adjacent pairs $(A[i], A[i+1])$ such that $A[i+1] \\prec A[i]$, then by definition, $A[i] \\prec A[i+1]$ holds for all those pairs.
