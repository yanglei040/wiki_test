This practice tackles the quintessential problem of finding a \"safe\" shortest path in a graph that may contain such cycles.

            "problem": "You are given a finite directed weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ with real-valued edge weights $w:E\\to\\mathbb{R}$. A path from a source vertex $s\\in V$ to a target vertex $t\\in V$ is a sequence of vertices $\\left[v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_k\\right]$ with $v_0=s$, $v_k=t$, and $\\left(v_i,v_{i+1}\\right)\\in E$ for all $i\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,k-1\\}$. The weight of a path is the sum of its edge weights, that is, $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w\\!\\left(v_i,v_{i+1}\\right)$. A cycle is a path with $v_0=v_k$ and $k\\geq 1$. A negative cycle is a cycle whose total weight is strictly less than $0$. In the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem, the goal is to find a path from $s$ to $t$ with minimum total weight among all $s$ to $t$ paths.\n\nYour task is to write a complete program that, for each provided test case, computes a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that is guaranteed not to be part of any negative cycle, even if such cycles exist elsewhere in the graph. The program must implement logic that ensures the returned path uses only vertices that are not affected by any negative cycle reachable from $s$. If the target vertex $t$ is unreachable from $s$, or $t$ is reachable from any vertex that lies on or is reachable from a negative cycle that is itself reachable from $s$, then there is no well-defined finite shortest path, and you must return an empty list.\n\nFundamental base and definitions you must adhere to:\n- The directed weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ has vertex set $V$ and edge set $E\\subseteq V\\times V$, with each edge $\\left(u,v\\right)\\in E$ assigned a weight $w\\!\\left(u,v\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The weight of any path $\\left[v_0,\\dots,v_k\\right]$ is $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w\\!\\left(v_i,v_{i+1}\\right)$.\n- A negative cycle is any cycle $\\left[v_0,\\dots,v_k\\right]$ with $v_0=v_k$ and $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w\\!\\left(v_i,v_{i+1}\\right)0$.\n- It is a well-tested fact that if there is a negative cycle reachable from $s$ that can reach $t$, then no finite minimum exists for the $s$ to $t$ path weight; moreover, after performing $|V|-1$ rounds of relaxation in the Bellman–Ford algorithm, the presence of any edge $\\left(u,v\\right)\\in E$ for which the distance estimate $d[u]+w\\!\\left(u,v\\right)$ is still less than $d[v]$ implies the existence of a negative cycle reachable from $s$, and any vertex reachable from such a witness of further relaxation is affected by that negative cycle.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- For each test case, return the path as a list of integers denoting the vertex sequence from $s$ to $t$. If no well-defined finite shortest path exists (either because $t$ is unreachable from $s$ or because $t$ is affected by a negative cycle reachable from $s$), return an empty list $\\left[\\right]$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $\\left[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3\\right]$), where each $\\text{result}_i$ is itself a list (e.g., $\\left[0,1,2\\right]$) or an empty list $\\left[\\right]$.\n\nTest suite:\nUse exactly the following test cases, each specified by a tuple $\\left(n,E,s,t\\right)$ where $n=|V|$ is the number of vertices labeled as integers $\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, $E$ is a list of directed edges with weights given as triples $\\left(u,v,w\\right)$, and $s,t$ are the source and target vertices.\n\n- Test case $1$ (happy path with an unreachable negative cycle elsewhere):\n  - $n=5$\n  - $E=\\left[\\left(0,1,3\\right),\\left(1,2,-2\\right),\\left(0,2,5\\right),\\left(3,4,-1\\right),\\left(4,3,-1\\right)\\right]$\n  - $s=0$\n  - $t=2$\n  - Expected behavior: The negative cycle on vertices $\\left\\{3,4\\right\\}$ is unreachable from $s$, so the shortest path is well-defined.\n\n- Test case $2$ (negative cycle reachable from $s$ that can reach $t$):\n  - $n=4$\n  - $E=\\left[\\left(0,1,1\\right),\\left(1,2,1\\right),\\left(2,1,-3\\right),\\left(2,3,2\\right)\\right]$\n  - $s=0$\n  - $t=3$\n  - Expected behavior: There exists a negative cycle reachable from $s$ that can reach $t$, so no finite shortest path exists; return $\\left[\\right]$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (negative cycle reachable from $s$ but cannot reach $t$, with an unaffected path to $t$):\n  - $n=6$\n  - $E=\\left[\\left(0,1,2\\right),\\left(1,2,2\\right),\\left(2,1,-5\\right),\\left(0,3,1\\right),\\left(3,4,1\\right),\\left(4,5,1\\right)\\right]$\n  - $s=0$\n  - $t=5$\n  - Expected behavior: The negative cycle on vertices $\\left\\{1,2\\right\\}$ is reachable from $s$ but cannot reach $t$, so the shortest path to $t$ is well-defined and must avoid affected vertices.\n\n- Test case $4$ (target unreachable):\n  - $n=3$\n  - $E=\\left[\\left(0,1,1\\right)\\right]$\n  - $s=0$\n  - $t=2$\n  - Expected behavior: Vertex $t$ is unreachable from $s$; return $\\left[\\right]$.\n\n- Test case $5$ (boundary case $s=t$ with no negative influence on $s$):\n  - $n=3$\n  - $E=\\left[\\left(0,2,4\\right)\\right]$\n  - $s=1$\n  - $t=1$\n  - Expected behavior: The shortest path from $s$ to itself is the trivial path $\\left[1\\right]$ since $s$ is not affected by any negative cycle.\n\nYour program must use these test cases and output one line containing the list of results in the exact format described above.",
            "solution": "The given problem asks for the computation of a shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$ in a directed, weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ where edge weights can be negative. The crucial constraint is that the path must be well-defined, meaning it must not be possible to decrease its weight indefinitely by traversing a negative cycle. Specifically, if the target $t$ is unreachable, or if its shortest path is influenced by a negative cycle reachable from $s$, no such path exists.\n\nThe presence of negative edge weights suggests the use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is designed for the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem in such graphs. The standard Bellman-Ford algorithm can also detect if there is a negative cycle reachable from the source $s$. Our task requires an extension of this capability to identify all vertices whose shortest path calculations are \"corrupted\" by such cycles and to ensure our path to $t$ avoids them.\n\nThe core principle of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is iterative relaxation. It initializes the distance to the source $d[s]$ as $0$ and all other distances $d[v]$ to infinity. It then repeatedly relaxes all edges in the graph. For an edge $(u,v)$ with weight $w(u,v)$, relaxation is the process of checking if the path to $v$ can be shortened by going through $u$, i.e., if $d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v]$. If so, $d[v]$ is updated to $d[u] + w(u,v)$, and the predecessor of $v$ on this path, $p[v]$, is set to $u$.\n\nIn a graph with $|V|$ vertices, any simple path (a path without repeated vertices) can have at most $|V|-1$ edges. The Bellman-Ford algorithm guarantees that after $|V|-1$ iterations of relaxing all edges, the calculated distances $d[v]$ are the shortest path weights from $s$ to all other vertices $v$, provided there are no negative cycles reachable from $s$.\n\nThe problem hinges on correctly handling negative cycles. A key property of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, as stated in the problem description, is that if after $|V|-1$ iterations, a further relaxation is possible for any edge $(u,v)$, it signals the existence of a negative-weight cycle reachable from $s$. Any vertex $v$ whose distance estimate $d[v]$ is lowered during a conceptual $|V|$-th iteration is on a path from $s$ that contains a negative cycle. The shortest path to such a vertex is undefined (it can be made arbitrarily small by repeatedly traversing the cycle).\n\nFurthermore, any vertex reachable from a vertex affected by a negative cycle is also considered affected, as paths to it could be routed through the corrupted vertex, making their shortest path weights also undefined.\n\nThis leads to the following comprehensive algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: For a graph with $n=|V|$ vertices, create a distance array $d$ of size $n$ and initialize $d[s] = 0$ and $d[v] = \\infty$ for all $v \\neq s$. Create a predecessor array $p$ of size $n$, initialized to a sentinel value (e.g., $-1$) indicating no predecessor.\n\n2.  **Bellman-Ford Relaxations**: Perform $n-1$ iterations. In each iteration, loop through every edge $(u,v) \\in E$ with weight $w(u,v)$ and perform the relaxation step: if $d[u] \\neq \\infty$ and $d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v]$, update $d[v] = d[u] + w(u,v)$ and $p[v] = u$.\n\n3.  **Identification of Affected Vertices**:\n    a.  Identify vertices directly affected by negative cycles. We can do this by performing one more round of relaxation checks (the $n$-th round). Create a queue, `affected_queue`, and for each edge $(u,v) \\in E$, if $d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v]$, it means $v$ is on a path from $s$ that involves a negative cycle. Add $v$ to `affected_queue`. To avoid duplicates and for efficient lookup, a set `all_affected` is also populated with these initial vertices.\n    b.  Propagate the \"affected\" status. Any vertex reachable from an affected vertex is also affected. Perform a graph traversal (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from all vertices in `affected_queue`. For this, an adjacency list representation of the graph is useful. During the traversal, add all newly discovered reachable vertices to the `all_affected` set.\n\n4.  **Path Determination and Reconstruction**:\n    a.  First, check if the target vertex $t$ is reachable at all. If $d[t] = \\infty$ after the Bellman-Ford phase, no path exists from $s$ to $t$. The result is an empty list.\n    b.  Next, check if $t$ is affected by a negative cycle. If $t$ is in the `all_affected` set, no well-defined finite shortest path exists. The result is an empty list.\n    c.  If $t$ is reachable and not affected, a valid shortest path exists. This path can be reconstructed by starting from $t$ and iteratively moving to its predecessor using the array $p$ until $s$ is reached. The sequence of vertices visited, when reversed, gives the shortest path from $s$ to $t$. If $s=t$, the path is simply $[s]$.\n\nThis algorithm correctly finds a safe shortest path by first running the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute path weights and predecessors, then systematically identifying and quarantining all vertices whose shortest path distances are compromised by negative cycles, and finally checking the target vertex against these conditions before reconstructing the path.",

            "problem": "You are given a directed, weighted graph specified by a finite vertex set and a finite edge set. Each edge has an integer weight. A cycle is a closed walk that starts and ends at the same vertex. The total weight of a cycle is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. A cycle is called negative if its total weight is strictly less than $0$. You are also given a designated directed edge $(u,v)$ inside the graph. Your task is to design and implement a program that, using first principles of shortest-path definitions and the Bellman–Ford algorithm, determines whether there exists a negative cycle that passes through the designated edge $(u,v)$. If such a cycle exists, the program must return one explicit instance of it as a list of vertex indices in order, starting at $u$, immediately traversing the designated edge to $v$, and then continuing until returning to $u$. If no such cycle exists, return the empty list for that test case.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- A directed weighted graph is a tuple $(V,E,w)$, where $V$ is a finite set of vertices indexed by integers, $E \\subseteq V \\times V$ is the set of directed edges, and $w: E \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ assigns an integer weight to each edge.\n- For a path $P = (x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$ where $(x_i, x_{i+1}) \\in E$ for all $i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,k-1\\}$, the path weight is $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(x_i, x_{i+1})$.\n- For an edge $(u,v) \\in E$, and any path $Q$ from $v$ to $u$, the closed walk that traverses $(u,v)$ followed by $Q$ is a cycle.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine if a directed, weighted graph $(V,E,w)$ contains a negative-weight cycle that passes through a designated edge $(u,v) \\in E$. If such a cycle exists, we must provide one instance of it.\n\nThe fundamental principle for identifying such a cycle is rooted in the definition of cycle weight. A cycle passing through the edge $(u,v)$ is formed by the traversal of $(u,v)$ followed by a path $P$ from vertex $v$ back to vertex $u$. The total weight of this cycle, $W_{cycle}$, is the sum of the weight of the edge $(u,v)$, denoted $w(u,v)$, and the weight of the path $P$, denoted $W(P_{v \\to u})$.\n$$W_{cycle} = w(u,v) + W(P_{v \\to u})$$\nThe cycle is negative if and only if its total weight is strictly less than zero.\n$$w(u,v) + W(P_{v \\to u})  0$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to provide a condition on the path weight:\n$$W(P_{v \\to u})  -w(u,v)$$\nTo determine if such a path exists, we must find the path from $v$ to $u$ with the minimum possible weight. This is, by definition, the shortest path from $v$ to $u$. Let the weight of this shortest path be $\\delta(v,u)$. If $\\delta(v,u)  -w(u,v)$, then a negative cycle through $(u,v)$ is guaranteed to exist, formed by the edge $(u,v)$ and this shortest path. If even the shortest path does not satisfy this condition, no other path will, and thus no such negative cycle exists.\n\nThe problem statement includes a critical specification: \"if there are no negative cycles that make shortest-path values ill-defined along the path to $u$\". This implies that we can assume the shortest path weight $\\delta(v,u)$ is a finite value, rather than $-\\infty$, which would be the case if a negative-weight cycle were part of the shortest path from $v$ to $u$. This simplification allows for a direct application of a standard shortest-path algorithm.\n\nThe Bellman-Ford algorithm is the appropriate tool for this task, as it correctly computes single-source shortest paths in graphs that may contain negative-weight edges. We will execute the Bellman-Ford algorithm with vertex $v$ as the source to find the shortest path to all other vertices, including $u$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Validation**: First, we verify that the designated edge $(u,v)$ exists in the graph's edge set $E$. If it does not, no cycle can pass through it, and the process terminates for that test case. Let its weight be $w_{uv}$.\n\n2.  **Bellman-Ford Execution**: We initialize a distance array, $d$, of size $|V|$, with $d[v] = 0$ and $d[i] = \\infty$ for all other vertices $i \\in V$. A predecessor array, $p$, is also initialized to track the path. The core of the Bellman-Ford algorithm consists of relaxing every edge in the graph. This relaxation step is repeated $|V|-1$ times. For each edge $(x,y)$ with weight $w_{xy}$, the relaxation operation is: if $d[x] + w_{xy}  d[y]$, update $d[y]$ to $d[x] + w_{xy}$ and set $p[y] = x$. After $|V|-1$ iterations, $d[u]$ will hold the weight of the shortest path from $v$ to $u$, $\\delta(v,u)$, given the problem's simplifying assumption.\n\n3.  **Path and Cycle Existence Check**:\n    - If, after the algorithm completes, $d[u]$ remains $\\infty$, it signifies that there is no path from $v$ to $u$. Consequently, no cycle can be formed, and we conclude no such negative cycle exists.\n    - If a path exists (i.e., $d[u]$ is finite), we check the negativity condition: $d[u] + w_{uv}  0$. If this condition is not met, the cycle formed by the shortest path is not negative, and no other path from $v$ to $u$ can form a lighter cycle.\n\n4.  **Cycle Reconstruction**: If the negativity condition $d[u] + w_{uv}  0$ is satisfied, a negative cycle has been found. We must reconstruct its vertex sequence. This is done by backtracking from $u$ using the predecessor array $p$. We start with a list containing $u$, and iteratively prepend its predecessor $p[u]$, then $p[p[u]]$, and so on, until we reach $v$. This process yields the vertex list for the shortest path from $v$ to $u$, let's call it `path_v_to_u`. The final output is the ordered list of vertices forming the cycle, which starts at $u$, traverses the edge to $v$, and then follows the reconstructed path back to $u$. This corresponds to concatenating a list containing just $u$ with `path_v_to_u`, i.e., `[u] + path_v_to_u`. For a path $v \\to x_1 \\to \\dots \\to u$, the reconstructed path list is $[v, x_1, \\dots, u]$, and the final cycle list is $[u, v, x_1, \\dots, u]$.\n\nThis systematic approach, founded on the first principles of shortest paths and implemented with the Bellman-Ford algorithm, correctly solves the problem as specified.",

            "problem": "You are given the task of designing and implementing a program that computes shortest path estimates in a directed weighted graph using the Bellman–Ford algorithm. The focus is to reason from core definitions of paths and cycles and to ensure the implementation uses only signed $64$-bit integer arithmetic, including a robust strategy to detect and handle potential overflows during relaxation.\n\nThe fundamental base to be used is the following set of definitions and properties:\n- A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of a finite set of vertices $V$ and directed edges $E \\subseteq V \\times V$ with weights.\n- Each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ has an integer weight $w(u, v)$. A path $P = (v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k)$ has total weight equal to the sum of its edge weights, that is $W(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(v_i, v_{i+1})$.\n- A cycle is a path whose starting and ending vertex are the same. A cycle is negative if the sum of its edge weights is strictly less than $0$.\n- The Bellman–Ford algorithm iteratively relaxes edges based on path definitions, and it detects the presence of a negative cycle reachable from the source if an additional relaxation after $|V|-1$ iterations can still reduce some distance estimate.\n- All integer computations must conform to signed $64$-bit two's complement bounds. Define the smallest representable signed $64$-bit integer as $\\text{MIN} = -2^{63}$ and the largest as $\\text{MAX} = 2^{63}-1$.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use only signed $64$-bit integer arithmetic for all path weight computations and comparisons. You must design a relaxation step that checks for potential overflow before attempting to add two signed $64$-bit integers $a$ and $b$. Overflow must be detected using inequalities on $\\text{MIN}$ and $\\text{MAX}$ without computing $a+b$ if it would exceed the representable bounds. If an overflow would occur during a relaxation attempt, the relaxation must be skipped (i.e., treated as no improvement).\n- Use the convention that an initially unreachable vertex has distance $\\text{INF} = \\text{MAX}$. Use the convention that a vertex affected by a negative cycle reachable from the source has distance $\\text{NEG\\_INF} = \\text{MIN}$. For scientific realism and to prevent ambiguous sentinel collisions, assume all edge weights lie strictly within the open interval $(\\text{MIN}, \\text{MAX})$ and that the program will not assign $\\text{MIN}$ through finite relaxation except when marking vertices as affected by a negative cycle.\n- The algorithm must detect vertices whose estimates can still be decreased on the $|V|$-th pass and then mark all vertices reachable from any such vertex as affected by a negative cycle reachable from the source. Those vertices must have their output distance set to $\\text{NEG\\_INF}$.\n\nYour program must be self-contained, with the following fixed test suite encoded within it. Interpret each test case as a directed graph with a specified source, and produce the computed result for that case.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$ (Happy path with no negative cycle):\n  - Vertices: $5$\n  - Edges: $(0,1,5)$, $(0,2,10)$, $(1,3,3)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(3,4,2)$\n  - Source: $0$\n  - Expected behavior: shortest path estimates computed normally.\n- Case $2$ (Negative cycle reachable from the source):\n  - Vertices: $4$\n  - Edges: $(0,1,1)$, $(1,2,-1)$, $(2,1,-1)$, $(2,3,2)$\n  - Source: $0$\n  - Expected behavior: detection and propagation of negative cycle reachability to affected vertices.\n- Case $3$ (Boundary weights inducing potential overflow handling during relaxation):\n  - Vertices: $4$\n  - Edges: $(0,1, \\text{MAX}-1)$, $(1,2, 10)$, $(1,3, \\text{MIN}+10)$\n  - Source: $0$\n  - Expected behavior: a relaxation that would overflow is skipped; other relaxations proceed if within bounds.\n- Case $4$ (Disconnected graph with an unreachable negative cycle):\n  - Vertices: $5$\n  - Edges: $(1,2,4)$, $(2,3,5)$, $(3,1,-12)$\n  - Source: $0$\n  - Expected behavior: unreachable vertices retain $\\text{INF}$; the negative cycle is not reachable from the source and thus does not affect outputs.\n\nFinal Output Format:\n- For each test case, produce a list containing two elements: the boolean indicating whether some vertex is affected by a negative cycle reachable from the source, and a list of signed $64$-bit integers representing the distance to each vertex where $\\text{INF} = 2^{63}-1$ denotes unreachable and $\\text{NEG\\_INF} = -2^{63}$ denotes affected by a reachable negative cycle.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, the overall output should look like $[ [\\text{boolean}, [\\text{d}_0,\\dots,\\text{d}_{n-1}] ], \\dots ]$ with literal Python syntax in the printed line.",
            "solution": "The provided problem is valid. It is a well-defined task in the domain of graph algorithms, grounded in standard computer science principles. The constraints on arithmetic and overflow handling are specific and formalizable.\n\nThe goal is to implement the Bellman–Ford algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed, weighted graph $G=(V, E)$ from a given source vertex $s \\in V$. The implementation must strictly adhere to signed $64$-bit integer arithmetic, including robust overflow detection, and correctly handle negative-weight cycles.\n\nThe core principle of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is iterative relaxation based on the property that a shortest path in a graph with no negative-weight cycles can have at most $|V|-1$ edges. Let $d[v]$ be the estimated weight of the shortest path from the source $s$ to any vertex $v \\in V$.\n\n**1. Initialization**\nFirst, we initialize the distance estimates. The distance to the source $s$ is $0$, and the distance to all other vertices is $\\infty$. For this problem, we must use the signed $64$-bit integer limits. We define $\\text{INF}$ as the maximum representable value, $\\text{MAX} = 2^{63}-1$, and $\\text{NEG\\_INF}$ as the minimum representable value, $\\text{MIN} = -2^{63}$.\nThe distance array, $d$, is initialized as:\n$d[s] = 0$\n$d[v] = \\text{INF}$ for all $v \\in V, v \\neq s$.\n\n**2. Iterative Relaxation with Overflow Safety**\nThe algorithm proceeds by relaxing edges repeatedly. For each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ with weight $w(u,v)$, relaxation is the process of checking if the path through $u$ provides a shorter path to $v$. The standard relaxation is:\nif $d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v]$, then update $d[v] = d[u] + w(u,v)$.\n\nThis loop is executed $|V|-1$ times. After $i$ iterations, the algorithm finds all shortest paths of at most $i$ edges. After $|V|-1$ iterations, it has found all shortest paths, provided no negative-weight cycles exist.\n\nA critical requirement is to perform this addition with overflow safety within signed $64$-bit integer bounds. Before computing $a+b$, where $a=d[u]$ and $b=w(u,v)$, we must check if the result would exceed $[\\text{MIN}, \\text{MAX}]$. An overflow occurs if:\n- **Positive Overflow**: $a  0$, $b  0$, and $b  \\text{MAX} - a$.\n- **Negative Overflow**: $a  0$, $b  0$, and $b  \\text{MIN} - a$.\nIf an overflow is detected, the relaxation is skipped, as if no shorter path was found. We also do not relax from a vertex $u$ if $d[u] = \\text{INF}$.\n\n**3. Negative-Weight Cycle Detection**\nAfter $|V|-1$ iterations, a final, $|V|$-th, iteration over all edges is performed. If any distance $d[v]$ can still be improved, it signifies that $v$ is part of or reachable from a negative-weight cycle that is itself reachable from the source $s$.\nSpecifically, we identify a set of \"infected\" vertices:\n$$I = \\{ v \\in V \\mid \\exists (u, v) \\in E \\text{ such that } d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v] \\text{ after } |V|-1 \\text{ passes} \\}$$\nThe same overflow-safe addition must be used in this check. If this set $I$ is non-empty, a reachable negative-weight cycle has been detected.\n\n**4. Negative-Weight Cycle Propagation**\nThe presence of a negative-weight cycle means the shortest path to vertices affected by it is undefined (or can be considered $-\\infty$). The problem requires us to identify all such vertices and set their distance to $\\text{NEG\\_INF}$. A vertex is affected if it is reachable from any vertex that is part of a negative-weight cycle. Our set $I$ contains vertices whose distances were shortened in the $|V|$-th pass. These vertices are guaranteed to be reachable from a negative cycle. Therefore, any vertex reachable from a vertex in $I$ is also affected.\n\nTo implement this, we perform a graph traversal (such as Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from all vertices in the set $I$. All vertices visited during this traversal have their final distance set to $\\text{NEG\\_INF}$.\n\n**5. Final Result Formulation**\nThe output for each test case is a pair: a boolean value indicating if a reachable negative-weight cycle was detected (i.e., if the set $I$ was non-empty), and a list of the final distances to each vertex. Distances to unreachable vertices remain $\\text{INF}$, and distances to vertices affected by a negative cycle are set to $\\text{NEG\\_INF}$.\nThe implementation will process the provided test suite, applying this logic to each case, and format the collected results into a single output string as specified.",
