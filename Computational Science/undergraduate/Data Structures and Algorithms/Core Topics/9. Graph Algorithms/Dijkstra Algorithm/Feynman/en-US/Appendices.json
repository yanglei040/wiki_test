            "problem": "A distributed network consists of six data centers, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, that handle large-scale computations. To optimize data routing, a protocol is initiated from the primary data center, A. The protocol's goal is to establish the lowest-cost communication path from A to every other center in the network. The connections between centers are bidirectional, and each link has an associated latency cost.\n\nThe network topology and costs are as follows:\n- A is connected to B with a cost of 2.\n- A is connected to C with a cost of 5.\n- A is connected to D with a cost of 9.\n- B is connected to C with a cost of 2.\n- B is connected to E with a cost of 7.\n- C is connected to D with a cost of 3.\n- C is connected to E with a cost of 1.\n- D is connected to F with a cost of 2.\n- E is connected to F with a cost of 4.\n\nThe protocol operates by maintaining a set of \"unconfirmed\" centers and their current lowest-known latency cost from A. Initially, all centers except A are unconfirmed, with their costs set to infinity, while A's cost is 0. In each step, the protocol selects the unconfirmed center with the minimum current cost, marks it as \"confirmed\", and updates the costs of its unconfirmed neighbors if a shorter path is found through the newly confirmed center. This process repeats until all centers are confirmed.\n\nWhat is the sequence in which the data centers are confirmed by this protocol?\n\nA. A, B, C, D, E, F\n\nB. A, B, C, E, D, F\n\nC.

Then apply your derived modification to the graph above to determine the total number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths. Assume arbitrary tie-breaking in the PQ; the count must be independent of tie-breaking. Express your final answer as a single real-valued number with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin with the core definitions. A weighted directed graph $(V,E,w)$ has a set of vertices $V$, a set of directed edges $E \\subseteq V \\times V$, and a nonnegative weight function $w : E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. For a path $P = \\langle v_{0}, v_{1}, \\dots, v_{k} \\rangle$ with $(v_{i}, v_{i+1}) \\in E$ for all $i$, its length is $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(v_{i}, v_{i+1})$. The shortest-path distance from $s$ to $x$, denoted $d^{\\ast}(x)$, is $\\min\\{\\text{length}(P) : P \\text{ is an } s\\text{-}x \\text{ path}\\}$.\n\nDijkstra’s algorithm maintains a tentative distance array $d[v]$, initializing $d[s] = 0$ and $d[v] = \\infty$ for $v \\neq s$, and a priority queue (PQ) keyed by $d[v]$. A fundamental invariant is: when a vertex $u$ is extracted from the PQ, $d[u] = d^{\\ast}(u)$, and no future relaxation can decrease $d[u]$ because all edge weights are nonnegative.\n\nTo count the number of distinct shortest paths, we augment Dijkstra’s algorithm with a path-count array $c[v]$ where $c[v]$ denotes the number of distinct shortest $s$-$v$ paths consistent with the current best known distance $d[v]$. The initialization is $c[s] = 1$ (there is exactly one empty path of length $0$ to itself), and $c[v] = 0$ for $v \\neq s$. When relaxing an edge $(u,v)$ with weight $w(u,v)$, we consider the candidate distance $d[u] + w(u,v)$:\n- If $d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$, then we have found a strictly shorter $s$-$v$ path. Set $d[v] \\leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$ and reset $c[v] \\leftarrow c[u]$ because every shortest $s$-$v$ path must now end by $(u,v)$ and consist of a shortest $s$-$u$ path followed by this edge.\n- If $d[u] + w(u,v) = d[v]$, then we have found additional shortest $s$-$v$ paths of equal minimal length. Add $c[u]$ to $c[v]$, that is, $c[v] \\leftarrow c[v] + c[u]$, because each shortest $s$-$u$ path can be extended by $(u,v)$ to yield a distinct shortest $s$-$v$ path.\n\nCorrectness is justified by induction over the order in which vertices are extracted from the PQ. The base case is $s$, with $d[s] = 0 = d^{\\ast}(s)$ and $c[s] = 1$. Assume that for all previously extracted vertices $u$, we have $d[u] = d^{\\ast}(u)$ and $c[u]$ equals the count of distinct shortest $s$-$u$ paths. For a relaxation $(u,v)$, if a strictly better distance is found, all previous shortest $s$-$v$ paths become non-shortest, so resetting $c[v]$ to $c[u]$ is necessary and sufficient, because any shortest $s$-$v$ path must pass through some predecessor $u$ extracted earlier with finalized $d[u]$, and then the last edge $(u,v)$; nonnegative weights ensure this structure is acyclic in the final shortest-path DAG when distances are finalized. If an equally short distance is found, paths via $u$ are new shortest $s$-$v$ paths distinct from those already counted for $v$, so addition accumulates the correct total. When $t$ is extracted or all relaxations are complete, $d[t] = d^{\\ast}(t)$ and $c[t]$ equals the number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths.\n\nWe now apply this modification to the given graph.

Extract $e$ ($d[e] = 4$):\n- $(e,g)$: candidate $4 + 2 = 6 < \\infty$, so $d[g] \\leftarrow 6$, $c[g] \\leftarrow c[e] = 2$.\n- $(e,t)$: candidate $4 + 5 = 9 < d[t] = 10$, so $d[t] \\leftarrow 9$, $c[t] \\leftarrow c[e] = 2$.\n\nExtract $f$ ($d[f] = 4$):\n- $(f,g)$: candidate $4 + 2 = 6 = d[g]$, so $c[g] \\leftarrow c[g] + c[f] = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n- $(f,t)$: candidate $4 + 5 = 9 = d[t]$, so $c[t] \\leftarrow c[t] + c[f] = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nExtract $g$ ($d[g] = 6$):\n- $(g,t)$: candidate $6 + 3 = 9 = d[t]$, so $c[t] \\leftarrow c[t] + c[g] = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n\nFinally, extract $t$ ($d[t] = 9$); no outgoing relaxations relevant. The algorithm terminates with $d[t] = 9$, which is the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$, and $c[t] = 6$, the total number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths.\n\nWe can cross-check the path structure to ensure no overcounting:\n- Paths via $e$ directly to $t$: from $s$ to $e$ there are $2$ shortest routes ($s \\to b \\to e$ and $s \\to c \\to e$), each extended by $(e,t)$ yields $2$ distinct shortest paths of total length $4 + 5 = 9$.\n- Paths via $f$ directly to $t$: the unique shortest route to $f$ is $s \\to d \\to f$ (length $3 + 1 = 4$); extending by $(f,t)$ yields $1$ shortest path of length $9$.\n- Paths via $g$ to $t$: to $g$ there are $3$ shortest routes (two via $e$ and one via $f$), each extended by $(g,t)$ yields $3$ distinct shortest paths of length $6 + 3 = 9$.\nSumming $2 + 1 + 3 = 6$ agrees with $c[t] = 6$ produced by the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ in the given graph is $6$.",
