This first exercise challenges you to adapt the standard Breadth-First Search to find a shortest path while respecting a set of \"forbidden\" nodes.

            "problem": "Consider a finite, simple, unweighted graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a finite set of nodes labeled by distinct integers and $E \\subseteq \\{\\,(u,v)\\mid u,v \\in V,\\, u \\neq v\\,\\}$ is a set of undirected edges. A path is a sequence of nodes $(v_0,v_1,\\ldots,v_k)$ such that for all $i \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,k-1\\}$, $(v_i,v_{i+1}) \\in E$. The length of a path is the number of edges in the sequence, which equals $k$. Given two distinct nodes $s,t \\in V$ and a set of forbidden nodes $F \\subseteq V$, an admissible path from $s$ to $t$ is a path that starts at $s$, ends at $t$, and contains no node from $F$. If either $s \\in F$ or $t \\in F$, there is no admissible path by definition.\n\nYou must compute the shortest admissible path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$, if it exists, under the following deterministic tie-breaking rule: among all admissible paths of minimal length, return the path with the lexicographically smallest sequence of nodes. To enforce determinism, when exploring neighbors, always consider neighbors in ascending numerical order. If no admissible path exists, return the empty list.\n\nThe fundamental base you may assume is the following: in an unweighted graph, the breadth-first search expansion layers correspond to shortest-path distances from a source node, and restricting to an induced subgraph preserves path lengths relative to that subgraph.\n\nYour program must implement this computation and produce outputs for the following test suite. In each case, interpret $E$ as an undirected set: for each $(u,v) \\in E$, both $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ are allowed moves.\n\n- Test case $1$ (happy path with a detour forced by a forbidden node):\n  - $V = \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n  - $E = \\{(0,1),(0,3),(1,2),(2,3),(2,5),(5,6),(3,4),(4,6)\\}$.\n  - $s = 0$, $t = 6$, $F = \\{3\\}$.\n  - Expected behavior: the direct route through node $3$ is disallowed; find the shortest admissible path.\n\n- Test case $2$ (boundary condition where $s=t$):\n  - $V = \\{0,1,2\\}$.\n  - $E = \\{(0,1),(1,2)\\}$.\n  - $s = 2$, $t = 2$, $F = \\varnothing$.\n  - Expected behavior: the shortest admissible path has length $0$ and is the single-node sequence.\n\n- Test case $3$ (target is forbidden):\n  - $V = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.\n  - $E = \\{(0,1),(1,4),(0,2),(2,3),(3,4)\\}$.\n  - $s = 0$, $t = 4$, $F = \\{4\\}$.\n  - Expected behavior: no admissible path exists.\n\n- Test case $4$ (source is forbidden):\n  - $V = \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n  - $E = \\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)\\}$.\n  - $s = 1$, $t = 3$, $F = \\{1\\}$.\n  - Expected behavior: no admissible path exists.\n\n- Test case $5$ (multiple shortest admissible paths, require lexicographic tie-breaking):\n  - $V = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.\n  - $E = \\{(0,1),(1,4),(0,2),(2,4),(0,3),(3,4)\\}$.\n  - $s = 0$, $t = 4$, $F = \\varnothing$.\n  - Expected behavior: there are multiple admissible paths of minimal length; return the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nOutput specification: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the above five test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each test case result must be a list of integers representing the sequence of nodes on the returned path from $s$ to $t$ (inclusive), or the empty list $[]$ if no admissible path exists. For example, an output might look like $[[0,1,2,5,6],[2],[],[],[0,1,4]]$. There are no physical quantities in this problem; therefore, no physical units are required. The only acceptable data types in the final output are lists of integers, aggregated into a single top-level list as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. There exists a minor contradiction where the general problem description specifies \"two distinct nodes $s,t \\in V$\", but Test Case $2$ provides an instance where $s=t$. This is categorized as an ambiguity (a violation of Checklist Item 5: Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured). However, the test case is explicitly labeled as a \"boundary condition where $s=t$\", which serves to clarify the intended behavior. The problem is therefore solvable by interpreting the specific test cases as ground truth that refines or supersedes the general description. All other aspects of the problem are scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe task is to find a shortest path between a source node $s$ and a target node $t$ in a finite, simple, unweighted graph $G=(V,E)$. The path must be \"admissible,\" meaning it cannot pass through any node in a given forbidden set $F$. Furthermore, among all shortest admissible paths, the one that is lexicographically smallest must be chosen.\n\nThe fundamental principle for finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores the graph layer by layer from the source node $s$. This guarantees that the first time the target node $t$ is reached, the path taken is one of minimal length (i.e., has the fewest edges).\n\nThe solution must incorporate three main features into the standard BFS framework:\n1.  **Handling Forbidden Nodes**: The constraint that paths must be admissible is addressed by treating nodes in the set $F$ as if they are not part of the graph. The problem defines that if $s \\in F$ or $t \\in F$, no admissible path exists. This forms a base case that must be checked before initiating the search. During the search, any neighbor node $v$ that belongs to $F$ is ignored and not added to the exploration queue.\n2.  **Lexicographical Tie-Breaking**: The problem requires the lexicographically smallest path among all shortest paths. This is achieved by enforcing a deterministic order of exploration. The rule \"when exploring neighbors, always consider neighbors in ascending numerical order\" ensures this property. When the BFS expands from a node $u$, it enqueues its neighbors in sorted ascending order. Let us consider two paths $P_1 = (s, \\dots, u, v_1, \\dots, t)$ and $P_2 = (s, \\dots, u, v_2, \\dots, t)$ of the same minimal length, which first differ at the node after a common prefix $(s, \\dots, u)$. If $v_1 < v_2$, then the BFS will explore from $v_1$ before exploring from $v_2$. Consequently, the sub-path from $v_1$ will be explored, and the target $t$ will be found via this route, before the search proceeds from $v_2$ at the same depth. The algorithm terminates upon first finding $t$, thereby guaranteeing that the discovered path is not only of minimal length but also the lexicographically smallest.\n3.  **Path Reconstruction**: A standard BFS finds the shortest path *length* but does not inherently store the path itself. To reconstruct the path, we use a parent map, a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) that stores the predecessor of each visited node along the search path. For a node $v$ visited from node $u$, we set `parent[v] = u`. Once the target $t$ is found, the path can be reconstructed by backtracking from $t$ to $s$ using this parent map and then reversing the resulting sequence.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing and Initial Checks**:\n    - Given the set of nodes $V$, edges $E$, source $s$, target $t$, and forbidden nodes $F$.\n    - Check if $s \\in F$ or $t \\in F$. If so, no admissible path exists; return an empty list.\n    - If $s = t$, the shortest path is of length $0$ and consists of the node itself. Return the list $[s]$.\n    - Construct an adjacency list representation of the graph $G$, where for each node $u \\in V$, the list of its neighbors is sorted in ascending numerical order. This is critical for the lexicographical tie-breaking rule.\n\n2.  **BFS Execution**:\n    - Initialize a queue for BFS and add the source node $s$: `queue = [s]`.\n    - Initialize a set of visited nodes to prevent cycles and redundant exploration, containing only the source: `visited = {s}`.\n    - Initialize a parent map to reconstruct the path: `parents = {s: None}`.\n\n3.  **Graph Traversal**:\n    - While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue the current node $u$.\n        - If $u = t$, the shortest, lexicographically smallest path has been found. Proceed to path reconstruction.\n        - For each neighbor $v$ of $u$ (in pre-sorted ascending order):\n            - If $v$ has not been visited and $v \\notin F$:\n                - Mark $v$ as visited: add $v$ to `visited`.\n                - Record the parent: `parents[v] = u`.\n                - Enqueue $v$: `queue.append(v)`.\n\n4.  **Path Reconstruction or Failure**:\n    - If the loop finishes (queue is empty) and the target $t$ was not reached (i.e., `t` is not in the `parents` map), then no admissible path exists. Return an empty list.\n    - If $t$ was reached, backtrack from $t$ to $s$ using the `parents` map. Initialize a path list with `path = [t]`. While the last node in the path is not $s$, prepend its parent: `path.insert(0, parents[path[0]])`. Return the reconstructed `path`.\n\nThis algorithm correctly and efficiently computes the required path, satisfying all constraints of the problem.",

Concepts like directed graphs, paths, path length, and lexicographical ordering are rigorously defined. The problem is free of any pseudoscience or factual inaccuracies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The objective is clearly stated: find a shortest path with a specific property.

It is a clear, consistent, and solvable problem in the field of algorithms. A full solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$ that is constrained to pass through a specific intermediate vertex $w$.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\n\nA path from $s$ to $t$ that passes through $w$ can be conceptually decomposed into two segments: a path from $s$ to $w$ and a path from $w$ to $t$. To find the overall shortest path, we must find the shortest path for each of these segments.\nLet $P_{s \\to w}$ be a shortest path from $s$ to $w$, and $P_{w \\to t}$ be a shortest path from $w$ to $t$. The concatenation of these two paths forms a path from $s$ to $t$ that passes through $w$. The length of this concatenated path is the sum of the lengths of the individual paths: $L = \\text{length}(P_{s \\to w}) + \\text{length}(P_{w \\to t})$. By the principle of optimality, any shortest path from $s$ to $t$ via $w$ must be composed of a shortest path from $s$ to $w$ and a shortest path from $w$ to $t$.\n\nSince the graph is unweighted, the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is the appropriate method for finding shortest paths from a single source. A standard BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nThe problem introduces a tie-breaking rule: among all shortest paths, we must choose the one that is lexicographically smallest. A path $P_A = (v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k)$ is lexicographically smaller than another path $P_B = (u_0, u_1, \\dots, u_k)$ if at the first index $i$ where they differ, $v_i < u_i$. To ensure our BFS finds the lexicographically smallest path, we must modify the order in which it explores neighbors. When exploring the neighbors of any given vertex, the standard BFS algorithm can visit them in any order. To satisfy the lexicographical requirement, we must ensure that the neighbors are visited in ascending order of their vertex labels. This is achieved by sorting the adjacency list for each vertex.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list. For each vertex $u$, the list `adj[u]` will store all vertices $v$ for which an edge $(u,v)$ exists. Crucially, each of these lists must be sorted in ascending order to facilitate the lexicographical tie-breaking.\n\n2.  **Modified Breadth-First Search**: Implement a BFS function, `bfs(graph, source)`, that takes a graph and a source vertex as input. This function will:\n    - Use a queue to manage the frontier of vertices to visit.\n    - Use a `distance` array, initialized to a value indicating infinity (e.g., $-1$), to store the shortest distance from the `source` to every other vertex.\n    - Use a `parent` array to store the predecessor of each vertex in the shortest path, which is necessary for path reconstruction.\n    - When dequeuing a vertex $u$, iterate through its neighbors $v$ from the sorted adjacency list. If $v$ has not been visited yet (i.e., `distance[v] == -1`), update its distance and parent (`distance[v] = distance[u] + 1`, `parent[v] = u`) and enqueue it.\n    - The function returns the `distance` and `parent` arrays.\n\n3.  **Pathfinding and Combination**:\n    a. Execute the modified BFS starting from the source vertex $s$: `(distances_s, parents_s) = bfs(graph, s)`.\n    b. Execute the modified BFS starting from the intermediate vertex $w$: `(distances_w, parents_w) = bfs(graph, w)`.\n\n4.  **Reachability Check**:\n    a. Check if $w$ is reachable from $s$ by inspecting `distances_s[w]`.\n    b. Check if $t$ is reachable from $w$ by inspecting `distances_w[t]`.\n    c. If either is unreachable (distance is $-1$), no valid path exists. In this case, the result is a length of $-1$ and an empty path $[]$.\n\n5.  **Path Reconstruction**:\n    a. If both segments are navigable, reconstruct the lexicographically smallest shortest path from $s$ to $w$, let's call it $P_{s \\to w}$, by backtracking from $w$ to $s$ using the `parents_s` array.\n    b. Similarly, reconstruct the path from $w$ to $t$, $P_{w \\to t}$, using the `parents_w` array.\n\n6.  **Final Path and Length Calculation**:\n    a. The final path $P$ is the concatenation of $P_{s \\to w}$ and $P_{w \\to t}$. Since $w$ is the last vertex of $P_{s \\to w}$ and the first vertex of $P_{w \\to t}$, it appears twice. One instance must be removed. The final path is $P = P_{s \\to w} \\oplus P_{w \\to t}[1:]$, where $\\oplus$ denotes list concatenation and $[1:]$ denotes the slice of the list from the second element onward.\n    b. The total length $L$ is the sum of the lengths of the two sub-paths: $L = \\text{distances\\_s}[w] + \\text{distances\\_w}[t]$.\n\nThis constructive method is guaranteed to yield the correct result. The path length is minimal because it is the sum of two minimal-length sub-paths. The path is lexicographically minimal among all shortest paths because the sequential composition of two lexicographically minimal shortest paths ($s \\to w$ and $w \\to t$) results in an overall lexicographically minimal path. If there were a lexicographically smaller path of the same length, it would imply that either its $s \\to w$ segment or its $w \\to t$ segment is lexicographically smaller, contradicting the way they were constructed.",

The solution must be derived from the principles of graph theory and the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Graph**: A finite, directed, unweighted graph $G = (V, E)$, with $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$.\n- **Path**: A sequence of vertices $(v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k)$ such that $v_0 = s$, $v_k = t$, and $(v_{i-1}, v_i) \\in E$ for $1 \\le i \\le k$.\n- **Path Length**: The number of edges, $k$, in a path.\n- **Even-Length Path**: A path whose length $k$ is an even integer ($k \\ge 0$).\n- **Objective**: For a given source $s$ and target $t$, compute the length of the shortest even-length path from $s$ to $t$. If no such path exists, the value is $-1$.\n- **Algorithmic Basis**: The solution must be grounded in fundamental graph definitions and the properties of Breadth-First Search (BFS), specifically that it finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs.\n- **Test Suite**:\n  - Case $1$: $n = 6$, $E = \\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(0,2),(2,4)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 4$.\n  - Case $2$: $n = 3$, $E = \\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 1$.\n  - Case $3$: $n = 2$, $E = \\{(0,1)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 1$.\n  - Case $4$: $n = 4$, $E = \\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 0$.\n  - Case $5$: $n = 6$, $E = \\{(0,1),(1,3),(3,5),(0,2),(2,4),(4,5),(1,2)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 5$.\n  - Case $6$: $n = 2$, $E = \\{(0,1),(1,1)\\}$, $s = 0, t = 1$.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a well-established topic in graph theory and algorithms, a sub-field of computer science and discrete mathematics. It is based on formal definitions of graphs, paths, and path lengths. All premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly specified. The objective is to find a minimum value (shortest length) under a specific constraint (even length). For a finite graph, such a path either exists, in which case a shortest one is guaranteed to exist, or it does not. Therefore, a unique, meaningful solution (the length, or $-1$) exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is expressed in precise, formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion.\n- **Relevance**: The problem is directly related to the topic of breadth-first search and its applications, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-posed. It is a standard extension of a classic algorithm, not a trivial or contrived problem.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the length of a shortest path with an additional constraint on the parity of its length. The standard Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, where \"shortest\" is defined as the minimum number of edges. However, a standard BFS does not inherently distinguish between paths of different parities. The shortest path found by BFS could be of odd length, which would not be a valid solution to our problem.\n\nTo incorporate the parity constraint, we must augment the state representation used in the search. A state in a standard BFS corresponds to a vertex $v \\in V$. We need a state representation that encodes not only the current location (vertex) but also the parity of the path taken to reach it.\n\nLet us define a new state space. A state can be represented by a pair $(v, p)$, where $v \\in V$ is a vertex and $p \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the parity of the path length from the source vertex $s$ to $v$. Here, $p=0$ signifies an even-length path, and $p=1$ signifies an odd-length path.\n\nThis conceptual augmentation can be formalized by constructing a new graph, $G' = (V', E')$.\n- The set of vertices in the new graph is $V' = V \\times \\{0, 1\\}$. The size of this set is $|V'| = 2n$. A vertex $(v, p)$ in $G'$ signifies that we have reached vertex $v$ in $G$ via a path of parity $p$.\n- The set of edges $E'$ in $G'$ is derived from the edges in $G$. For each edge $(u, v) \\in E$, traversing it increases the path length by $1$, thereby flipping the parity of the path length. This translates to two directed edges in $G'$:\n  1. An edge from $(u, 0)$ to $(v, 1)$: A path to $u$ of even length, followed by the edge $(u,v)$, results in a path to $v$ of odd length.\n  2. An edge from $(u, 1)$ to $(v, 0)$: A path to $u$ of odd length, followed by the edge $(u,v)$, results in a path to $v$ of even length.\n\nThe problem of finding the shortest even-length path from $s$ to $t$ in the original graph $G$ is now transformed into the problem of finding the shortest path from a start vertex to a target vertex in the new graph $G'$. The starting point is a path of length $0$ from $s$ to itself. Since $0$ is an even number, the starting state in $G'$ is $(s, 0)$. We are looking for an even-length path to $t$, so the target state in $G'$ is $(t, 0)$.\n\nSince the original graph $G$ is unweighted, the transformed graph $G'$ is also unweighted. Therefore, we can apply the standard BFS algorithm on $G'$ to find the shortest path from $(s, 0)$ to $(t, 0)$. The length of this path in $G'$ is equal to the length of the corresponding path in $G$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  We do not need to explicitly construct $G'$. We can perform the BFS on the implicit state space.\n2.  We use a queue to store states to visit. Each element in the queue will be a tuple `(vertex, length)`, e.g., $(u, d)$.\n3.  We use a $2$-dimensional array, `distances[v][p]`, to store the length of the shortest path found so far to vertex $v$ with parity $p$. This array is of size $n \\times 2$ and is initialized with a value indicating unreachability, such as $-1$. This array also serves to track visited states, preventing cycles and redundant computations.\n4.  The search begins at the source $s$ with a path of length $0$. We initialize `distances[s][0] = 0` and add $(s, 0)$ to the queue.\n5.  The BFS main loop:\n    a. Dequeue a state $(u, d)$.\n    b. For each neighbor $v$ of $u$ in the original graph $G$:\n        i. The new path length to $v$ is $d_{\\text{new}} = d + 1$.\n        ii. The parity of this new path is $p_{\\text{new}} = d_{\\text{new}} \\pmod 2$.\n        iii. If the state $(v, p_{\\text{new}})$ has not been visited yet (i.e., `distances[v][p_{new}] == -1`), we have found the shortest path to this state. We record its length, `distances[v][p_{new}] = d_{new}`, and enqueue the new state $(v, d_{\\text{new}})$.\n6.  The BFS continues until the queue is empty.\n7.  The final answer is the length of the shortest even-length path to $t$, which is stored in `distances[t][0]`. If `distances[t][0]` remains at its initial value of $-1$, it means the state $(t, 0)$ was never reached, and thus no even-length path from $s$ to $t$ exists.\n\nA special case is when $s = t$. The path of length $0$ from $s$ to itself is an even-length path. Thus, the answer is $0$. The described algorithm correctly handles this, as `distances[s][0]` is initialized to $0$.\n\nThis principled approach correctly adapts the BFS algorithm to solve the constrained shortest path problem by expanding the state space to include the constraint itself.",
