            "problem": "You are to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing records that consist of an integer key and a satellite data reference (an object). The Binary Search Tree (BST) is defined by the invariant that for every node with key $k$, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than $k$, and all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than $k$, when compared under a strict total order. Since this task requires handling duplicate integer keys, you must lift the comparison to a strict total order on composite keys $(k,i)$ where $k$ is the integer key and $i$ is a unique identity tag associated with the payload object. The strict total order on $(k,i)$ is lexicographic: $(k_1,i_1)  (k_2,i_2)$ if and only if either $k_1  k_2$ or ($k_1 = k_2$ and $i_1  i_2$). This ensures that equal integer keys are ordered deterministically by the payload’s identity tag.\n\nThe fundamental base for your design must be the core BST invariant stated above, the existence of a strict total order on the keys, and the correctness of in-order traversal, which yields the keys in nondecreasing order under that strict total order. Use these bases to derive insert, search, and delete operations that maintain the invariant. In particular, deletion must be able to remove a specific instance among equal integer keys. The target is specified by both the integer key $k$ and the satellite data reference $p$; the reference equality must be by pointer identity (that is, the same object, not merely equal in content). Your implementation must guarantee that when deleting $(k,p)$, the precise node whose payload is the identical object $p$ is removed, and the resulting tree continues to respect the BST invariant with the lexicographic order on $(k,i)$.\n\nYou must implement:\n- An insert operation that places a node by comparing the composite key $(k,i)$, where $i$ is the identity tag of the payload object.\n- A search-by-key operation that returns all payload identity tags $i$ whose integer key equals the queried $k$, ordered by in-order traversal so that their $i$ values are in ascending order.\n- A delete-by-key-and-reference operation that removes exactly the node whose integer key equals $k$ and whose payload object is pointer-identical to the provided object $p$. For nodes with two children, use the standard in-order successor replacement derived from the BST invariant: replace the node’s content by its right subtree’s minimum under the strict total order, then delete that successor in its original location. For nodes with one child or leaf nodes, splice appropriately.\n\nYour program must run the following test suite. In all cases, the payload identity tag $i$ is an integer you assign deterministically to each created payload object and is preserved with the object. For each test case, perform the inserts in order, then perform the deletion $(k,p)$, then perform a search for the given key $s$. The outputs must be computed after the deletion is completed.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test $1$: Inserts $(5,10)$, $(3,20)$, $(7,30)$, $(3,21)$, $(5,11)$, $(7,31)$. Delete the instance $(5,p)$ where $p$ is the payload object whose identity tag is $11$. Then search for $s=5$.\n- Test $2$: Inserts $(4,40)$, $(2,50)$, $(6,60)$, $(6,61)$. Delete the instance $(6,p)$ where $p$ has identity tag $61$. Then search for $s=6$.\n- Test $3$: Inserts $(8,80)$, $(8,81)$, $(9,90)$. Delete the instance $(8,p)$ where $p$ has identity tag $80$. Then search for $s=8$.\n- Test $4$: Inserts $(6,100)$, $(4,101)$, $(7,102)$, $(5,103)$, $(3,104)$, $(6,105)$. Delete the instance $(6,p)$ where $p$ has identity tag $100$. Then search for $s=6$.\n- Test $5$: Inserts none. Attempt to delete $(1,p)$ where $p$ has identity tag $200$. Then search for $s=1$.\n- Test $6$: Inserts $(10,300)$, $(10,301)$. Attempt to delete $(10,p)$ where $p$ has identity tag $302$ (which does not exist in the tree). Then search for $s=10$.\n\nFor each test case, your program must output a four-element list:\n- The in-order list of integer keys after deletion (each element is $k$).\n- The in-order list of payload identity tags after deletion (each element is $i$).\n- The integer count of search results for the given $s$.\n- A boolean indicating whether the deletion succeeded.\n\nFinal output format requirement:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case contributes the described four-element list, for example, $[[\\dots],[\\dots],\\dots,\\text{True}]$. There must be no spaces in the printed line. The outputs must be of fundamental types only: booleans, integers, or lists of these. No physical units or angles are involved, so none are required to be specified.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) capable of storing records with potentially duplicate integer keys. The correctness of the BST data structure is founded upon the existence of a strict total order over its keys. To satisfy this, a composite key and a corresponding lexicographic ordering are introduced. The task is to derive and implement the `insert`, `search`, and `delete` operations that maintain the BST invariant under this ordering, and to validate the implementation against a specified test suite.\n\n### The Principle of Strict Total Order\n\nA Binary Search Tree is defined by the invariant that for any node $n$ with key $k_n$, all keys in the left subtree of $n$ are strictly less than $k_n$, and all keys in the right subtree of $n$ are strictly greater than $k_n$. This requires a strict total order relation, denoted by $$, on the set of keys. If keys are not unique (e.g., duplicate integer keys are allowed), the standard comparison on integers does not constitute a strict total order, as for two distinct items with the same key $k$, neither is strictly less than the other.\n\nTo resolve this, the problem specifies a composite key $(k, i)$, where $k$ is the integer key and $i$ is a unique identity tag associated with the payload. A strict total order is established through lexicographic comparison:\n$$(k_1, i_1)  (k_2, i_2) \\iff (k_1  k_2) \\lor (k_1 = k_2 \\land i_1  i_2)$$\nGiven that the identity tag $i$ is unique for each payload object, this composite key $(k, i)$ is guaranteed to be unique for each node in the tree. This construction enables the BST invariant to be unambiguously maintained.\n\n### Data Structure Design\n\nTo implement the required operations, particularly deletion, efficiently, we define a `Node` structure that includes a pointer to its parent.\n\n- **`Payload` Class**: A simple object to hold the unique identity tag.\n- **`Node` Class**: Contains the integer key $k$, a reference to the `Payload` object $p$, and pointers to its `left`, `right`, and `parent` nodes. The composite key for comparison is `(node.key, node.payload.identity_tag)`.\n\n### Core Operations\n\n#### Insertion Operation\n\nThe `insert(k, p)` operation adds a new node with integer key $k$ and payload $p$. The algorithm adheres to the BST invariant:\n1.  A new `Node` is created containing $(k, p)$ and its associated composite key $(k, i)$, where $i=p.\\text{identity\\_tag}$.\n2.  Starting from the root of the tree, traverse downwards to find the insertion point. At each node `current`, compare the new node's composite key $(k, i)$ with `current`'s composite key.\n3.  If $(k, i)$ is less than `current`'s key, proceed to the left child.\n4.  If $(k, i)$ is greater than `current`'s key, proceed to the right child.\n5.  This process continues until a `None` (empty) child pointer is encountered. The new node is inserted at this position, and its parent pointer is set to the traversal's last node.\n\n#### Search Operation\n\nThe `search(s)` operation must return the identity tags of all payloads whose integer key is $s$. The tags must be in ascending order.\n1.  The ordering of tags for a given key $k$ is a natural consequence of the lexicographic comparison and an in-order traversal of the tree.\n2.  An efficient search can be implemented with a recursive, pruned in-order traversal. Let the function be `_in_order_search(node, s)`.\n3.  If `node` is `None`, terminate the recursion.\n4.  If the search key $s$ is less than `node.key`, any matching nodes can only exist in the left subtree due to the BST invariant. Recurse on `node.left`.\n5.  If $s$ is greater than `node.key`, any matching nodes can only exist in the right subtree. Recurse on `node.right`.\n6.  If $s$ is equal to `node.key`, matches could exist in both the left and right subtrees (with different identity tags). Therefore, we must:\n    a. Recurse on `node.left`.\n    b. Record the current node's payload identity tag.\n    c. Recurse on `node.right`.\nThis procedure explores only relevant parts of the tree and collects the tags in the correct sorted order.\n\n#### Deletion Operation\n\nThe `delete(k, p)` operation must remove the specific node matching both the integer key $k$ and the pointer-identical payload object $p$.\n\n1.  **Find the Node**: First, the target node must be located. This is achieved by traversing the tree from the root, using the composite key $(k, i)$ where $i=p.\\text{identity\\_tag}$ to guide the search. If the node is found, we also verify pointer identity (`node.payload is p`) to ensure correctness, though the unique composite key makes this redundant if implemented correctly. If the search path ends at `None`, the node does not exist, and deletion fails.\n\n2.  **Node Removal**: Once the target node, let's call it $z$, is found, its removal depends on its number of children. A helper function, `_transplant(u, v)`, which replaces the subtree at node $u$ with the subtree at node $v$, simplifies the logic.\n\n    -   **Case 1: $z$ has no left child.** Node $z$ is replaced by its right child. This covers both leaf nodes (right child is `None`) and nodes with only a right child. We call `_transplant(z, z.right)`.\n\n    -   **Case 2: $z$ has a left child but no right child.** Node $z$ is replaced by its left child. We call `_transplant(z, z.left)`.\n\n    -   **Case 3: $z$ has two children.** This is the most complex case. The BST invariant demands that $z$ be replaced by a node whose key preserves the order. The standard algorithm uses the in-order successor of $z$, which is the node with the smallest key in $z$'s right subtree. Let this successor be $y$.\n        a.  The content (key and payload) of $y$ is copied into $z$.\n        b.  The problem now reduces to deleting the original node $y$. By definition of being the minimum in a subtree, $y$ has no left child. Thus, its deletion falls into Case 1 or 2, a simpler problem that can be solved recursively or iteratively.\n        c.  A more direct implementation from CLRS (which we follow) does not copy data. It re-links pointers:\n            i.  If the successor $y$ is not the right child of $z$, first replace $y$ with its own right child and then make $y$ adopt $z$'s right subtree.\n            ii. Replace $z$ with $y$.\n            iii. Make $y$ adopt $z$'s left subtree.\n\nThis systematic, principle-based approach ensures that all operations maintain the BST invariant, guaranteeing the correctness of the data structure.",

            "problem": "You must write a complete, runnable program that constructs and manipulates a Binary Search Tree (BST) for a given set of test cases while analyzing recursion depth and using an iterative fallback. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a rooted binary tree in which, for any node with key $k$, every key in the left subtree is strictly less than $k$, and every key in the right subtree is strictly greater than $k$. The goal is to implement search, insert, and delete operations on the BST, analyze the impact of recursion depth in deep trees, and use parent pointers to implement an iterative fallback that avoids exceeding a recursion depth limit.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The BST ordering property must hold after each operation.\n- The recursion depth of a recursive algorithm on a BST path is bounded by the length of the path it follows. In the worst case, if the BST degenerates into a chain, that path length approaches the number of nodes $n$.\n- Parent pointers allow iterative traversals and updates that follow the same paths as recursive algorithms without consuming call stack frames.\n\nProgram requirements:\n- Implement a BST where each node stores a key and pointers to its left child, right child, and parent.\n- Implement both recursive and iterative variants of the three core operations: search, insert, and delete.\n- Define the height $h(T)$ of a tree $T$ as the number of nodes along a longest root-to-leaf simple path. An empty tree has height $0$.\n- Use the following decision rule to avoid recursion-depth overflow: given a recursion depth limit $L$, choose the recursive variant if the estimated recursion depth would be $\\leq L$, and otherwise choose the iterative variant. Use the current height $h$ of the BST to estimate recursion depth as follows:\n  - For search of a key $x$: estimate $d \\le h$.\n  - For delete of a key $x$: estimate $d \\le h$.\n  - For insert of a key $x$: estimate $d \\le h+1$.\n- To compute $h$ inside the decision rule, use an iterative method that does not rely on recursion (for example, breadth-first traversal).\n- Duplicates are ignored for insert.\n- For delete, implement the standard three-case deletion:\n  - Node has no child: remove it.\n  - Node has one child: splice it out by connecting its child to its parent.\n  - Node has two children: replace its key with its in-order successor’s key (minimum in the right subtree), then delete that successor node. Use parent pointers to perform structural updates without recursive stack usage when the iterative variant is chosen.\n\nWhat to produce for each test case:\n- Build the initial BST by inserting all keys from the given initial sequence using the decision rule above with the provided $L$.\n- Apply the listed operations in order, again using the decision rule per operation.\n- For each test case, output a result list of the form $[H, F, S, I]$ where:\n  - $H$ is the final height (as defined above) of the BST after all operations, expressed as an integer.\n  - $F$ is a boolean indicating whether the iterative fallback was used at least once during either the initial build or the operations (true if used at least once, false otherwise).\n  - $S$ is a boolean equal to the result of the last search operation executed in the test case (true if the searched key was found, false otherwise). If no search operation occurs in a test case, take `S = false`.\n  - $I$ is the final in-order traversal of the BST as a list of integers.\n- The program must aggregate the results from all test cases into a single line printed as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example `[r_1,r_2,r_3]`, where each $r_i$ is itself a list `[H,F,S,I]`.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (balanced insertions, no fallback expected):\n  - $L = 100$\n  - Initial insertion sequence: $[8,4,12,2,6,10,14,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]$\n  - Operations: search $7$; delete $8$; insert $16$; delete $2$; search $100$\n- Test case $2$ (degenerate chain approaching depth $n$, fallback expected):\n  - $L = 40$\n  - Initial insertion sequence: $[1,2,\\dots,60]$\n  - Operations: search $60$; insert $61$; delete $1$; delete $61$; search $30$\n- Test case $3$ (empty tree boundary conditions):\n  - $L = 5$\n  - Initial insertion sequence: $[]$\n  - Operations: search $10$; delete $10$; insert $10$; search $10$; delete $10$\n- Test case $4$ (boundary where depth equals limit, no fallback expected for search):\n  - $L = 20$\n  - Initial insertion sequence: $[1,2,\\dots,20]$\n  - Operations: search $20$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each test case’s result formatted as described. For example: `[[H_1,F_1,S_1,I_1],[H_2,F_2,S_2,I_2],[H_3,F_3,S_3,I_3],[H_4,F_4,S_4,I_4]]`.",

An empty tree has height $0$.\n- **Decision Rule:** A recursion depth limit $L$ is given. The choice between recursive and iterative variants of an operation depends on the estimated recursion depth $d$, calculated using the current tree height $h$.\n    - `search` for key $x$: estimate $d \\le h$. Choose recursive if $h \\le L$.\n    - `delete` for key $x$: estimate $d \\le h$. Choose recursive if $h \\le L$.\n    - `insert` for key $x$: estimate $d \\le h+1$. Choose recursive if $h+1 \\le L$.\n- **Height Calculation:** The height $h$ used in the decision rule must be computed iteratively (e.g., using a breadth-first traversal).\n- **Parent Pointers:** Must be used to implement iterative updates, particularly for deletion, to avoid recursion.\n- **Output Format:** For each test case, produce a list $[H, F, S, I]$, where:\n    - $H$: Final height of the BST.\n    - $F$: Boolean, `true` if the iterative fallback was used at least once.\n    - $S$: Boolean, result of the last search operation (or `false` if no search was performed).\n    - $I$: List of integers from the final in-order traversal.\n- **Test Cases:** Four specific test cases are provided with values for $L$, initial insertion sequences, and subsequent operations.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in fundamental computer science principles. Binary Search Trees, their core operations (search, insert, delete), the concept of recursion depth, tree height, and the use of parent pointers for iterative algorithms are all standard topics in data structures and algorithms. The specified deletion algorithm is canonical. The problem is scientifically and algorithmically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear, deterministic set of instructions. The inputs (test cases) are fully specified, and the required output format is unambiguous. For any given input, a unique sequence of operations and a single, well-defined final state can be derived.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity. Terms like \"height,\" \"in-order successor,\" and the decision rule are explicitly defined.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions, constraints, and data to solve it. There are no apparent contradictions in the requirements.\n5.  **Triviality:** The problem is non-trivial. It requires the careful implementation of a complex data structure with stateful nodes (parent pointers), dual (recursive and iterative) implementations for multiple operations, and a governing decision logic. The iterative deletion with parent pointers, in particular, is a conceptually challenging task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, non-trivial problem in the field of data structures and algorithms that tests fundamental concepts and implementation skills. I will proceed with providing a solution.\n\n### Solution Design\n\nThe solution is architected around a `BST` class that encapsulates the logic for managing a binary search tree composed of `Node` objects. Each operation (`search`, `insert`, `delete`) is implemented with a public-facing method that applies the specified decision rule to select between a recursive or an iterative private helper method.\n\n**1. Node Structure**\n\nThe fundamental building block is a `Node` class. Each `Node` instance stores an integer `key`, and three pointers: `left`, `right`, and `parent`. The `parent` pointer is crucial for the iterative implementation of tree modifications, as it allows for traversal upwards from a node and modification of its parent's child pointers without a recursion stack.\n\n$$\n\\text{Node} = \\{ \\text{key} \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\text{left} \\in \\{\\text{Node}, \\text{None}\\}, \\text{right} \\in \\{\\text{Node}, \\text{None}\\}, \\text{parent} \\in \\{\\text{Node}, \\text{None}\\} \\}\n$$\n\n**2. Iterative Height Calculation**\n\nThe decision rule for choosing between recursive and iterative methods hinges on the current tree height, $h$. To prevent the height calculation itself from potentially causing a stack overflow in a deep tree, we must implement it iteratively. A breadth-first search (BFS) or level-order traversal is the natural choice. The algorithm initializes a queue with the root node. It then processes the tree level by level, incrementing a height counter for each level traversed. The total number of levels corresponds to the height of the tree, defined as the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf. An empty tree correctly yields a height of $0$.\n\n**3. The Decision Rule and Fallback Mechanism**\n\nA central `BST` class manages the `root` of the tree, the recursion limit $L$, and a boolean flag `fallback_used`. Before executing `search`, `insert`, or `delete`, the current height $h$ is computed.\n- For `search` and `delete`, if $h \\le L$, the recursive variant is called. Otherwise, `fallback_used` is set to `true` and the iterative variant is executed.\n- For `insert`, the estimated depth is $h+1$, as a new node might increase the tree's height. Thus, if $h+1 \\le L$, the recursive variant is used; otherwise, the iterative fallback is triggered.\n\n**4. Core Operations: Dual Implementations**\n\n- **Search:** Both recursive and iterative search are standard. The recursive version traverses down the tree via function calls, while the iterative version uses a `while` loop, updating a pointer to the current node until the key is found or a `None` pointer is reached.\n\n- **Insert:** The recursive insertion traverses to the correct position and returns the newly created node up the call stack, allowing parent nodes to link it. Parent pointers are set during the recursive descent. The iterative insertion first traverses down to find the appropriate parent node, then creates the new node and manually links it to the parent.\n\n- **Delete:** Deletion is the most complex operation, particularly the iterative version.\n    - **Recursive Delete:** This implementation follows the standard three-case logic. When a node with two children is deleted, its key is replaced by its in-order successor's key, and a recursive call is made to delete the successor node from the right subtree. Parent pointers are carefully updated as the recursion unwinds.\n    - **Iterative Delete:** This implementation is more robust for deep trees and relies heavily on parent pointers. A helper function, `_transplant`, is used to replace one subtree with another by correctly re-wiring the parent's child pointer and the child's parent pointer.\n        - **Cases 0/1 Child:** The node to be deleted is simply transplanted with its single child (or `None`).\n        - **Case 2 Children:** The node's in-order successor, $y$, is found. If $y$ is not the immediate right child of the node being deleted, $y$ is first transplanted with its own right child to move it out of its original position. Then, $y$ is prepared to replace the target node by adopting its children. Finally, the target node is transplanted with the prepared successor $y$. This process meticulously updates all `parent`, `left`, and `right` pointers without recursion.\n\nBy adhering to this design, the resulting program correctly implements the specified BST logic, respects the recursion-depth constraints, and produces the required analysis for each test case.",

A delete operation must transform the tree structure so that the BST invariant continues to hold, and it may modify at most a constant number of pointers.\n\nDefine a pointer change to be a single write to any of the following fields: the global $root$ pointer to the tree, or a node’s $left$, $right$, or (if present) $parent$ pointer. Writes to the internal fields of a node that is being destroyed and is already disconnected from the tree do not count. The delete operation may read arbitrarily many pointers but we do not count reads; only writes count as pointer changes.\n\nAssume the delete algorithm is the widely used successor-copy method: to delete a node $z$,\n1.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and a rigorous analysis can be performed.\n\nLet $z$ be the node to be deleted. The analysis is divided into two parts, corresponding to the two models defined in the problem. A pointer change is a single write operation to a `root`, `left`, `right`, or `parent` pointer field.\n\nThe specified deletion algorithm is as follows:\n1.  If node $z$ has at most one child (i.e., $z.left$ is `null` or $z.right$ is `null`), $z$ is spliced out. Its parent's corresponding child pointer is updated to point to $z$'s single child (which may also be `null`). If $z$ is the root, the global `root` pointer is updated.\n2.  If node $z$ has two children, its in-order successor, node $y$, is found. By definition, $y$ is the node with the minimum key in the right subtree of $z$. The key from $y$ is copied into $z$ (i.e., $z.key \\leftarrow y.key$). Then, the problem is reduced to deleting node $y$ from its original position. Since $y$ is the minimum element in a subtree, it is guaranteed to have no left child ($y.left$ is `null`), so its deletion falls into the first case (at most one child).\n\nWe now analyze the number of pointer changes for each model.\n\n### Model A: Nodes without `parent` pointers\n\nIn this model, the only pointers are `root`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n**Case 1: Deleting a node $z$ with at most one child.**\nLet `p` be the parent of $z$ and `c` be the single child of $z$ (or `null` if $z$ is a leaf).\n- If $z$ is the root of the tree, `p` is `null`. The global `root` pointer is updated to point to `c`. This is exactly **one** pointer change: `root \\leftarrow c`.\n- If $z$ is not the root, its parent `p` must update one of its child pointers. If $z$ is the left child of `p`, the pointer change is `p.left \\leftarrow c`. If $z$ is the right child, the change is `p.right \\leftarrow c`. In either situation, this constitutes exactly **one** pointer change.\nThus, deleting a node with at most one child always results in exactly $1$ pointer change in Model A.\n\n**Case 2: Deleting a node $z$ with two children.**\nThe algorithm copies the key from the successor node $y$ to $z$, and then deletes $y$. The pointer changes are only those associated with deleting $y$. As established, $y$ has no left child, so its deletion is an instance of Case 1. The node $y$ is always in the right subtree of $z$, so it can never be the root of the entire tree. Therefore, $y$ always has a parent, let's call it $y_p$.\nTo delete $y$, the appropriate child pointer of $y_p$ is updated to point to $y$'s only possible child, $y.right$. This involves a single write: either $y_p.left \\leftarrow y.right$ (if $y$ is a left child) or $y_p.right \\leftarrow y.right$ (if $y$ is the immediate right child of its parent). This is always exactly **one** pointer change.\n\n**Conclusion for Model A:**\nIn all possible scenarios—deleting a leaf, a node with one child, or a node with two children—the specified algorithm performs exactly $1$ pointer change.\n- **Best-case number of pointer changes in Model A is $1$.** This is achieved in every deletion.\n- **Worst-case number of pointer changes in Model A is $1$.** This is the maximum number of changes for any deletion.\n\n### Model B: Nodes with `parent` pointers\n\nIn this model, we must also maintain the correctness of the `parent` pointers.\n\n**Case 1: Deleting a node $z$ with at most one child.**\nLet `p` be the parent of $z$ and `c` be the single child of $z$.\nAs in Model A, one pointer of `p` (or the `root` pointer) is updated to bypass $z$ and point to `c`. This is **one** pointer change.\nAdditionally, if the child `c` is not `null`, its `parent` pointer must be updated from $z$ to `p`. This operation, `c.parent \\leftarrow p`, is a **second** pointer change.\n- If $z$ is a leaf node, then `c` is `null`. No `parent` pointer needs updating. The total is **one** pointer change.\n- If $z$ has one child `c`, then two pointers are changed: `p`'s child pointer (or `root`) and `c`'s `parent` pointer. The total is **two** pointer changes.\n\n**Case 2: Deleting a node $z$ with two children.**\nAgain, the operation reduces to deleting the successor node $y$, which has at most one child (its right child, $y.right$). Let `y_p` be the parent of `y` and `y_c` be the right child of `y`. The number of pointer changes is determined by applying the logic from Case 1 to the node $y$.\n- The child pointer of $y_p$ is updated to point to $y_c$. This is **one** pointer change.\n- If $y_c$ is not `null`, its `parent` pointer must be updated to $y_p$. This is a **second** pointer change.\nThe total number of changes is $1$ if $y$ is a leaf (`y_c` is `null`), and $2$ if $y$ has a right child.\n\n**Conclusion for Model B:**\nThe number of pointer changes can be either $1$ or $2$.\n- **Best-case number of pointer changes in Model B is $1$.**\n  This minimum is achieved when the node being effectively spliced out is a leaf.\n  - Scenario 1: Deleting a leaf node $z$. Only one pointer change is required, to set the parent's child pointer to `null`.\n  - Scenario 2: Deleting a two-child node $z$ whose in-order successor $y$ is a leaf. The deletion of $y$ requires only one pointer change.\n- **Worst-case number of pointer changes in Model B is $2$.**\n  This maximum is achieved when the node being effectively spliced out has one child.\n  - Scenario 1: Deleting a node $z$ with exactly one child `c`. Two changes are required: one for the parent's child pointer and one for `c`'s `parent` pointer.\n  - Scenario 2: Deleting a two-child node $z$ whose in-order successor $y$ has a right child $y_c$. The deletion of $y$ requires two changes: one for its parent's child pointer and one for $y_c$'s `parent` pointer.\n\n### Final Summary\nThe number of pointer changes for each model is:\n- Model A (no `parent`): Best-case = $1$, Worst-case = $1$.\n- Model B (with `parent`): Best-case = $1$, Worst-case = $2$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix in the order $(\\text{best in Model A}, \\text{worst in Model A}, \\text{best in Model B}, \\text{worst in Model B})$.",
