            "solution": "The problem asks to determine which of the given multisets of numbers can represent the depths of all leaves in a finite rooted binary tree. A rooted binary tree allows nodes to have $0$, $1$, or $2$ children.\n\nA fundamental property connects the depths of the leaves of any such tree. Let $D$ be the multiset of the depths of all leaves in a finite rooted binary tree. This multiset $D = \\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k\\}$ is valid if and only if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  If $0 \\in D$, then $D$ must be $\\{0\\}$. A leaf at depth $0$ implies the root node is a leaf. If the root is a leaf, it has no children, and the tree consists of only this single node. Consequently, there can be no other leaves at other depths.\n2.  The sum of the quantities $2^{-d}$ for each depth $d$ in the multiset must be less than or equal to $1$. This is a form of the Kraft's inequality for prefix codes, where leaf depths correspond to codeword lengths.\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{-d_i} \\le 1 $$\n\nLet us provide a brief justification for this inequality. We can construct any binary tree by starting with a single node (the root) and repeatedly applying an expansion operation.\n- **Base Case:** The simplest tree is a single node, which is the root. This node is also a leaf at depth $d=0$. The sum is $2^{-0} = 1$. The inequality $1 \\le 1$ holds.\n- **Inductive Step:** Assume we have a valid binary tree for which the sum is $S = \\sum_{l \\in \\text{leaves}} 2^{-d(l)} \\le 1$. We can expand the tree by picking a leaf $l_0$ at depth $d_0$ and making it an internal node.\n    - If we give $l_0$ one child, this new child becomes a leaf at depth $d_0+1$. The original leaf $l_0$ is removed from the set of leaves. The new sum $S'$ is:\n      $$ S' = S - 2^{-d_0} + 2^{-(d_0+1)} = S - 2^{-d_0} + \\frac{1}{2} 2^{-d_0} = S - \\frac{1}{2} 2^{-d_0} $$\n      Since $S \\le 1$, the new sum $S'$ is also less than or equal to $1$.\n    - If we give $l_0$ two children, these two new children become leaves, both at depth $d_0+1$. The original leaf $l_0$ is removed. The new sum $S'$ is:\n      $$ S' = S - 2^{-d_0} + 2^{-(d_0+1)} + 2^{-(d_0+1)} = S - 2^{-d_0} + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} 2^{-d_0}\\right) = S $$\n      The sum remains unchanged.\n\nSince we start with a sum of $1$ and the operations either preserve the sum or decrease it, the sum for any finite rooted binary tree must be less than or equal to $1$. The converse, that any multiset of depths satisfying the inequality corresponds to a valid tree, is also true and can be shown by a constructive algorithm.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on this principle.\n\n**A. $\\{1,1,2,3\\}$**\nThe multiset of depths is $D = \\{1,1,2,3\\}$. We calculate the sum:\n$$ S = 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ S = 1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{11}{8} $$\nSince $S = \\frac{11}{8} > 1$, the inequality is violated.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\{2,2,3,3,3\\}$**\nThe multiset of depths is $D = \\{2,2,3,3,3\\}$.

Using only the foundational definitions of a rooted tree, post-order traversal, and node depth, design an algorithm that reconstructs the parent of each node in the given traversal order. A rooted ordered tree is defined as a connected acyclic graph with a designated root such that each node’s children are ordered. A post-order traversal is defined recursively: for a node, visit all of its children in order using post-order, and then visit the node itself. The depth of a node is defined as the number of edges on the unique simple path from the root to that node.

            "solution": "### Principle-Based Solution\nThe solution is derived by reasoning from the foundational definitions of post-order traversal and node depth.\n\nA post-order traversal sequence has the defining property that a parent node is always visited immediately after the traversals of all its children's subtrees are completed. This implies that for any node $v$, its parent $p$ must appear later in the post-order sequence. Consequently, if the nodes are indexed $0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ according to their appearance in the traversal $S$, the parent of the node at index $j$ must be a node at some index $k > j$.\n\nFurthermore, the depth definition dictates that for any node $v$ with parent $p$, their depths are related by $depth(v) = depth(p) + 1$.\n\nCombining these two properties provides a powerful method for reconstruction. If we process the traversal sequence $S$ in reverse order (from index $j = n-1$ down to $0$), we are effectively moving from parents to their descendants. At any point in this reverse scan, for a node at index $j$ with depth $D[j] = d$, its parent must be a node at some index $k > j$ with depth $D[k] = d-1$. The key insight is identifying which node at index $k$ is the correct parent.\n\nDue to the nested structure of subtrees in a post-order traversal, the correct parent for the node at index $j$ is the *most recently encountered* node to its right (i.e., at an index $k>j$) that has a depth of $d-1$. This \"most recent\" node represents the root of the smallest enclosing subtree at the parent's depth level.\n\nThis leads to the following algorithm:\n\n$1$. **Validation**: First, we perform initial consistency checks.\n    - The sequence must not be empty. Let $n$ be the number of nodes. If $n=0$, it is invalid under the problem's implicit assumption of at least one node.\n    - The last node in the traversal, $S[n-1]$, must be the root. Therefore, its depth $D[n-1]$ must be exactly $0$.\n    - All other nodes must be non-root nodes, so their depths $D[j]$ for $j < n-1$ must be greater than $0$.\n\n$2$. **Reconstruction**: We iterate from right to left, from $j = n-1$ down to $0$. We use a map, let's call it `last_at_depth`, to store the index of the most recently seen node for each depth level.\n    - Initialize an integer array $P$ of size $n$ with default values of $-1$.\n    - Initialize the map `last_at_depth`.\n    - Begin the loop for $j$ from $n-1$ down to $0$:\n        a. Let the current node's depth be $d = D[j]$.\n        b. If $d > 0$, the node must have a parent. The parent's depth must be $d-1$. We look for `last_at_depth[d-1]`.\n            i. If a parent at depth $d-1$ has not been seen yet (i.e., `d-1` is not a key in `last_at_depth`), the depth sequence is inconsistent with a valid tree structure. The input is invalid.\n            ii. Otherwise, the parent is the node at index `last_at_depth[d-1]`. We set $P[j] = \\text{last\\_at\\_depth}[d-1]$.\n        c. If $d=0$ (which should only be true for $j=n-1$), the node is the root and its parent remains $-1$.\n        d. Finally, we update the map with the current node's information: `last_at_depth[d] = j$. This establishes the current node as the potential parent for subsequent (leftward) nodes that are its children.\n\nIf the algorithm completes without finding any inconsistencies, the array $P$ holds the unique parent structure of the tree.\n\nLet us trace Case 1: $S=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]$, $D=[2,2,1,2,2,1,0]$.\n- $n=7$. $D[6]=0$, which is valid for the root.\n- Initialize $P = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]$ and `last_at_depth = {}`.\n\n- $j=6$: Node index $6$, depth $D[6]=0$. This is the root. $P[6]$ remains $-1$. Update `last_at_depth[0] = 6`.\n- $j=5$: Node index $5$, depth $D[5]=1$. Parent must have depth $0$. Find `last_at_depth[0]`, which is $6$. Set $P[5] = 6$. Update `last_at_depth[1] = 5$.\n- $j=4$: Node index $4$, depth $D[4]=2$. Parent must have depth $1$. Find `last_at_depth[1]`, which is $5$. Set $P[4] = 5$. Update `last_at_depth[2] = 4$.\n- $j=3$: Node index $3$, depth $D[3]=2$. Parent must have depth $1$. Find `last_at_depth[1]`, which is $5$. Set $P[3] = 5$. Update `last_at_depth[2] = 3$.\n- $j=2$: Node index $2$, depth $D[2]=1$. Parent must have depth $0$. Find `last_at_depth[0]`, which is $6$. Set $P[2] = 6$. Update `last_at_depth[1] = 2$.\n- $j=1$: Node index $1$, depth $D[1]=2$. Parent must have depth $1$. Find `last_at_depth[1]`, which is $2$. Set $P[1] = 2$. Update `last_at_depth[2] = 1$.\n- $j=0$: Node index $0$, depth $D[0]=2$. Parent must have depth $1$. Find `last_at_depth[1]`, which is $2$. Set $P[0] = 2$.

            "solution": "The task is to design an algorithm to compute the center $C(T)$ and radius $r(T)$ of a given tree $T=(V,E)$, relying only on the provided foundational definitions. The definitions are:\n- The distance $d(u,v)$ is the number of edges on the unique simple path between vertices $u, v \\in V$.\n- The eccentricity of a vertex $v$, $\\mathrm{ecc}(v)$, is $\\max_{u \\in V} d(v,u)$.\n- The radius of the tree, $r(T)$, is $\\min_{v \\in V} \\mathrm{ecc}(v)$.\n- The center of the tree, $C(T)$, is the set of vertices $\\{v \\in V \\mid \\mathrm{ecc}(v) = r(T)\\}$.\n\nThese definitions naturally prescribe a direct computational procedure. The algorithm's validity rests on its being a direct translation of these mathematical statements into a sequence of computations, rather than relying on external theorems. The procedure is as follows:\n\nFirst, to evaluate the eccentricity of any vertex, one must first determine its distance to all other vertices in the tree. This necessitates the computation of all-pairs shortest paths. Since the graph is a tree and is unweighted, the distance $d(u,v)$ corresponds to the number of edges on the path. The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is the standard method for finding shortest paths from a single source in an unweighted graph. By executing a BFS starting from each vertex $s \\in V$, we can systematically find the distances $d(s,v)$ for all other vertices $v \\in V$. This process is repeated for every vertex in the tree, yielding all necessary distance information. Let the number of vertices be $n = |V|$.\n\nSecond, with all distances computed, the eccentricity $\\mathrm{ecc}(v)$ for each vertex $v$ is calculated directly from its definition. For each $v \\in V$, we find the maximum value in the set of distances $\\{d(v,u) \\mid u \\in V\\}$. This maximum is, by definition, $\\mathrm{ecc}(v)$. This step is performed for all $n$ vertices, resulting in a list containing the eccentricity of every vertex.\n\nThird, the radius of the tree, $r(T)$, is defined as the minimum eccentricity among all vertices. After computing all $n$ eccentricities, we find the minimum value in this collection. This value is the radius $r(T) = \\min_{v \\in V} \\mathrm{ecc}(v)$.\n\nFourth, the center $C(T)$ is the set of vertices whose eccentricity is equal to the radius. We identify these vertices by iterating through our list of eccentricities and collecting all vertices $v$ for which $\\mathrm{ecc}(v) = r(T)$. The resulting set of vertices constitutes the center of the tree. Per the output requirements, this set is stored as an ascending list of vertex indices.\n\nFinally, the uniqueness of the center is determined by its cardinality, $|C(T)|$. If $|C(T)| = 1$, the center is unique; otherwise, it is not. A boolean value represents this outcome.\n\nThis algorithmic procedure is correct by construction because each step is a direct implementation of the corresponding mathematical definition provided in the problem statement. It relies only on the fundamental property that distances in a connected graph are well-defined and computable (e.g., via BFS). The method does not invoke any advanced, unstated theorems about the properties of tree centers, thereby adhering to the problem's constraints. The computational complexity of this approach for a tree with $n$ vertices is dominated by the all-pairs distance computation. A single BFS traversal on a tree takes time proportional to the number of vertices and edges, which is $O(n + m) = O(n)$ since $m=n-1$. Repeating this for all $n$ vertices gives a total time complexity of $O(n^2)$. The subsequent steps to find the radius and center are of a lower complexity, $O(n)$. For the small values of $n$ in the provided test suite, this $O(n^2)$ complexity is entirely feasible.",
