            "problem": "Consider an algorithm that processes a stream of $n$ distinct elements arriving one by one and maintains a running minimum. Each time the current element is strictly smaller than all previously seen elements, the algorithm performs an additional constant-time update. Let $T(n)$ denote the expected number of these additional updates after observing $n$ elements, and suppose the following recurrence holds for all integers $n \\geq 2$:\n$$\nT(n) = T(n-1) + \\frac{1}{n},\n$$\nwith base condition $T(1) = 0$. Using the substitution method (also known as the method of unrolling), derive a closed-form expression for $T(n)$ in terms of the $n$th harmonic number $H_n$, where $H_n$ is defined by\n$$\nH_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}.\n$$\nYour final answer must be a single analytic expression written in terms of $n$ and $H_n$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated according to the required procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The stream has $n$ distinct elements.\n- The recurrence relation for the expected number of updates $T(n)$ is $T(n) = T(n-1) + \\frac{1}{n}$ for all integers $n \\geq 2$.\n- The base condition is $T(1) = 0$.\n- The method to be used is the substitution method (unrolling).\n- The $n$th harmonic number is defined as $H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$.\n- The objective is to find a closed-form expression for $T(n)$ in terms of $n$ and $H_n$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is standard in the analysis of algorithms. If the $n$ elements arrive in a random permutation, the probability that the $n$-th element is the minimum of all elements seen so far is exactly $\\frac{1}{n}$. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of updates at step $n$ is $\\frac{1}{n}$, leading to the given recurrence. The problem is mathematically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a first-order linear recurrence relation with a specified base case. This structure guarantees a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language with no ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary information (recurrence, base case, definition of $H_n$) is provided.\n5.  **Relevance**: The problem is a direct application of the substitution method for solving recurrences, a core topic in data structures and algorithms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires solving the recurrence relation\n$$\nT(n) = T(n-1) + \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nfor $n \\geq 2$, with the base case $T(1) = 0$. The method to be used is the substitution method, also known as unrolling or iteration.\n\nWe begin with the given recurrence relation:\n$$\nT(n) = T(n-1) + \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nWe unroll the recurrence by repeatedly substituting the expression for the term with a smaller index.\nFor the $T(n-1)$ term, the recurrence relation implies $T(n-1) = T(n-2) + \\frac{1}{n-1}$. Substituting this into the equation for $T(n)$:\n$$\nT(n) = \\left( T(n-2) + \\frac{1}{n-1} \\right) + \\frac{1}{n} = T(n-2) + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nNext, we substitute for $T(n-2)$, which is $T(n-3) + \\frac{1}{n-2}$:\n$$\nT(n) = \\left( T(n-3) + \\frac{1}{n-2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n} = T(n-3) + \\frac{1}{n-2} + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nA pattern is emerging. After $i$ steps of unrolling, the expression becomes:\n$$\nT(n) = T(n-i) + \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} \\frac{1}{n-k}\n$$\nTo reach the base case $T(1)$, we must unroll until the argument of $T$ becomes $1$. We set $n-i = 1$, which gives $i = n-1$.\nSubstituting $i = n-1$ into the general pattern:\n$$\nT(n) = T(n-(n-1)) + \\sum_{k=0}^{(n-1)-1} \\frac{1}{n-k} = T(1) + \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \\frac{1}{n-k}\n$$\nLet's expand the summation to see the terms explicitly:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \\frac{1}{n-k} = \\frac{1}{n-0} + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{n-(n-2)} = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis is the sum of reciprocals from $2$ to $n$. We can write this using summation notation with an index running upwards:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{j}\n$$\nSo, the expression for $T(n)$ becomes:\n$$\nT(n) = T(1) + \\sum_{j=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{j}\n$$\nWe are given the base condition $T(1) = 0$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nT(n) = 0 + \\sum_{j=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{j} = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{j}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the solution in terms of the $n$th harmonic number, $H_n$, which is defined as:\n$$\nH_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nWe can split the sum for $H_n$ at $k=1$:\n$$\nH_n = \\frac{1}{1} + \\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{k} = 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nComparing this with our expression for $T(n)$, we see that $T(n) = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{j}$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$\nH_n = 1 + T(n)\n$$\nSolving for $T(n)$, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nT(n) = H_n - 1\n$$\nThis is the expected number of times the running minimum is updated when processing a random permutation of $n$ distinct elements.",

The step size of $2$ in the recurrence argument, $n-2$, indicates that the parity of the input is preserved. This means that values of $T(n)$ for even $n$ depend only on the base case $T(0)$, and values for odd $n$ depend only on $T(1)$. We must therefore analyze the two cases separately.\n\n**Case 1: $n$ is even**\nLet $n$ be an even non-negative integer. We can write $n = 2k$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.

The arguments are $n, n-c, n-2c, \\dots, n-(k_{max}-1)c$. The last term must be positive, so $n-(k_{max}-1)c  0$, which implies $(k_{max}-1)c  n$, or $k_{max}  \\frac{n}{c} + 1$.
