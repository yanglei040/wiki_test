            "problem": "A deep-space probe sends observational data back to Earth using a stream of four distinct markers, which we will denote as Alpha ($\\alpha$), Beta ($\\beta$), Gamma ($\\gamma$), and Delta ($\\delta$). To conserve transmission bandwidth, the data stream is compressed using a Huffman code. The codebook mapping each marker to its binary representation is as follows:\n*   $\\alpha$: `0`\n*   $\\beta$: `10`\n*   $\\gamma$: `110`\n*   $\\delta$: `111`\n\nA segment of a received transmission contains the binary sequence `11010011100`.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to decode a binary sequence using a given Huffman codebook. The fundamental property of a Huffman code is that it is a prefix code. This means no codeword is a prefix of any other codeword, which guarantees that any encoded sequence can be decoded unambiguously into a unique sequence of symbols.\n\nThe decoding algorithm proceeds by reading the binary stream from left to right. We accumulate bits one by one until the current string of bits matches a codeword in the dictionary. Once a match is found, we record the corresponding symbol and then continue the process from the very next bit in the stream.\n\nThe provided codebook is:\n*   $\\alpha$: `0`\n*   $\\beta$: `10`\n*   $\\gamma$: `110`\n*   $\\delta$: `111`\n\nThe binary sequence to be decoded is `11010011100`.\n\nLet's apply the decoding procedure step-by-step:\n\n1.  We start at the beginning of the sequence: `11010011100`.\n    -   We read the first bit, `1`. This is not a complete codeword in our codebook.\n    -   We read the second bit, forming the string `11`. This is also not in the codebook.\n    -   We read the third bit, forming `110`. This string matches the code for the symbol $\\gamma$. We record $\\gamma$ as the first symbol of our decoded sequence.\n    -   The remaining bit sequence is `10011100`.\n\n2.  We continue decoding from the start of the remaining sequence: `10011100`.\n    -   We read the first bit, `1`. This is not a codeword.\n    -   We read the second bit, forming `10`. This string matches the code for $\\beta$. We record $\\beta$ as the second symbol.\n    -   The remaining bit sequence is `011100`.\n\n3.  We proceed with the new sequence: `011100`.\n    -   We read the first bit, `0`. This string matches the code for $\\alpha$. We record $\\alpha$ as the third symbol.\n    -   The remaining bit sequence is `11100`.\n\n4.  We continue with the sequence `11100`.\n    -   We read the first bit, `1`. Not a codeword.\n    -   We read the second bit, forming `11`. Not a codeword.\n    -   We read the third bit, forming `111`. This string matches the code for $\\delta$. We record $\\delta$ as the fourth symbol.\n    -   The remaining bit sequence is `00`.\n\n5.  We proceed with the sequence `00`.\n    -   We read the first bit, `0`. This matches the code for $\\alpha$. We record $\\alpha$ as the fifth symbol.\n    -   The remaining bit sequence is `0`.\n\n6.  Finally, we decode the last part of the sequence: `0`.\n    -   We read the bit, `0`. This matches the code for $\\alpha$. We record $\\alpha$ as the sixth and final symbol.\n    -   The remaining sequence is now empty, so the decoding is complete.\n\nBy concatenating the symbols we identified in order, we find the original sequence to be $\\gamma\\beta\\alpha\\delta\\alpha\\alpha$.\n\nWe now compare this result with the given multiple-choice options:\nA. $\\gamma\\beta\\delta\\alpha\\alpha$\nB. $\\gamma\\beta\\alpha\\gamma\\alpha\\alpha$\nC. $\\delta\\alpha\\beta\\beta\\alpha\\gamma$\nD. $\\gamma\\beta\\alpha\\delta\\alpha\\alpha$\nE. $\\gamma\\alpha\\beta\\delta\\alpha\\alpha$\n\nOur decoded sequence, $\\gamma\\beta\\alpha\\delta\\alpha\\alpha$, matches option D.",
