            "problem": "Consider an open-addressed hash table that supports dynamic resizing by doubling and halving its capacity based on the load factor. The load factor is defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{s}{M}$, where $s$ is the current number of stored keys and $M$ is the current table capacity. The table uses the following resizing policy:\n- On insertion, if inserting one more key would make $\\alpha$ exceed the upper threshold $\\alpha_{\\max}$, the table is grown by doubling the capacity, and every existing key is rehashed into the new table.\n- On deletion, after removing a key, if $\\alpha$ falls strictly below the lower threshold $\\alpha_{\\min}$, the table is shrunk by halving the capacity (but never below a fixed minimum capacity), and every remaining key is rehashed into the new table.\n\nAssume the following parameters and cost model:\n- The initial capacity is $M_0 = 16$, and the table never shrinks below $M_0$.\n- The upper threshold is $\\alpha_{\\max} = 1$ (growth occurs when attempting to insert into a full table).\n- The lower threshold is $\\alpha_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The sequence of operations is $N = 1000$ insertions into an initially empty table, followed immediately by $N = 1000$ deletions.\n- Each insertion or deletion that does not trigger resizing costs $1$ unit of work.\n- A resize (either growth or shrink) rehashes all currently stored keys into the new table, at a cost of $1$ unit of work per rehashed key. Ignore allocation and any other overheads.\n- Assume uniform hashing so that the expected cost of placing a key into the table (without resizing) is constant and counted in the $1$ unit of work above.\n\nStarting from these definitions and policies, derive the exact total work performed by the entire sequence of operations, counted in units specified above.

            "solution": "The user wants me to solve the problem. I will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   The load factor is defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{s}{M}$, where $s$ is the number of stored keys and $M$ is the table capacity.\n-   The initial and minimum capacity is $M_0 = 16$.\n-   The upper resize threshold is $\\alpha_{\\max} = 1$. Growth occurs if inserting one more key would make $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\max}$.\n-   The lower resize threshold is $\\alpha_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Shrinking occurs after a deletion if $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\min}$.\n-   The sequence of operations is $N = 1000$ insertions into an initially empty table, followed by $N = 1000$ deletions.\n-   The cost of an insertion or deletion without resizing is $1$ unit of work.\n-   The cost of a resize is $1$ unit of work per key rehashed.\n-   Growth operation: table capacity is doubled ($M \\to 2M$).\n-   Shrink operation: table capacity is halved ($M \\to \\frac{M}{2}$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic dynamic array or open-addressed hash table resizing strategy. The model and cost analysis are standard topics in computer science and algorithms. It is firmly based on established principles of data structure analysis.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The initial conditions (empty table, $M_0=16$), operation sequence ($1000$ insertions, $1000$ deletions), and resizing rules are all precisely defined. This allows for a unique, deterministic calculation of the total work.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical definitions and rules.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any of the specified criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe total work is the sum of the work performed during the insertion phase and the deletion phase. We will analyze each phase separately.\n\n**1. Insertion Phase: $1000$ Insertions**\n\nThe table starts empty, so $s=0$, and with initial capacity $M=16$.\nThe base cost for the $1000$ insertion operations is $1000 \\times 1 = 1000$ units of work.\n\nWe must also account for the work done during resizing. A resize-up (growth) is triggered when an attempt is made to insert a key that would make the load factor $\\alpha = \\frac{s+1}{M}$ exceed $\\alpha_{\\max} = 1$. This simplifies to the condition $\\frac{s+1}{M}  1$, or $s+1  M$. Since the number of keys $s$ cannot exceed the capacity $M$, this condition is met only when $s=M$. Thus, the table grows just before inserting the $(M+1)$-th key. The cost of this growth is the number of keys already in the table, which is $s=M$.\n\nLet's trace the growth events:\n-   **Initial State:** $s=0$, $M=16$.\n-   Keys $1$ through $16$ are inserted. When $s=16$, the table is full.\n-   **Growth 1:** Before inserting the $17$-th key, $s=16$ and $M=16$. A resize is triggered.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 16 = 32$.\n    -   Resize work: $16$ keys are rehashed, costing $16$ units.\n-   **Growth 2:** The table fills again. Before inserting the $33$-rd key, $s=32$ and $M=32$. A resize is triggered.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 32 = 64$.\n    -   Resize work: $32$ keys are rehashed, costing $32$ units.\n-   **Growth 3:** Before inserting the $65$-th key ($s=64$, $M=64$).\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 64 = 128$.\n    -   Resize work: $64$ units.\n-   **Growth 4:** Before inserting the $129$-th key ($s=128$, $M=128$).\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 128 = 256$.\n    -   Resize work: $128$ units.\n-   **Growth 5:** Before inserting the $257$-th key ($s=256$, $M=256$).\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 256 = 512$.\n    -   Resize work: $256$ units.\n-   **Growth 6:** Before inserting the $513$-th key ($s=512$, $M=512$).\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to 2 \\times 512 = 1024$.\n    -   Resize work: $512$ units.\n\nAfter the 6th growth, the capacity is $M=1024$. The keys from $513$ to $1000$ are inserted. Since the number of keys $s$ remains less than $1024$, no further growths occur.\n\nTotal work during the insertion phase ($W_{\\text{ins}}$) is the sum of the base insertion work and the total resize work.\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, ins}} = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 $$\nThis is a geometric series:\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, ins}} = 16(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32) = 16 \\sum_{i=0}^{5} 2^i = 16 \\left(\\frac{2^6 - 1}{2-1}\\right) = 16(63) = 1008 $$\nTotal insertion phase work:\n$$ W_{\\text{ins}} = 1000 + W_{\\text{resize, ins}} = 1000 + 1008 = 2008 $$\nAt the end of this phase, the table has $s=1000$ keys and a capacity of $M=1024$.\n\n**2. Deletion Phase: $1000$ Deletions**\n\nThis phase starts with $s=1000$ and $M=1024$.\nThe base cost for the $1000$ deletion operations is $1000 \\times 1 = 1000$ units of work.\n\nA resize-down (shrink) is triggered after a key is deleted if the new load factor $\\alpha = \\frac{s}{M}$ falls strictly below $\\alpha_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This condition is $\\frac{s}{M}  \\frac{1}{2}$, or $s  \\frac{M}{2}$. The cost of shrinking is the number of remaining keys, $s$.\n\nLet's trace the shrink events:\n-   **Initial State:** $s=1000$, $M=1024$.\n-   Keys are deleted one by one. The first shrink condition for $M=1024$ is $s  \\frac{1024}{2}$, i.e., $s  512$. This occurs when the number of elements drops from $s=512$ to $s=511$.\n-   **Shrink 1:** After deleting a key when $s=512$, the new count is $s=511$.\n    -   Condition met: $511  512$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{1024}{2} = 512$.\n    -   Resize work: $511$ remaining keys are rehashed, costing $511$ units.\n-   **Shrink 2:** Now $s$ decreases from $511$ with $M=512$. The next shrink condition is $s  \\frac{512}{2}$, i.e., $s  256$. This occurs when $s$ drops from $256$ to $255$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{512}{2} = 256$.\n    -   Resize work: $255$ units.\n-   **Shrink 3:** $s$ decreases from $255$ with $M=256$. Shrink condition: $s  \\frac{256}{2}$, i.e., $s  128$. Triggered when $s$ becomes $127$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{256}{2} = 128$.\n    -   Resize work: $127$ units.\n-   **Shrink 4:** $s$ decreases from $127$ with $M=128$. Shrink condition: $s  \\frac{128}{2}$, i.e., $s  64$. Triggered when $s$ becomes $63$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{128}{2} = 64$.\n    -   Resize work: $63$ units.\n-   **Shrink 5:** $s$ decreases from $63$ with $M=64$. Shrink condition: $s  \\frac{64}{2}$, i.e., $s  32$. Triggered when $s$ becomes $31$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{64}{2} = 32$.\n    -   Resize work: $31$ units.\n-   **Shrink 6:** $s$ decreases from $31$ with $M=32$. Shrink condition: $s  \\frac{32}{2}$, i.e., $s  16$. Triggered when $s$ becomes $15$.\n    -   New capacity: $M \\to \\frac{32}{2} = 16$.\n    -   Resize work: $15$ units.\n\nAfter this last shrink, the capacity is $M=16$. The problem states that the capacity never shrinks below $M_0=16$. Thus, no further shrinking occurs as the remaining keys are deleted.\n\nTotal work during the deletion phase ($W_{\\text{del}}$) is the sum of the base deletion work and the total resize work.\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, del}} = 511 + 255 + 127 + 63 + 31 + 15 $$\nThis sum can be written as:\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, del}} = (512-1) + (256-1) + (128-1) + (64-1) + (32-1) + (16-1) $$\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, del}} = (2^9-1) + (2^8-1) + (2^7-1) + (2^6-1) + (2^5-1) + (2^4-1) $$\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, del}} = \\left(\\sum_{i=4}^{9} 2^i\\right) - 6 $$\nThe geometric sum is $\\sum_{i=4}^{9} 2^i = 2^4 \\sum_{j=0}^{5} 2^j = 16 \\left(\\frac{2^6 - 1}{2-1}\\right) = 16(63) = 1008$.\n$$ W_{\\text{resize, del}} = 1008 - 6 = 1002 $$\nTotal deletion phase work:\n$$ W_{\\text{del}} = 1000 + W_{\\text{resize, del}} = 1000 + 1002 = 2002 $$\n\n**3. Total Work**\n\nThe total work is the sum of the work from both phases:\n$$ W_{\\text{total}} = W_{\\text{ins}} + W_{\\text{del}} = 2008 + 2002 = 4010 $$\nThe exact total work performed is $4010$ units.",

By coding this strategy, you will gain firsthand experience in preventing performance oscillation.",

            "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a dynamic hash table with a hysteresis-based rehashing strategy that uses a higher load factor threshold for growth than for shrinking. The table must use separate chaining for collision resolution, and all operations are over nonnegative integer keys. The goal is to programmatically verify the behavior and consequences of hysteresis in resizing, including its impact on collisions and the avoidance of oscillation.\n\nDefinitions to use as the fundamental base:\n- A hash table has a capacity $m$ (the number of buckets) and stores $n$ keys. The load factor is $\\alpha = n/m$.\n- Separate chaining stores, in each bucket $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$, a list of keys whose hash maps to $i$.\n- A collision, during an insertion of a key $k$, occurs when its bucket already contains at least one key. The number of collisions for that insertion is the current list length of bucket $h(k)$ immediately before inserting $k$.\n- The hash function is $h(k) = k \\bmod m$.\n- Rehashing means choosing a new capacity $m'$, allocating new empty buckets, and moving all existing keys into the new table using the new capacity.\n- Hysteresis in resizing means using two thresholds with $ \\alpha_{grow}  \\alpha_{shrink} $. Growth is triggered only when $\\alpha  \\alpha_{grow}$, and shrinking is triggered only when $\\alpha  \\alpha_{shrink}$.\n\nRequired rehashing policy:\n- Thresholds are exact rational numbers: $ \\alpha_{grow} = p_g / q_g $ and $ \\alpha_{shrink} = p_s / q_s $ with $ p_g, q_g, p_s, q_s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0} $ and $ \\alpha_{grow}  \\alpha_{shrink} $.\n- After each insertion, compute $\\alpha = n/m$. If $\\alpha  \\alpha_{grow}$, grow: set the new capacity to the next prime number at least as large as $ \\lceil \\gamma_{up} \\cdot m \\rceil $ where $ \\gamma_{up} = u/v $ is a given rational with $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0}$ and $ \\gamma_{up} \\ge 1 $. Then rehash all keys.\n- After each deletion, compute $\\alpha = n/m$. If $\\alpha  \\alpha_{shrink}$ and $m  m_{min}$, shrink: set the new capacity to the largest prime number at most $ \\lfloor \\gamma_{down} \\cdot m \\rfloor $ where $ \\gamma_{down} = x/y $ is a given rational with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0}$ and $ \\gamma_{down} \\le 1 $. Do not shrink below the minimum capacity $ m_{min} $.\n- Capacities must always be prime.\n- Ignore duplicate insertions (if a key is already present, do nothing). Deleting a non-present key does nothing.\n- Track the following statistics across the entire operation sequence:\n  1. $m_{final}$: the final capacity.\n  2. $R$: the total number of rehashes performed (growths plus shrinks).\n  3. $L_{max}$: the maximum chain length observed at the moment of any insertion, before placing the new key.\n  4. $\\alpha_{final}$: the final load factor $n/m$, reported as a floating-point decimal rounded to three decimal places.\n  5. $G_{eq}$: a boolean indicating whether growth was ever triggered exactly at equality $\\alpha = \\alpha_{grow}$; with the specified rule “grow only if $\\alpha  \\alpha_{grow}$,” this should be false.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use separate chaining with $h(k) = k \\bmod m$.\n- Use exact rational arithmetic for thresholds and resizing factors ($\\alpha_{grow}$, $\\alpha_{shrink}$, $\\gamma_{up}$, $\\gamma_{down}$) so that equality conditions like $\\alpha = \\alpha_{grow}$ are checked without floating-point error.\n- When resizing, choose prime capacities as specified by “next prime at least” for growth and “largest prime at most” for shrink, respecting $m_{min}$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case below, you must simulate the exact sequence of operations and output the specified results.\n\nCommon parameters for all tests:\n- Growth factor $ \\gamma_{up} = 2/1 $.\n- Shrink factor $ \\gamma_{down} = 1/2 $.\n- Minimum capacity $ m_{min} = 5 $.\n\nTest cases:\n- Test case A (happy path growth):\n  - Initial capacity $ m_0 = 7 $.\n  - Thresholds: $ \\alpha_{grow} = 3/4 $, $ \\alpha_{shrink} = 1/4 $.\n  - Operations: insert keys $ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 $ (ten insertions).\n- Test case B (boundary at equality, no growth at equality):\n  - Initial capacity $ m_0 = 5 $.\n  - Thresholds: $ \\alpha_{grow} = 3/5 $, $ \\alpha_{shrink} = 1/5 $.\n  - Operations: insert keys $ 10, 11, 12 $ (three insertions).

The use of exact rational arithmetic removes ambiguity from floating-point comparisons. The problem is valid on this criterion.\n6.  **Triviality**: The problem is not trivial. It requires careful implementation of the state machine, including number-theoretic functions (prime generation), exact rational arithmetic, and meticulous tracking of several statistics through a sequence of operations. The test cases are designed to probe specific behaviors like growth, boundary conditions, hysteresis, and minimum size constraints.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Design\n\nThe solution will be implemented in Python. A class, `HysteresisHashTable`, will encapsulate the logic and state of the hash table.\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n1.  **Prime Number Utilities**: Helper functions will be created to support the capacity management policy.\n    *   `is_prime(k)`: A function to test if an integer $k$ is prime. For the small numbers involved, trial division up to $\\sqrt{k}$ is sufficient.\n    *   `next_prime(k)`: Finds the smallest prime number $p \\ge k$.\n    *   `prev_prime(k)`: Finds the largest prime number $p \\le k$.\n\n2.  **Exact Rational Arithmetic**: Python's standard `fractions` module will be used to represent $\\alpha_{grow}$, $\\alpha_{shrink}$, $\\gamma_{up}$, and $\\gamma_{down}$ and to perform all comparisons involving the load factor $\\alpha$, thereby avoiding floating-point precision errors.\n\n3.  **`HysteresisHashTable` Class**:\n    *   **State Variables**:\n        *   $m$: current capacity (an integer).\n        *   $n$: number of keys stored (an integer).\n        *   `buckets`: A list of lists, representing the separate chains.\n        *   `keys`: A `set` for efficient $O(1)$ average time complexity for checking key existence. This is crucial for ignoring duplicate insertions and deletions of non-existent keys.\n        *   Parameters: $\\alpha_{grow}, \\alpha_{shrink}, \\gamma_{up}, \\gamma_{down}, m_{min}$ will be stored as attributes, likely as `Fraction` objects.\n        *   Statistics: $R, L_{max}, G_{eq}$ will be tracked.\n    *   **Methods**:\n        *   `__init__(m_0, ...)`: Initializes the table with capacity $m_0$ and all required parameters.\n        *   `_hash(k)`: Returns $k \\bmod m$.\n        *   `_add_key_internal(k)`: A private helper to add a key to the buckets and the key set, and increment $n$. This method does not trigger rehashing or update statistics, making it safe to use during a rehash operation.\n        *   `_rehash(new_m)`: Manages the resizing of the table. It increments $R$, creates a new set of buckets with capacity `new_m`, and re-inserts all existing keys using `_add_key_internal`.\n        *   `insert(k)`: The public insertion method.\n            1.  Returns immediately if key $k$ is already in the `keys` set.\n            2.  Calculates the hash index $i = h(k)$.\n            3.  Updates $L_{max}$ by comparing it with the current length of `buckets[i]`.\n            4.  Calls `_add_key_internal(k)` to add the key.\n            5.  Computes the new load factor $\\alpha = n/m$.\n            6.  Checks if $\\alpha  \\alpha_{grow}$. If so, it calculates the target new capacity $m'_{target} = \\lceil \\gamma_{up} \\cdot m \\rceil$, finds the next prime $m' = \\text{next\\_prime}(m'_{target})$, and calls `_rehash(m')`.\n            7.  The problem requires checking for growth triggered *at* equality for $G_{eq}$. Although the growth rule is strict inequality, we will check if $\\alpha = \\alpha_{grow}$ occurs. As per the problem's own analysis, $G_{eq}$ should remain `False`.\n        *   `delete(k)`: The public deletion method.\n            1.  Returns if key $k$ is not in the `keys` set.\n            2.

Execute the sequence of insertion and deletion operations.\n3.  Call `get_stats()` to retrieve the final results.\n4.  Format the results for each test case into a string `\"[m,R,L_max,alpha,Geq]\"` where `alpha` is formatted to three decimal places.\n5.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-defined computational problem concerning the algorithmic detection of and recovery from catastrophic hash table performance. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of data structures and algorithms, specifically hash tables, collision resolution by separate chaining, and universal hashing. All parameters, conditions, and procedures are specified without ambiguity, rendering the problem valid and solvable.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first implementing the detection protocol based on the performance of a specified degenerate hash function. If a failure is detected, an emergency rehashing protocol is initiated to find a new table capacity and a new hash function from a universal family that restores a provably balanced state.\n\n### Part 1: Catastrophic Failure Detection\n\nThe initial state of the system is defined by a hash table of capacity $m_0$ and a multiset of $n$ integer keys. A \"bad\" hash function, $h_{\\text{bad}}$, is used, leading to a poor distribution of keys.\n\n1.  **Initial Hashing and Metrics**: We first compute the distribution of the $n$ keys into the $m_0$ buckets using $h_{\\text{bad}}$. The primary metric for performance is the maximum bucket size, denoted as $M$. This represents the worst-case time complexity for operations like search, insertion, or deletion in the hash table.\n\n2.  **Defining the Failure Threshold**: A catastrophic failure is declared if the observed maximum bucket size $M$ is excessively large compared to what would be expected from a good hash function. The problem provides a precise, two-part condition for this.\n    *   First, we establish a baseline for expected performance under uniform hashing. The average or expected number of keys per bucket is the load factor, $\\alpha = n/m_0$. In this context, we use the integer-valued expected occupancy $E = \\lceil n / m_0 \\rceil$. An initial sign of trouble is when the maximum load $M$ is significantly larger than this average, which we quantify as $M \\ge \\tau \\cdot E$ for a multiplier $\\tau=3$.\n    *   Second, we use a theoretical bound from the analysis of universal hashing. For a hash function chosen uniformly from a universal family, the maximum bucket occupancy is, with high probability, bounded by a polylogarithmic function of $n$. The problem formalizes this as a bound $L = \\lceil \\gamma \\log_2(n+1) \\rceil$, with a parameter $\\gamma=2$. A hash table is considered to be performing catastrophically if its worst-case occupancy $M$ exceeds this theoretical \"good\" worst case.\n\n3.  **The Detection Rule**: The emergency condition combines these two checks. An emergency is declared if and only if the table is not empty ($n \\ge 1$) and the maximum bucket size $M$ exceeds **both** the scaled average and the theoretical bound:\n    $$ M \\ge \\max\\left(\\left\\lceil \\gamma \\log_2(n+1) \\right\\rceil, \\tau \\cdot E\\right) $$\n    where $\\gamma = 2$ and $\\tau = 3$. If this condition is not met, the table configuration is considered acceptable, and no action is taken. The result reported is $[m_0, M, 0]$.\n\n### Part 2: Emergency Rehashing Protocol\n\nIf an emergency is declared, a recovery protocol is initiated to create a new, well-behaved hash table.\n\n1.  **New Capacity Selection**: A key reason for poor hash performance is a high load factor or an unfortunate relationship between the table size and key distribution. The protocol first determines a new table capacity, $m'$.\n    *   It targets a conservative load factor of $\\alpha^\\star = 0.75$. This ensures the table is not overly crowded.\n    *   The minimum required capacity to achieve this is $\\lceil n / \\alpha^\\star \\rceil$.\n    *   To further improve the statistical properties of hashing, especially with modular arithmetic, the new capacity is chosen to be a prime number. Thus, the new capacity is $m' = \\text{next\\_prime}(\\lceil n/\\alpha^\\star \\rceil)$.\n\n2.  **Iterative Search for a Good Hash Function**: The protocol employs a standard universal family of hash functions:\n    $$ h_{a,b}(x) = \\left((a \\cdot x + b) \\bmod p\\right) \\bmod m' $$\n    Here, $p$ is a large prime number ($p = 1000000007$) greater than any key, and the parameters $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ define a specific function from the family. Instead of choosing $(a, b)$ randomly, the protocol specifies a deterministic procedure to generate a sequence of pairs $(a_t, b_t)$ for attempt index $t = 1, 2, \\dots$:\n    *   $a_t = 1 + \\left((t \\cdot 2654435761) \\bmod (p-1)\\right)$\n    *   $b_t = \\left(t \\cdot 11400714819323198485\\right) \\bmod p$\n\n    For each generated function $h_{a_t, b_t}$, we rehash all $n$ keys into the new table of size $m'$ and compute the resulting maximum bucket size, $M'$. The attempt is deemed successful if $M'$ meets a quality standard, which is again based on the theoretical logarithmic bound:\n    $$ M' \\le \\left\\lceil \\beta \\log_2(n+1) \\right\\rceil $$\n    with a parameter $\\beta = 3$. The first attempt $t$ that satisfies this condition is accepted. The process stops, and the result is $[m', M', t]$.\n\n3.  **Escalation and Finalization**: It is statistically unlikely, but possible, that none of the first $K_1=25$ attempts succeed.\n    *   If no success is found after $K_1$ attempts, the protocol escalates by drastically reducing the load factor. The capacity is updated to $m' \\leftarrow \\text{next\\_prime}(2m')$, effectively halving the load factor.\n    *   An additional $K_1 = 25$ attempts are made with this new, larger capacity.\n    *   If a successful function is found during this second phase, the protocol terminates, reporting the new $m'$, the successful $M'$, and the total number of attempts.\n    *   If, after a total of $2K_1$ attempts, no function has met the success criterion, the protocol guarantees termination by selecting the attempt (across all $2K_1$ tries) that produced the minimum $M'$, regardless of whether it met the formal success bound. This \"best effort\" result is then reported.\n\nThis comprehensive protocol ensures that any catastrophic failure is not only detected but also resolved in a deterministic, finite, and robust manner, yielding a hash table with provably good performance characteristics.",
