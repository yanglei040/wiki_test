            "solution": "The problem posed is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Hamiltonian mechanics and celestial mechanics, specifically the circular restricted three-body problem. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants, initial conditions, equations, and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective, and the task is a standard exercise in computational physics for comparing the long-term performance of numerical integrators.\n\nThe first step is to derive the explicit system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the given Hamiltonian. The state of the system is described by the canonical coordinates $(q,p) = (x, y, p_x, p_y)$. The Hamiltonian is given by\n$$H(x,y,p_x,p_y)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(p_x^2+p_y^2\\right)+y\\,p_x-x\\,p_y-\\left(\\frac{1-\\mu}{r_1}+\\frac{\\mu}{r_2}\\right)$$\nwhere $r_1=\\sqrt{(x+\\mu)^2+y^2}$ and $r_2=\\sqrt{(x-1+\\mu)^2+y^2}$. The equations of motion are Hamilton's equations, $\\dot{q}_i = \\partial H / \\partial p_i$ and $\\dot{p}_i = -\\partial H / \\partial q_i$.\n\nThe derivatives with respect to the momenta are:\n$$\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = p_x + y$$\n$$\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = p_y - x$$\n\nThe derivatives with respect to the positions require computing the partials of $H$. We have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -p_y - (1-\\mu)(-\\frac{1}{r_1^2})\\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial x} - \\mu(-\\frac{1}{r_2^2})\\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial x} = -p_y + \\frac{(1-\\mu)(x+\\mu)}{r_1^3} + \\frac{\\mu(x-1+\\mu)}{r_2^3}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = p_x - (1-\\mu)(-\\frac{1}{r_1^2})\\frac{\\partial r_1}{\\partial y} - \\mu(-\\frac{1}{r_2^2})\\frac{\\partial r_2}{\\partial y} = p_x + \\frac{(1-\\mu)y}{r_1^3} + \\frac{\\mu y}{r_2^3}$$\nFrom $\\dot{p}_i = -\\partial H/\\partial q_i$, we obtain the equations for the momenta:\n$$\\dot{p}_x = p_y - \\frac{(1-\\mu)(x+\\mu)}{r_1^3} - \\frac{\\mu(x-1+\\mu)}{r_2^3}$$\n$$\\dot{p}_y = -p_x - y\\left(\\frac{1-\\mu}{r_1^3} + \\frac{\\mu}{r_2^3}\\right)$$\nThis system of four coupled, autonomous, first-order ODEs, $\\dot{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z})$ where $\\mathbf{z}=(x,y,p_x,p_y)^T$, governs the dynamics.\n\nNext, we specify the numerical integration methods.\n1.  **First-Order Symplectic Euler Method:** This method preserves the symplectic structure of phase space, which is crucial for the long-term qualitative accuracy of Hamiltonian system simulations. A common explicit first-order symplectic Euler scheme (also known as Euler-B) for a state $\\mathbf{z}_n = (\\mathbf{q}_n, \\mathbf{p}_n)$ at time $t_n$ is given by the following two-step update to obtain the state at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$:\n    $$\\mathbf{p}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{p}_n - h \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}(\\mathbf{q}_n, \\mathbf{p}_n)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{q}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{q}_n + h \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}(\\mathbf{q}_n, \\mathbf{p}_{n+1})$$\n    Notice that the update for position $\\mathbf{q}$ uses the newly computed momentum $\\mathbf{p}_{n+1}$. For the given CRTBP Hamiltonian, this translates to the following explicit algorithm for one time step $h$:\n    Given $(\\mathbf{q}_n, \\mathbf{p}_n)=(x_n, y_n, p_{x,n}, p_{y,n})$:\n    First, update momenta using the forces evaluated at the current state:\n    $$p_{x, n+1} = p_{x,n} + h \\left(p_{y,n} - \\frac{(1-\\mu)(x_n+\\mu)}{r_{1,n}^3} - \\frac{\\mu(x_n-1+\\mu)}{r_{2,n}^3}\\right)$$\n    $$p_{y, n+1} = p_{y,n} + h \\left(-p_{x,n} - y_n\\left(\\frac{1-\\mu}{r_{1,n}^3} + \\frac{\\mu}{r_{2,n}^3}\\right)\\right)$$\n    Second, update positions using the *new* momenta and *old* positions:\n    $$x_{n+1} = x_n + h (p_{x,n+1} + y_n)$$\n    $$y_{n+1} = y_n + h (p_{y,n+1} - x_n)$$\n    This method is of first-order accuracy but has superior long-term stability properties for Hamiltonian systems compared to non-symplectic methods of the same order.\n\n2.  **Classical Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method:** This is a standard, general-purpose, non-symplectic method for solving ODEs. For the system $\\dot{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z})$, a single step from $\\mathbf{z}_n$ to $\\mathbf{z}_{n+1}$ is:\n    $$\\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z}_n)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z}_n + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z}_n + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z}_n + h\\mathbf{k}_3)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{z}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{z}_n + \\tfrac{h}{6}(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)$$\n    While highly accurate for a single step (local error is $O(h^5)$), RK4 does not preserve the symplectic form. This leads to secular drift in conserved quantities like the Hamiltonian, making it unsuitable for long-term integrations of such systems.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by setting up initial conditions for each test case. The mass parameter for the Earth-Sun system is $\\mu=3.003489614915\\times 10^{-6}$. The integration time corresponds to $N_p=30$ primary revolutions, $T=2\\pi N_p$. The number of steps is $N=\\lfloor T/h \\rfloor$. For each case, trajectories are initialized with zero velocity in the rotating frame, which corresponds to initial canonical momenta $p_x(0) = -y_0$ and $p_y(0) = x_0$. For each test case, two separate simulations are run, one with each integrator. During each simulation, the state vector is stored at every step. After the integration is complete, two diagnostics are computed: the maximum absolute deviation of the Hamiltonian from its initial value, $\\max_{0\\le n\\le N}|H_n-H_0|$, and the maximum displacement from the equilibrium point, $\\max_{0\\le n\\le N}\\sqrt{(x_n-x_{\\mathrm{eq}})^2+(y_n-y_{\\mathrm{eq}})^2}$. The results are then aggregated for all test cases. The expectation is that the symplectic integrator will show bounded Hamiltonian error, while the RK4 method will exhibit a drift, and this difference in energy conservation will be reflected in the trajectory stability.",
