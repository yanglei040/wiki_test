            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for its scientific and logical integrity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Simulation method: Discrete Element Method (DEM).\n- System: $N$ polydisperse spherical grains in a $3$D periodic cubic domain.\n- Particle radii: $r_i$, with minimum $r_{\\min}$ and maximum $r_{\\max}$.\n- Interaction condition: Two particles $i$ and $j$ are in contact if their center-to-center distance $d_{ij}$ satisfies $d_{ij} \\le r_i + r_j$.\n- Neighbor search algorithm: A uniform cubic cell-linked list with cell edge length $a$.\n- Search stencil: For any given particle, candidate neighbors are searched in its own cell and the $26$ adjacent cells (a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ block of cells).\n- Rebuild policy: The neighbor data structure is rebuilt at every time step without any extra buffer or \"skin\".\n- Objective: Determine the condition on the cell edge length $a$ that guarantees no contacting pair is ever missed, while keeping the neighbor enumeration minimal.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a standard short-range interaction scenario in a many-particle system, and the use of a cell-linked list (or cell grid) method for efficient neighbor finding. This is a fundamental and canonical problem in computational physics and molecular dynamics simulations. The components are as follows:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The setup is based on established principles of DEM and computational geometry. The contact condition for spheres and the cell list algorithm are standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the necessary condition on the cell size $a$ to ensure the correctness of the neighbor search algorithm under a specific search stencil. The objective is clearly stated: guarantee correctness while aiming for efficiency (\"minimal enumeration\"). A unique, derivable condition exists for this well-defined problem.\n- **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, technical language common to the field. There is no ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific or factual unsoundness, is formal and relevant, is complete, is realistic for a computational model, is well-posed, and is scientifically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe cell-linked list method is employed to reduce the computational complexity of finding interacting pairs from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. The correctness of this method hinges on the choice of the cell size, $a$. The problem specifies that for a given particle, we search for its neighbors in the $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ block of cells centered on its own cell. This means that if two particles are to be identified as a potential interaction pair, they must reside in cells that are, at most, adjacent.\n\nLet the position vectors of the centers of two particles $i$ and $j$ be $\\vec{p}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $\\vec{p}_j = (x_j, y_j, z_j)$. The cell grid is aligned with the Cartesian axes. A particle at position $(x, y, z)$ is assigned to a cell with indices $(\\lfloor x/a \\rfloor, \\lfloor y/a \\rfloor, \\lfloor z/a \\rfloor)$.\n\nFor the neighbor search to be successful, if two particles $i$ and $j$ are in contact, the absolute difference of their cell indices along each dimension must be at most $1$. That is:\n$$|\\lfloor x_i/a \\rfloor - \\lfloor x_j/a \\rfloor| \\le 1$$\n$$|\\lfloor y_i/a \\rfloor - \\lfloor y_j/a \\rfloor| \\le 1$$\n$$|\\lfloor z_i/a \\rfloor - \\lfloor z_j/a \\rfloor| \\le 1$$\n\nA contact will be missed if, for example, the separation in the $x$-direction, $|x_i - x_j|$, is large enough that the particles are placed in non-adjacent cells, i.e., $|\\lfloor x_i/a \\rfloor - \\lfloor x_j/a \\rfloor| > 1$. This can happen if $|x_i - x_j| > a$. For instance, if particle $i$ is at $x_i = k \\cdot a - \\epsilon$ and particle $j$ is at $x_j = (k+1) \\cdot a + \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$, then $|x_i - x_j| \\approx a$. Their cell indices would be $\\lfloor x_i/a \\rfloor = k-1$ and $\\lfloor x_j/a \\rfloor = k+1$, which differ by $2$.\n\nTo guarantee that this never happens for any interacting pair, the separation of their centers along any Cartesian axis must be less than or equal to the cell size $a$. Let $\\Delta x = |x_i - x_j|$, $\\Delta y = |y_i - y_j|$, and $\\Delta z = |z_i - z_j|$. The condition to guarantee finding the pair is:\n$$\\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z) \\le a$$\n\nThe contact condition is $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2 + (\\Delta z)^2} \\le r_i + r_j$. The maximum possible value for $\\Delta x$ occurs when $\\Delta y = \\Delta z = 0$, in which case $\\Delta x = d_{ij}$. Thus, the maximum component separation is bounded by the maximum total separation: $\\Delta x \\le d_{ij}$.\n\nIn summary, for any two contacting particles $i$ and $j$, we have:\n$$\\Delta x \\le d_{ij} \\le r_i + r_j$$\n\nTo ensure that $\\Delta x \\le a$ for *all* possible contacting pairs, $a$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of the right-hand side. The maximum possible contact distance occurs for two of the largest particles in the system, i.e., two particles with radius $r_{\\max}$. Their maximum separation is $r_{\\max} + r_{\\max} = 2 r_{\\max}$.\n\nTherefore, the condition on $a$ must be:\n$$a \\ge \\max_{i,j \\text{ in contact}} (r_i + r_j)$$\nThe worst case, which we must accommodate, is two of the largest particles just touching.\n$$a \\ge r_{\\max} + r_{\\max} = 2 r_{\\max}$$\n\nIf $a < 2 r_{\\max}$, one can construct a counterexample. Let two particles, each with radius $r_{\\max}$, be in contact and aligned with the $x$-axis. Their centers are separated by a distance $2 r_{\\max}$. If we choose $a$ such that $a < 2 r_{\\max}$, it is possible to place these two particles such that their $x$-coordinates are $x_i = k \\cdot a - \\epsilon$ and $x_j = x_i + 2 r_{\\max}$. If $a < 2 r_{\\max}$, then $x_j$ can fall into cell $k+2$ or beyond, while $x_i$ is in cell $k-1$. The contact would be missed.\n\nTo keep neighbor enumeration minimal, one should choose the smallest possible cell size $a$ that still satisfies the correctness criterion. This means choosing the equality, $a = 2 r_{\\max}$. The condition itself, however, is the inequality $a \\ge 2 r_{\\max}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Set $a$ equal to the smallest particle diameter, $a = 2 r_{\\min}$, to keep per-cell occupancy small.**\nThis choice is flawed. In a polydisperse system where $r_{\\max} > r_{\\min}$, we can have $a = 2 r_{\\min} < 2 r_{\\max}$. As demonstrated in the derivation, if $a < 2 r_{\\max}$, it is possible for two contacting particles of radius $r_{\\max}$ to be placed in non-adjacent cells. This would violate the search guarantee. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Set $a$ at least as large as the largest particle diameter, $a \\ge 2 r_{\\max}$, so that any contacting pair must lie in the same or adjacent cells; taking $a$ smaller can miss contacts.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derived condition. If $a \\ge 2 r_{\\max}$, then for any contacting pair $(i, j)$, the separation of their centers along any axis, e.g., $\\Delta x$, satisfies $\\Delta x \\le d_{ij} \\le r_i + r_j \\le 2 r_{\\max} \\le a$. With $\\Delta x \\le a$, $\\Delta y \\le a$, and $\\Delta z \\le a$, the particles are guaranteed to be in the same or adjacent cells. The claim that taking $a$ smaller can miss contacts is also correct, as shown by the worst-case scenario. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**C. Set $a$ equal to the mean particle diameter, $a = 2 \\langle r \\rangle$, to balance accuracy and cost on average.**\nThe use of a mean value, $\\langle r \\rangle$, is incorrect for establishing a strict guarantee. In any non-monodisperse system, $r_{\\max} > \\langle r \\rangle$. Thus, this choice implies $a = 2 \\langle r \\rangle < 2 r_{\\max}$. This fails to handle the worst-case scenario of two large particles in contact and can lead to missed interactions. The problem demands a guarantee, not an average-case performance. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Set $a$ equal to the geometric mean diameter, $a = 2 \\sqrt{r_{\\min} r_{\\max}}$, because it bounds most pairwise center separations.**\nSimilar to the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean provides a measure of central tendency. For $r_{\\min} < r_{\\max}$, we have $\\sqrt{r_{\\min} r_{\\max}} < r_{\\max}$. This implies $a = 2 \\sqrt{r_{\\min} r_{\\max}} < 2 r_{\\max}$, which is an insufficient condition. A guarantee must cover all cases, not \"most\" cases. The worst case of two particles of radius $r_{\\max}$ in contact would not be handled correctly. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard computational physics scenario involving a linked-cell neighbor search algorithm for particles in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The validity of the proposed strategies hinges on the fundamental principles of this algorithm, particularly in the specified \"small box\" regime where the box side length $L$ is less than three times the potential cutoff radius $r_c$, i.e., $L < 3r_c$.\n\nThe primary condition for the correctness of the standard linked-cell method, which employs a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ neighbor cell stencil, is that the cell edge length $a$ must be greater than or equal to the cutoff radius $r_c$. That is, $a \\ge r_c$. Since the box is divided into $n$ cells per dimension, we have $a = L/n$. The condition becomes $L/n \\ge r_c$, which is equivalent to $n \\le L/r_c$. If this condition is not met, i.e., $a < r_c$, then particles separated by a distance less than $r_c$ may exist in cells that are not immediate neighbors, rendering the $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil insufficient. In such a case, the search stencil must be expanded to include all cells within a distance $r_c$ of the home cell. Periodic boundary conditions are correctly implemented not by explicit box replication but by wrapping cell indices using modulo arithmetic. For a cell with index $c_k$ in dimension $k$, its neighbor with offset $\\delta_k$ has index $(c_k + \\delta_k) \\pmod n$. To avoid counting each pair interaction twice, a \"half-shell\" or similar convention must be used where, for example, only a specific subset of the $26$ neighbor cells is searched for each home cell.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We now proceed to evaluate each proposed strategy.\n\nA. When $2r_c \\le L < 3r_c$, choose $n=2$ so that $a=L/2>r_c$, and for each cell, search the standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil (the cell itself and all face-, edge-, and corner-adjacent neighbors), with neighbor cell indices wrapped modulo $2$ to enforce PBC. Use a half-shell convention (for example, only $j>i$ within the same cell and a fixed subset of neighbor cells) to avoid double counting.\n\nThe proposed regime is $2r_c \\le L < 3r_c$. The strategy suggests setting the number of cells per dimension to $n=2$. This results in a cell edge length of $a = L/2$. From the given condition $2r_c \\le L$, we can divide by $2$ to find $r_c \\le L/2$, which means $r_c \\le a$. The strict inequality $a > r_c$ mentioned in the option is a subset of this valid range. Since the fundamental condition $a \\ge r_c$ is satisfied, the use of a standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ neighbor cell stencil is indeed correct and sufficient to find all interacting pairs. The use of wrapped cell indices modulo $n=2$ is the correct way to handle periodic boundary conditions for the cell grid. The mention of a half-shell convention to avoid double-counting pair interactions (e.g., checking only pairs $(i,j)$ with $j>i$ for particles in the same cell, and only checking a non-redundant subset of neighboring cells) is a necessary detail for a correct implementation. This strategy is entirely sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. For any $L<3r_c$, forcing $n=3$ and using only the standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil is always sufficient, because it covers all neighbors within one cell in each direction regardless of $a$.\n\nThis strategy proposes setting $n=3$ for any $L < 3r_c$. The cell edge length would be $a = L/3$. From the condition $L < 3r_c$, we get $L/3 < r_c$, which means $a < r_c$. As established, if the cell size $a$ is smaller than the cutoff radius $r_c$, the standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil is insufficient. It is possible for two particles to have a separation distance less than $r_c$ while residing in cells that are not immediate neighbors. For instance, a particle at the boundary of a cell can be within $r_c$ of another particle that is two cells away. The reasoning provided (\"because it covers all neighbors within one cell in each direction\") is a description of what a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil does, but it fails to recognize that this is not sufficient when $a < r_c$. Therefore, this strategy is fundamentally flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. When $r_c<L<2r_c$, set $n=1$ so that all particles occupy a single cell ($a=L$), and compute distances for all distinct particle pairs using the minimum-image convention; restrict to $j>i$ to avoid double counting. This yields correct neighbor detection under PBC.\n\nIn the regime $r_c < L < 2r_c$, this strategy suggests using $n=1$. This makes the cell edge length $a = L$. The entire simulation box becomes a single cell. The condition for the standard linked-cell method, $a \\ge r_c$, becomes $L \\ge r_c$, which is satisfied by the specified range $r_c < L$. With only one cell, the concept of \"neighboring cells\" refers to the periodic images of the box itself. A search over the cell and its neighbors is equivalent to performing an all-pairs check on the $N$ particles within the box, where the distance between each pair $(\\vec{r}_i, \\vec{r}_j)$ is calculated using the minimum-image convention (MIC). The MIC correctly accounts for periodic boundary conditions by finding the shortest distance between a particle and all periodic images of another particle. Restricting the pair indices to $j>i$ is the standard procedure to avoid double counting. While computationally equivalent to a brute-force $O(N^2)$ algorithm, this procedure is guaranteed to be correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. When $L \\le 2r_c$, one must explicitly replicate the box into a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ supercell and build cell lists there; otherwise, pairs near opposite faces of the original box will be missed.\n\nThis option claims that for $L \\le 2r_c$, explicit replication of the simulation box into a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ supercell containing $27$ copies of the original system is a necessity. This is false. A correctly implemented linked-cell algorithm handles periodic boundary conditions efficiently by wrapping cell indices, as described in the analysis of option A. This arithmetical wrapping correctly identifies pairs of particles across periodic boundaries without the need for creating a large, explicit supercell. The claim that pairs \"will be missed\" otherwise is incorrect; it reflects a misunderstanding of how PBC is implemented in modern simulation codes. The procedure described in options A and C are counterexamples to this claim of necessity. Explicit replication is a conceptually simple but computationally wasteful method that is not required.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. When $2r_c<L<3r_c$ and $n=2$ so that $a=L/2>r_c$, the neighbor stencil must include $5 \\times 5 \\times 5$ cells (offsets $-2,-1,0,1,2$ in each dimension) to account for possible wrap-around across two faces under PBC; the standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil is insufficient in this case.\n\nThis option starts with the same setup as option A: $2r_c < L < 3r_c$ and $n=2$. This implies $a = L/2 > r_c$. As established previously, the condition $a > r_c$ is precisely the requirement that makes the standard $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ stencil sufficient. The claim that this stencil is *insufficient* and a larger $5 \\times 5 \\times 5$ stencil is required is a direct contradiction of the fundamental principle of the linked-cell algorithm. A larger stencil is only necessary when $a < r_c$. Furthermore, with $n=2$, using offsets up to $\\pm 2$ is redundant due to the modulo $2$ arithmetic for cell indices. For example, an offset of $\\delta_x = 2$ is equivalent to an offset of $\\delta_x = 0$ since $2 \\pmod 2 = 0$. An offset of $\\delta_x = -1$ is equivalent to $\\delta_x = 1$ since $-1 \\pmod 2 = 1$. The proposed $5 \\times 5 \\times 5$ stencil is both unnecessary and nonsensical in this context.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

The problem provides a model for this error based on a set of physically justified approximations.\n\nThe pressure bias $\\Delta P$ is defined as the contribution from particle pairs that enter the force cutoff radius $r_c$ during the $k$ timesteps but are not included in force calculations because the neighbor list is stale. This corresponds to the integral of the virial over a \"missed\" spherical shell. The formula provided is:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} \\, \\rho^2 \\int_{r_a}^{r_c} r^3 f(r) \\, dr\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the number density, $f(r)$ is the magnitude of the Lennard-Jones pair force, and the integration bounds are determined by the geometry of the missed interactions.\n\nThe key steps in the calculation for each test case, specified by the parameters $(\\rho, T, r_c, \\delta, dt, k)$, are as follows:\n\n$1$. Compute the maximum single-particle displacement, $s_{\\max}$. The model assumes ballistic motion, where the maximum speed is approximated by the root-mean-square speed, $v_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. In the given reduced units ($k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$, $m=1$), this is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{3 T}\n$$\nThe maximum displacement over $k$ timesteps of duration $dt$ is then:\n$$\ns_{\\max} = v_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\cdot k \\cdot dt\n$$\n\n$2$. Compute the thickness of the missed shell, $s_{\\mathrm{miss}}$. A Verlet list is built with a skin of thickness $\\delta$, extending the search radius to $r_{\\mathrm{list}} = r_c + \\delta$. The list is considered safe as long as any single particle does not move more than $\\delta/2$. If two particles move directly towards each other, their relative displacement can be up to $2 s_{\\max}$. The region of pairs that may have been missed is a shell of thickness $2 s_{\\max} - \\delta$ just inside $r_{\\mathrm{list}}$. We are interested in those that cross into the interaction range $r < r_c$. The thickness of this missed region, adjacent to $r_c$, is therefore:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{miss}} = \\max\\{ 0, 2 s_{\\max} - \\delta \\}\n$$\nIf $s_{\\mathrm{miss}} = 0$, no pairs are missed, and the pressure bias $\\Delta P = 0$.\n\n$3$. Determine the integration limits. If $s_{\\mathrm{miss}} > 0$, we must evaluate the pressure integral. The upper limit is $r_c$. The lower limit, $r_a$, is the inner boundary of the missed shell, $r_c - s_{\\mathrm{miss}}$. However, an additional constraint is imposed to avoid the unphysical divergence of the force at very small separations. The lower limit is clipped at the Lennard-Jones potential minimum, $r_{\\min} = 2^{1/6} \\sigma$. In reduced units where $\\sigma=1$, $r_{\\min} = 2^{1/6}$. Thus, the lower integration bound is:\n$$\nr_a = \\max\\{ r_c - s_{\\mathrm{miss}}, 2^{1/6} \\}\n$$\n\n$4$. Evaluate the integral. The integrand involves the Lennard-Jones force, $f(r) = 24 \\left[ 2 r^{-13} - r^{-7} \\right]$. The term to integrate is $r^3 f(r)$:\n$$\nr^3 f(r) = r^3 \\cdot 24 \\left( 2r^{-13} - r^{-7} \\right) = 48r^{-10} - 24r^{-4}\n$$\nThe definite integral can be found analytically. Let $I(r_a, r_c) = \\int_{r_a}^{r_c} (48r^{-10} - 24r^{-4}) \\, dr$. The antiderivative is:\n$$\n\\int (48r^{-10} - 24r^{-4}) \\, dr = 48 \\frac{r^{-9}}{-9} - 24 \\frac{r^{-3}}{-3} + C = -\\frac{16}{3}r^{-9} + 8r^{-3} + C\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $r_a$ to $r_c$:\n$$\nI(r_a, r_c) = \\left[ 8r^{-3} - \\frac{16}{3}r^{-9} \\right]_{r_a}^{r_c} = \\left( 8r_c^{-3} - \\frac{16}{3}r_c^{-9} \\right) - \\left( 8r_a^{-3} - \\frac{16}{3}r_a^{-9} \\right)\n$$\n\n$5$. Calculate the final pressure bias, $\\Delta P$. By substituting the value of the integral back into the expression for $\\Delta P$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} \\rho^2 \\cdot I(r_a, r_c)\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each test case. The model assumes $g(r) \\approx 1$ in the missed shell, which is a reasonable approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of the error. The force is attractive for $r > 2^{1/6}$, so $f(r) < 0$. We therefore expect the missed contribution $\\Delta P$ to be negative, indicating that the computed pressure is artificially high.\n\nFor Case $1$: $(\\rho, T, r_c, \\delta, dt, k) = (0.8, 1.0, 2.5, 0.3, 0.001, 50)$.\n$v_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 1.0} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$s_{\\max} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 50 \\cdot 0.001 = 0.05\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.0866$.\n$2s_{\\max} \\approx 0.1732$, which is less than $\\delta = 0.3$.\nThus, $s_{\\mathrm{miss}} = 0$ and $\\Delta P = 0$.\n\nFor Case $4$: $(\\rho, T, r_c, \\delta, dt, k) = (0.8, 1.0, 2.5, 0.2, 0.002309401076758503, 25)$.\nThe timestep $dt$ is specifically chosen such that $2 s_{\\max} = \\delta$.\n$v_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$s_{\\max} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 25 \\cdot \\frac{0.2}{2 \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 25} = 0.1$.\n$2s_{\\max} = 0.2 = \\delta$.\nTherefore, $s_{\\mathrm{miss}} = \\max\\{0, 0.2 - 0.2\\} = 0$, and $\\Delta P = 0$.\n\nFor the other cases where $s_{\\mathrm{miss}} > 0$, the full integral calculation is performed as outlined above. The final implementation will execute these steps for all provided test cases and format the results as requested.",
