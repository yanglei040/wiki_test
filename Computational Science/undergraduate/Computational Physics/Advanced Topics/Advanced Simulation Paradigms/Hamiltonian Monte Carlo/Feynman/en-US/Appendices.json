Your implementation must be based on the following foundational facts.\n\n1. Hamiltonian dynamics: Introduce auxiliary momentum $p$ with a symmetric positive-definite mass matrix $M$ for position $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. Define the potential energy $U(q) = -\\log \\pi(q)$ up to an additive constant and the kinetic energy $K(p) = \\tfrac{1}{2} p^\\top M^{-1} p$. The Hamiltonian is $H(q,p) = U(q) + K(p)$.

Symplectic integration: To numerically integrate Hamilton's equations, use a symplectic, time-reversible method of your choice compatible with the equations above. The method must be second-order accurate and should only require evaluations of $\\nabla U(q)$ and matrix-vector products with $M^{-1}$.\n\n3. Metropolis correction: To correct for discretization error, given a proposal $(q', p')$ obtained by numerically integrating the dynamics for a time interval $\\tau$, accept the proposal with probability\n$$\n\\alpha = \\min\\left(1, \\exp\\big(-H(q', p') + H(q, p)\\big)\\right).\n$$\nIf rejected, keep the current state $q$.\n\n4. Momentum resampling: At each iteration, sample $p$ independently from the Gaussian with density proportional to $\\exp\\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2} p^\\top M^{-1} p\\right)$.\n\nYour task is to implement:\n\n- A general HMC sampler that takes as arguments the potential $U(q)$, its gradient $\\nabla U(q)$, a diagonal mass matrix $M = \\mathrm{diag}(m_1, \\dots, m_d)$, a step size $\\epsilon$, a number of integration steps $L$, a number of iterations $N$, a burn-in $B$, and an initial position $q_0$.\n\n- Two gradient providers for $\\nabla U(q)$:\n  1) An analytic gradient computed by hand from the definitions of the specified $U(q)$, and\n  2) A forward-mode automatic differentiation engine implemented within your program, using dual numbers with a derivative vector of length $d$ propagated through elementary scalar operations. Your automatic differentiation engine should return both the scalar value $U(q)$ and the gradient $\\nabla U(q)$ for vector inputs $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ in a single forward pass.\n\nTarget distributions and potentials:\n\n- Case A (correlated Gaussian in $\\mathbb{R}^2$): Let the target be a correlated Gaussian with mean $\\mu = (1.0, -1.0)$ and covariance\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.0  0.8\\\\\n0.8  2.0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nLet\n$$\nU(q) = \\tfrac{1}{2} (q - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (q - \\mu),\n$$\nso that $\\pi(q) \\propto \\exp\\big(-U(q)\\big)$. Provide the analytic gradient $\\nabla U(q) = \\Sigma^{-1} (q - \\mu)$.\n\n- Case B (same correlated Gaussian but deliberately mis-tuned integrator): Use the same $U(q)$ and analytic gradient as in Case A, but with an intentionally large step size to probe the acceptance behavior of HMC.\n\n- Case C (Rosenbrock-type potential in $\\mathbb{R}^2$): Let $q = (x,y)$ and\n$$\nU(q) = \\frac{(1 - x)^2 + 100 (y - x^2)^2}{20}.\n$$\nSupply its analytic gradient derived from first principles. Note that this target is unnormalized but valid for HMC since only $U(q)$ differences are used.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n\n- The symplectic integrator must be consistent with the Hamiltonian system above and must use only evaluations of $\\nabla U(q)$ and multiplications by $M^{-1}$.\n\n- The automatic differentiation engine must implement forward-mode dual numbers with derivative vectors and support scalar arithmetic operations needed by the potentials above (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer powers), producing the full gradient $\\nabla U(q)$ for vector input $q$.\n\n- Randomness must be reproducible: use a fixed random seed for each case so that results are deterministic.

            "solution": "The task is to construct and implement a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler from first principles. This requires a synthesis of concepts from classical mechanics, numerical integration, and statistical simulation. The validity of the problem statement is confirmed; it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of HMC is to augment the target variable $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, whose probability density is $\\pi(q)$, with an auxiliary momentum variable $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. This creates a synthetic physical system. The probability density over the joint space $(q, p)$ is defined as $\\pi(q, p) = \\pi(q) \\pi(p)$. We define a potential energy $U(q) = -\\log \\pi(q)$ and a kinetic energy $K(p)$. A standard choice for the kinetic energy, as specified, is $K(p) = \\frac{1}{2} p^\\top M^{-1} p$, where $M$ is a symmetric positive-definite \"mass\" matrix, typically diagonal. This corresponds to the momentum distribution being a zero-mean Gaussian, $p \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, M)$.\n\nThe total energy of this system is given by the Hamiltonian, $H(q, p) = U(q) + K(p)$. The evolution of the system in time is governed by Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = M^{-1} p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -\\nabla U(q)\n$$\nIn an ideal physical system, this evolution conserves the total energy $H(q,p)$ and is volume-preserving in the phase space $(q,p)$. HMC leverages this property. To generate a sample, we first draw a fresh momentum $p$ from its Gaussian distribution, then evolve the system $(q, p)$ for a fixed time $\\tau$ using a numerical integrator to obtain a proposal $(q', p')$. Due to numerical errors, $H(q', p')$ will not be exactly equal to $H(q, p)$, so a Metropolis-Hastings correction step is used to accept the proposal with probability $\\alpha = \\min(1, \\exp(-H(q', p') + H(q, p)))$. This ensures that the resulting Markov chain has the correct stationary distribution $\\pi(q)$.\n\nA crucial component is the numerical integrator. To maintain the desirable properties of the Hamiltonian dynamics as closely as possible, a symplectic, time-reversible integrator is required. The leapfrog (or Störmer-Verlet) method is the standard choice. It is a second-order method that updates position and momentum in an interleaved, or \"leapfrogging,\" manner. For a single step of size $\\epsilon$, the updates are:\n1.  A half-step for momentum: $p(t + \\epsilon/2) = p(t) - (\\epsilon/2) \\nabla U(q(t))$\n2.  A full-step for position: $q(t + \\epsilon) = q(t) + \\epsilon M^{-1} p(t + \\epsilon/2)$\n3.  A final half-step for momentum: $p(t + \\epsilon) = p(t + \\epsilon/2) - (\\epsilon/2) \\nabla U(q(t + \\epsilon))$\n\nThis sequence is repeated $L$ times to integrate for a total time $\\tau = L\\epsilon$. This method is time-reversible and symplectic, which leads to excellent long-term energy conservation and high acceptance rates in the HMC algorithm.\n\nThe HMC algorithm requires the gradient of the log-posterior, $\\nabla U(q)$. This can be provided analytically or computed numerically. We will implement both. For the latter, we use forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) with dual numbers. A dual number is an object of the form $z = (u, \\nabla u)$, where $u$ is the scalar value of a function and $\\nabla u \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is its gradient vector. Arithmetic operations are defined on these objects to propagate derivatives according to the rules of calculus:\n-   Addition: $(u, \\nabla u) + (v, \\nabla v) = (u+v, \\nabla u + \\nabla v)$\n-   Multiplication: $(u, \\nabla u) \\cdot (v, \\nabla v) = (uv, v \\nabla u + u \\nabla v)$\n-   Power Rule: $(u, \\nabla u)^n = (u^n, n u^{n-1} \\nabla u)$\n\nBy representing the input variables $q_i$ as dual numbers $(q_i, e_i)$, where $e_i$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector, and evaluating the function $U(q)$ using dual number arithmetic, the final result is a dual number $(U(q), \\nabla U(q))$. This provides both the function value and its complete gradient in a single forward pass, with machine precision.\n\nThe analytic gradients for the specified potential functions are as follows:\n-   For the Gaussian case, $U(q) = \\frac{1}{2} (q - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (q - \\mu)$, the gradient is $\\nabla U(q) = \\Sigma^{-1} (q - \\mu)$.\n-   For the Rosenbrock-type case, $U(x,y) = \\frac{1}{20}((1 - x)^2 + 100 (y - x^2)^2)$, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla U(q) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{10}(x - 1 - 200x(y - x^2)) \\\\ 10(y - x^2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe implementation will consist of a `DualNumber` class, a general `hmc_sampler` function, and specific functions for each potential and gradient source. The sampler will iteratively resample momentum, integrate the trajectory using the leapfrog method, and apply the Metropolis correction, collecting samples after a burn-in period to compute the required statistics.",

This final hands-on practice  tasks you with stress-testing an HMC implementation on a potential with a near-singularity, a scenario common in physical models like celestial mechanics or electrostatics. By analyzing metrics like acceptance rate and energy conservation error, you will gain practical insight into tuning HMC and diagnosing its behavior in numerically challenging situations.",

            "problem": "You are to design and implement a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to study the effect of a near-singular potential on numerical stability and acceptance behavior. Work in one spatial dimension with mass equal to $1$, and base your derivation strictly on Hamilton's equations and the Metropolis–Hastings rule, starting from first principles.\n\nConsider a regularized and confining version of the attractive Coulomb potential in one dimension. Define the potential energy as\n$$\nU(q;a) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}\\,q^2 - \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{q^2 + a^2}},\n$$\nwith $c = 1$. The parameter $a  0$ softens the singularity at $q=0$ while the quadratic term ensures normalizability of the target distribution. The target probability density is proportional to $\\exp\\!\\left(-U(q;a)\\right)$. Use the kinetic energy\n$$\nK(p) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} p^2,\n$$\nso that the Hamiltonian is $H(q,p) \\equiv U(q;a) + K(p)$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n- Derive a time-reversible, volume-preserving integrator for Hamilton's equations associated with $H(q,p)$, consistent with the properties required by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Base your construction on splitting principles that follow from Hamilton's equations and avoid any non-symplectic discretization.\n- Compute the force term by differentiating $U(q;a)$ with respect to $q$.\n- Implement a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo kernel that, given a current position $q$, draws a fresh momentum $p$ from the Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance, integrates the Hamiltonian dynamics for a given step size $\\epsilon$ and number of steps $L$, and then applies a Metropolis–Hastings accept/reject step using the exact Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ at the start and end of the trajectory.\n- For each proposal, record whether the numerical trajectory approached the softened singularity by tracking the minimum absolute value of $q$ visited along the discrete path and comparing it to a fixed threshold $\\delta$.\n- For each parameter set, after a fixed number $N$ of proposals, report three metrics: the acceptance rate, the mean absolute Hamiltonian error (the average of $\\lvert \\Delta H \\rvert$ over all proposals), and the fraction of proposals whose numerical trajectory had $\\min \\lvert q \\rvert  \\delta$.\n\nConstraints and fixed choices that must be used:\n- Use $c = 1$ and mass equal to $1$.\n- Use $N = 300$ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo proposals for each parameter set.\n- Use the threshold $\\delta = 10^{-2}$.\n- Use a fixed random number generator seed of $12345$ for reproducibility. If you choose to vary the seed across test cases, you must do so deterministically in a documented way that depends only on the test case index and the fixed base seed.\n- For numerical stability in the acceptance step, compare in log space by using the fact that the acceptance condition is equivalent to comparing $\\log u$ to $- \\Delta H$, where $u$ is drawn from the uniform distribution on $(0,1)$.\n- The initial position $q_0$ for each test case is specified in the test suite below. Always start the Markov chain at this $q_0$ and run for exactly $N$ proposals, without burn-in removal.\n\nTest suite of parameter values:\n- Case $1$: $\\epsilon = 0.05$, $L = 50$, $a = 0.1$, $q_0 = 1.0$.\n- Case $2$: $\\epsilon = 0.2$, $L = 50$, $a = 0.1$, $q_0 = 1.0$.\n- Case $3$: $\\epsilon = 0.05$, $L = 50$, $a = 0.001$, $q_0 = 0.1$.\n- Case $4$: $\\epsilon = 0.2$, $L = 50$, $a = 0.001$, $q_0 = 0.1$.\n\nDefinition of metrics:\n- Acceptance rate is the fraction of accepted proposals out of $N$, expressed as a decimal in $[0,1]$.\n- Mean absolute Hamiltonian error is the arithmetic mean over $N$ proposals of $\\lvert \\Delta H \\rvert$, where $\\Delta H \\equiv H(q^{\\star},p^{\\star}) - H(q,p)$ is the change in Hamiltonian between the end and start of the numerical trajectory, regardless of acceptance.\n- Near-singularity fraction is the fraction of proposals whose numerical trajectory satisfies $\\min \\lvert q \\rvert  \\delta$ for at least one discrete integration step.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each test case result must itself be a list of three decimals in the order $[$acceptance rate$, $mean absolute Hamiltonian error$, $near-singularity fraction$]$, rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places. For example, your program must print something of the form\n$$\n\\big[\\,[a_1,b_1,c_1],[a_2,b_2,c_2],[a_3,b_3,c_3],[a_4,b_4,c_4]\\,\\big],\n$$\nwhere each $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ is a decimal rounded to $6$ places.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of computational physics, containing all necessary information for a unique, deterministic solution. I shall proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe primary task is to construct a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler for a particle of unit mass ($m=1$) in one dimension, governed by a specific potential energy function. The objective is to analyze the sampler's performance under varying parameters that control the numerical integration step size and the proximity to a potential singularity.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ of the system is the sum of kinetic energy $K(p)$ and potential energy $U(q;a)$:\n$$\nH(q,p) = K(p) + U(q;a)\n$$\nGiven $m=1$, the kinetic energy is:\n$$\nK(p) = \\frac{1}{2} p^2\n$$\nThe potential energy is given as:\n$$\nU(q;a) = \\frac{1}{2}q^2 - \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{q^2 + a^2}}\n$$\nwith the constant $c=1$. The parameter $a  0$ regularizes the attractive Coulomb-like term, preventing a true singularity at $q=0$. The quadratic term $\\frac{1}{2}q^2$ ensures that the target probability density, $\\pi(q) \\propto \\exp(-U(q;a))$, is normalizable.\n\nHamilton's equations of motion, which describe the evolution of the system in phase space $(q,p)$, are:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q}\n$$\nThe term $-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q}$ is the force, $F(q)$. We compute this derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}q^2 - (q^2 + a^2)^{-1/2}\\right) = q - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(q^2 + a^2)^{-3/2}(2q) = q + \\frac{q}{(q^2 + a^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nTherefore, the force is:\n$$\nF(q;a) = -q - \\frac{q}{(q^2 + a^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\n\nTo simulate these dynamics numerically, a symplectic integrator is required. The leapfrog (or Störmer-Verlet) method is a standard choice as it is both time-reversible and volume-preserving, properties which are essential for the correctness of the HMC algorithm. The method is derived from a second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution operator, which splits the evolution into a sequence of steps under the kinetic and potential parts of the Hamiltonian. A single leapfrog step of size $\\epsilon$ updates the position $q$ and momentum $p$ as follows:\n$1$. A half-step update for the momentum:\n$$\np(t + \\epsilon/2) = p(t) + F(q(t);a) \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\n$$\n$2$. A full-step update for the position:\n$$\nq(t + \\epsilon) = q(t) + p(t + \\epsilon/2) \\cdot \\epsilon\n$$\n$3$. A second half-step update for the momentum:\n$$\np(t + \\epsilon) = p(t + \\epsilon/2) + F(q(t+\\epsilon);a) \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\n$$\nTo generate a trajectory of length $L\\epsilon$, this process is iterated $L$ times. For computational efficiency, the full momentum updates from adjacent steps are combined.\n\nThe HMC algorithm proceeds as follows for each proposal, starting from a given position $q_{current}$:\n$1$. **Momentum Sampling**: A new momentum $p_{current}$ is drawn from its conditional distribution, which is a standard Gaussian since $K(p) = p^2/2$, i.e., $p_{current} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$2$. **Trajectory Integration**: Starting from $(q_{current}, p_{current})$, the system is evolved for $L$ leapfrog steps with step size $\\epsilon$. This produces a proposal state $(q_{proposal}, p_{proposal})$. During this integration, we must track the minimum absolute value of the position, $\\min_i |q_i|$, along the discrete path $q_0, q_1, \\ldots, q_L$.\n$3$. **Metropolis-Hastings Acceptance**: The proposal is accepted or rejected based on the change in the Hamiltonian, $\\Delta H = H(q_{proposal}, p_{proposal}) - H(q_{current}, p_{current})$. The acceptance probability is $\\alpha = \\min(1, \\exp(-\\Delta H))$. This simple form is valid because the leapfrog integrator is volume-preserving and time-reversible. The time-reversibility property implies that if one were to start from $(q_{proposal}, -p_{proposal})$ and integrate backward in time, one would recover $(q_{current}, -p_{current})$, making the proposal symmetric in the appropriate sense. A random variate $u \\sim U(0,1)$ is drawn, and the proposal is accepted if $u  \\exp(-\\Delta H)$, or equivalently, $\\log u  -\\Delta H$. If accepted, the new state is $q_{proposal}$; otherwise, the state remains $q_{current}$.\n\nFor each of the $N=300$ proposals per test case, we will record three quantities: ($1$) whether the proposal was accepted, ($2$) the absolute Hamiltonian error $|\\Delta H|$, and ($3$) whether the trajectory's minimum absolute position fell below the threshold $\\delta = 10^{-2}$. The final reported metrics will be the averages of these quantities over all $N$ proposals. The implementation will use a fixed random seed for reproducibility as specified.",
