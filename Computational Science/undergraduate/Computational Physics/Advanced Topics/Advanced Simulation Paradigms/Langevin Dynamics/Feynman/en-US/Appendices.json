We will analytically solve for the time evolution of a particle that is first held in thermal equilibrium by a harmonic trap and then suddenly released. This exercise is valuable because it sharpens your ability to calculate statistical moments and demonstrates a key principle: the final uncertainty in the particle's position is a simple sum of its initial thermal uncertainty and the additional uncertainty gained from free diffusion over time .",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. All parameters and conditions are precisely defined, allowing for a rigorous analytical solution. It is a standard problem in the field of statistical physics concerning Langevin dynamics. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the ensemble second moment $M(t_{\\mathrm{f}})\\equiv \\mathbb{E}[x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})^2]$ for a particle undergoing overdamped Langevin motion. The procedure involves two steps: first, determining the initial second moment $\\mathbb{E}[x(0)^2]$ from the equilibrium condition at times $t<0$; second, evolving this moment in time for $t\\ge 0$ using the given Langevin equation for a free particle.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Second Moment at $t=0$**\n\nFor time $t<0$, the particle is in a harmonic potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ and is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature $T$. The probability distribution of the particle's position $x$ is given by the canonical Boltzmann distribution. With the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$, the probability density function is:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-U(x)/T} = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-kx^2/(2T)}\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is the partition function ensuring normalization. This is a Gaussian distribution with zero mean, $\\mathbb{E}[x]=0$. The variance of this distribution, $\\sigma^2_x = \\mathbb{E}[x^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[x])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[x^2]$, is found by comparing the exponent to the standard form of a Gaussian, $e^{-x^2/(2\\sigma^2_x)}$:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2_x} = \\frac{kx^2}{2T} \\implies \\sigma^2_x = \\frac{T}{k}\n$$\nTherefore, the initial second moment at the moment the trap is released, $t=0$, is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[x(0)^2] = \\frac{T}{k}\n$$\nThis result is also a direct consequence of the equipartition theorem, which states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ to the average energy. For the potential energy $\\mathbb{E}[U(x)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{1}{2}kx^2] = \\frac{1}{2}k\\mathbb{E}[x^2]$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}k\\mathbb{E}[x(0)^2] = \\frac{1}{2}T \\implies \\mathbb{E}[x(0)^2] = \\frac{T}{k}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Time Evolution for $t\\ge 0$**\n\nFor $t\\ge 0$, the potential is removed, $U(x, t\\ge 0)=0$. The Langevin equation simplifies to describe a free overdamped particle (free Brownian motion):\n$$\n\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sqrt{2\\gamma T}\\,\\eta(t)\n$$\nAs the problem correctly notes, the Itô and Stratonovich interpretations of this stochastic differential equation are equivalent because the noise coefficient, $\\sqrt{2\\gamma T}$, is a constant. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\ndx = \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}}\\,\\eta(t)\\,dt\n$$\nWe formally integrate this equation from $t=0$ to a final time $t_{\\mathrm{f}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}}\\,\\eta(t')\\,dt'\n$$\n$$\nx(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) - x(0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt'\n$$\nThe position at time $t_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is thus:\n$$\nx(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) = x(0) + \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt'\n$$\nWe now compute the ensemble second moment, $M(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) = \\mathbb{E}[x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})^2]$, by squaring the expression for $x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})$ and taking the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( x(0) + \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt' \\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nExpanding the square yields three terms:\n$$\nM(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) = \\mathbbE}[x(0)^2] \\;+\\; 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ x(0) \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt' \\right] \\;+\\; \\frac{2T}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt' \\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nLet us evaluate each term.\n1.  The first term is the initial second moment, which we found to be $\\mathbb{E}[x(0)^2] = \\frac{T}{k}$.\n2.  The second term is the cross-term. The initial position $x(0)$ is determined by the system's evolution for $t<0$. The white noise $\\eta(t')$ for $t' > 0$ is causally independent of the state at $t=0$. Therefore, $x(0)$ and $\\eta(t')$ are uncorrelated. We can separate the expectation:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[ x(0) \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt' \\right] = \\mathbb{E}[x(0)] \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\mathbb{E}[\\eta(t')]\\,dt'\n    $$\n    Since the noise has zero mean, $\\mathbb{E}[\\eta(t')] = 0$, this entire term is zero.\n3.  The third term represents the mean squared displacement due to free diffusion. We use the property $\\mathbb{E}[\\eta(t')\\eta(t'')] = \\delta(t'-t'')$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\eta(t')\\,dt' \\right)^2 \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt' \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt''\\, \\eta(t')\\eta(t'') \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt' \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt''\\, \\mathbb{E}[\\eta(t')\\eta(t'')] = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt' \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}}dt''\\, \\delta(t'-t'')\n    $$\n    The inner integral over $t''$ evaluates to $1$ for $0 \\le t' \\le t_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n    $$\n    = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} 1 \\cdot dt' = t_{\\mathrm{f}}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the third term is $\\frac{2T}{\\gamma} t_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the final expression for the second moment at time $t_{\\mathrm{f}}$:\n$$\nM(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) = \\mathbb{E}[x(t_{\\mathrm{f}})^2] = \\frac{T}{k} + 0 + \\frac{2Tt_{\\mathrm{f}}}{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nM(t_{\\mathrm{f}}) = T \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{2t_{\\mathrm{f}}}{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nThis formula shows that the final variance is the sum of the initial variance from the harmonic confinement and the variance accumulated from free diffusion over the time interval $[0, t_{\\mathrm{f}}]$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. It describes a standard problem in statistical physics, the overdamped Langevin dynamics of a particle in a potential, which can be analyzed with established theoretical and numerical methods. All parameters and procedures are specified without ambiguity. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured according to the six tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n1. Derivation of the Overdamped Langevin Equation\n\nWe begin with Newton's second law for a particle of mass $m$ in one dimension $x$, subject to a potential force $F_{\\mathrm{pot}}(x)$, a viscous drag force $F_{\\mathrm{fric}}$, and a stochastic thermal force $\\eta(t)$:\n$$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F_{\\mathrm{pot}}(x) + F_{\\mathrm{fric}} + \\eta(t)$$\nThe potential force is conservative, $F_{\\mathrm{pot}}(x) = -V'(x)$. The viscous drag is proportional to the velocity, $F_{\\mathrm{fric}} = -\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt}$, where $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient. The equation of motion is the full Langevin equation:\n$$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -V'(x) - \\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\eta(t)$$\nThe overdamped limit considers motion where frictional forces dominate inertial forces, which is equivalent to taking the limit $m \\to 0$. This is physically justified for motion in a highly viscous medium or on time scales much longer than the momentum relaxation time, $\\tau_p = m/\\gamma$. In this limit, the inertial term $m\\ddot{x}$ is neglected:\n$$0 \\approx -V'(x) - \\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\eta(t)$$\nRearranging yields the overdamped Langevin equation:\n$$\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} = -V'(x) + \\eta(t)$$\nThe stochastic force $\\eta(t)$ represents thermal fluctuations from the heat bath at temperature $T$. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem dictates its statistical properties: it is a Gaussian white noise process with zero mean and a correlation function given by:\n$$\\langle \\eta(t) \\rangle = 0$$\n$$\\langle \\eta(t)\\eta(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\delta(t-t')$$\nGiven the problem states $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$, the correlation is $\\langle \\eta(t)\\eta(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma T \\delta(t-t')$.\n\nTo write the equation in the standard Itô form $dx = \\mu(x)\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$, we divide by $\\gamma$:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma}V'(x) + \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\eta(t)$$\nThis corresponds to an Itô stochastic differential equation where $dW_t = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\eta}}\\eta(t) dt$, with $\\langle dW_t dW_{t'} \\rangle = \\delta(t-t') dt^2$? No, this is incorrect reasoning. We define the Wiener process $W_t$ such that its formal time derivative is Gaussian white noise, $\\frac{dW_t}{dt}$, satisfying $\\langle \\frac{dW_t}{dt} \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\frac{dW_t}{dt} \\frac{dW_{t'}}{dt'} \\rangle = \\delta(t-t')$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\eta(t)$ in the equation for $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ must be identified with $\\sigma \\frac{dW_t}{dt}$. The variance of this term must match.\nThe correlation of the noise term $\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\eta(t)$ is:\n$$\\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\eta(t)\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\eta(t')\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}\\langle \\eta(t)\\eta(t') \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} (2\\gamma T \\delta(t-t')) = \\frac{2T}{\\gamma}\\delta(t-t')$$\nComparing this to the correlation of the stochastic term in the Itô SDE, $\\langle (\\sigma \\frac{dW_t}{dt})(\\sigma \\frac{dW_{t'}}{dt'}) \\rangle = \\sigma^2 \\delta(t-t')$, we identify:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{2T}{\\gamma} \\implies \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}}$$\nThe deterministic part of the equation gives the drift term:\n$$\\mu(x) = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma}V'(x)$$\nFor the given potential $V(x)=a \\ln(1+(x/x_0)^2)$, the derivative is:\n$$V'(x) = a \\frac{1}{1+(x/x_0)^2} \\cdot \\frac{2x}{x_0^2} = \\frac{2ax}{x_0^2+x^2}$$\nThus, the drift and diffusion coefficients are:\n$$\\mu(x) = -\\frac{2ax}{\\gamma(x_0^2+x^2)}, \\quad \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}}$$\nThe diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ is independent of position $x$.\n\n2. Fokker-Planck Equation and Stationary Distribution\n\nThe time evolution of the probability density function $p(x,t)$ for a process described by $dx = \\mu(x)\\,dt + \\sigma(x)\\,dW_t$ is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [\\mu(x)p(x,t)] + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [\\sigma^2(x)p(x,t)]$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\mu(x)$ and constant $\\sigma$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}V'(x)p\\right] + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left[\\frac{2T}{\\gamma}p\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[V'(x)p\\right] + \\frac{T}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\partial^2p}{\\partial x^2}$$\nA stationary distribution $p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$ is defined by the condition $\\frac{\\partial p_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial t}=0$.\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[V'(x)p_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\right] + \\frac{T}{\\gamma}\\frac{d^2p_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dx^2} \\implies \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[V'(x)p_{\\mathrm{eq}} + T\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dx}\\right] = 0$$\nThe term in brackets is the probability current, which must be zero everywhere for a stationary state in a confining potential.\n$$V'(x)p_{\\mathrm{eq}} + T\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{p_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dx} = -\\frac{V'(x)}{T}$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ yields $\\ln(p_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = -V(x)/T + C$, where $C$ is an integration constant.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) = \\exp(C) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(x)}{T}\\right)$$\nWith $\\beta=1/T$, this is the Boltzmann distribution, $p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta V(x))$, as required.\nSubstituting the potential $V(x)=a \\ln(1+(x/x_0)^2)$ and defining $\\nu = \\beta a$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\beta a \\ln(1+(x/x_0)^2)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\nu \\ln(1+(x/x_0)^2)\\right) = \\left(1+(x/x_0)^2\\right)^{-\\nu}$$\nThe unnormalized density is $p_{\\mathrm{unnorm}}(x) = (1+(x/x_0)^2)^{-\\nu}$.\nFor this distribution to be normalizable, the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1+(x/x_0)^2)^{-\\nu} dx$ must converge. For large $|x|$, the integrand behaves as $( (x/x_0)^2 )^{-\\nu} \\propto |x|^{-2\\nu}$. The integral $\\int^{\\infty} |x|^{-p} dx$ converges if and only if $p>1$. Here, $p=2\\nu$, so the condition for normalizability is $2\\nu>1$, or $\\nu > 1/2$.\n\n3. Normalization Constant\n\nWe must evaluate the normalization constant $Z(\\nu, x_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1+(x/x_0)^2)^{-\\nu} dx$ for $\\nu > 1/2$. We perform a change of variables $u=x/x_0$, so $dx = x_0 du$:\n$$Z(\\nu, x_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1+u^2)^{-\\nu} x_0 du = x_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1+u^2)^{-\\nu} du$$\nSince the integrand is an even function of $u$, we can write:\n$$Z(\\nu, x_0) = 2x_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1+u^2)^{-\\nu} du$$\nThis integral is a standard form related to the Beta function, which has the representation $B(z_1, z_2) = 2\\int_0^{\\pi/2}(\\sin\\theta)^{2z_1-1}(\\cos\\theta)^{2z_2-1}d\\theta$. Alternatively, a more direct relation uses the representation $B(z_1, z_2) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z_1-1}}{(1+t)^{z_1+z_2}} dt$.\nLet $u^2=t$, then $u=\\sqrt{t}$ and $du = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{t}}dt$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1+u^2)^{-\\nu} du = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1+t)^{-\\nu} \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{t}}dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-1/2}}{(1+t)^{\\nu}} dt$$\nComparing this with the Beta function integral, we set $z_1-1 = -1/2 \\implies z_1=1/2$, and $z_1+z_2=\\nu \\implies 1/2+z_2=\\nu \\implies z_2=\\nu-1/2$.\nThe integral is thus $\\frac{1}{2}B(1/2, \\nu-1/2)$. Using the relation $B(z_1, z_2) = \\frac{\\Gamma(z_1)\\Gamma(z_2)}{\\Gamma(z_1+z_2)}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1+u^2)^{-\\nu} du = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/2)\\Gamma(\\nu-1/2)}{\\Gamma(1/2+\\nu-1/2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/2)\\Gamma(\\nu-1/2)}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}$$\nSince $\\Gamma(1/2)=\\sqrt{\\pi}$, the normalization constant is:\n$$Z(\\nu, x_0) = 2x_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\Gamma(\\nu-1/2)}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}\\right) = x_0\\sqrt{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(\\nu-1/2)}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}$$\n\n4. Simulation Protocol\n\nThe overdamped Langevin equation is discretized using the Euler-Maruyama scheme with time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n + \\mu(x_n)\\Delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,\\xi_n$$\nwhere $\\xi_n$ are independent random variables drawn from a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$. The parameters are specified as:\n- Time step: $\\Delta t = 0.005\\,\\frac{\\gamma x_0^2}{a}$\n- Number of particles: $N_{\\mathrm{p}}=5000$\n- Number of steps: $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}=3000$\n- Burn-in steps: $N_{\\mathrm{burn}}=500$\n- Initial condition: All $N_{\\mathrm{p}}$ particles start at $x_i(0)=0$.\nThe simulation proceeds by initializing a vector of $N_{\\mathrm{p}}$ particle positions to zero. Then, for each of the $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$, the positions are updated in parallel according to the discretized equation. Samples of particle positions $x_i(t_n)$ are collected for all time steps $n$ such that $n \\ge N_{\\mathrm{burn}}$.\n\n5. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe exact probability of finding the particle in the interval $[-w/2, w/2]$ with $w=0.5x_0$ is given by integrating the normalized stationary distribution $p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\nu,x_0)}p_{\\mathrm{unnorm}}(x)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} p_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) dx = \\frac{1}{Z(\\nu,x_0)} \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\right)^2\\right)^{-\\nu} dx$$\nThis integral is computed using high-precision numerical quadrature.\n\nThe empirical probability, $P_{\\mathrm{emp}}$, is estimated from the simulation. After discarding the burn-in phase, we have a total of $N_{\\mathrm{samples}} = N_{\\mathrm{p}} \\times (N_{\\mathrm{steps}}-N_{\\mathrm{burn}})$ position samples. $P_{\\mathrm{emp}}$ is the fraction of these samples that fall within the interval $[-w/2, w/2]$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{emp}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of samples in } [-w/2, w/2]}{N_{\\mathrm{samples}}}$$\n\n6. Relative Error\n\nFor each test case, the relative error $\\varepsilon$ between the empirical and exact probabilities is calculated as:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{|P_{\\mathrm{emp}}-P_{\\mathrm{exact}}|}{P_{\\mathrm{exact}}}$$\nThis quantity is computed for the three specified parameter sets. The final implementation will execute these steps for each case and report the resulting errors.",

You will then implement a sophisticated symmetric integrator designed to handle such complexities and validate your simulation by testing a fundamental principle of statistical mechanics—the equipartition theorem .

            "problem": "A single point particle moves in one spatial dimension in contact with a thermal reservoir at fixed temperature. The particle’s inertial mass depends on position, which is physically motivated by accretion as the particle traverses a medium. Starting only from Newton’s second law, the Lagrangian formulation for a one-dimensional particle with position-dependent mass, the definition of momentum, and the fluctuation–dissipation principle for a linear drag in a thermal bath, derive a correct underdamped Langevin dynamics model for the particle and implement a numerically stable and physically consistent time-stepping algorithm.\n\nYou must adhere to the following requirements.\n\n1) Physical model and fundamental starting point:\n- Begin with the Lagrangian $L = \\tfrac{1}{2} m(x) \\, v^{2} - U(x)$, where $x$ is the position, $v = dx/dt$ is the velocity, and $U(x)$ is a smooth potential energy.\n- Extend the conservative equations of motion to include an isothermal linear drag force $- \\gamma \\, v$ from a heat bath at absolute temperature $T$, together with a zero-mean Gaussian white noise force with delta correlation, such that the fluctuation–dissipation principle holds.\n- Use the canonical momentum definition $p = \\partial L / \\partial v$ as your fundamental variable to handle the stochastic forcing in a way that is additive in the momentum update when the position is held fixed.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of an underdamped Langevin dynamics integrator for a particle with position-dependent mass. The derivation must start from first principles—the Lagrangian formulation and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Equations of Motion**\n\nWe begin with the provided Lagrangian for a one-dimensional particle with position-dependent mass $m(x)$ in a potential $U(x)$:\n$$\nL(x, v) = \\frac{1}{2} m(x) v^2 - U(x)\n$$\nwhere $v = dx/dt$ is the velocity. The canonical momentum $p$ is defined as:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v} = m(x)v\n$$\nThe conservative equation of motion is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nCalculating the spatial derivative of the Lagrangian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dm}{dx} v^2 - \\frac{dU}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives the rate of change of momentum:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dm}{dx} v^2 - \\frac{dU}{dx}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dm}{dx}v^2$ is an effective force arising from the changing inertia of the particle. Expressing velocity as $v = p/m(x)$, this force becomes dependent on both position and momentum.\n\nTo model the interaction with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$, we introduce a linear drag force, $F_{\\text{drag}} = -\\gamma v$, and a stochastic thermal force, $\\xi(t)$. The complete equation of motion for the momentum is the sum of all forces:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dm}{dx} v^2 - \\frac{dU}{dx}\\right) - \\gamma v + \\xi(t)\n$$\nSubstituting $v=p/m(x)$, we obtain the system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in phase space $(x, p)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{p}{m(x)} \\\\\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = - \\frac{dU}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dm}{dx} \\left(\\frac{p}{m(x)}\\right)^2 - \\frac{\\gamma}{m(x)}p + \\xi(t)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe thermal noise $\\xi(t)$ is a zero-mean Gaussian white noise process, $\\langle \\xi(t) \\rangle = 0$. The fluctuation-dissipation principle dictates its correlation, relating the noise strength to the dissipation (drag) and temperature:\n$$\n\\langle \\xi(t) \\xi(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\delta(t-t')\n$$\nWith the given convention $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$, this simplifies to $\\langle \\xi(t) \\xi(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma T \\delta(t-t')$.\n\n**2. Numerical Integration Scheme**\n\nTo integrate these SDEs, we use a symmetric splitting method, which ensures numerical stability, time-reversibility of the conservative part, and correct sampling of the equilibrium distribution for long simulations. A suitable choice is the \"BAOAB\" integrator, which splits the time-evolution operator into three parts:\n- **Part B (Force):** Momentum update due to conservative and mass-dependent forces. $\\dot{p} = -U'(x) + \\frac{p^2 m'(x)}{2m(x)^2}$.\n- **Part A (Drift):** Position update. $\\dot{x} = p/m(x)$.\n- **Part O (Thermostat):** Momentum update due to drag and noise. $dp = -\\frac{\\gamma p}{m(x)}dt + \\sqrt{2\\gamma T}dW_t$, where $dW_t$ is a Wiener process increment.\n\nThe O-step represents an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process for the momentum, assuming position $x$ is fixed. This subproblem can be solved exactly over a time step $\\Delta t$, as requested by the problem statement. The solution is:\n$$\np(t+\\Delta t) = p(t) e^{-\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta t}{m(x)}} + \\sqrt{m(x)T \\left(1 - e^{-2\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta t}{m(x)}}\\right)} R\n$$\nwhere $R$ is a standard normal random number, $R \\sim N(0,1)$.\n\nThe BAOAB algorithm composes these steps symmetrically for a single time step $\\Delta t$, evolving the system from $(x_n, p_n)$ to $(x_{n+1}, p_{n+1})$:\n\n1.  **B-step ($\\Delta t/2$):** Update momentum with the force term for a half time step.\n    $p^{(1)} = p_n + \\left[-U'(x_n) + \\frac{p_n^2 m'(x_n)}{2m(x_n)^2}\\right] \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n2.  **A-step ($\\Delta t/2$):** Update position using the new momentum for a half time step.\n    $x^{(1)} = x_n + \\frac{p^{(1)}}{m(x_n)} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n3.  **O-step ($\\Delta t$):** Apply the exact OU update to the momentum at the midpoint position $x^{(1)}$ for a full time step.\n    $p^{(2)} = p^{(1)} e^{-\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta t}{m(x^{(1)})}} + \\sqrt{m(x^{(1)})T \\left(1 - e^{-2\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta t}{m(x^{(1)})}}\\right)} R_n$\n4.  **A-step ($\\Delta t/2$):** Update position for another half time step to reach the final position.\n    $x_{n+1} = x^{(1)} + \\frac{p^{(2)}}{m(x^{(1)})} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n5.  **B-step ($\\Delta t/2$):** Update momentum with the force at the final state $(x_{n+1}, p^{(2)})$ for a half time step.\n    $p_{n+1} = p^{(2)} + \\left[-U'(x_{n+1}) + \\frac{(p^{(2)})^2 m'(x_{n+1})}{2m(x_{n+1})^2}\\right] \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n\nThis symmetric decomposition ensures the algorithm correctly samples the canonical phase-space distribution $P(x,p) \\propto \\exp(-H(x,p)/T)$, where $H(x,p) = p^2/(2m(x)) + U(x)$, which is essential for obtaining correct equilibrium averages.\n\n**3. Observables and Theoretical Checks**\n\nThe problem asks to compute two ratios: $R_k = \\langle m(x) v^2 \\rangle / T$ and $R_x = k \\langle x^2 \\rangle / T$.\n- **Kinetic Equipartition Ratio ($R_k$):** The kinetic energy is $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}m(x)v^2$. In some contexts, this is written as $p^2/(2m(x))$. The equipartition theorem states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributing to the energy has an average value of $T/2$. Here, the kinetic energy corresponds to a single quadratic degree of freedom in momentum. The average kinetic energy is $\\langle E_k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}T$. Thus, $\\langle m(x)v^2 \\rangle = T$. Therefore, we expect $R_k = \\langle m(x) v^2 \\rangle / T \\approx 1$ for all cases, which serves as a critical check of the thermostat's correctness.\n- **Configuration Ratio ($R_x$):** The equilibrium probability distribution for position $x$ is found by integrating the full phase-space distribution over momentum: $P(x) \\propto \\sqrt{m(x)} \\exp(-U(x)/T)$. For a constant mass ($\\alpha=0$), this reduces to the standard Boltzmann distribution $P(x) \\propto \\exp(-U(x)/T)$. For a harmonic potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, this leads to $\\langle x^2 \\rangle = T/k$ and thus $R_x = 1$. However, when mass is position-dependent ($\\alpha > 0$), the $\\sqrt{m(x)} = \\sqrt{m_0(1+\\alpha x^2)}$ factor gives additional weight to larger values of $|x|$, causing $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ to increase. Consequently, we expect to find $R_x > 1$ for Cases B and C, with the deviation increasing with $\\alpha$.\n\nThe implementation will simulate the dynamics using the BAOAB integrator and compute time averages of $m(x)v^2 = p^2/m(x)$ and $x^2$ over a long ergodic trajectory after an initial burn-in period to reach equilibrium.",
