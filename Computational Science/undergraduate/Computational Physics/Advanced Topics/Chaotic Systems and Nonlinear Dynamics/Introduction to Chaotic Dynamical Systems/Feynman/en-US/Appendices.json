For $r = 4$, this discrete-time dynamical system is known to exhibit chaotic behavior on the unit interval. The invariant density $p(x)$ of values visited by the iterates is given by $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}$ for $x \\in (0,1)$ and $p(x) = 0$ otherwise. For a given positive integer $B$, define a uniform partition of $[0,1]$ into $B$ bins with edges $0 = e_0 < e_1 < \\dots < e_B = 1$, where $e_k = \\frac{k}{B}$, and interpret the bins as half-open intervals $[e_k, e_{k+1})$ for $k = 0,1,\\dots,B-2$ and the last bin as $[e_{B-1}, e_B]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard computational exercise in the study of chaotic dynamical systems, specifically the ergodic properties of the logistic map. All definitions, parameters, and conditions required for a unique solution are provided without ambiguity or contradiction. We shall proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the $\\ell^1$ distance, denoted by $E$, between an empirically generated probability distribution and its theoretical counterpart for the logistic map. The logistic map is given by the recurrence relation:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)\n$$\nwith the parameter $r$ fixed at $r=4$. For each test case defined by a tuple $(N, M, B, x_0)$, where $N$ is the sample size, $M$ is the burn-in count, $B$ is the number of bins, and $x_0$ is the initial condition, we must perform the following steps.\n\nFirst, we must generate the empirical data. Starting with the initial condition $x_0 \\in (0,1)$, we iterate the map. The first $M$ iterates are discarded to allow the system's state to converge to the attractor, effectively removing transient effects from the initial condition. Subsequently, we generate and store $N$ iterates, forming the set $\\{x_{M+1}, x_{M+2}, \\dots, x_{M+N}\\}$.\n\nSecond, we construct the empirical probability vector, $\\mathbf{p}^{\\text{emp}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^B$. The interval $[0,1]$ is partitioned into $B$ uniform bins. The bin edges are $e_k = k/B$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, B\\}$. The $k$-th bin (for $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., B-1\\}$) is the interval $[e_k, e_{k+1})$. A special case is made for the rightmost boundary, such that the final bin is inclusive, $[e_{B-1}, e_B]$. We count the number of generated iterates, $c_k$, that fall into each bin $k$. The empirical probability for bin $k$ is then given by the fraction:\n$$\np^{\\text{emp}}_k = \\frac{c_k}{N}\n$$\n\nThird, we must determine the theoretical probability vector, $\\mathbf{p}^{\\text{th}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^B$. For the logistic map with $r=4$, the invariant probability density function for the iterates is known to be:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}\n$$\nfor $x \\in (0,1)$. The theoretical probability of an iterate falling into bin $k$ is the integral of this density function over the bin's interval:\n$$\np^{\\text{th}}_k = \\int_{e_k}^{e_{k+1}} p(x) \\,dx = \\int_{k/B}^{(k+1)/B} \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}} \\,dx\n$$\nThis integral can be evaluated analytically. Let $F(x)$ be the antiderivative of $p(x)$. We perform the substitution $x = \\sin^2(\\theta)$, for which $dx = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$. With this substitution, the indefinite integral becomes:\n$$\nF(x) = \\int \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{\\sin^2(\\theta)(1-\\sin^2(\\theta))}} (2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\,d\\theta) = \\int \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\,d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\theta + C\n$$\nSubstituting back $\\theta = \\arcsin(\\sqrt{x})$, we obtain the antiderivative:\n$$\nF(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arcsin(\\sqrt{x})\n$$\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, the theoretical probability for bin $k$ is:\n$$\np^{\\text{th}}_k = F(e_{k+1}) - F(e_k) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k+1}{B}}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{B}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nAll angles from the inverse sine function are in radians, as specified.\n\nFinally, we compute the required error metric $E$, which is the $\\ell^1$ distance between the two probability vectors:\n$$\nE = \\sum_{k=0}^{B-1} \\left| p^{\\text{emp}}_k - p^{\\text{th}}_k \\right|\n$$\nThis procedure is algorithmically implemented and applied to each of the four specified test cases.

            "problem": "Implement a complete, runnable program to explore the Mandelbrot set by testing for which complex parameters $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ the critical orbit of the complex quadratic map remains bounded. The complex quadratic map is defined by the iteration $z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n) = z_n^2 + c$, with the critical initial condition $z_0 = 0$. The Mandelbrot set is the set of all parameters $c$ such that the orbit $\\{z_n\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ is bounded.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- The iteration rule $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ defines a discrete-time dynamical system on $\\mathbb{C}$.\n- The modulus of a complex number $z$ is $|z| = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Re}(z)^2 + \\operatorname{Im}(z)^2}$.\n- If $|z_n|$ ever exceeds a fixed escape radius $R$ during the iteration, then the orbit diverges to infinity. For the quadratic family $z^2 + c$, it is a well-tested and standard fact that taking $R = 2$ suffices: if $|z_n| > 2$ for some $n$, then the orbit of $z$ diverges to infinity.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Implement a function that, for a given parameter $c$, iterates $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ starting from $z_0 = 0$, and returns a boolean indicating whether the orbit stays bounded, according to the following numerical criterion:\n   - Use the escape radius $R = 2$.\n   - Use a maximum number of iterations $N = 10000$.\n   - Declare the orbit as unbounded if there exists $n \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,N-1\\}$ such that $|z_n| > R$. Otherwise, declare it bounded.\n2. Apply your function to the test suite of parameters listed below and compute the boolean result for each parameter, where $\\mathrm{True}$ means “bounded within $N$ iterations” and $\\mathrm{False}$ means “escaped within $N$ iterations.”\n3.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the established mathematical theory of complex dynamical systems, is well-posed with a clear and complete set of definitions and constraints, and is expressed with objective, formal language. The task is to implement a standard algorithm for determining membership in the Mandelbrot set for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe problem revolves around the iteration of the complex quadratic map, defined as:\n$$\nz_{n+1} = f_c(z_n) = z_n^2 + c\n$$\nwhere $z_n$ and $c$ are complex numbers, $z, c \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This equation defines a discrete-time dynamical system for each parameter $c$.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set, denoted $\\mathcal{M}$, is the set of all parameters $c$ for which the orbit of the critical point $z_0 = 0$ remains bounded. The critical point is the point where the derivative of the map is zero, $f_c'(z) = 2z = 0$, which yields $z=0$. The behavior of this critical orbit, $\\{z_n\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ where $z_0=0$, is fundamental to the structure of the system.\n\nA key theorem in complex dynamics provides a practical criterion for boundedness. It states that if the modulus of any iterate, $|z_n|$, exceeds the value $2$, the orbit is guaranteed to diverge to infinity. Consequently, the orbit is bounded if and only if $|z_n| \\le 2$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nThis provides a basis for a numerical algorithm to test for membership in $\\mathcal{M}$. Since we cannot perform an infinite number of iterations, we use a finite-step approximation. For a given parameter $c$, we iterate the map starting from $z_0 = 0$ for a maximum of $N$ steps. If at any step $k < N$, the condition $|z_k| > R$ is met, where $R=2$ is the escape radius, we classify the orbit as unbounded and conclude that $c \\notin \\mathcal{M}$. If the modulus does not exceed $R$ after $N$ iterations, we declare the orbit to be bounded, providing an approximation that $c \\in \\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThe specific parameters for this problem are:\n-   Initial condition: $z_0 = 0 + 0i$.\n-   Maximum number of iterations: $N = 10000$.\n-   Escape radius: $R = 2$.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n\nFor a given complex parameter $c$:\n1.  Initialize the complex variable $z$ to $z_0 = 0$.\n2.  Iterate for $n$ from $0$ to $N - 1$:\n    a.  Check the escape condition: is $|z| > R$? Note that this is computationally equivalent and more efficient to check as $|z|^2 > R^2$, which in our case is $\\operatorname{Re}(z)^2 + \\operatorname{Im}(z)^2 > 4$. If this condition is met, the orbit is unbounded. The function terminates and returns $\\mathrm{False}$.\n    b.  If the escape condition is not met, update $z$ using the rule $z \\leftarrow z^2 + c$.\n3.  If the loop completes without the escape condition ever being satisfied, the orbit is considered bounded for the purposes of this numerical test. The function terminates and returns $\\mathrm{True}$.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the $8$ complex parameters specified in the test suite:\n-   $c_1 = 0 + 0i$\n-   $c_2 = -1 + 0i$\n-   $c_3 = -2 + 0i$\n-   $c_4 = 0.25 + 0i$\n-   $c_5 = 1 + 0i$\n-   $c_6 = 0.26 + 0i$\n-   $c_7 = 0.28 + 0.207846i$\n-   $c_8 = 0.5 + 0.5i$\n\nThe final output will be a list of boolean values, one for each parameter, indicating the result of the boundedness test.",

Use only numerical procedures grounded in definitions and well-tested facts from dynamical systems. Your solution must adhere to the following requirements.\n\n1. Fundamental definitions to use:\n- The logistic map $f_{r}(x) = r x (1-x)$.\n- A period-$p$ orbit is a set $\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{p-1}\\}$ with $f_{r}^{p}(x_{0}) = x_{0}$ and $p$ minimal, where $f_{r}^{p}$ denotes $p$-fold composition of $f_{r}$.\n- A period-doubling bifurcation occurs at parameter values $r_{n}$ where the attracting orbit’s minimal period changes from $2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n}$.\n- The critical point of $f_{r}$ is $x_{c} = 1/2$ (where $df_{r}/dx = 0$).\n- For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the superstable parameter $r_{n}^{*}$ within the period-$2^{n}$ window is defined by $f_{r}^{2^{n}}(x_{c}) = x_{c}$, which ensures that the period-$2^{n}$ cycle includes $x_{c}$ and is therefore superstable.\n- The diameter $d_{n}$ is defined at $r_{n}^{*}$ by $d_{n} = \\left| f_{r_{n}^{*}}^{2^{n-1}}(x_{c}) - x_{c} \\right|$.\n- The Feigenbaum spatial-scaling constant $\\alpha$ (magnitude) is the limit $\\alpha = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{d_{n-1}}{d_{n}}$.\n\n2.

If no such $p$ is detected, report $0$ as “no period detected up to the tested maximum.”\n- Scan parameters $r$ on a uniform grid over the interval $[2.8, 4.0]$ with step size $10^{-3}$ to classify minimal periods and detect period-doubling windows. A period-$2^{n}$ window is a maximal contiguous interval in which the detected minimal period equals $2^{n}$. Use these windows to estimate bifurcation locations by their left endpoints.\n- Independently of window endpoints, compute the superstable parameters $r_{n}^{*}$ for $n \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ by solving the scalar equation $f_{r}^{2^{n}}(x_{c}) - x_{c} = 0$ on an interval $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ that you must construct numerically so that it brackets a root.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed task in computational physics, specifically in the domain of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. It requires the numerical investigation of the logistic map, defined by the iterative equation $x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n) = r x_n (1 - x_n)$, for a state $x \\in [0, 1]$ and a control parameter $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The objectives are to implement algorithms for period detection, locate bifurcation points, calculate superstable parameters, and ultimately estimate the Feigenbaum spatial-scaling constant $\\alpha$. The problem is scientifically sound, with all definitions and parameters being standard in the field. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed through a series of modular functions, each corresponding to a specific task outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we require a robust method for determining the minimal period of an attracting orbit for a given parameter $r$. The algorithm proceeds as follows: starting from an initial condition $x_0 = 0.123456789$, we iterate the logistic map for $N_{\\text{trans}} = 1500$ steps. This initial phase, known as the transient, is discarded to ensure that the subsequent states lie on or very near the attractor. We then collect the next $N_{\\text{keep}} = 512$ points of the orbit, $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{keep}}}$. To determine the minimal period, we test for periodicity against a set of candidate periods $p \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. For each $p$, we check if the condition $\\max_{k} |x_{k+p} - x_k| < \\varepsilon$ is met, where the tolerance is $\\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$. The maximum is taken over all indices $k$ such that both $x_k$ and $x_{k+p}$ are within our collected sample. The smallest value of $p$ that satisfies this criterion is identified as the minimal period of the attracting orbit. If no such $p$ is found, we conclude that the orbit is not periodic with any of the tested periods, which may indicate chaotic behavior, and return a period of $0$.\n\nSecond, to approximate the location of the first period-doubling bifurcation, $r_1$, we perform a systematic scan of the parameter $r$. We create a uniform grid of $r$ values in the interval $[2.8, 4.0]$ with a step of $10^{-3}$. For each $r$ on this grid, we invoke the period detection algorithm described above. The problem defines a period-$2$ window as a contiguous range of $r$ values where the minimal period is found to be $2$. The first bifurcation point $r_1$, where the stable period-$1$ orbit gives way to a stable period-$2$ orbit, is estimated as the left endpoint of the first such detected window. This corresponds to the smallest $r$ in our grid for which the detected period is $2$.\n\nThird, a more precise method is employed to find the specific parameter values $r_n^*$ at which the period-$2^n$ orbits are superstable. An orbit is superstable when it includes the critical point of the map, $x_c = 1/2$, where the map's derivative is zero. The condition for a superstable period-$2^n$ orbit is thus $f_r^{2^n}(x_c) = x_c$. This translates to finding the roots of the function $g_n(r) = f_r^{2^n}(x_c) - x_c = 0$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. To solve this equation for $r_n^*$, we use a bracketing root-finding algorithm. As stipulated, for $n=1$, we search within the interval $[3.0, 3.5]$. For $n \\ge 2$, the search interval is $[r_{n-1}^*, 3.6]$. Within each primary interval, we first identify a tighter bracket $[a, b]$ where $g_n(a) \\cdot g_n(b) < 0$ by sampling the function $g_n(r)$ on a uniform subgrid of at least $200$ points. Once such a bracket is secured, a robust numerical solver, specifically Brent's method, is used to find the root $r_n^*$ with high precision.\n\nFourth, with the superstable parameters $r_n^*$ in hand, we can compute the sequence of approximants to the Feigenbaum constant $\\alpha$. This constant governs the scaling of the attractor's geometry near the accumulation point of period-doubling bifurcations. The approximants are based on the diameters $d_n$ of the attractor at these superstable points, defined as $d_n = |f_{r_n^*}^{2^{n-1}}(x_c) - x_c|$. This value represents the distance between the critical point $x_c$ and its image after $2^{n-1}$ iterations of the map, evaluated at the superstable parameter $r_n^*$. The ratio of successive diameters, $\\alpha_n = d_{n-1}/d_n$, forms a sequence that converges to $\\alpha$. The program computes this sequence up to $n=5$ to find the value of $\\alpha_5 = d_4/d_5$.\n\nFinally, the implemented functions are employed to address the four specific test cases. The first test case requires the calculation of $\\alpha_5$. The second test case requires the estimation of the first bifurcation point $r_1$ from the parameter scan. The third and fourth test cases require applying the period detector to specific $r$ values, $r=3.2$ (stable period-$2$ window) and $r=4.0$ (chaotic regime), respectively. The results are collected, formatted to the specified precision, and presented in the required list format.",
