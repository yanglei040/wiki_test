The pressure $p_{i,j}$ is stored at cell centers located at $(x_i, y_j)$ with $x_i = (i - \\tfrac{1}{2})\\Delta x$ for $i = 1, \\dots, N_x$ and $y_j = (j - \\tfrac{1}{2})\\Delta y$ for $j = 1, \\dots, N_y$.

The MAC grid placement is such that pressure is stored at cell centers, while velocities would be stored at faces (you will not need velocities in this problem but should follow the MAC placement for pressure).\n\nYour implementation must start from first principles:\n- Finite-volume control of a cell-centered control volume with area $h^2$ in two dimensions, integrating the divergence form and using the divergence theorem to express fluxes across the four faces.\n- For each of the four coordinate-aligned directions, approximate the face-normal gradient using two-point fluxes between the cell center and either the neighboring fluid-cell center or the intersection point with the Dirichlet boundary where the boundary cuts the face-normal line, at a properly computed distance.\n\nUse the following well-tested base:\n- Manufactured solution $p^\\star(x,y) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$.\n- Source term $f(x,y) = 2\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$, since $\\Delta p^\\star = -2\\pi^2 p^\\star$ and thus $-\\nabla^2 p^\\star = 2\\pi^2 p^\\star$.\n- Dirichlet data on both the outer boundary and the embedded boundary equal to the manufactured solution: $p = p^\\star$.\n\nStaggered-grid context and stencil modification near the embedded boundary:\n- Pressure unknowns are stored at cell centers $(x_i,y_j)$ with $x_i = (i+1/2)h$, $y_j = (j+1/2)h$, where $i,j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a finite-volume solver for the scalar Poisson equation $-\\nabla^2 p = f$. We begin from the integral form of the equation over a control volume $V_{i,j}$, which is a square cell of area $h^2$ centered at $(x_i, y_j)$. Applying the divergence theorem to the Laplacian term gives:\n$$ -\\int_{V_{i,j}} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p) \\, dV = \\int_{V_{i,j}} f \\, dV $$\n$$ -\\oint_{\\partial V_{i,j}} \\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{V_{i,j}} f \\, dV $$\nIn two dimensions, the control volume is an area and the boundary integral is a line integral over the four faces of the cell (east, west, north, south). Let the side length of the cell be $h$. The equation becomes:\n$$ -\\left[ \\int_{\\text{east}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} dy - \\int_{\\text{west}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} dy + \\int_{\\text{north}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} dx - \\int_{\\text{south}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} dx \\right] \\approx f(x_i, y_j) h^2 $$\nApproximating the integrals and gradients, the total flux out of the cell is the sum of fluxes across the four faces. The flux across the east face, for example, is $-h (\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x})_e$. The discrete equation for cell $(i,j)$ is a balance of these fluxes:\n$$ -h \\left[ (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_e + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_w + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_n + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_s \\right] = f_{i,j} h^2 $$\n$$ (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_e + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_w + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_n + (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_s = -f_{i,j} h $$\nWe approximate the normal gradient at each face using a two-point finite difference. The specific approximation depends on whether the neighboring cell is fluid, solid, or outside the domain. Summing all contributions gives a linear equation for $p_{i,j}$.\n\nFor a cell $(i,j)$ where all four neighbors—$(i\\pm1, j)$ and $(i, j\\pm1)$—are also fluid cells, the gradients are approximated using centered differences. For the east face, the gradient is $(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x})_e \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i,j}}{h}$. Summing all four flux approximations yields the standard five-point stencil for the negative Laplacian, scaled by $h^2$:\n$$ \\frac{4p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j} - p_{i-1,j} - p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j-1}}{h^2} = f(x_i,y_j) $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to show contributions to a linear system. For each fluid neighbor, say $(i+1,j)$, the terms are $\\frac{1}{h^2}p_{i,j} - \\frac{1}{h^2}p_{i+1,j}$. This corresponds to adding $\\frac{1}{h^2}$ to the diagonal matrix element for $p_{i,j}$ and $-\\frac{1}{h^2}$ to the off-diagonal element corresponding to the neighbor $p_{i+1,j}$.\n\nWhen a cell face lies on the outer computational boundary (e.g., $x=1$), a Dirichlet condition $p=p_B$ is applied. The face is located at a distance $\\delta = h/2$ from the cell center. The normal gradient is approximated by a one-sided difference: $(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x})_e \\approx \\frac{p_B - p_{i,j}}{\\delta}$. The contribution to the flux balance from this face is $\\frac{p_{i,j} - p_B}{h\\delta}$. This modifies the linear equation for $p_{i,j}$ by adding $\\frac{1}{h\\delta}$ to the diagonal coefficient and adding the known term $\\frac{p_B}{h\\delta}$ to the right-hand side vector.\n\nWhen a fluid cell $(i,j)$ is adjacent to a solid cell, the embedded boundary $\\Gamma$ cuts through the grid. We use the level set function $\\phi$ to locate the interface. Let $\\phi_P = \\phi(x_i, y_j) \\ge 0$ be the value at the fluid cell center and $\\phi_N  0$ be the value at the solid neighbor's center. Assuming $\\phi$ is a signed distance function, linear interpolation gives the fractional distance to the interface as $\\lambda = \\frac{\\phi_P}{\\phi_P - \\phi_N}$. The actual distance is $\\delta = \\lambda h$. The Dirichlet condition $p=p_B$ is applied at this interpolated point on the boundary. The gradient approximation becomes $\\frac{p_B - p_{i,j}}{\\delta}$, and the flux contribution is $\\frac{p_{i,j} - p_B}{h\\delta}$. This results in a stencil modification identical in form to the outer boundary case: the diagonal element is incremented by $\\frac{1}{h\\delta}$ and the right-hand side is incremented by $\\frac{p_B}{h\\delta}$.\n\nA critical edge case arises if a fluid cell center lies on the boundary, i.e., $\\phi(x_i, y_j)=0$. This leads to $\\lambda=0$ and $\\delta=0$, creating a singularity in the flux term $\\frac{1}{h\\delta}$. This is the \"small cell\" problem. The physically correct and numerically stable approach is to recognize that the pressure at this cell center is known by the Dirichlet condition. Therefore, for such a cell, we discard the flux balance equation and directly enforce $p_{i,j} = p^\\star(x_i, y_j)$. In the linear system $A\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{b}$, this is accomplished by setting the corresponding row of $A$ to the identity (1 on the diagonal, 0 elsewhere) and setting the corresponding element of $\\mathbf{b}$ to the known boundary value.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Identify all fluid cells where $\\phi(x_i, y_j) \\ge 0$. Create a mapping from the 2D indices $(i,j)$ of these $M$ cells to a 1D index $k \\in [0, M-1]$.\n2.  Construct the $M \\times M$ sparse matrix $A$ and the $M \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n3.  For each fluid cell $(i,j)$, iterate through its four neighbors.\n4.  For each neighbor, apply the appropriate rule: standard five-point coupling for a fluid neighbor, or the boundary flux modification for an outer boundary or a solid (cut-cell) neighbor. Update the coefficients of $A$ and the entries of $\\mathbf{b}$ accordingly. Handle the $\\delta=0$ case by setting the Dirichlet condition directly.\n5.  Solve the resulting sparse linear system $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the vector of unknown pressures $\\mathbf{p}$.\n6.  Compute the RMS error by comparing the numerical solution $p_{i,j}$ to the exact manufactured solution $p^\\star(x_i, y_j)$ over all fluid cells.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement.",
