            "introduction": "This practice draws a powerful analogy between the training of a neural network and the physical process of simulated annealing. You will explore how adding noise to backpropagation, akin to thermal fluctuations in a system described by Langevin dynamics, can help the model escape from suboptimal local minima and find a better global solution . This exercise builds physical intuition for why stochasticity is a powerful tool in complex optimization and demonstrates its practical implementation.",

            "problem": "You will implement and analyze a computational experiment that connects artificial neural network training by backpropagation to thermal-noise-assisted escape from local minima, drawing a parallel to simulated annealing. Consider a scalar artificial neural network with a single parameter $w \\in \\mathbb{R}$ whose output is $y(w) = w$ for a single fixed input. Define a nonconvex training objective (interpreted as an energy landscape) by\n$$\nU(w) = (w^2 - 1)^2 + \\alpha\\, w + \\beta \\cos(k\\, w),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $k$ are fixed, known constants. Assume that the scalar network is trained by minimizing $U(w)$ via backpropagation in the sense that the training dynamics are driven by the gradient $\\frac{dU}{dw}$ with respect to $w$. You will incorporate thermal noise into the gradient signal to model thermal fluctuations, in direct analogy with overdamped Langevin dynamics and simulated annealing.\n\nFoundational bases you must use:\n- The definition of gradient-based training for a scalar parameter: the backpropagated gradient for the scalar parameter is $\\frac{dU}{dw}$.\n- The overdamped Langevin dynamics for a coordinate $w$ in an energy landscape $U(w)$ at temperature $T$ has the continuous-time form $dw/dt = -\\mu \\frac{dU}{dw} + \\sqrt{2 D}\\,\\xi(t)$ with mobility $\\mu$ and diffusion constant $D$ related by the Einstein relation $D = \\mu k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\xi(t)$ is standard white noise. In discrete time with step size $\\Delta t$ and identifying the learning rate with $\\eta = \\mu \\Delta t$, this yields a time-discretized update with a thermally scaled Gaussian noise term.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. Starting from the above bases, derive the discrete-time update for $w_{t+1}$ from $w_t$ that models gradient-descent-like backpropagation with an additive thermal noise term at a (possibly time-dependent) temperature $T(t)$. Use a constant learning rate $\\eta > 0$. Clearly justify the exact variance of the Gaussian noise term in terms of $\\eta$ and $T(t)$.\n2. Using your derived update, implement a simulation that starts the parameter at $w_0 = 0.95$ and performs a fixed number of update steps $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$. Define a successful escape event as ending in the deeper, global well near $w \\approx -1$, which you must operationalize as the condition $w_{N_{\\mathrm{steps}}} \\le -0.9$.\n3. For each experiment, run $N_{\\mathrm{trials}}$ independent trials with different random seeds and report the fraction of successful escapes as a floating-point number in $[0,1]$. Each trial must use the same initial condition $w_0 = 0.95$ and the same schedule $T(t)$, but independent realizations of the Gaussian thermal noise. Use the following fixed constants: $\\alpha = 0.3$, $\\beta = 0.1$, $k = 5.0$, $\\eta = 0.01$, $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = 4000$, $N_{\\mathrm{trials}} = 64$.\n4. Consider the following temperature schedules $T(t)$ that emulate different training regimes. For each schedule, compute and report the escape fraction as described.\n   - Case A (no thermal noise): $T(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n   - Case B (constant thermal bath): $T(t) = 0.02$ for all $t$.\n   - Case C (exponential simulated annealing, slow): $T(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with $T_0 = 0.05$ and $\\tau = 1500$.\n   - Case D (exponential simulated annealing, hot and fast): $T(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with $T_0 = 0.15$ and $\\tau = 300$.\n5. Your program must compute the escape fractions for Cases A–D in this order and output them on a single line as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each value must be rounded to exactly three decimal places. For example, an output for four cases should look like: [0.000,0.312,0.516,0.203].\n\nAdditional instructions:\n- Angles in trigonometric functions are dimensionless radians.\n- There are no physical units required in the output; report pure numbers.\n- The random number generation must be reproducible: fix a master seed of your choice and then derive distinct seeds for each independent trial.\n- Implement the gradient $\\frac{dU}{dw}$ exactly from the given $U(w)$. Do not approximate derivatives numerically.\n- Your code must be self-contained and must not read any input.\n\nTest suite specification:\n- Use the exact constants and schedules listed above. These constitute the test cases to be run by your program.\n- Output format requirement: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets and rounded to three decimals, in the order [CaseA,CaseB,CaseC,CaseD].\n- Each of the four numbers must be of type float and must lie in $[0,1]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires deriving a discrete-time update rule for a parameter $w$ undergoing training analogous to overdamped Langevin dynamics, and then using this rule to simulate escape from a local minimum of an energy landscape $U(w)$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Discrete-Time Update Rule**\n\nWe begin with the continuous-time overdamped Langevin equation for the parameter $w$ in the potential $U(w)$ at temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = -\\mu \\frac{dU}{dw} + \\sqrt{2 D}\\,\\xi(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the mobility, $D$ is the diffusion constant, and $\\xi(t)$ is standard Gaussian white noise with $\\langle \\xi(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\xi(t)\\xi(t') \\rangle = \\delta(t-t')$. The mobility and diffusion are related by the Einstein relation, which we take as $D = \\mu T$ by absorbing the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ into the definition of temperature $T$ (treating $T$ as having units of energy).\n\nTo obtain a discrete-time update rule, we employ the Euler-Maruyama method to integrate this stochastic differential equation over a small time step $\\Delta t$. The change in $w$ from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is approximately:\n$$\nw_{t+1} - w_t = \\Delta w \\approx \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\left( -\\mu \\frac{dU}{dw}\\bigg|_{w_s} + \\sqrt{2 D}\\,\\xi(s) \\right) ds\n$$\nAssuming $\\Delta t$ is small, the gradient term can be treated as constant over the interval, evaluated at $w_t = w(t)$. The integral of the noise term is a Wiener process increment, $\\Delta W_t = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\xi(s) ds$. This increment is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\\Delta t$. We can write $\\Delta W_t = \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t$, where $Z_t$ is a random variable drawn from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\nThe discretized update equation thus becomes:\n$$\nw_{t+1} = w_t - \\mu \\Delta t \\frac{dU}{dw}\\bigg|_{w_t} + \\sqrt{2 D} \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t\n$$\nThe problem statement provides an analogy between the learning rate $\\eta$ and the physical parameters via $\\eta = \\mu \\Delta t$. Substituting this and the relation $D = \\mu T$ into the equation gives:\n$$\nw_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\frac{dU}{dw}\\bigg|_{w_t} + \\sqrt{2 (\\mu T)} \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t\n$$\nTo express the noise term purely in terms of $\\eta$ and $T$, we rearrange $\\eta = \\mu \\Delta t$ to find $\\mu = \\eta / \\Delta t$. Substituting this into the square root:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2 (\\mu T) \\Delta t} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\Delta t} T\\right) \\Delta t} = \\sqrt{2 \\eta T}\n$$\nTherefore, the final discrete-time update rule for $w_t$ is:\n$$\nw_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\frac{dU}{dw}\\bigg|_{w_t} + \\sqrt{2 \\eta T(t)} Z_t\n$$\nwhere $Z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and the temperature $T(t)$ can be time-dependent. The first term, $-\\eta \\frac{dU}{dw}$, corresponds to a standard gradient descent update in machine learning. The second term, $\\sqrt{2 \\eta T(t)} Z_t$, is the additive thermal noise. This term is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $(\\sqrt{2\\eta T(t)})^2 = 2\\eta T(t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Gradient Calculation**\n\nThe energy landscape (or training objective) is given by:\n$$\nU(w) = (w^2 - 1)^2 + \\alpha w + \\beta \\cos(k w)\n$$\nTo implement the update rule, we must compute the analytical gradient of $U(w)$ with respect to $w$:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dw} = \\frac{d}{dw} \\left( w^4 - 2w^2 + 1 + \\alpha w + \\beta \\cos(k w) \\right)\n$$\nApplying the rules of differentiation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dw} = 4w^3 - 4w + \\alpha - \\beta k \\sin(k w)\n$$\nThis expression is used directly in the simulation with the provided constants $\\alpha=0.3$, $\\beta=0.1$, and $k=5.0$.\n\n**Part 3: Simulation Procedure**\n\nThe simulation aims to calculate the fraction of times the parameter $w$, starting near a local minimum at $w \\approx 1$, escapes to the global minimum basin near $w \\approx -1$.\n\nFor each of the four specified temperature schedules $T(t)$, we perform the following procedure:\n1.  Initialize a counter for successful escapes to $0$.\n2.  Run $N_{\\mathrm{trials}} = 64$ independent trials. For each trial:\n    a. Initialize the parameter $w$ to its starting value, $w_0 = 0.95$.\n    b. Generate an independent sequence of random numbers for the thermal noise. This is ensured by seeding a random number generator for each trial with a unique seed derived from a master generator to ensure reproducibility across and independence between trials.\n    c. Perform $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = 4000$ update steps. For each step $t$ from $0$ to $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}-1$:\n        i.  Calculate the temperature $T_t = T(t)$ according to the given schedule.\n        ii. Calculate the gradient $g_t = \\frac{dU}{dw}\\big|_{w_t}$ using the formula derived above.\n        iii. Calculate the standard deviation of the noise term, $\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{2 \\eta T_t}$. If $T_t = 0$, then $\\sigma_t=0$.\n        iv. Draw a random sample $Z_t$ from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n        v.  Update the parameter: $w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta g_t + \\sigma_t Z_t$.\n    d. After $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$, check the final state of the parameter, $w_{N_{\\mathrm{steps}}}$. If $w_{N_{\\mathrm{steps}}} \\le -0.9$, the trial is counted as a successful escape.\n3.  The final escape fraction for the temperature schedule is the total number of successful escapes divided by $N_{\\mathrm{trials}}$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all four cases:\n- Case A (No Noise): $T(t) = 0$.\n- Case B (Constant Temperature): $T(t) = 0.02$.\n- Case C (Slow Annealing): $T(t) = 0.05 \\exp(-t/1500)$.\n- Case D (Fast Annealing): $T(t) = 0.15 \\exp(-t/300)$.\n\nThe implementation will directly follow this logic, using the provided constants: $\\alpha = 0.3$, $\\beta = 0.1$, $k = 5.0$, and $\\eta = 0.01$. The final results are rounded to three decimal places and presented in the specified format.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation, implementation, and comparison of two optimization methods for training a logistic regression model: standard Euclidean gradient descent and a Riemannian steepest-descent method based on the Fisher Information Metric (FIM). The derivation must begin from first principles.\n\nFirst, the derivation of the Riemannian steepest-descent direction is addressed. The objective is to find a parameter update $\\delta\\theta$ that produces the maximum decrease in the loss function $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$. A first-order Taylor expansion of the loss gives the change $\\Delta \\mathcal{L} \\approx \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)^\\top \\delta\\theta$. To find the direction of steepest descent, this change must be minimized subject to a constraint on the \"size\" of the step $\\delta\\theta$. In a standard Euclidean setting, this constraint is on the squared Euclidean norm $||\\delta\\theta||_2^2$, leading to the familiar gradient descent update $\\delta\\theta \\propto -\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$.\n\nIn the context of probabilistic models, the geometry of the parameter space is more naturally described by how much the probability distribution $p_\\theta$ changes. A fundamental measure of the dissimilarity between two distributions $p_\\theta$ and $p_{\\theta'}$ is the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, $\\mathrm{KL}(p_\\theta \\,\\|\\, p_{\\theta'})$. For an infinitesimal step $\\delta\\theta$, so that $\\theta' = \\theta + \\delta\\theta$, the KL-divergence provides a local metric for the distance between parameters.

First, the expectation of the score function (the gradient of the log-likelihood) is zero: $\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta] = 0$. Second, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), $F(\\theta)$, is given by the information matrix equality: $F(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta)(\\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta)^\\top] = -\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla^2_\\theta \\log p_\\theta]$.\nApplying these identities simplifies the KL-divergence to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{KL}(p_\\theta \\,\\|\\, p_{\\theta+\\delta\\theta}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\delta\\theta^\\top F(\\theta) \\delta\\theta\n$$\nThis quadratic form defines a Riemannian metric on the parameter manifold, where the metric tensor is the FIM. The Riemannian steepest-descent direction is the one that minimizes $\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)^\\top \\delta\\theta$ subject to a fixed step size in this geometry, i.e., $\\frac{1}{2} \\delta\\theta^\\top F(\\theta) \\delta\\theta = \\text{constant}$.

Differentiating with respect to $\\delta\\theta$ and setting to zero yields $\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) + \\mu F(\\theta) \\delta\\theta = 0$. This gives the optimal step direction $\\delta\\theta \\propto -F(\\theta)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$. The vector $d_N = -F(\\theta)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ is known as the natural gradient. The update rule for the Fisher-Riemannian method is $\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha_N F(\\theta_t)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_t)$. Including the Tikhonov damping term $\\lambda I$ for numerical stability, the update becomes:\n$$\n\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha_N (F(\\theta_t) + \\lambda I)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_t)\n$$\n\nSecond, we specialize the required quantities for the given logistic regression model. The model prediction is $p_i = p_\\theta(y=1|x_i) = \\sigma(\\theta^\\top x_i)$, where $\\sigma(z) = (1+e^{-z})^{-1}$. The derivative of the sigmoid function is $\\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z)(1-\\sigma(z))$.\nThe Euclidean gradient of the average negative log-likelihood $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i [y_i \\log p_i + (1-y_i)\\log(1-p_i)]$ is found by applying the chain rule. For a single data point $(x_i, y_i)$, the gradient of its contribution to the sum inside $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla_\\theta [y_i \\log p_i + (1-y_i)\\log(1-p_i)] = \\left(\\frac{y_i}{p_i} - \\frac{1-y_i}{1-p_i}\\right)\\nabla_\\theta p_i = \\frac{y_i - p_i}{p_i(1-p_i)} (p_i(1-p_i)x_i) = (y_i - p_i)x_i\n$$\nThe full gradient is therefore $\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - p_i)x_i = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - y_i)x_i$. In matrix notation, this is $\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}X^\\top(p-y)$.\n\nThe FIM for a single data point $x_i$, denoted $F_{x_i}(\\theta)$, is computed by taking the expectation over the model's predicted label distribution $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$. The gradient of the log-likelihood for one sample is $\\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(y_i|x_i) = (y_i-p_i)x_i$.\n$$\nF_{x_i}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{Y_i \\sim p_i}[ (Y_i-p_i)^2 x_i x_i^\\top ] = x_i x_i^\\top \\mathbb{E}[(Y_i-p_i)^2]\n$$\nThe expectation term is the variance of a Bernoulli random variable, which is $p_i(1-p_i)$. Thus, $F_{x_i}(\\theta) = p_i(1-p_i)x_i x_i^\\top$. The total FIM for the dataset is the average, known as the empirical FIM:\n$$\nF(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(1-p_i) x_i x_i^\\top\n$$\nIn matrix notation, this is $F(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}X^\\top W X$, where $W$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $W_{ii} = p_i(1-p_i)$.\n\nFinally, the implementation proceeds by setting up two optimization loops for each test case, one for Euclidean gradient descent and one for the Fisher-Riemannian method. In each step of the Riemannian method, the Euclidean gradient $\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ and the empirical FIM $F(\\theta)$ are computed. The damped metric $M = F(\\theta) + \\lambda I$ is formed, and the linear system $Mv = \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ is solved for the natural gradient direction $v$. The parameters are then updated using this direction and the step size $\\alpha_N$. For numerical stability, the loss calculation clips probability values away from exactly $0$ and $1$. The final negative log-likelihood values are calculated after $T$ iterations for both methods and reported for each test case.",

            "solution": "The task is to simulate the training of a single linear neuron using full-batch gradient descent where the gradients are quantized. We will analyze the behavior for different bit precisions and determine when the training process breaks down, defined as failing to reach a specific loss threshold.\n\nFirst, we formulate the loss function and its gradient. The model is a linear neuron with output $Xw$ for an input matrix $X$ and weight vector $w$. The loss is the empirical mean-squared error:\n$$\nL(w) = \\frac{1}{N} \\lVert Xw - y \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies $N=5$, $d=5$, $X = I_5$ (the $5 \\times 5$ identity matrix), and the target outputs $y$ are set equal to the target weights $w^{\\star}$. Thus, the loss function simplifies to:\n$$\nL(w) = \\frac{1}{5} \\lVert I_5 w - w^\\star \\rVert_2^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\lVert w - w^\\star \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThe global minimum of this loss is $L=0$ at $w = w^\\star$. The gradient of the loss function with respect to $w$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla L(w) = \\frac{2}{N} X^{\\top}(Xw - y) = \\frac{2}{5} I_5^{\\top}(I_5 w - w^\\star) = \\frac{2}{5} (w - w^\\star)\n$$\n\nThe training process starts with the initial parameter vector $w_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The initial gradient is therefore:\n$$\ng_0 = \\nabla L(w_0) = \\frac{2}{5} (w_0 - w^\\star) = -\\frac{2}{5} w^\\star\n$$\nGiven $w^{\\star} = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]^{\\top}$, we compute $g_0$:\n$$\ng_0 = -\\frac{2}{5} [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]^{\\top} = [-0.4, 0.8, -1.2, 1.6, -2.0]^{\\top}\n$$\nThe quantization scheme uses a fixed dynamic range $s_{\\mathrm{fixed}}$ determined by the maximum magnitude of the initial gradient components:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = \\max_{j} |(g_0)_j| = \\max\\{0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0\\} = 2.0\n$$\n\nThe training proceeds for $T=2000$ iterations using the update rule:\n$$\nw_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\, Q_b(\\nabla L(w_t))\n$$\nwhere the learning rate is $\\eta=1$, and $Q_b$ is the quantization operator for $b$ bits of precision.\n\nFor $b \\ge 2$, the uniform quantization step $\\Delta_b$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta_b = \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{fixed}}}{2^{b-1}-1} = \\frac{2.0}{2^{b-1}-1}\n$$\nThe component-wise quantization function is:\n$$\n[Q_b(g)]_j = \\operatorname{sign}(g_j) \\cdot \\Delta_b \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{|g_j|}{\\Delta_b} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nThis function maps any gradient component $g_j$ to the nearest multiple of $\\Delta_b$ that is closer to zero. A \"dead zone\" exists around zero: if $|g_j|  \\Delta_b$, then $[Q_b(g)]_j = 0$.\n\nFor the edge case $b=1$, the quantization is:\n$$\n[Q_1(g)]_j = s_{\\mathrm{fixed}} \\cdot \\operatorname{sign}(g_j) = 2.0 \\cdot \\operatorname{sign}(g_j)\n$$\nThis maps any non-zero gradient component to either $+2.0$ or $-2.0$.\n\nThe simulation will be run for each bit precision $b \\in \\{32, 16, 8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1\\}$. After $T=2000$ iterations, we calculate the final loss $L(w_T)$ and check for breakdown, which occurs if $L(w_T)  \\tau=0.002$.\n\nA key cause of breakdown is the quantization dead zone. If the magnitude of an initial gradient component $|(g_0)_j|$ is smaller than the quantization step $\\Delta_b$, that component will be quantized to zero from the start. The corresponding weight $w_j$ will never be updated from its initial value of $0$. The smallest magnitude of a component in $g_0$ is $|(g_0)_0| = 0.4$. Breakdown is guaranteed if $\\Delta_b  0.4$:\n$$\n\\frac{2.0}{2^{b-1}-1}  0.4 \\implies 5  2^{b-1}-1 \\implies 6  2^{b-1} \\implies b-1  \\log_2(6) \\approx 2.585 \\implies b  3.585\n$$\nThus, for $b=3, 2, 1$, we anticipate breakdown because at least one weight component will fail to learn.\n\nFor higher values of $b$, where $\\Delta_b$ is small enough for all components to begin learning, the quantization error still limits the final precision. The training effectively stalls when the gradient magnitude for each component, $|\\nabla L(w_t)_j|$, falls below $\\Delta_b$. This leaves a residual error in the weights, $w_T - w^\\star$, where each component is roughly bounded by $\\frac{N}{2}\\Delta_b$. The final loss is approximately proportional to $\\Delta_b^2$. If this minimum achievable loss is greater than the threshold $\\tau$, breakdown occurs. We expect this to happen for intermediate values of $b$ such as $7$ and $5$.\n\nFor large $b$ (e.g., $32, 16$), $\\Delta_b$ is very small, the quantization error is negligible, and the algorithm converges well, resulting in a final loss below $\\tau$. The provided program implements this simulation precisely to find the breakdown point.",
