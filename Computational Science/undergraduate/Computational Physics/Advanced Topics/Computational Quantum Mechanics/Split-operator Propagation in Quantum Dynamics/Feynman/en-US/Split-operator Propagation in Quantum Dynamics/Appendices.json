Four test cases with specific parameters ($L, N, \\sigma_x, x_0, p_0, \\{t_k\\}$) are provided.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It describes a fundamental problem in quantum dynamics: the time evolution of a free particle. All concepts, equations, and parameters are well-defined and consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics. The request to \"evolve exactly... using spatial discretization\" is understood to mean the use of a spectral method, like the split-operator Fourier method, which is numerically exact for the discretized system in the case of a free particle. The problem is well-posed, objective, and computationally feasible. The initial Gaussian form is defined on an infinite domain, but for the given parameters, it is well-localized within the periodic box, making its use as an initial state on the periodic domain a valid approximation. We will proceed to the solution.\n\nPrinciple-Based Solution Design:\n\nThe solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, $\\psi(x,t) = e^{-i\\hat{H}t}\\psi(x,0)$, can be efficiently computed using a spectral method in the basis of momentum eigenstates. The Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{p}^2/(2m)$ is diagonal in the momentum (Fourier) basis. The momentum operator's eigenfunctions on a periodic domain of length $L$ are the plane waves $\\phi_k(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}} e^{ikx}$, where the wavevectors $k$ are quantized as $k_n = 2\\pi n/L$ for integer $n$.\n\nThe action of the Hamiltonian on these basis states is simple multiplication: $\\hat{H} \\phi_k(x) = \\frac{k^2}{2m} \\phi_k(x)$. Consequently, the action of the time-evolution operator $e^{-i\\hat{H}t}$ is also a simple multiplication in this basis: $e^{-i\\hat{H}t} \\phi_k(x) = e^{-i\\frac{k^2}{2m}t} \\phi_k(x)$.\n\nThe numerical algorithm, known as the split-operator Fourier method, leverages this property via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which efficiently transforms the wavefunction between the position and momentum representations.\n\nThe step-by-step procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization and Initial State Preparation**:\n    The spatial domain $x \\in [-L/2, L/2)$ is discretized into $N$ grid points $x_j$ with spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$. The initial wavefunction $\\psi(x,0)$ is evaluated at these grid points. The given analytical form for $\\psi(x,0)$ is technically normalized on an infinite domain. For our finite, periodic domain, we must enforce normalization numerically on the grid:\n    $$\n    \\psi_j(0) = \\frac{\\phi_j}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{l=0}^{N-1} |\\phi_l|^2 \\Delta x}}\n    $$\n    where $\\phi_j$ is the unnormalized Gaussian wavepacket evaluated at $x_j$. This ensures that the initial state satisfies the probability conservation condition $\\int |\\psi|^2 dx \\approx \\sum_j |\\psi_j(0)|^2 \\Delta x = 1$.\n\n2.  **Time Evolution in Fourier Space**:\n    For each required time $t_k$, the wavefunction $\\psi(x, t_k)$ is computed from the initial state $\\psi(x, 0)$:\n    a.  The initial state is transformed to the momentum representation using the FFT: $\\tilde{\\psi}(k, 0) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\psi(x, 0)\\}$. The corresponding momentum grid $k_n$ is determined by the spatial discretization via $k = 2\\pi \\cdot \\text{fftfreq}(N, \\Delta x)$.\n    b.  The state is evolved in momentum space by multiplying with the diagonal time-evolution operator:\n        $$\n        \\tilde{\\psi}(k, t_k) = \\tilde{\\psi}(k, 0) \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{k^2}{2m} t_k}\n        $$\n        Since we are using Hartree atomic units, $m=1$.\n    c.  The state is transformed back to the position representation using the inverse FFT: $\\psi(x, t_k) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\tilde{\\psi}(k, t_k)\\}$. The `numpy` FFT and IFFT functions are inverse pairs, ensuring that the norm of the state vector is preserved throughout the evolution.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Observables**:\n    For each evolved state $\\psi(x, t_k)$, we compute the required standard deviations $\\Delta x(t_k)$ and $\\Delta p(t_k)$.\n\n    a.  **Position Uncertainty $\\Delta x(t_k)$**: The expectation values $\\langle x \\rangle_{t_k}$ and $\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{t_k}$ are computed by numerical integration (summation over the grid points) as defined in the problem statement:\n        $$\n        \\langle x \\rangle_{t_k} \\approx \\sum_j x_j |\\psi_j(t_k)|^2 \\Delta x\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\langle x^2 \\rangle_{t_k} \\approx \\sum_j x_j^2 |\\psi_j(t_k)|^2 \\Delta x\n        $$\n        The position variance is $\\Delta x(t_k)^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle_{t_k} - \\langle x \\rangle_{t_k}^2$. Special care is taken with the definition of the position coordinate $x_j$ on the periodic domain, as this affects the expectation value calculation, particularly if the wavepacket approaches or crosses the boundaries at $x = \\pm L/2$.\n\n    b.  **Momentum Uncertainty $\\Delta p(t_k)$**: The momentum observables are most conveniently and accurately calculated in the momentum representation. For a free particle, the momentum distribution $|\\tilde{\\psi}(k, t)|^2$ is constant in time because the evolution operator is a pure phase factor. Therefore, $\\Delta p(t)$ is constant for all $t$. We can compute it once from the initial state $\\tilde{\\psi}(k, 0)$:\n        $$\n        \\langle p \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\sum_n k_n |\\tilde{\\psi}_n(0)|^2}{\\sum_n |\\tilde{\\psi}_n(0)|^2}\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\langle p^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\sum_n k_n^2 |\\tilde{\\psi}_n(0)|^2}{\\sum_n |\\tilde{\\psi}_n(0)|^2}\n        $$\n        The momentum variance is $\\Delta p^2 = \\langle p^2 \\rangle - \\langle p \\rangle^2$. This calculation is robust as it computes the mean and variance directly from the momentum probability distribution.\n\n4.  **Verification Against Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:\n    For each test case, the list of uncertainty products $\\{\\Delta x(t_k)\\Delta p(t_k)\\}$ is generated. The minimum value, $S$, is found. The initial state is a minimum uncertainty wavepacket, for which $\\Delta x(0) \\Delta p(0) = 1/2$. For a free particle, $\\Delta p$ is constant while $\\Delta x$ increases with time (wavepacket spreading). Thus, the minimum uncertainty product must occur at $t=0$. The numerical simulation must confirm that $S \\ge 1/2 - \\tau$. A result of `True` for all cases is expected, as this is a numerical verification of the fundamental Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.",

The transformation between position and momentum space is achieved via the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse (IDFT). The momentum-space (or k-space) grid points $k_n$ are determined by the properties of the DFT. For our spatial grid, the corresponding wave numbers are given by $k_n$, as provided by `scipy.fft.fftfreq(N, d=dx) * 2 * np.pi`. In this basis, the kinetic operator's action is multiplication by $\\hat{T}_k = \\frac{k^2}{2}$.\n\n**2. Initial State Calculation**\n\nThe system starts in the ground state of the field-free Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0 = \\hat{T} + V(x)$. To find this state, we solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}_0 \\phi = E \\phi$. This is an eigenvalue problem. We construct a matrix representation of $\\hat{H}_0$ on our spatial grid. For this purpose, we use a second-order finite-difference approximation for the kinetic operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_j} \\approx \\frac{\\psi_{j+1} - 2\\psi_j + \\psi_{j-1}}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nThis turns $\\hat{T}$ into a sparse, tridiagonal matrix (with corner elements due to periodic boundary conditions). The potential $V(x)$ becomes a diagonal matrix with entries $V(x_j)$. The resulting Hamiltonian matrix $\\mathbf{H}_0$ is sparse. We use a sparse eigensolver `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs` to find the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue (the ground state energy). The obtained eigenvector is then normalized according to the discrete inner product: $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |\\psi_j(0)|^2 \\Delta x = 1$. This normalized vector is our initial state, $\\psi(x,0)$.\n\n**3. Time Propagation using the Split-Operator Method**\n\nThe time evolution of the wavefunction from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is formally given by $\\psi(t+\\Delta t) = \\exp(-i \\hat{H}_{\\text{eff}} \\Delta t) \\psi(t)$, where $\\hat{H}_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective Hamiltonian over the time step. Since the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$ and the various potential operators do not commute, we cannot simply exponentiate their sum. We employ a symmetric second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the evolution operator:\n$$\n\\hat{U}(\\Delta t) = e^{-i\\hat{H}\\Delta t} \\approx e^{-i\\hat{B}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}} e^{-i\\hat{A}\\Delta t} e^{-i\\hat{B}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}} + O(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nHere, we split the Hamiltonian into the kinetic part $\\hat{A} = \\hat{T}$ and the total potential part $\\hat{B}(t) = V(x) + xE(t) - iW(x)$. The propagators for $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ are straightforward to apply in momentum space and position space, respectively.\n\nThe algorithm for a single time step from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the total potential at the center of the time step, $V_{\\text{full}}(x, t+\\Delta t/2) = V(x) + x E(t+\\Delta t/2) - iW(x)$.\n2.  Apply the first half-step potential propagator in position space:\n    $$ \\psi'(x) = e^{-i V_{\\text{full}}(x, t+\\Delta t/2) \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}} \\psi(x,t) $$\n3.  Transform the result to momentum space using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): $\\tilde{\\psi}'(k) = \\text{FFT}[\\psi'(x)]$.\n4.  Apply the full-step kinetic propagator in momentum space:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\psi}''(k) = e^{-i \\frac{k^2}{2} \\Delta t} \\tilde{\\psi}'(k) $$\n5.  Transform back to position space using the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT): $\\psi''(x) = \\text{IFFT}[\\tilde{\\psi}''(k)]$.\n6.  Apply the second half-step potential propagator in position space to obtain the final state for the step:\n    $$ \\psi(x,t+\\Delta t) = e^{-i V_{\\text{full}}(x, t+\\Delta t/2) \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}} \\psi''(x) $$\nThis sequence is repeated for the total duration of the laser pulse, $T$.\n\n**4. Calculation of Ionization Probability**\n\nThe CAP term $-iW(x)$ in the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which leads to a non-conservation of the wavefunction's norm, $\\|\\psi(t)\\|_2^2 = \\sum_j |\\psi_j(t)|^2 \\Delta x$. The rate of norm decay is given by $\\frac{d}{dt} \\|\\psi\\|^2 = -2 \\langle \\psi | W | \\psi \\rangle$, which is non-positive since $W(x) \\ge 0$. The total norm absorbed by the CAP over the simulation time $[0, T]$ serves as a measure of the total ionization probability, $P_{\\mathrm{ion}}$. Given that the initial state is normalized, $\\|\\psi(0)\\|_2^2 = 1$, the ionization probability is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ion}} = 1 - \\|\\psi(T)\\|_2^2 = 1 - \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |\\psi_j(T)|^2 \\Delta x\n$$\nThis quantity is computed for each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement.",

All integrals must be approximated by appropriate Riemann sums on the numerical grid, and spatial derivatives required for the kinetic contribution must be computed in a manner consistent with the Fourier representation on the chosen grid.\n\nAll quantities are in dimensionless units, so your program must output the chemical potentials in dimensionless energy units.\n\nImplement your program for the following test suite of parameter sets, all in one spatial dimension:\n- Case A (linear harmonic oscillator, baseline check):\n  - External potential $V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\omega^2 x^2$ with $\\omega = 1.0$.\n  - Interaction strength $g = 0.0$.\n  - Domain length $L = 20.0$ with periodic boundary conditions and $N = 512$ grid points, so that $\\Delta x = L/N$.\n  - Imaginary-time step $\\Delta \\tau = 0.001$ and number of steps $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = 2500$.\n  - Initial wavefunction: normalized Gaussian $\\psi(x,0) \\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)\\big)$ with $\\sigma = 1.0$, normalized to $\\int |\\psi(x,0)|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n- Case B (repulsive nonlinear harmonic oscillator):\n  - External potential $V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\omega^2 x^2$ with $\\omega = 1.0$.\n  - Interaction strength $g = 1.0$.\n  - Domain length $L = 20.0$ with periodic boundary conditions and $N = 512$ grid points.\n  - Imaginary-time step $\\Delta \\tau = 0.001$ and number of steps $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = 2500$.\n  - Initial wavefunction: normalized Gaussian with $\\sigma = 1.0$, normalized to unity.\n- Case C (periodic box, uniform stationary state):\n  - External potential $V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = 0$.\n  - Interaction strength $g = 2.0$.\n  - Domain length $L = 10.0$ with periodic boundary conditions and $N = 512$ grid points.\n  - Imaginary-time step $\\Delta \\tau = 0.001$ and number of steps $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = 10$.\n  - Initial wavefunction: uniform $\\psi(x,0) = 1/\\sqrt{L}$ so that it is exactly normalized.\n\nYour program must:\n- Use a symmetric split-operator scheme of second order in the imaginary-time step to propagate to the final time for each case, normalizing after each time step to maintain $\\int |\\psi|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n- Compute the chemical potential $\\mu$ for each case from the final normalized state.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the three results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $\\texttt{[0.500000,1.234567,0.200000]}$, with each value rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nConstraints and implementation details:\n- Spatial grid: $x_j = x_{\\min} + j\\,\\Delta x$ with $x_{\\min} = -L/2$, $j = 0,1,\\dots,N-1$, and $\\Delta x = L/N$.\n- Wavenumbers: $k$-grid consistent with the discrete Fourier transform and periodic boundary conditions must be used for kinetic steps and spectral derivatives.\n- The algorithm must be fully self-contained and must not read any input.\n- Your program must compute and return the chemical potentials for the three cases above in the required output format.\n\nYour final program must be a complete, runnable script that prints only one line: a single list in the format $\\texttt{[}\\mu_A,\\mu_B,\\mu_C\\texttt{]}$ with each entry rounded to $6$ decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a numerical algorithm to find the stationary ground state of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and compute its associated chemical potential, $\\mu$. The method specified is imaginary-time propagation using a second-order symmetric split-operator scheme.\n\nThe time-dependent GPE is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; \\hat{H}\\psi(x,t) \\;=\\; \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\;+\\; V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) \\;+\\; g\\,|\\psi(x,t)|^2 \\right] \\psi(x,t)\n$$\nwhere the mass $m$ and reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ are set to $1$. The Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is composed of a kinetic energy operator, $\\hat{T} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$, and a potential energy operator, $\\hat{V}(x, \\psi) = V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) + g\\,|\\psi(x,t)|^2$, which includes a term dependent on the wavefunction density itself.\n\nTo find the ground state, we employ the method of imaginary-time evolution. This is achieved by the substitution $t \\to -i\\tau$, transforming the Schrödinger equation into a diffusion-type equation in the imaginary-time variable $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,\\tau)}{\\partial \\tau} \\;=\\; -\\hat{H}\\psi(x,\\tau)\n$$\nThe formal solution to this equation over a small time step $\\Delta\\tau$ is $\\psi(x, \\tau+\\Delta\\tau) = e^{-\\hat{H}\\Delta\\tau}\\psi(x,\\tau)$. When an arbitrary initial state is propagated using this rule, components corresponding to higher-energy eigenstates decay more rapidly than the ground state component. By repeatedly applying the evolution operator and renormalizing the wavefunction at each step, the state converges to the ground state, which is the eigenstate of $\\hat{H}$ with the lowest eigenvalue.\n\nThe evolution operator $e^{-\\hat{H}\\Delta\\tau} = e^{-(\\hat{T} + \\hat{V})\\Delta\\tau}$ is difficult to compute directly because the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$ and potential operator $\\hat{V}$ do not commute ($\\left[\\hat{T}, \\hat{V}\\right] \\neq 0$). The split-operator method approximates the evolution by separating the kinetic and potential propagations. A second-order accurate symmetric splitting, also known as the Strang splitting, is employed:\n$$\ne^{-(\\hat{T} + \\hat{V})\\Delta\\tau} \\approx e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau/2} \\, e^{-\\hat{T}\\Delta\\tau} \\, e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau/2} + O(\\Delta\\tau^3)\n$$\nThis scheme is implemented algorithmically for a single time step from $\\tau$ to $\\tau + \\Delta\\tau$:\n\n1.  **Potential Half-Step:** The wavefunction is first propagated under the potential operator for a half-step $\\Delta\\tau/2$. This operation is local in position space and amounts to a simple multiplication. For the nonlinear GPE, the potential must be calculated using the current state $\\psi(x,\\tau)$:\n    $$\n    \\psi'(x) = e^{-(V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) + g|\\psi(x,\\tau)|^2)\\Delta\\tau/2} \\psi(x,\\tau)\n    $$\n2.  **Kinetic Full-Step:** The kinetic energy operator $\\hat{T}$ is local in momentum (or $k$) space. The propagation is most efficiently performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The state $\\psi'(x)$ is transformed to Fourier space, $\\tilde{\\psi}'(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\psi'(x)\\}$. In this basis, the kinetic operator is diagonal, $\\hat{T}_k = k^2/2$, so the propagation is a multiplication:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{\\psi}''(k) = e^{-k^2\\Delta\\tau/2} \\tilde{\\psi}'(k)\n    $$\n    The result is then transformed back to position space: $\\psi''(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\tilde{\\psi}''(k)\\}$. The wavevector grid $k_j$ must be consistent with the spatial grid $x_j$, which is achieved using the `fftfreq` function, where $k_j = 2\\pi f_j$ and $f_j$ are the discrete frequencies. For a spatial domain of length $L$ with $N$ points and grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, the wavevectors are $k = 2\\pi \\cdot \\texttt{fftfreq}(N, d=\\Delta x)$.\n\n3.  **Potential Half-Step (Second):** A final propagation under the potential operator for another half-step $\\Delta\\tau/2$ completes the symmetric step. The potential is recalculated using the updated wavefunction $\\psi''(x)$ to ensure symmetry and stability:\n    $$\n    \\psi(x, \\tau+\\Delta\\tau)_{\\text{un-norm}} = e^{-(V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) + g|\\psi''(x)|^2)\\Delta\\tau/2} \\psi''(x)\n    $$\n4.  **Normalization:** Since imaginary-time evolution does not conserve the norm, the wavefunction must be renormalized after each full step to maintain the physical constraint $\\int |\\psi|^2 dx = 1$. The integral is approximated by a Riemann sum: $I = \\sum_j |\\psi_j|^2 \\Delta x$. The wavefunction is then updated as $\\psi_j \\to \\psi_j / \\sqrt{I}$.\n\nAfter a sufficient number of steps, $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$, the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ converges to the stationary ground state. The chemical potential $\\mu$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to this state, defined by the stationary GPE: $\\hat{H}\\psi(x) = \\mu\\psi(x)$. The value of $\\mu$ is computed as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the final normalized state:\n$$\n\\mu = \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(x) \\hat{H} \\psi(x) \\, dx\n$$\nThis expectation value is the sum of three energy contributions:\n- **Kinetic Energy:** $E_{kin} = \\int \\psi^*(x) \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\right) \\psi(x) \\, dx$. This is computed efficiently in Fourier space: $E_{kin} = \\int \\tilde{\\psi}^*(k) \\left(\\frac{k^2}{2}\\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(k) \\, dk$. Numerically, this is $\\sum_j |\\tilde{\\psi}_j|^2 \\frac{k_j^2}{2}$ (with appropriate FFT normalization) or, more directly, by applying the kinetic operator to $\\psi$ and computing the inner product: $E_{kin} \\approx \\Delta x \\sum_j \\psi_j^* \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{ (k^2/2) \\mathcal{F}\\{\\psi_j\\} \\}$.\n- **External Potential Energy:** $E_{pot, ext} = \\int V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, dx$. This is approximated by the sum $\\Delta x \\sum_j V_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x_j) |\\psi_j|^2$.\n- **Interaction Energy:** $E_{int} = \\int g |\\psi(x)|^4 \\, dx$. This is approximated by the sum $\\Delta x \\sum_j g |\\psi_j|^4$.\n\nThe chemical potential is the sum $\\mu = E_{kin} + E_{pot, ext} + E_{int}$. The algorithm is applied to each of the three test cases specified, yielding their respective chemical potentials.",
