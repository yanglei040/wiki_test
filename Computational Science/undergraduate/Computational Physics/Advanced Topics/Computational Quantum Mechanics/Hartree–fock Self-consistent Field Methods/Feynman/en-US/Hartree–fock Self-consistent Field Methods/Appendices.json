            "solution": "The problem is to compute the total restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) electronic energy for a helium atom in a minimal STO-3G basis. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. All necessary data are provided.\n\nThe system is a closed-shell atom with $N=2$ electrons. Both electrons occupy a single spatial orbital, which we denote as $\\psi_{1}$. This spatial orbital is constructed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). In this case, the basis is minimal, consisting of a single normalized $1s$-type function $\\chi_{1}$. The expansion is therefore trivial:\n$$ \\psi_{1} = c_{11} \\chi_{1} $$\nThe normalization condition for the spatial orbital is $\\langle \\psi_1 | \\psi_1 \\rangle = 1$. Expanding this gives:\n$$ \\langle c_{11} \\chi_{1} | c_{11} \\chi_{1} \\rangle = |c_{11}|^2 \\langle \\chi_{1} | \\chi_{1} \\rangle = |c_{11}|^2 S_{11} = 1 $$\nWe are given that the basis is orthonormal, meaning the overlap matrix element is $S_{11} = 1$. This implies $|c_{11}|^2 = 1$. We can choose the real, positive coefficient $c_{11}=1$, which means the spatial orbital is identical to the basis function:\n$$ \\psi_{1} = \\chi_{1} $$\nThe first step is to construct the Fock matrix. For a closed-shell RHF calculation, the elements of the Fock matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ are given by:\n$$ F_{\\mu\\nu} = h_{\\mu\\nu} + \\sum_{\\lambda\\sigma} P_{\\lambda\\sigma} \\left[ (\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma) \\right] $$\nwhere $h_{\\mu\\nu}$ are the one-electron (core) integrals, $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)$ are the two-electron repulsion integrals, and $P_{\\lambda\\sigma}$ are the elements of the density matrix. The indices $\\mu, \\nu, \\lambda, \\sigma$ refer to the basis functions. In this problem, we have only one basis function, $\\chi_{1}$, so all indices must be $1$.\n\nThe density matrix elements $P_{\\lambda\\sigma}$ are defined as:\n$$ P_{\\lambda\\sigma} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} c_{\\lambda i}^{*} c_{\\sigma i} $$\nwhere the sum is over the occupied spatial orbitals. Here, we have one occupied orbital ($i=1$) with $N=2$ electrons, and the coefficient is $c_{11}=1$. Thus, the only non-zero density matrix element is:\n$$ P_{11} = 2 c_{11}^{*} c_{11} = 2(1)(1) = 2 $$\nNow we can construct the single element of the Fock matrix, $F_{11}$:\n$$ F_{11} = h_{11} + \\sum_{\\lambda=1} \\sum_{\\sigma=1} P_{\\lambda\\sigma} \\left[ (11|\\lambda\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2}(1\\lambda|1\\sigma) \\right] $$\nWith $\\lambda=1$ and $\\sigma=1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ F_{11} = h_{11} + P_{11} \\left[ (11|11) - \\frac{1}{2}(11|11) \\right] = h_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} P_{11} (11|11) $$\nSubstituting $P_{11}=2$:\n$$ F_{11} = h_{11} + \\frac{1}{2}(2)(11|11) = h_{11} + (11|11) $$\nWe are given the integral values $h_{11} = -2.038$ and $(11|11) = 1.216$. We can now compute the numerical value of $F_{11}$:\n$$ F_{11} = -2.038 + 1.216 = -0.822 $$\nThe next step is to compute the total RHF electronic energy, $E$. A general formula for the total energy in terms of the density and Fock matrices is:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mu\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu} (h_{\\mu\\nu} + F_{\\mu\\nu}) $$\nFor our minimal basis system, this sum collapses to a single term:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2} P_{11} (h_{11} + F_{11}) $$\nSubstituting the known values for $P_{11}$, $h_{11}$, and the calculated value for $F_{11}$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2} (2) (-2.038 + (-0.822)) = 1 \\times (-2.860) = -2.860 $$\nThe total electronic energy is $E = -2.860$ Hartree.\n\nAlternatively, the total energy for a two-electron system in a single spatial orbital $\\psi_1$ is given by the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian:\n$$ E = \\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H}_{el} | \\Psi \\rangle $$\nwhere the Slater determinant is $\\Psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\psi_1\\alpha \\psi_1\\beta|$ and $\\hat{H}_{el} = \\hat{h}_1 + \\hat{h}_2 + r_{12}^{-1}$. This evaluates to:\n$$ E = 2 \\langle \\psi_1 | \\hat{h} | \\psi_1 \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_1 \\psi_1 | r_{12}^{-1} | \\psi_1 \\psi_1 \\rangle $$\nSince $\\psi_1 = \\chi_1$, this becomes:\n$$ E = 2 h_{11} + (11|11) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ E = 2(-2.038) + 1.216 = -4.076 + 1.216 = -2.860 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The result $-2.860$ already has four significant figures.",

Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) for Closed-Shell Systems**\n\nFor a closed-shell system ($N_\\alpha = N_\\beta$), RHF uses a single set of spatial orbitals for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The electronic state has $N_e/2$ doubly occupied orbitals. The central equation is the Roothaan-Hall equation:\n$$\nFC = SCE\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the Fock matrix, $C$ is the matrix of MO coefficients, $S$ is the AO overlap matrix, and $E$ is a diagonal matrix of orbital energies $\\varepsilon_a$. The Fock matrix is given by:\n$$\nF = H_{\\mathrm{core}} + G(D)\n$$\nThe matrix $G$ represents the average two-electron potential, with elements:\n$$\nG_{ij} = \\sum_{k,l} D_{kl} \\left[ 2(ij|kl) - (ik|jl) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the spinless density matrix, defined from the MO coefficients of the $N_e/2$ occupied orbitals:\n$$\nD_{kl} = \\sum_{a=1}^{N_e/2} C_{ka} C_{la}^*\n$$\nThe total RHF electronic energy is given by:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{RHF}} = \\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} (H_{\\mathrm{core},ij} + F_{ij}) = \\mathrm{Tr}[D(H_{\\mathrm{core}} + F)]\n$$\n\n**B. Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF)**\n\nUHF allows different spatial orbitals for spin-up ($\\alpha$) and spin-down ($\\beta$) electrons.

Algorithmic Implementation\n\nBoth RHF and UHF are solved iteratively:\n1.  **Compute Integrals**: Evaluate and store all one-electron ($S, T, V$) and two-electron ($ij|kl$) integrals. Form $H_{\\mathrm{core}}$.\n2.  **Initial Guess**: An initial guess for the density matrix is obtained by diagonalizing the core Hamiltonian. The generalized eigenvalue problem $H_{\\mathrm{core}}C = SCE$ is solved, and the MOs corresponding to the lowest energies are used to construct the initial density matrix/matrices. For UHF, the initial guess is symmetric, $P^\\alpha_0 = P^\\beta_0$.\n3.  **SCF Cycle**:\n    a. Construct the Fock matrix (or matrices for UHF) using the current density matrix/matrices.\n    b. Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem(s) $FC=SCE$ to obtain new MO coefficients and orbital energies.\n    c. Form new density matrix/matrices from the MO coefficients of the occupied orbitals ($N_e/2=1$ for RHF, $N_\\alpha=1$, $N_\\beta=1$ for UHF).\n    d. Check for convergence. The process is stopped if the maximum absolute change in the density matrix elements between iterations is below a threshold (e.g., $10^{-9}$).\n    e. If not converged, mix the new and old density matrices to aid stability and repeat the cycle.\n4.  **Post-SCF**: Once converged, compute the total electronic energy and the required observables. For the specified closed-shell systems, the UHF solution is expected to collapse to the RHF solution, meaning $P^\\alpha \\approx P^\\beta$, $\\varepsilon^\\alpha_k \\approx \\varepsilon^\\beta_k$, and $E_{\\mathrm{UHF}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{RHF}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and testing of a one-dimensional Hartree-Fock exchange operator, a fundamental concept in computational quantum physics. The validity of the problem statement is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary parameters and definitions for a direct, verifiable computation. We shall proceed with a systematic, principle-based solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the action of the exchange operator $K$ on a spatial orbital $\\phi(x)$. The operator is defined by the integral transformation:\n$$\n(K\\phi)(x) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\psi_j(x)\\,\\int_{-L}^{L} w(x,x')\\,\\psi_j(x')\\,\\phi(x')\\,dx'\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\psi_j(x)\\}_{j=1}^M$ are the occupied orbitals and $w(x,x')$ is the interaction kernel.\n\nFirst, we establish the computational domain. The problem is defined on the interval $[-L, L]$ with $L=10$. This interval is discretized into a uniform grid of $N=801$ points, denoted by the vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N)$. The grid spacing is constant, given by $\\Delta x = \\frac{2L}{N-1}$. Any continuous function $f(x)$ is thus represented by a vector $\\mathbf{f}$ of its values at the grid points, $\\mathbf{f} = (f(x_1), f(x_2), \\dots, f(x_N))$.\n\nThe occupied orbitals, $\\psi_1(x)$ and $\\psi_2(x)$, and the test orbitals are based on the Gaussian function:\n$$\ng(x;c,\\sigma) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{(x-c)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nFor computational purposes, these orbitals are represented as vectors on the grid. They must be normalized according to the discrete $\\ell^2$ inner product, such that the norm is unity:\n$$\n\\|\\psi_j\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\psi_j(x_i)|^2 \\,\\Delta x} \\;=\\; 1\n$$\nThis is achieved by first evaluating the unnormalized Gaussian function on the grid to obtain a vector $\\mathbf{g}$, computing its discrete norm $\\|\\mathbf{g}\\|_2$, and then scaling the vector as $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j = \\mathbf{g} / \\|\\mathbf{g}\\|_2$. The specified occupied orbitals are $\\psi_1 \\propto g(x; c_1=-2.5, \\sigma_1=0.7)$ and $\\psi_2 \\propto g(x; c_2=2.5, \\sigma_2=1.0)$, with $M=2$.\n\nThe integral in the definition of the exchange operator is discretized using a Riemann sum. The action of the operator on a grid-represented orbital $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ yields a new grid-represented orbital $\\mathbf{K\\phi}$, where the $i$-th component is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{K\\phi})_i \\;=\\; (K\\phi)(x_i) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\psi_j(x_i) \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{k=1}^{N} w(x_i,x_k)\\,\\psi_j(x_k)\\,\\phi(x_k) \\right)\n$$\nThe interaction kernel $w(x,x') = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(x-x')^2 + \\alpha^2}}$ is represented by an $N \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, where its elements are $W_{ik} = w(x_i, x_k)$.\n\nTo translate this expression into an efficient numerical algorithm, we leverage matrix-vector operations. For each occupied orbital $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j$:\n1.  Form the element-wise product of $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j$ and the input orbital $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$. Let us call this vector $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j$, with elements $(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j)_k = \\psi_j(x_k)\\,\\phi(x_k)$.\n2.  The inner summation over $k$ is now a matrix-vector product between the kernel matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ and the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j$. Let us define the resulting vector as $\\mathbf{I}_j = \\Delta x \\, (\\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j)$. The components of this vector are $(\\mathbf{I}_j)_i = \\Delta x \\sum_{k=1}^{N} W_{ik} (\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j)_k$.\n3.  The final result is obtained by summing the contributions from all occupied orbitals. For each $j$, the contribution is the element-wise product of $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j$ and $\\mathbf{I}_j$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{K\\phi} \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j \\odot \\mathbf{I}_j \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j \\odot \\left( \\Delta x \\cdot (\\mathbf{W} (\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_j \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\phi})) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product. This fully vectorized approach is implemented using the `NumPy` library.\n\nThe test suite is designed to verify fundamental properties of the operator and its dependence on the softness parameter $\\alpha$:\n- **Test 1:** Verifies the linearity of the operator. The quantity $r_1 = \\| K(a\\phi_1 + b\\phi_2) - aK(\\phi_1) - bK(\\phi_2) \\|_2$ should be zero in exact arithmetic. The computed value will be a small number on the order of machine floating-point precision, representing the numerical error.\n- **Test 2:** Demonstrates the non-local nature of the exchange interaction. The change at a point $x_0$, $|(K\\phi_{\\mathrm{pert}})(x_0) - (K\\phi_b)(x_0)|$, is computed, where $\\phi_{\\mathrm{pert}}$ differs from $\\phi_b$ only by a small perturbation at a distant location. A non-zero result confirms that the operator's value at $x_0$ depends on the input function's values across the entire domain.\n- **Test 3:** Confirms that a zero input orbital maps to a zero output orbital, a direct consequence of linearity. The result $r_3 = \\|K(\\mathbf{0})\\|_\\infty$ must be exactly $0.0$.\n- **Tests 4 and 5:** Investigate the behavior of the operator as the softness parameter $\\alpha$ is varied. We compute the norm of the result, $\\|K(\\phi)\\|_2$, for a small $\\alpha=0.2$ and a large $\\alpha=2.0$. A smaller $\\alpha$ leads to a more sharply peaked kernel, resembling the true Coulomb potential more closely and resulting in a stronger interaction (larger norm). Conversely, a larger $\\alpha$ 'softens' or smooths the interaction, leading to a weaker effect (smaller norm).\n\nThe implementation will construct a function for each test, which will be called in sequence to generate the final list of results $[r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5]$.",
