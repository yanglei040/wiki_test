            "problem": "You are to write a complete program that compares two adaptive step-size strategies for integrating a scalar initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation. Consider an initial value problem of the form $y'(t)=f(t,y)$ with $y(t_0)=y_0$ on a finite interval $[t_0,t_f]$. For each test case below, integrate from $t_0$ to $t_f$ and produce two summaries, one for an embedded Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg $4(5)$ method and one for a step-doubling strategy built on the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. For each strategy, report the total number of function evaluations and the arithmetic mean of the accepted step sizes.\n\nMathematical specifications that must be followed exactly for both strategies:\n- Error scaling: For a trial step from $(t,y)$ with stepsize $h$, define the scalar scale $s=\\max\\{|y|,|y_{\\mathrm{trial}}|\\}$, the tolerance $T=\\text{atol}+\\text{rtol}\\cdot s$, and an error estimate $E\\ge 0$ computed by the strategy. A trial step is accepted if and only if $E\\le T$. If accepted, update $(t,y)\\leftarrow (t+h,y_{\\mathrm{accept}})$. If the trial step would overshoot $t_f$, replace $h$ by $t_f-t$ before the trial.\n- Step-size update: Let the method’s effective local error order be $q=5$ so that the local error behaves as $\\mathcal{O}(h^q)$. After any trial (accepted or rejected), define the growth factor\n$$\ng=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\max(g_{\\min},\\min(g_{\\max},\\,\\sigma\\,(T/\\max(E,\\varepsilon))^{1/q} )), & E>0,\\\\\ng_{\\max}, & E=0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith fixed constants $\\sigma=0.9$, $g_{\\min}=0.2$, $g_{\\max}=5$, and $\\varepsilon=10^{-30}$. Then set the next trial step size to $h\\leftarrow \\max(h_{\\min},\\min(h_{\\max},g\\,h))$ with $h_{\\min}=10^{-12}$ and $h_{\\max}=t_f-t_0$. The initial step size must be $h_0=(t_f-t_0)/50$ for all test cases.\n- Angle unit: All occurrences of trigonometric functions use radians.\n\nEmbedded Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg $4(5)$ method details:\n- Use the classical Fehlberg coefficients with $6$ stages.

The output must be printed as a single line in the exact format of a Python list, for example:\n[[N1_RKF45,N1_SD,mean_h1_RKF45,mean_h1_SD],[N2_RKF45,N2_SD,mean_h2_RKF45,mean_h2_SD],[N3_RKF45,N3_SD,mean_h3_RKF45,mean_h3_SD]]\n\nNo additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The task is to implement and compare two adaptive step-size control strategies for solving scalar ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The fundamental principle of adaptive integration is to dynamically adjust the step size $h$ to ensure that the local truncation error per step remains within a user-defined tolerance. This approach is significantly more efficient than using a fixed step size, as it allows the integrator to take large steps when the solution is smooth and small steps when it changes rapidly.\n\nThe control mechanism for both strategies is governed by a common framework. At each time $t$ with solution $y$, a trial step of size $h$ is attempted. This yields a trial solution $y_{\\mathrm{trial}}$ and an estimate of the local error, $E \\ge 0$. The step is deemed acceptable if $E \\le T$, where $T$ is the tolerance, defined as a combination of relative and absolute tolerances: $T = \\text{atol} + \\text{rtol} \\cdot s$, with the scale factor $s = \\max\\{|y|, |y_{\\mathrm{trial}}|\\}$. If the step is accepted, the solution is advanced to $(t+h, y_{\\mathrm{accept}})$.\n\nRegardless of whether the step is accepted or rejected, the step size for the next trial, $h_{\\text{new}}$, is computed based on the observed error. The problem specifies a standard update rule:\n$$\nh_{\\text{new}} = g \\cdot h_{\\text{old}}\n$$\nwhere $g$ is a growth factor. For a method whose local error estimate behaves as $\\mathcal{O}(h^q)$, the ideal factor would be $(T/E)^{1/q}$. To ensure stability, this factor is moderated:\n$$\ng =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\max\\left(g_{\\min}, \\min\\left(g_{\\max}, \\sigma \\left(\\frac{T}{\\max(E, \\varepsilon)}\\right)^{1/q}\\right)\\right), & E > 0 \\\\\ng_{\\max}, & E = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma < 1$ is a safety factor, $\\varepsilon$ is a very small number to prevent division by zero, and $g_{\\min}, g_{\\max}$ are bounds to prevent drastic changes in step size. The problem specifies $q=5$, $\\sigma=0.9$, $g_{\\min}=0.2$, $g_{\\max}=5$, and $\\varepsilon=10^{-30}$. The new step size is also clamped within $[h_{\\min}, h_{\\max}]$.\n\nThe two strategies differ solely in how they compute the trial solution and the error estimate $E$.\n\n**1. Embedded Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg $4(5)$ Method (RKF45)**\n\nThis is an \"embedded\" method, which uses a pair of Runge-Kutta formulas of different orders ($p=4$ and $p+1=5$) that share intermediate function evaluations (stages) to minimize computational cost. For a step size $h$, the method computes six stages, $k_1, \\dots, k_6$, which are then linearly combined to produce two approximations: a fourth-order solution $y_4$ and a fifth-order solution $y_5$.\n$$\ny_4 = y + h \\sum_{i=1}^6 b_i k_i, \\quad y_5 = y + h \\sum_{i=1}^6 b_i^* k_i\n$$\nThe problem specifies using the higher-order solution to advance the integration, so $y_{\\mathrm{trial}} = y_5$ and $y_{\\mathrm{accept}} = y_5$. The difference between the two solutions provides an asymptotically correct estimate of the local truncation error of the lower-order method:\n$$\nE = |y_5 - y_4| = \\mathcal{O}(h^5)\n$$\nThis error estimate is used in the step-size control logic. Since the error estimate is of order $5$, the specified controller parameter $q=5$ is appropriate. The entire procedure requires $6$ function evaluations per trial step.\n\n**2. Step-Doubling with Classical Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4)**\n\nThis strategy, based on Richardson extrapolation, uses a single underlying method (RK4, order $p=4$) to generate an error estimate. For a desired step size $h$, the solution is advanced from $t$ to $t+h$ in two different ways:\n- One single step of size $h$, yielding $y^{(1)} = \\Phi_h(y)$.\n- Two consecutive steps of size $h/2$, yielding $y^{(2)} = \\Phi_{h/2}(\\Phi_{h/2}(y))$.\n\nThe local truncation error of the more accurate solution, $y^{(2)}$, can be estimated from the difference between the two results:\n$$\nE = \\frac{|y^{(2)} - y^{(1)}|}{2^p - 1} = \\frac{|y^{(2)} - y^{(1)}|}{15}\n$$\nThis error estimate is also of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1}) = \\mathcal{O}(h^5)$, making $q=5$ the correct choice for the step-size controller. The problem specifies advancing the solution with the more accurate result, $y_{\\text{accept}} = y^{(2)}$. This technique is computationally intensive; a single trial requires one full step ($4$ function evaluations) and two half-steps ($2 \\times 4 = 8$ evaluations), for a total of $12$ function evaluations, as no stage computations are shared.\n\nThe program is structured around a general-purpose adaptive integration function that implements the main control loop. This function accepts a \"stepper\" function as an argument, which encapsulates the logic specific to either RKF45 or step-doubling. This design cleanly separates the control logic from the error estimation method. The main script defines the three specified ODE problems and, for each one, calls the integrator twice—once with the RKF45 stepper and once with the step-doubling stepper—to compute and report the required performance metrics.",

            "solution": "The problem statement presented is valid. It is a well-posed initial value problem grounded in the principles of classical Hamiltonian mechanics and numerical analysis. All parameters and conditions required for a unique solution are provided, and the tasks are clearly defined and scientifically sound. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe system under consideration is a simple pendulum described by the nondimensionalized, separable Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH(q,p) = T(p) + V(q) = \\frac{p^2}{2} + (1 - \\cos(q))\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the generalized coordinate (angle) and $p$ is the canonical momentum. The dynamics are governed by Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p, \\qquad \\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -\\sin(q)\n$$\n\nWe are tasked with implementing and comparing three numerical integration schemes. The performance of each method will be evaluated by computing the relative energy drift, $\\delta_H$, at a final time $T$:\n$$\n\\delta_H = \\frac{\\lvert H(q(T),p(T)) - H(q(0),p(0)) \\rvert}{H(q(0),p(0))}\n$$\n\n### 1. Second-Order Symplectic Integrator\n\nFor a separable Hamiltonian, one can construct symplectic integrators by composing the exact flows corresponding to the kinetic energy $T(p)$ and potential energy $V(q)$. The time evolution operator for a step of size $h$, $e^{h L_H}$, can be approximated using a symmetric splitting, such as the Strang splitting, which is second-order accurate.\n$$\n\\Phi_h \\approx \\Phi_V(h/2) \\circ \\Phi_T(h) \\circ \\Phi_V(h/2)\n$$\nHere, $\\Phi_T(\\tau)$ is the exact flow for time $\\tau$ under Hamiltonian $T(p)$, and $\\Phi_V(\\tau)$ is the exact flow for time $\\tau$ under Hamiltonian $V(q)$.\n\nThe flow under $T(p) = p^2/2$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = p, \\qquad \\frac{dp}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad q(\\tau) = q(0) + \\tau p(0), \\quad p(\\tau) = p(0)\n$$\nThe flow under $V(q) = 1 - \\cos(q)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = 0, \\qquad \\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\sin(q) \\quad \\implies \\quad q(\\tau) = q(0), \\quad p(\\tau) = p(0) - \\tau \\sin(q(0))\n$$\n\nApplying the composition $\\Phi_V(h/2) \\circ \\Phi_T(h) \\circ \\Phi_V(h/2)$ to the state $(q_n, p_n)$ to obtain $(q_{n+1}, p_{n+1})$ results in the Størmer-Verlet or leapfrog integration scheme:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Update momentum by a half-step: $p_{n+1/2} = p_n - \\frac{h}{2} \\sin(q_n)$\n    \\item Update position by a full step using the new momentum: $q_{n+1} = q_n + h \\cdot p_{n+1/2}$\n    \\item Update momentum by a second half-step using the new position: $p_{n+1} = p_{n+1/2} - \\frac{h}{2} \\sin(q_{n+1})$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThis method is symplectic for a fixed step size $h$, meaning it exactly preserves a nearby shadow Hamiltonian, which leads to excellent long-term energy stability (bounded energy error). For the fixed-step simulation, this scheme is applied repeatedly with a constant $h$.\n\n### 2. Adaptive Step Size Control\n\nAn adaptive step size controller adjusts the step size $h$ to maintain a local error estimate below a given tolerance $\\text{tol}$. The problem specifies a step-doubling approach. Given a state $\\mathbf{y}_n = (q_n, p_n)^T$, we compute the state at $t_n+h$ in two ways:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item One step of size $h$: $\\mathbf{y}_1 = \\Psi_h(\\mathbf{y}_n)$\n    \\item Two steps of size $h/2$: $\\mathbf{y}_2 = \\Psi_{h/2}(\\Psi_{h/2}(\\mathbf{y}_n))$\n\\end{enumerate}\nwhere $\\Psi_h$ is the numerical integration map for one step.\n\nFor a method of order $p$, the local truncation error is $O(h^{p+1})$. The error in the less accurate solution, $\\mathbf{y}_1$, is approximately $C h^{p+1}$, while the error in the more accurate solution, $\\mathbf{y}_2$, is approximately $2C(h/2)^{p+1} = C h^{p+1}/2^p$. The difference $\\Delta \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{y}_1 - \\mathbf{y}_2$ serves as an estimate of the local error. We use its Euclidean norm, $\\text{err} = \\lVert \\Delta \\mathbf{y} \\rVert_2$, as the error indicator.\n\nThe step control logic is as follows:\n- If $\\text{err} \\le \\text{tol}$, the step is accepted. The state is advanced to $\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_2$ (the more accurate result).\n- If $\\text{err} > \\text{tol}$, the step is rejected, and a smaller step size is chosen to retry from $\\mathbf{y}_n$.\n\nThe new step size $h_{\\text{new}}$ is determined by relating the current error to the desired tolerance. Since $\\text{err} \\propto h^{p+1}$, we desire $\\text{tol} \\propto h_{\\text{new}}^{p+1}$. This leads to the update rule:\n$$\nh_{\\text{new}} = S \\cdot h \\left( \\frac{\\text{tol}}{\\text{err}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p+1}}\n$$\nwhere $S$ is a safety factor (typically $S \\approx 0.9$) to prevent frequent rejections. The step size is also constrained by a minimum $h_{\\min}$ and maximum $h_{\\max}$. For the second-order symplectic integrator, the order is $p=2$. Varying the step size breaks the exact symplecticity of the method, but it can still provide better energy conservation than a non-symplectic method.\n\n### 3. Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)\n\nFor comparison, a non-symplectic method is used: the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. For an ODE system $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{y})$, the update rule for a step of size $h$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n, \\mathbf{y}_n) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h/2, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h/2, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h, \\mathbf{y}_n + h\\mathbf{k}_3) \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{h}{6}(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nIn our case, $\\mathbf{y} = (q, p)^T$ and the function $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y}) = (p, -\\sin(q))^T$ is autonomous. This method is not symplectic and is expected to exhibit secular energy drift over long integrations.\n\nThe adaptive step size control for RK4 employs the same step-doubling strategy. The only difference is the order of the method, which is $p=4$. The step size adaptation formula therefore uses the exponent $1/(p+1) = 1/5$. The implementation will follow the same logic as for the adaptive symplectic integrator but using the RK4 step function and the appropriate order.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard problem from computational physics: the analysis of numerical artifacts in the integration of ordinary differential equations. Specifically, it asks to quantify the phenomenon of phase locking, where the internal time steps of an adaptive integrator synchronize with a periodic feature of the system, such as an external driving force. The methodology is clearly defined, using the Rayleigh resultant as a standard statistical measure for circular data. All parameters and test cases are specified unambiguously. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is the second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for a damped, driven harmonic oscillator:\n$$\n\\ddot{x}(t) + 2\\zeta \\,\\omega_0 \\,\\dot{x}(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\, x(t) = F \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nwith initial conditions $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$.\n\nTo solve this numerically, we must first convert it into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [y_1(t), y_2(t)]^T$, where $y_1(t) = x(t)$ is the position and $y_2(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$ is the velocity.

Such integrators, like the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg or Dormand-Prince methods, adapt the step size $h_k = t_{k+1} - t_k$ at each step $k$ to ensure the estimated local truncation error remains within a bound defined by the user-specified relative tolerance, $r_{\\text{tol}}$, and absolute tolerance, $a_{\\text{tol}}$. The sequence of time points $\\{t_k\\}$ is therefore not uniform but is determined dynamically by the solver based on the solution's local behavior.\n\nThe central hypothesis is that the solver's step-selection algorithm may \"lock on\" to the period of the driving force, $T_{drive} = 2\\pi/\\omega$. To investigate this, we analyze the distribution of the internal time steps $\\{t_k\\}$ chosen by the solver. First, we discard the initial portion of the integration corresponding to the first $N_{\\text{burn}}$ periods to eliminate the influence of transient behavior, which decays with a time constant related to $( \\zeta \\omega_0 )^{-1}$. The cutoff time is $t_{\\text{burn}} = N_{\\text{burn}} \\cdot (2\\pi/\\omega)$.\n\nFor the remaining $N$ time stamps $\\{t_k\\}$ where $t_k > t_{\\text{burn}}$, we compute the corresponding phase angle $\\phi_k$ with respect to the driving period:\n$$\n\\phi_k = (\\omega t_k) \\pmod{2\\pi}\n$$\nThis calculation maps each time point onto the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, representing its position within a driving cycle.\n\nTo quantify the degree of clustering of these phases, we employ the Rayleigh resultant, $R$. Each phase $\\phi_k$ is represented as a unit vector $e^{i\\phi_k}$ in the complex plane. The Rayleigh resultant is the magnitude of the average of these vectors:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{N}\\left|\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\phi_k}\\right|\n$$\nIf the phases $\\{\\phi_k\\}$ are uniformly distributed, the vectors will tend to cancel each other out, resulting in an $R$ value close to $0$. Conversely, if the phases are tightly clustered around a specific value, the vectors will add constructively, yielding an $R$ value close to $1$. This provides a robust metric for phase locking.\n\nFor implementation, we will use the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function, a high-quality numerical ODE solver from the SciPy library. By calling it with `t_eval=None` (the default), the solver returns its solution at the internally chosen time steps, which are stored in the `t` attribute of the output object. This is precisely the internal time mesh required by the problem. We use the `'RK45'` method, which is a standard choice for an adaptive-step-size algorithm.\n\nThe procedure for each test case will be as follows:\n1. Define the parameters $(\\omega_0, \\zeta, F, \\omega, r_{\\text{tol}}, a_{\\text{tol}}, N_{\\text{periods}}, N_{\\text{burn}})$.\n2. Set up the ODE function $\\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{y})$ and the integration time span $[0, t_{\\text{end}}]$.\n3. Call `solve_ivp` to perform the numerical integration and obtain the internal time mesh $\\{t_k\\}$.\n4. Filter this mesh to retain only points where $t_k > t_{\\text{burn}}$.\n5. Compute the phases $\\phi_k = (\\omega t_k) \\pmod{2\\pi}$ for the filtered time points.\n6. Calculate the Rayleigh resultant $R$ from the phases.\nThe results from all four test cases will then be formatted and printed as required.",
