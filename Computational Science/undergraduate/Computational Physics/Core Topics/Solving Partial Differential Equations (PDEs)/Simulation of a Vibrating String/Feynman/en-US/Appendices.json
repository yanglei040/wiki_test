            "problem": "You are to derive, implement, and test a numerical simulation of a taut, uniform string subject to small transverse vibrations, in which two localized Gaussian wave packets travel in opposite directions, superpose, and interfere. Your program must implement an explicit finite-difference time-domain scheme for the one-dimensional wave equation with fixed-end boundary conditions. The program must run without user input and must output a single line containing the results for the specified test suite.\n\nPhysical and mathematical base:\n- Start from Newton’s second law applied to a uniformly dense string: a small segment of linear mass density $\\mu$ subject to nearly horizontal tension $T$ yields the continuum equation $\\mu \\partial^2 u / \\partial t^2 = T \\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2$, where $u(x,t)$ is the transverse displacement. Define the wave speed $c$ by $c^2 = T/\\mu$ to obtain the wave equation $\\partial^2 u / \\partial t^2 = c^2 \\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2$.\n- Impose fixed-end (Dirichlet) boundary conditions $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(L,t)=0$, with $L$ the string length.\n- Use a uniform spatial grid with spacing $\\Delta x$ and a uniform time step $\\Delta t$ satisfying the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for stability.\n- Discretize the wave equation using centered second-order differences in space and time, producing an explicit update for $u_i^{n+1}$ in terms of $u_i^n$ and $u_i^{n-1}$, where $u_i^n$ approximates $u(x_i, t_n)$ at $x_i = i \\Delta x$ and $t_n = n \\Delta t$. Derive the second-order accurate first-step formula for $u_i^1$ from a Taylor expansion using the initial velocity $v(x)=\\partial u/\\partial t(x,0)$.\n- Choose the initial displacement $u(x,0)$ to be the sum of two Gaussian profiles centered at $x=x_1$ and $x=x_2$ with amplitudes $A_1$ and $A_2$ and widths $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$. Choose the initial velocity $v(x)$ so that the first Gaussian travels to the right with speed $c$ and the second Gaussian travels to the left with speed $c$. Derive the needed $v(x)$ explicitly in terms of $u(x,0)$ constructed from the two Gaussians and their spatial derivatives. Do not use any shortcut formulas beyond the fundamental laws and definitions described above; derive what you need from first principles and standard calculus.\n- The total mechanical energy of the string (per unit width out of plane) is $E(t) = \\int_0^L \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left[(\\partial u/\\partial t)^2 + c^2 (\\partial u/\\partial x)^2\\right] \\, dx$. For fixed ends and no external forcing, $E(t)$ should be approximately conserved in the numerical simulation as long as wave packets do not reach the boundaries during the simulated time.\n\nNumerical specifications:\n- Use units of meters for $x$ and $u$, and seconds for $t$. The wave speed $c$ is in meters per second. All reported displacement quantities and errors must be in meters. Any reported energy changes are dimensionless ratios. No angles are involved.\n- Use a spatial grid of $N_x$ points on $[0,L]$ with $x_i = i \\Delta x$, where $\\Delta x = L/(N_x-1)$.\n- Use a time step $\\Delta t$ satisfying $0 < \\lambda \\le 1$, where $\\lambda = c \\Delta t / \\Delta x$ is the Courant number. Use $\\lambda$ strictly less than $1$ for stability. Define and use a specific $\\lambda$ of your choice in your implementation, and compute $\\Delta t$ accordingly.\n\nObservables to compute:\n- Let $t_\\star$ be the time when the centers of the two Gaussian wave packets coincide, and let $x_\\star$ be the collision location. Compute the simulated string displacement at $(x_\\star, t_\\star)$ by temporal interpolation if $t_\\star$ does not land exactly on a time step and by using the nearest grid point to $x_\\star$ if $x_\\star$ is not exactly a grid point. Report the absolute error at the collision for two test cases: one with constructive interference (both amplitudes positive) and one with destructive interference (opposite-sign amplitudes). Errors must be in meters.\n- For a third test case (different parameter set), compute the relative change in total energy between $t=0$ and $t=t_\\star$, defined as $|E(t_\\star)-E(0)|/E(0)$, and report whether this relative change is strictly less than a chosen tolerance (return a boolean). Choose the simulation parameters and $t_\\star$ so that the wave packets remain well separated from the boundaries for $0 \\le t \\le t_\\star$.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide three parameter sets. In each case, the domain is $[0,L]$ with $L$ in meters, wave speed $c$ in meters per second, and Gaussian parameters in meters.\n- Case A (constructive interference):\n  - $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.010$, $A_2 = 0.020$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.050$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.050$, $x_1 = 0.300$, $x_2 = 0.700$.\n  - The expected collision occurs at $t_\\star = (x_2 - x_1)/(2c)$ and $x_\\star = (x_1 + x_2)/2$. The expected displacement at $(x_\\star, t_\\star)$ is $A_1 + A_2$. Your program must output the absolute error in meters for this case as the first number.\n- Case B (destructive interference):\n  - $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.015$, $A_2 = -0.015$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.040$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.040$, $x_1 = 0.350$, $x_2 = 0.650$.\n  - The expected displacement at $(x_\\star, t_\\star)$ is $0.0$. Your program must output the absolute error in meters for this case as the second number.\n- Case C (energy check):\n  - $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.010$, $A_2 = 0.013$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.030$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.070$, $x_1 = 0.250$, $x_2 = 0.750$.\n  - Compute the relative energy change $|E(t_\\star)-E(0)|/E(0)$ at $t_\\star = (x_2 - x_1)/(2c)$ and return a boolean that is true if this value is strictly less than a tolerance of $0.02$ and false otherwise. This boolean must be the third output.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use a second-order accurate explicit scheme in time and space, enforce $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(L,t)=0$ at all time steps, and initialize $u(x,0)$ as the sum of the two Gaussians. Derive and implement $v(x)=\\partial u/\\partial t(x,0)$ so that the first Gaussian travels rightward with speed $c$ and the second travels leftward with speed $c$.\n- Use a Courant number $\\lambda$ strictly less than $1$ for stability. Explicitly compute $\\Delta t$ from $\\lambda$, $c$, and $\\Delta x$.\n- Compute $E(0)$ using $v(x)$ and the spatial gradient of $u(x,0)$, and compute $E(t_\\star)$ using a consistent discrete approximation to $\\partial u/\\partial t$ and $\\partial u/\\partial x$ at $t_\\star$. Ensure that the simulated time span does not allow the packets to interact with the boundaries for any test case.\n- Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order: Case A error (meters), Case B error (meters), Case C energy-conservation boolean. For example: \"[0.00012,0.00003,True]\". Do not print any other text.\n\nAssumptions and constraints:\n- Use $N_x$ sufficiently large that $x_\\star$ lies on or very near a grid point and the Gaussians are well resolved. You must ensure $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$ and that $t_\\star$ is reached by the time integration for each case.\n- All floating-point outputs are to be given as raw decimal numbers; do not append units in the printed output. Internally, all quantities must be handled with the physically correct units as specified above.",
            "solution": "We begin from Newton’s second law applied to a differential element of a taut uniform string. Let $\\mu$ be the linear mass density (mass per unit length) and $T$ the constant tension. For small transverse displacements $u(x,t)$, the vertical force due to tension is $T \\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x$, which equals the element’s mass $\\mu \\, \\mathrm{d}x$ times its vertical acceleration $\\partial^2 u / \\partial t^2$. Dividing by $\\mu \\, \\mathrm{d}x$ yields the standard wave equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}, \\quad c^2 = \\frac{T}{\\mu}.\n$$\nWe impose fixed ends $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(L,t)=0$, and choose initial conditions $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$ and $u_t(x,0)=v_0(x)$ to launch two oppositely traveling Gaussian wave packets.\n\nFinite-difference scheme:\nDiscretize space on a uniform grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$, $i=0,\\dots,N_x-1$ with $\\Delta x = L/(N_x-1)$, and time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, $n=0,1,2,\\dots$. Denote $u_i^n \\approx u(x_i,t_n)$. Use centered differences in space and time. The wave equation becomes\n$$\n\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2 u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2 u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2},\n$$\nor equivalently the explicit update\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = 2 u_i^n - u_i^{n-1} + \\lambda^2 \\left(u_{i+1}^n - 2 u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n \\right), \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}.\n$$\nThe Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition requires $0<\\lambda \\le 1$ for stability; we choose $\\lambda < 1$ strictly. Fixed ends are enforced by setting $u_0^n = 0$ and $u_{N_x-1}^n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nInitialization:\nWe require $u_i^0 = u_0(x_i)$ and $u_i^1$ to start the recurrence. A second-order Taylor expansion in time gives\n$$\nu(x,t+\\Delta t) = u(x,t) + \\Delta t \\, u_t(x,t) + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\, u_{tt}(x,t) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3).\n$$\nUsing the wave equation $u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}$ and the centered spatial Laplacian, we obtain the second-order accurate first step\n$$\nu_i^1 = u_i^0 + \\Delta t \\, v_0(x_i) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\left(u_{i+1}^0 - 2 u_i^0 + u_{i-1}^0\\right),\n$$\nwith boundary enforcement $u_0^1 = u_{N_x-1}^1 = 0$.\n\nConstructing counter-propagating Gaussians:\nWe define two Gaussian profiles\n$$\nf(x) = A_1 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x - x_1)^2}{2 \\sigma_1^2}\\right), \\quad\ng(x) = A_2 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x - x_2)^2}{2 \\sigma_2^2}\\right),\n$$\nand set the initial displacement to their sum $u_0(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. To make $f$ propagate rightward at speed $c$ and $g$ propagate leftward at speed $c$, we use the d’Alembert decomposition derived from the wave equation’s linearity and invariance: $u(x,t) = F(x - c t) + G(x + c t)$, where $F$ and $G$ are determined by initial data. Matching to $u_0(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ gives $F(x) = f(x)$ and $G(x) = g(x)$. Differentiating in time at $t=0$ yields\n$$\nv_0(x) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} = - c F'(x) + c G'(x) = - c f'(x) + c g'(x).\n$$\nFor the Gaussian derivative,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right)\\right]\n= - A \\frac{x - x_0}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right).\n$$\nThus we construct $v_0(x) = - c f'(x) + c g'(x)$ explicitly from the above expression.\n\nCollision time and location:\nThe centers of $f$ and $g$ are at $x_f(t) = x_1 + c t$ and $x_g(t) = x_2 - c t$. They meet when $x_f(t_\\star) = x_g(t_\\star)$, giving $t_\\star = (x_2 - x_1)/(2 c)$ and $x_\\star = (x_1 + x_2)/2$. At $(x_\\star,t_\\star)$, the continuous solution evaluates to $u(x_\\star,t_\\star) = f(x_1) + g(x_2) = A_1 + A_2$, independent of $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$. For destructive interference with $A_1 = -A_2$ and symmetric widths, the sum is $0$.\n\nEnergy and its discrete approximation:\nThe total energy is\n$$\nE(t) = \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 + c^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 \\right] dx,\n$$\nwhich is conserved for the continuous wave equation with fixed ends. Discretely, we approximate\n$$\nE^n \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (v_i^n)^2 + c^2 (D_x u_i^n)^2 \\right] \\Delta x,\n$$\nwhere $D_x u_i^n$ is a centered spatial difference for interior points,\n$$\nD_x u_i^n = \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n}{2 \\Delta x} \\quad \\text{for } 1 \\le i \\le N_x-2,\n$$\nwith one-sided differences at boundaries consistent with $u=0$. For $E^0$ we use $v_i^0 = v_0(x_i)$. For $E^n$ at later times, a centered time difference $v_i^n \\approx \\left(u_i^{n+1} - u_i^{n-1}\\right)/(2 \\Delta t)$ is second-order; in a two-level marching implementation, an accurate proxy is $v_i^{n} \\approx \\left(u_i^{n} - u_i^{n-1}\\right)/\\Delta t$ at the available time level, which suffices to monitor near-conservation over modest times before boundary interaction.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n1. Choose $N_x$ large and $\\lambda = c \\Delta t / \\Delta x$ strictly less than $1$; compute $\\Delta t$ from $\\lambda$.\n2. Build the grid $x_i$ on $[0,L]$ and assemble $u_i^0$ from the two Gaussians. Compute $v_i^0 = -c f'(x_i) + c g'(x_i)$. Enforce $u_0^0=u_{N_x-1}^0=0$ and $v_0^0=v_{N_x-1}^0=0$.\n3. Compute $u_i^1$ using the Taylor-based first-step formula and enforce boundary values.\n4. March in time with the explicit update until just past $t_\\star$. Detect the step where $t$ crosses $t_\\star$ and linearly interpolate in time at the grid index nearest to $x_\\star$ to estimate $u(x_\\star,t_\\star)$.\n5. Compute $E(0)$ from $u^0$ and $v^0$. Compute $E(t_\\star)$ from the two most recent time levels and spatial gradients. Form the relative energy change.\n6. Repeat for the three test cases.\n\nTest suite and outputs:\n- Case A: $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.010$, $A_2 = 0.020$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.050$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.050$, $x_1 = 0.300$, $x_2 = 0.700$. Compute the absolute error $|u(x_\\star,t_\\star) - (A_1 + A_2)|$ in meters.\n- Case B: $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.015$, $A_2 = -0.015$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.040$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.040$, $x_1 = 0.350$, $x_2 = 0.650$. Compute the absolute error $|u(x_\\star,t_\\star) - 0.0|$ in meters.\n- Case C: $L = 1.0$, $c = 1.0$, $A_1 = 0.010$, $A_2 = 0.013$, $\\sigma_1 = 0.030$, $\\sigma_2 = 0.070$, $x_1 = 0.250$, $x_2 = 0.750$. Compute the boolean that is true if $|E(t_\\star)-E(0)|/E(0) < 0.02$ and false otherwise.\n\nThe program outputs one line: a list with the Case A error (meters), the Case B error (meters), and the Case C boolean, in that order, formatted as a comma-separated list in square brackets with no extra text. The chosen grid and time step ensure that the wave packets do not reach the boundaries before $t_\\star$, making interference and energy diagnostics meaningful and boundary-reflection-free within the simulated window.",

You may assume all parameters are such that $c(x,t)$ remains real and strictly positive for all $x$ and $t$ of interest.\n\nYour tasks are:\n1) From the balance of forces on a small string element and the definition $c^2(x,t) = T(x,t)/\\rho$, where $T(x,t)$ is the local tension and $\\rho$ is the mass density per unit length, show that the governing equation above follows in the small-slope limit when light modulates tension as $T(x,t)=\\rho\\,c^2(x,t)$ with $c(x,t)$ as given.\n\n2) Discretize the equation on a uniform grid $x_i = i\\,\\Delta x$ for $i=0,1,\\dots,N-1$ with $\\Delta x = L/(N-1)$ and uniform time steps $t^n = n\\,\\Delta t$ for $n=0,1,2,\\dots$. Use centered differences in space on the flux $\\partial_x\\!\\big(c^2 u_x\\big)$ with half-node coefficients and centered differences in time for $u_{tt}$. That is, approximate\n$$\n\\big(c^2 u_x\\big)_x\\Big|_{x=x_i,\\,t=t^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}} \\;\\approx\\; \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\left[a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\,(u^n_{i+1}-u^n_i)-a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\,(u^n_i-u^n_{i-1})\\right],\n$$\nwhere $a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i\\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}}$ approximates $c^2\\!\\left(x_{i\\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}},t^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right)$ using arithmetic averages of nodal values of $a=c^2$. Derive the explicit update for $u^{n+1}_i$ at interior nodes $i=1,\\dots,N-2$, and a consistent second-order start-up formula for $u^1_i$ that uses $u^0_i$, $v^0_i$ and the spatial operator evaluated at $t^{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$.\n\n3) State a sufficient Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for stability in terms of $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta x$, and the maximum wave speed. Use it to choose $\\Delta t$ via $\\Delta t = C_{\\mathrm{CFL}}\\,\\Delta x/\\max_{x,t} c(x,t)$ with $0  C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} \\le 1$. For this problem, you must take $C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} = 0.9$ and note that $\\max_{x,t} c(x,t) = c_0$ for the given model.\n\n4) Implement the explicit scheme in a program that runs three specified test cases. Use fixed-end boundary conditions $u_0^n = u_{N-1}^n = 0$ for all $n$. The required observables and units are specified below.\n\nImplementation details and physical units:\n- All lengths must be in $\\mathrm{m}$, time in $\\mathrm{s}$, and wave speed in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.

            "solution": "The problem proposed is a standard, well-posed initial-boundary value problem from computational physics. It is scientifically sound, mathematically consistent, and all parameters and conditions required for a unique, stable numerical solution are provided. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive and implement a finite difference scheme for the one-dimensional wave equation with a variable coefficient, given by\n$$\nu_{tt}(x,t) \\;=\\; \\partial_x\\!\\big(c^2(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t)\\big)\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the transverse displacement of a string, and $c(x,t)$ is the non-uniform, time-dependent wave speed.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nWe begin from Newton's second law applied to an infinitesimal element of the string of length $\\Delta s$ between horizontal positions $x$ and $x+\\Delta x$. Let $\\rho$ be the constant linear mass density. The mass of the element is $\\Delta m = \\rho \\Delta s$. For small displacements, the slope $u_x = \\partial u/\\partial x$ is small, so the element length is approximately its horizontal projection, $\\Delta s \\approx \\Delta x$. The mass is then $\\Delta m \\approx \\rho \\Delta x$.\n\nThe net vertical force on the element is the difference in the vertical components of the tension force $T(x,t)$ acting at its ends. The vertical component of tension at a point is $T \\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of the string with the horizontal. In the small-slope approximation, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta = u_x$.\nThe net vertical force $\\Delta F_v$ is therefore\n$$\n\\Delta F_v \\;=\\; T(x+\\Delta x, t)\\,u_x(x+\\Delta x, t) - T(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t).\n$$\nAccording to Newton's second law, $F=ma$, the net force equals mass times acceleration, where the acceleration is the second partial derivative of displacement with respect to time, $u_{tt}$.\n$$\n(\\rho \\Delta x)\\, u_{tt}(x,t) \\;=\\; T(x+\\Delta x, t)\\,u_x(x+\\Delta x, t) - T(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t).\n$$\nDividing by $\\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$ gives the definition of the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\rho\\,u_{tt}(x,t) \\;=\\; \\partial_x \\big( T(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t) \\big).\n$$\nThe problem states that the wave speed squared is defined by $c^2(x,t) = T(x,t)/\\rho$, implying the tension is modulated as $T(x,t) = \\rho\\,c^2(x,t)$. Substituting this into the equation of motion yields\n$$\n\\rho\\,u_{tt}(x,t) \\;=\\; \\partial_x \\big( \\rho\\,c^2(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t) \\big).\n$$\nSince $\\rho$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the spatial derivative and canceled from both sides, which results in the specified governing equation:\n$$\nu_{tt}(x,t) \\;=\\; \\partial_x\\big(c^2(x,t)\\,u_x(x,t)\\big).\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The form of the equation is conservative because the spatial part is the divergence of a flux, in this case the flux of transverse momentum.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Finite Difference Scheme**\n\nWe discretize the domain with a uniform spatial grid $x_i = i\\,\\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where $\\Delta x = L/(N-1)$, and uniform time steps $t^n = n\\,\\Delta t$. The displacement is denoted by $u_i^n \\approx u(x_i, t^n)$.\n\nThe second time derivative $u_{tt}$ at $(x_i, t^n)$ is approximated using a second-order accurate centered difference:\n$$\nu_{tt}(x_i, t^n) \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2}.\n$$\nThe spatial operator $\\partial_x(c^2 u_x)$ is discretized as specified in the problem statement. This is a second-order accurate centered difference scheme for a flux term. Let $a(x,t) = c^2(x,t)$. The flux is $F(x,t) = a(x,t)u_x(x,t)$. We have $\\partial_x F \\approx (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2})/\\Delta x$. The fluxes at half-grid points are approximated as $F_{i\\pm 1/2} \\approx a_{i\\pm 1/2} (u_{i\\pm 1} - u_i)/\\Delta x$. This results in the specified form, which we denote $\\mathcal{L}[u]$. The problem requires evaluating the coefficients $a = c^2$ at the half-time step $t^{n+1/2}$, while using the displacement $u$ at time $t^n$. The full discrete equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\left[a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\,(u^n_{i+1}-u^n_i)-a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\,(u^n_i-u^n_{i-1})\\right],\n$$\nwhere the coefficients at half-nodes are arithmetic averages of the nodal values:\n$$\na^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i\\pm\\tfrac{1}{2}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\left( a(x_i, t^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) + a(x_{i\\pm 1}, t^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) \\right).\n$$\nThis scheme is explicit. Solving for $u_i^{n+1}$ gives the update rule for interior nodes ($i=1, \\dots, N-2$):\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} \\;=\\; 2u_i^n - u_i^{n-1} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\left[a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}(u^n_{i+1}-u^n_i)-a^{n+\\tfrac{1}{2}}_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}(u^n_i-u^n_{i-1})\\right].\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $u_0^n = 0$ and $u_{N-1}^n = 0$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the first time step ($n=0$), we need $u^1_i$. The general update requires $u^{-1}_i$, which is not given. We use the initial velocity $v_0(x) = u_t(x,0)$ and a centered difference approximation at $t=0$:\n$$\nv_i^0 \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{u_i^1 - u_i^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} \\quad\\implies\\quad u_i^{-1} \\;=\\; u_i^1 - 2\\Delta t v_i^0.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the update rule for $n=0$ gives:\n$$\nu_i^1 \\;=\\; 2u_i^0 - (u_i^1 - 2\\Delta t v_i^0) + \\Delta t^2 \\mathcal{L}^{1/2}[u^0]_i,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}^{1/2}[u^0]_i$ is the spatial operator with coefficients evaluated at $t^{1/2}=\\Delta t/2$ and applied to $u^0$. Solving for $u_i^1$ yields the second-order accurate start-up formula:\n$$\nu_i^1 \\;=\\; u_i^0 + \\Delta t v_i^0 + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\mathcal{L}^{1/2}[u^0]_i.\n$$\nThis formula is consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\n**3. Stability Condition**\n\nFor an explicit finite difference scheme for the wave equation, stability is governed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. For a variable wave speed $c(x,t)$, a sufficient condition for stability is that the numerical domain of dependence must contain the physical domain of dependence. This leads to the requirement:\n$$\nC_{\\text{CFL}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\max_{x,t} c(x,t) \\cdot \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\;\\le\\; 1.\n$$\nThe wave speed is given by $c(x,t) = c_0\\sqrt{1 - \\beta I(x,t)}$. Since $0 \\le \\beta  1$ and the intensity term $I(x,t) = \\exp(\\dots)$ is non-negative, the maximum value of $c(x,t)$ occurs where $I(x,t)$ is minimum. The minimum value of $I(x,t)$ is $0$, which occurs as $|x-x_s(t)| \\to \\infty$. Thus, $\\max_{x,t} c(x,t) = c_0$.\nThe stability condition simplifies to $c_0 \\Delta t / \\Delta x \\le 1$. The problem specifies choosing the time step as\n$$\n\\Delta t = 0.9 \\frac{\\Delta x}{c_0},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to a Courant number $C_{\\text{CFL}} = 0.9$. Since $0.9 \\le 1$, the scheme is stable under this choice.\n\n**4. Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe numerical scheme is implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient array operations.\n- The simulation state is maintained by three arrays: `u_prev` ($u^{n-1}$), `u_curr` ($u^n$), and `u_next` ($u^{n+1}$).\n- The simulation starts by initializing `u_curr` from the initial condition $u_0(x)$ and applying boundary conditions.\n- The first time step computes $u^1$ using the derived start-up formula, which is a special case since the initial velocity $v_0(x)=0$ for all test cases.\n- The main loop then iterates from $n=1$ to the final time step. In each iteration, it computes $u^{n+1}$ from $u^n$ and $u^{n-1}$ using the general update rule.\n- In each step, the time-dependent coefficients $a(x, t^{n+1/2})$ are calculated first, followed by the averaged half-node coefficients. The spatial operator is then computed using vectorized `numpy` operations on the interior grid points.\n- Boundary conditions $u_0=0, u_{N-1}=0$ are enforced after each update.\n- The required observables for each test case are computed:\n  - **Test 1:** The final spatial $\\mathrm{L}^2$ norm, $\\|u(\\cdot, T_{\\text{end}})\\|_2 = \\left(\\sum_i (u_i^{\\text{final}})^2 \\Delta x\\right)^{1/2}$, is computed after the loop finishes.\n  - **Test 2:** The maximum absolute displacement, $\\max_{n,i}|u_i^n|$, is updated within the loop at each time step.\n  - **Test 3:** The displacement at the string's midpoint, $u(L/2, t)$, is recorded. After the simulation, these time series data are processed to detect zero-crossings via sign changes. Linear interpolation is used to estimate the precise time of each crossing. The average time difference between crossings gives the half-period, from which the numerical frequency $f_{\\text{num}}$ is calculated. The final result is the absolute error $|f_{\\text{num}} - f_1|$, where $f_1 = c_0/(2L)$.",

Starting from Newton’s Second Law applied to a differential element of the string and the definition of transverse displacement, derive a continuum model that includes a linear damping force and a random fluctuating (Langevin) force representing a thermal bath. The model must be specified for transverse displacement $y(x,t)$ on a domain $x \\in [0,L]$ with fixed ends. The damping must be linear in the local transverse velocity, and the random force must be a zero-mean Gaussian white noise that is consistent with thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature $\\Theta$ as prescribed by the fluctuation-dissipation principle. You must then discretize the model in space and time using a stable explicit scheme subject to a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition, and implement a program to compute a physically meaningful observable.\n\nYour simulation must adhere to the following foundational and modeling specifications:\n\n- Start from the fundamental balance of transverse forces on a string element of length $\\mathrm{d}x$ with linear mass density $\\mu$ and tension $\\mathcal{T}$, using small-amplitude approximations justified by linearizing the geometry.\n- Include a linear damping force per unit length proportional to $-\\mu \\gamma \\,\\partial y/\\partial t$, where $\\gamma$ has units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Introduce a random fluctuating force per unit length with zero mean and delta-correlated statistics in space and time.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a complete physical and numerical analysis. It is based on established principles of classical mechanics and statistical physics, specifically the Langevin model for a system in contact with a thermal reservoir, governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Stochastic Wave Equation\n\nWe begin by applying Newton's Second Law to a differential element of the string, located between $x$ and $x + \\mathrm{d}x$. Let $y(x,t)$ be the transverse displacement. For small amplitude vibrations, we can make the approximation $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta = \\partial y/\\partial x$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of the string element with the horizontal axis. The mass of the element is $\\mathrm{d}m = \\mu \\,\\mathrm{d}x$, where $\\mu$ is the linear mass density.\n\nThe net transverse force on the element is the sum of the restoring force from tension $\\mathcal{T}$, the damping force, and the stochastic thermal force.\nThe restoring force is the sum of the vertical components of tension at the ends of the element:\n$$ F_{\\text{tension}} = \\mathcal{T} \\sin\\theta(x+\\mathrm{d}x, t) - \\mathcal{T} \\sin\\theta(x, t) \\approx \\mathcal{T} \\left( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x+\\mathrm{d}x} - \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x} \\right) \\approx \\mathcal{T} \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe problem specifies a linear damping force per unit length as $-\\mu \\gamma (\\partial y/\\partial t)$. For an element of length $\\mathrm{d}x$, this is:\n$$ F_{\\text{damping}} = -\\mu \\gamma \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe thermal fluctuations from the heat bath are represented by a stochastic force per unit length, $\\eta(x,t)$. For the element, this force is:\n$$ F_{\\text{stochastic}} = \\eta(x,t) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nApplying Newton's Second Law, $(\\mu \\mathrm{d}x) \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = F_{\\text{tension}} + F_{\\text{damping}} + F_{\\text{stochastic}}$, we obtain:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} \\mathrm{d}x = \\mathcal{T} \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} \\mathrm{d}x - \\mu \\gamma \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} \\mathrm{d}x + \\eta(x,t) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nDividing by $\\mu \\mathrm{d}x$ and defining the wave speed $c = \\sqrt{\\mathcal{T}/\\mu}$, we arrive at the Langevin equation for the string:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} + \\gamma \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\eta(x,t) $$\n\n### 2. Fluctuation-Dissipation Principle and Noise Amplitude\n\nThe stochastic force $\\eta(x,t)$ is assumed to be a zero-mean, Gaussian white noise process, characterized by its correlation function:\n$$ \\langle \\eta(x,t) \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle \\eta(x,t) \\eta(x',t') \\rangle = A \\, \\delta(x-x') \\delta(t-t') $$\nThe constant $A$ must be determined by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which requires that in thermal equilibrium at temperature $\\Theta$, the system satisfies the equipartition theorem. Each normal mode of the string must have an average energy of $k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\Theta$.\n\nWe decompose the displacement $y(x,t)$ into the string's normal modes, which for fixed ends ($y(0,t)=y(L,t)=0$) are sinusoidal:\n$$ y(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} q_n(t) \\sin(k_n x), \\quad \\text{where } k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L} $$\nSubstituting this into the Langevin equation and using the orthogonality of the sine functions, $\\int_0^L \\sin(k_n x) \\sin(k_m x) \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{L}{2}\\delta_{nm}$, we project the dynamics onto each mode. The equation for the modal amplitude $q_n(t)$ becomes:\n$$ \\ddot{q}_n + \\gamma \\dot{q}_n + \\omega_n^2 q_n = \\tilde{\\eta}_n(t) $$\nwhere $\\omega_n = c k_n$ is the angular frequency of the $n$-th mode, and $\\tilde{\\eta}_n(t) = \\frac{2}{\\mu L} \\int_0^L \\eta(x,t) \\sin(k_n x) \\mathrm{d}x$ is the modal stochastic force. The correlation of the modal force is:\n$$ \\langle \\tilde{\\eta}_n(t) \\tilde{\\eta}_m(t') \\rangle = \\frac{4}{\\mu^2 L^2} \\int_0^L\\int_0^L \\langle \\eta(x,t)\\eta(x',t') \\rangle \\sin(k_n x)\\sin(k_m x') \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}x' = \\frac{2A}{\\mu^2 L} \\delta_{nm} \\delta(t-t') $$\nThe total energy of the string, $E(t) = \\int_0^L (\\frac{1}{2}\\mu(\\partial y/\\partial t)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{T}(\\partial y/\\partial x)^2)\\mathrm{d}x$, can be expressed as a sum of modal energies $E_n$:\n$$ E(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mu L}{4} (\\dot{q}_n^2 + \\omega_n^2 q_n^2) $$\nThe effective mass for the $n$-th mode is $M_n = \\mu L/2$. According to the equipartition theorem, the average energy of each mode in thermal equilibrium is $\\langle E_n \\rangle = k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta$. Standard results for a Langevin oscillator state that the average kinetic energy is $\\frac{1}{2}M_n\\langle\\dot{q}_n^2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta$. This requires the two-sided power spectral density of the force $\\tilde{\\eta}_n(t)$ to be $2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta/M_n$. This implies the correlation strength of $\\tilde{\\eta}_n(t)$ is $C = \\langle \\tilde{\\eta}_n(t)\\tilde{\\eta}_n(t') \\rangle/\\delta(t-t') = 2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta/M_n$.\nPlugging in our expressions for $C$ and $M_n$:\n$$ \\frac{2A}{\\mu^2 L} = \\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu L/2} = \\frac{4\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu L} $$\nSolving for $A$, we find the required amplitude for the physical noise:\n$$ A = 2\\mu\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta $$\n\n### 3. Numerical Discretization and Algorithm\n\nTo solve the SPDE numerically, we discretize it in space and time. We use a uniform grid $x_i = i\\Delta x$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$ with $\\Delta x = L/(N-1)$, and discrete time steps $t_j = j\\Delta t$. We rewrite the second-order SPDE as a system of two first-order equations for position $y(x,t)$ and velocity $v(x,t) = \\partial y/\\partial t$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = v \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} - \\gamma v + \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\eta(x,t) $$\nWe use an explicit Euler-Cromer (or symplectic Euler) integration scheme, which is known for its better stability properties for oscillatory systems compared to the standard Euler method. For a grid point $i$ and time step $j$, the updates are:\n1. Calculate the total acceleration $a_i^j$ on node $i$ at time $t_j$.\n2. Update the velocity to $v_i^{j+1}$ using $a_i^j$.\n3. Update the position to $y_i^{j+1}$ using the new velocity $v_i^{j+1}$.\n\nThe discrete equations for the interior points ($i=1, \\dots, N-2$) are:\n$$ a_i^j = c^2 \\frac{y_{i+1}^j - 2y_i^j + y_{i-1}^j}{\\Delta x^2} - \\gamma v_i^j + R_i^j $$\n$$ v_i^{j+1} = v_i^j + a_i^j \\Delta t $$\n$$ y_i^{j+1} = y_i^j + v_i^{j+1} \\Delta t $$\nThe boundary conditions are $y_0^j=y_{N-1}^j=0$ and $v_0^j=v_{N-1}^j=0$ for all $j$.\n\nThe discrete random acceleration term $R_i^j$ corresponds to the continuous noise $\\eta(x,t)$. The random velocity kick over one time step, $\\Delta v_{\\text{stoch}} = R_i^j \\Delta t$, must have a variance consistent with the FDT. The variance of the velocity change of a particle of mass $m_i=\\mu\\Delta x$ due to thermal noise in time $\\Delta t$ is $\\langle (\\Delta v_{\\text{stoch}})^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{m_i} \\Delta t = \\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu\\Delta x}\\Delta t$.\nTherefore, $\\langle (R_i^j \\Delta t)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu\\Delta x}\\Delta t$, which implies that the variance of the random acceleration term is $\\langle (R_i^j)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu\\Delta x \\Delta t}$. We can thus write $R_i^j$ as:\n$$ R_i^j = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\Theta}{\\mu\\Delta x \\Delta t}} Z_i^j $$\nwhere $Z_i^j$ are independent random numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$.\n\n### 4. Energy Calculation\n\nThe total mechanical energy $E(t)$ is computed at each required time step.\nThe kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\int_0^L v^2 \\mathrm{d}x$ is discretized using the trapezoidal rule:\n$$ K^j \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{(v_i^j)^2 + (v_{i+1}^j)^2}{2} \\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\cdot \\text{trapz}((v^j)^2, x) $$\nThe potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{T} \\int_0^L (\\partial y/\\partial x)^2 \\mathrm{d}x$ is discretized by approximating the derivative with finite differences. Using forward differences $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x_{i+1/2}} \\approx \\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{\\Delta x}$ centered on the segments, the integral becomes a sum over the segments:\n$$ U^j \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{T} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\left(\\frac{y_{i+1}^j - y_i^j}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\Delta x = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{2\\Delta x} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} (y_{i+1}^j - y_i^j)^2 $$\nThe total energy is $E^j = K^j + U^j$. The final result for each test case is the time average of $E^j$ over the last $20\\%$ of the simulation steps.",
