It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part a) Derivation of the Source Term $f(x,y)$**\n\nThe source term $f(x,y)$ is determined by the relation $f = -\\Delta u = -(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2})$. We compute the second partial derivatives of the exact solution $u(x,y) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) \\right) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\pi \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) $$\nThe second partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\sin(\\pi x) + \\pi\\cos(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) \\right) \\\\ = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\sin(\\pi x) + \\pi\\cos(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) + \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}(\\pi\\cos(\\pi x) - \\pi^2\\sin(\\pi x))\\sin(\\pi y) \\\\ = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi y) \\left[ (1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi x) + 2\\pi\\cos(\\pi x) \\right] $$\nDue to the symmetry of $u(x,y)$ with respect to interchange of $x$ and $y$, the second partial derivative with respect to $y$ is analogous:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y}\\sin(\\pi x) \\left[ (1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi y) + 2\\pi\\cos(\\pi y) \\right] $$\nThe Laplacian $\\Delta u$ is the sum of these second derivatives:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y} \\left[ 2(1-\\pi^2)\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + 2\\pi(\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)) \\right] $$\nFinally, the source term is $f(x,y) = -\\Delta u$:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\mathrm{e}^{x+y} \\left[ 2(\\pi^2-1)\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) - 2\\pi(\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)) \\right] $$\nThis is the closed-form expression required.\n\n**Part b, c, d) Numerical Solution and Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires solving the linear system $A \\mathbf{u}_h = \\mathbf{b}$ for the unknown values of the numerical solution at the $(m-1)^2$ interior grid points. The vector $\\mathbf{u}_h$ contains the values $u_{i,j}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m-1\\}$, arranged in lexicographical (column-major) order. The matrix $A$ represents the discrete negative Laplacian operator, and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ contains the values of the source term $f(x_i, y_j)$ at the interior points.\n\nFor the $5$-point stencil, the matrix $A_5$ corresponding to $(-\\Delta_h^{(5)})$ can be constructed using Kronecker products. Let $T_{1D}$ be the $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ matrix for the one-dimensional second derivative operator $-\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, given by $T_{1D} = \\frac{1}{h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-1, 2, -1)$. Let $I$ be the $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ identity matrix. Then, the matrix for the two-dimensional operator is:\n$$ A_5 = I \\otimes T_{1D} + T_{1D} \\otimes I $$\n\nFor the $9$-point stencil, the matrix $A_9$ corresponding to $(-\\Delta_h^{(9)})$ has a block-tridiagonal structure $A_9 = \\text{block_tridiag}(B, D, B)$, where the blocks $D$ and $B$ are $(m-1) \\times (m-1)$ matrices:\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{6h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-4, 20, -4) $$\n$$ B = \\frac{1}{6h^2} \\text{tridiag}(-1, -4, -1) $$\nThis structure arises from the coefficients of the stencil coupling nodes within the same grid row (matrix $D$) and between adjacent grid rows (matrix $B$).\n\nThe numerical procedure for each $m \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16\\}$ is as follows:\n1.  Set the grid spacing $h=1/m$ and define the grid coordinates.\n2.  Construct the sparse matrices $A_5$ and $A_9$ of size $(m-1)^2 \\times (m-1)^2$.\n3.  Construct the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ by evaluating $f(x_i, y_j)$ at the $(m-1)^2$ interior grid points.\n4.  Solve the two linear systems $A_5 \\mathbf{u}_h^{(5)} = \\mathbf{b}$ and $A_9 \\mathbf{u}_h^{(9)} = \\mathbf{b}$ to obtain the numerical solutions at the interior points.\n5.  Form the full $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ grid solutions $u_h^{(5)}$ and $u_h^{(9)}$ by embedding the interior solutions into a grid of zeros, which correctly represents the homogeneous boundary conditions.\n6.  Evaluate the exact solution $u(x,y)$ on the full grid.\n7.  Compute the discrete RMS errors $E^{(5)}(h)$ and $E^{(9)}(h)$ using the specified formula. These errors are stored for each value of $m$.\n8.  After computing errors for all $m$, the observed convergence rates $p^{(5)}$ and $p^{(9)}$ are calculated for each refinement level using the given logarithmic formula.\n\nThe expected convergence rates are $p \\approx 2$ for the second-order $5$-point stencil and $p \\approx 4$ for the fourth-order $9$-point stencil, as these are the theoretical orders of accuracy for the respective discretizations. The numerical experiment serves to verify this theoretical behavior.",

The domain is partitioned at the interface $x_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ into two regions.\nIn Region $1$ ($0 \\le x < \\tfrac{1}{2}$), the thermal conductivity is $k(x)=k_1$, and the equation simplifies to $-k_1 u_1''(x) = 1$.\nIn Region $2$ ($\\tfrac{1}{2} \\le x \\le 1$), the thermal conductivity is $k(x)=k_2$, and the equation is $-k_2 u_2''(x) = 1$.\n\nIntegrating twice in each region yields general solutions that are quadratic in $x$:\nFor Region $1$: $u_1(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2k_1} + A_1 x + B_1$.\nFor Region $2$: $u_2(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2k_2} + A_2 x + B_2$.\nThe four constants of integration, $A_1$, $B_1$, $A_2$, and $B_2$, are determined by the four given conditions:\n$1$. Boundary condition at $x=0$: $u_1(0)=0$.\n$2$. Boundary condition at $x=1$: $u_2(1)=0$.\n$3$. Temperature continuity at $x=x_{\\mathrm{I}}$: $u_1(x_{\\mathrm{I}}) = u_2(x_{\\mathrm{I}})$.\n$4$. Heat flux continuity at $x=x_{\\mathrm{I}}$: $k_1 u_1'(x_{\\mathrm{I}}) = k_2 u_2'(x_{\\mathrm{I}})$.\n\nApplying these conditions systematically:\nFrom $u_1(0)=0$, we find $B_1=0$.\nFrom $k_1 u_1'(x_{\\mathrm{I}}) = k_2 u_2'(x_{\\mathrm{I}})$, we have $k_1(-\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{I}}}{k_1} + A_1) = k_2(-\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{I}}}{k_2} + A_2)$, which simplifies to $k_1 A_1 = k_2 A_2$.\nThe remaining two conditions form a linear system for $A_1$ and $B_2$ (or $A_1$ and $A_2$). Substituting $x_{\\mathrm{I}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, we solve this system to find the constants:\n$$\nA_1 = \\frac{k_2+3k_1}{4k_1(k_1+k_2)}, \\qquad A_2 = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}A_1 = \\frac{k_2+3k_1}{4k_2(k_1+k_2)}\n$$\n$$\nB_1 = 0, \\qquad B_2 = \\frac{1}{2k_2} - A_2 = \\frac{k_2-k_1}{4k_2(k_1+k_2)}\n$$\nThe exact solution is therefore given by the piecewise function:\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    -\\dfrac{x^2}{2k_1} + \\dfrac{k_2+3k_1}{4k_1(k_1+k_2)} x & \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le \\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\[1.5em]\n    -\\dfrac{x^2}{2k_2} + \\dfrac{k_2+3k_1}{4k_2(k_1+k_2)} x + \\dfrac{k_2-k_1}{4k_2(k_1+k_2)} & \\text{for } \\tfrac{1}{2} < x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNext, we address the numerical solution. The domain $[0, 1]$ is discretized into a uniform grid with $N$ subintervals of width $h=1/N$. The grid points are $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The specified finite difference scheme is:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{h}\\left( k_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\, \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_i}{h} - k_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\, \\frac{u_i-u_{i-1}}{h} \\right) = 1, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, N-1.\n$$\nRearranging, we obtain a linear equation for each interior node $i$:\n$$\n-k_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}} u_{i-1} + (k_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2}} + k_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}}) u_i - k_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}} u_{i+1} = h^2.\n$$\nThe set of these $N-1$ equations, together with the boundary conditions $u_0=0$ and $u_N=0$, forms a linear system $A\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the vector of unknowns $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-1})^T$. The matrix $A$ is a symmetric, positive-definite, tridiagonal matrix. The face conductivities $k_{i\\pm\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ are defined by the arithmetic mean of nodal conductivities, $k_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(k_i + k_{i+1})$, where $k_i = k(x_i)$. Since $N$ is even, the interface $x_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ coincides with the grid point $x_{N/2}$. The right-continuous definition of $k(x)$ implies $k_{N/2} = k_2$, while $k_{N/2-1} = k_1$. The face conductivity across the interface is thus $k_{N/2 - \\tfrac{1}{2}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(k_1+k_2)$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For a given grid size $N$ and conductivities $k_1, k_2$, define the nodal conductivities $k_i$ and face conductivities $k_{i\\pm\\tfrac{1}{2}}$.\n$2$. Construct the $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$ tridiagonal matrix $A$ and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ of size $N-1$ with all elements equal to $h^2$.\n$3$. Solve the linear system $A\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the interior nodal values $u_1, \\dots, u_{N-1}$. A specialized solver for banded systems is efficient for this task.\n$4$. Append the boundary values $u_0=0$ and $u_N=0$ to form the complete numerical solution vector $\\{u_i\\}_{i=0}^N$.\n$5$. Evaluate the exact solution $u(x_i)$ at each grid point $x_i$.\n$6$. Compute the maximum-norm nodal error $E(N;k_1,k_2) = \\max_{0 \\le i \\le N} | u_i - u(x_i) |$.\n$7$. Repeat steps $1$-$6$ for the coarse grid ($N=N_{\\mathrm{c}}$) and the fine grid ($N=N_{\\mathrm{f}}$) to obtain errors $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n$8$. Calculate the observed order of accuracy using the formula $p = \\log(E_{\\mathrm{c}}/E_{\\mathrm{f}}) / \\log(N_{\\mathrm{f}}/N_{\\mathrm{c}})$.\n\nIt must be noted that while the finite difference stencil is formally second-order accurate for a smooth problem, the use of an arithmetic mean for conductivity at a material interface is known to reduce the global accuracy to first order ($p \\approx 1$). In the special case where $k_1=k_2$, there is no interface, the problem is smooth, and the expected second-order accuracy ($p \\approx 2$) should be recovered. The numerical experiment will verify this behavior.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is determined to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It presents a standard numerical analysis task involving the finite difference method for a parabolic partial differential equation. All parameters, equations, and conditions are explicitly defined, forming a consistent and solvable problem. We proceed with the derivation and implementation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires simulating the one-dimensional heat equation $u_t(x,t) = \\alpha \\, u_{xx}(x,t)$ on the domain $x \\in [0,1]$ and $t \\in [0,T]$. We employ a finite difference method on a uniform grid with spatial points $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$ where $h=1/N$ is the spatial step size. The time domain is discretized into steps of size $\\Delta t$, with $t_n = n \\Delta t$. Let $u_i^n$ be the numerical approximation of the exact solution $u(x_i, t_n)$.\n\nThe time derivative $u_t$ is approximated using the first-order accurate forward Euler method. The spatial second derivative $u_{xx}$ is approximated using the second-order accurate centered difference stencil. Combining these discretizations yields the update rule for all grid points $i=0, \\dots, N$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{h^2}\n$$\nRearranging for $u_i^{n+1}$ and introducing the mesh Fourier number $\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{h^2}$, we obtain the explicit update formula:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\lambda (u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n)\n$$\nThis formula is applied at all interior points, $i = 1, \\dots, N-1$. For the boundary points $i=0$ and $i=N$, the formula requires values at the \"ghost points\" $x_{-1} = -h$ and $x_{N+1} = 1+h$. These values, $u_{-1}^n$ and $u_{N+1}^n$, are determined by enforcing the Neumann boundary conditions, $u_x(0,t) = g_0(t)$ and $u_x(1,t) = g_1(t)$, using two different finite difference closures.\n\nThe problem specifies a fixed relationship between the time and space steps: $\\Delta t = c \\frac{h^2}{2 \\alpha}$ with $c = 0.45$. This gives $\\lambda = c/2 = 0.225$, which satisfies the stability condition $\\lambda \\le 1/2$ for the forward Euler method. The number of time steps is chosen as the nearest integer to $T/\\Delta t$, and $\\Delta t$ is then adjusted to ensure the final time is exactly $T$.\n\nThe two boundary closures are as follows:\n\n1.  **First-Order (FO) Closure**: The ghost points are determined by a first-order accurate one-sided difference approximation of the Neumann condition as specified:\n    $$\n    u_{-1}^n = u_0^n - h g_0(t_n)\n    $$\n    $$\n    u_{N+1}^n = u_N^n + h g_1(t_n)\n    $$\n    Substituting these into the general update formula for $i=0$ and $i=N$ gives the specific boundary update rules:\n    -   At $i=0$: $u_0^{n+1} = u_0^n + \\lambda (u_1^n - 2u_0^n + (u_0^n - h g_0(t_n))) = (1-\\lambda) u_0^n + \\lambda u_1^n - \\lambda h g_0(t_n)$.\n    -   At $i=N$: $u_N^{n+1} = u_N^n + \\lambda ((u_N^n + h g_1(t_n)) - 2u_N^n + u_{N-1}^n) = \\lambda u_{N-1}^n + (1-\\lambda) u_N^n + \\lambda h g_1(t_n)$.\n    The local truncation error of this boundary condition implementation is $\\mathcal{O}(h)$. This is expected to limit the overall spatial accuracy of the entire scheme to first order, so the observed convergence rate $p$ should be approximately $1$.\n\n2.  **Second-Order (SO) Closure**: The ghost points are determined by a second-order accurate centered difference approximation of the Neumann condition:\n    $$\n    u_{-1}^n = u_1^n - 2h g_0(t_n)\n    $$\n    $$\n    u_{N+1}^n = u_{N-1}^n + 2h g_1(t_n)\n    $$\n    Substituting these yields the boundary update rules:\n    -   At $i=0$: $u_0^{n+1} = u_0^n + \\lambda (u_1^n - 2u_0^n + (u_1^n - 2h g_0(t_n))) = (1-2\\lambda) u_0^n + 2\\lambda u_1^n - 2\\lambda h g_0(t_n)$.\n    -   At $i=N$: $u_N^{n+1} = u_N^n + \\lambda ((u_{N-1}^n + 2h g_1(t_n)) - 2u_N^n + u_{N-1}^n) = 2\\lambda u_{N-1}^n + (1-2\\lambda) u_N^n + 2\\lambda h g_1(t_n)$.\n    The local truncation error of this boundary implementation is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, which is consistent with the $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ accuracy of the interior spatial discretization. The temporal error is $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t) = \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. Therefore, the entire scheme is expected to be second-order accurate, and the observed convergence rate $p$ should be approximately $2$.\n\nThe numerical experiment proceeds as follows: for each case (A, B) and each closure (FO, SO), we solve the problem for a sequence of grid resolutions $N \\in \\{20, 40, 80, 160\\}$. For each resolution, we compute the final numerical solution $u_i$ at time $T$. The error is measured using the discrete $L^2$-norm, defined as $E(h) = \\sqrt{h \\sum_{i=0}^N (u_i - u_{exact}(x_i, T))^2}$. The observed order of convergence, $p$, is calculated as the slope of the linear least-squares fit to the points $(\\log h, \\log E(h))$.
