Use the explicit Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) method, which employs a forward difference in time and centered differences in space, to advance the solution on a uniform periodic grid. The periodic grid has $N \\times N$ nodes with uniform spacing $h$ in both directions. Let $r = \\alpha \\Delta t / h^2$ denote the non-dimensional time step parameter. Implement periodic boundary conditions in both directions. Do not assume any stability property a priori; instead, observe behavior numerically. Start from the following initial condition on the discrete grid: a pure alternating-sign mode $u_{i,j}^0 = (-1)^{i+j}$ for all grid indices $i,j$, which is the highest-wavenumber mode under periodicity. Evolve this initial condition by applying the FTCS update repeatedly. Your program must do the following: \n- Implement the FTCS discretization consistent with the finite difference definitions: the time derivative at time level $n$ is replaced by a forward difference, and each second spatial derivative is replaced by a centered difference on the uniform grid. Apply periodic boundary conditions so that neighbor indices wrap around at the boundaries in both directions.\n- For a given $r$, number of time steps $n_{\\text{steps}}$, and grid size $N$, compute the ratio $R = \\left|A^{n_{\\text{steps}}}\\right| / \\left|A^0\\right|$, where $A^n$ is the scalar amplitude of the alternating-sign mode at time level $n$, defined by the discrete inner product $A^n = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{i,j}^n \\, (-1)^{i+j}$. \n- Use periodic boundary conditions to ensure this alternating-sign mode is a discrete Fourier mode. \n- No physical units are required in the output because $R$ is dimensionless.\n\nTest Suite: Run the program on the following three parameter sets, which together provide a general case, a boundary case, and a case that violates the classical stability condition:\n- Case $1$ (stable interior): $(N, r, n_{\\text{steps}}) = (64, 0.2, 12)$.\n- Case $2$ (stability boundary): $(N, r, n_{\\text{steps}}) = (64, 0.25, 12)$.\n- Case $3$ (unstable, expected checkerboard growth): $(N, r, n_{\\text{steps}}) = (64, 0.3, 12)$.\n\nFinal Output Format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $[R_1, R_2, R_3]$ corresponding to Cases $1$, $2$, and $3$.

            "solution": "The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the two-dimensional heat equation:\n$$ u_t = \\alpha \\left(u_{xx} + u_{yy}\\right) $$\nHere, $u(x,y,t)$ represents the temperature at spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ and time $t$, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity constant. The problem requires the use of the explicit Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) method for discretization on a uniform periodic grid of size $N \\times N$ with spatial step $h$ and time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nFirst, we discretize the PDE. The time derivative $u_t$ is approximated using a forward difference at time level $n$:\n$$ u_t \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^n}{\\Delta t} $$\nwhere $u_{i,j}^n$ denotes the numerical solution at grid point $(i,j)$ and time step $n$. The second-order spatial derivatives $u_{xx}$ and $u_{yy}$ are approximated using centered differences:\n$$ u_{xx} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n}{h^2} $$\n$$ u_{yy} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n}{h^2} $$\nSubstituting these approximations into the heat equation yields the full discretization:\n$$ \\frac{u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n}{h^2} + \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n}{h^2} \\right) $$\nWe are given the non-dimensional parameter $r = \\alpha \\Delta t / h^2$. By rearranging the equation to solve for the solution at the next time step, $u_{i,j}^{n+1}$, we obtain the FTCS update rule:\n$$ u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^n + r \\left( u_{i+1,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n + u_{i,j+1}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n - 4u_{i,j}^n \\right) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ u_{i,j}^{n+1} = (1 - 4r)u_{i,j}^n + r(u_{i+1,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n + u_{i,j+1}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n) $$\nThe problem specifies an initial condition corresponding to the highest-wavenumber mode on a periodic grid:\n$$ u_{i,j}^0 = (-1)^{i+j} $$\nThis mode is an eigenmode of the discrete numerical operator. To demonstrate this, we substitute $u_{i,j}^0$ into the update rule. The values at neighboring points are related to the central point by a factor of $-1$:\n$$ u_{i \\pm 1, j}^0 = (-1)^{i \\pm 1 + j} = -(-1)^{i+j} = -u_{i,j}^0 $$\n$$ u_{i, j \\pm 1}^0 = (-1)^{i + j \\pm 1} = -(-1)^{i+j} = -u_{i,j}^0 $$\nSubstituting these into the update rule for the first time step gives:\n$$ u_{i,j}^1 = (1 - 4r)u_{i,j}^0 + r(-u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i,j}^0) = (1 - 4r)u_{i,j}^0 - 4r u_{i,j}^0 = (1 - 8r)u_{i,j}^0 $$\nThe amplification factor for this mode from one time step to the next is therefore $G = (1 - 8r)$. After $n_{\\text{steps}}$, the solution is:\n$$ u_{i,j}^{n_{\\text{steps}}} = G^{n_{\\text{steps}}} u_{i,j}^0 = (1 - 8r)^{n_{\\text{steps}}} (-1)^{i+j} $$\nThe stability of the numerical scheme is determined by the magnitude of this amplification factor. For stability, we require $|G| \\le 1$. For this specific mode, the condition is $|1 - 8r| \\le 1$, which is equivalent to $0 \\le r \\le 1/4$. This confirms that the highest-wavenumber mode dictates the stability limit of the entire scheme.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio $R = |A^{n_{\\text{steps}}}| / |A^0|$, where the amplitude $A^n$ is defined by the discrete inner product:\n$$ A^n = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{i,j}^n \\, (-1)^{i+j} $$\nFirst, we compute the initial amplitude $A^0$:\n$$ A^0 = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{i,j}^0 (-1)^{i+j} = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (-1)^{i+j} (-1)^{i+j} = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} 1 = 1 $$\nNext, we compute the amplitude at $n_{\\text{steps}}$:\n$$ A^{n_{\\text{steps}}} = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u_{i,j}^{n_{\\text{steps}}} (-1)^{i+j} = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left( (1 - 8r)^{n_{\\text{steps}}} (-1)^{i+j} \\right) (-1)^{i+j} $$\n$$ A^{n_{\\text{steps}}} = (1 - 8r)^{n_{\\text{steps}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} 1 \\right) = (1 - 8r)^{n_{\\text{steps}}} $$\nThe required ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$ R = \\frac{|A^{n_{\\text{steps}}}|}{|A^0|} = \\frac{|(1 - 8r)^{n_{\\text{steps}}}|}{|1|} = |1 - 8r|^{n_{\\text{steps}}} $$\nThis analytical result provides a precise theoretical prediction. The implementation will perform the full numerical simulation as requested, which must match this result to high accuracy.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case $(N, r, n_{\\text{steps}})$, initialize an $N \\times N$ grid with the initial condition $u_{i,j}^0 = (-1)^{i+j}$.\n2. A second $N \\times N$ grid is created to represent the projection mode, $p_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}$.\n3. The initial amplitude $A^0$ is computed as the normalized inner product of the initial grid and the projection mode grid. It will be exactly $1.0$.\n4. A loop runs for $n_{\\text{steps}}$ iterations. In each iteration, the FTCS update rule is applied to every point on the grid. Periodic boundary conditions are handled by using modulo arithmetic on indices, which is efficiently implemented using vectorized array shifts (e.g., `numpy.roll`).\n5. After the loop, the final amplitude $A^{n_{\\text{steps}}}$ is computed similarly to $A^0$.\n6. The ratio $R$ is calculated as $|A^{n_{\\text{steps}}}| / |A^0|$.\n7. The results for the three cases are collected and printed in the specified format. The test cases explore the stable regime ($r=0.2$, $|G|=0.61$), the stability boundary ($r=0.25$, $|G|=1$), and the unstable regime ($r=0.3$, $|G|=1.4>1$).",
