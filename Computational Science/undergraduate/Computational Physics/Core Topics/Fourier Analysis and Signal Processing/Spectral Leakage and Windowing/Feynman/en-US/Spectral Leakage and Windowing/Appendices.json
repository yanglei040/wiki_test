This act of truncation is equivalent to multiplying the ideal, infinite signal by a rectangular window. This foundational exercise  explores the consequences of this implicit windowing in the frequency domain. By applying the modulation property of the Fourier Transform, you will see precisely how the clean spectrum of a pure sinusoid is convolved with the spectrum of the rectangular window, giving rise to the characteristic main lobe and side-lobe structure known as spectral leakage.",

            "solution": "The problem posed is a well-defined exercise in computational physics and digital signal processing. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and algorithmically formalizable. All parameters and functions are explicitly defined, and the test cases are consistent with the premises. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental task is to analyze the performance of different window functions in resolving two sinusoidal signals whose frequencies, $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, are separated by less than the frequency resolution of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), $\\Delta f = \\frac{f_{s}}{N}$. This situation is common in experimental data analysis, where spectral components may be closely spaced.\n\nThe core principle behind this analysis is the understanding of the DFT and the phenomenon of spectral leakage. The DFT assumes that the finite-length signal segment $x[n]$ of length $N$ is one period of an infinitely periodic signal. If the signal segment does not contain an integer number of cycles of its constituent sinusoids, a sharp discontinuity arises at the boundary where the signal wraps around. This discontinuity manifests in the frequency domain as spectral leakage, where energy from the true frequency \"leaks\" into other frequency bins.\n\nWindowing is a technique to mitigate this effect. A window function $w[n]$ is applied to the signal, $y[n] = x[n]w[n]$, before the DFT is computed. Window functions taper towards zero at the ends of the segment, reducing the boundary discontinuities. This comes at a cost. The Fourier transform of the window function is convolved with the true spectrum of the signal. This convolution broadens the main spectral peaks (main lobes) and reduces the amplitude of the spurious peaks (sidelobes). This creates a trade-off:\n\n$1$. **Rectangular Window, $w_{\\mathrm{rect}}[n]$**: This is equivalent to applying no window, simply truncating the signal. Its transform has the narrowest main lobe, offering the highest theoretical frequency resolution. However, it also has the highest sidelobes (the first sidelobe is only about $-13$ dB down from the main lobe), leading to severe spectral leakage that can obscure nearby weaker signals or merge with adjacent strong signals.\n\n$2$. **Hann Window, $w_{\\mathrm{hann}}[n]$**: This is a smooth, bell-shaped window. Its main lobe is approximately twice as wide as that of the rectangular window, thus reducing frequency resolution. Its significant advantage is the much lower sidelobe level (first sidelobe at about $-31$ dB), which provides excellent leakage suppression.\n\n$3$. **Blackman Window, $w_{\\mathrm{black}}[n]$**: This window provides an even wider main lobe (approximately three times that of the rectangular window) and, in return, even lower sidelobes (first sidelobe at about $-58$ dB). It offers superior leakage suppression at the cost of further reduced frequency resolution.\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative analysis of this trade-off using two metrics for the magnitude spectrum $M[k] = |X[k]|$.\n\n- **Leakage Fraction, $L$**: This metric, defined as $L = (\\sum_{k=0,\\,k \\neq p_{1},\\,k \\neq p_{2}}^{N/2} M[k]^{2}) / (\\sum_{k=0}^{N/2} M[k]^{2})$, measures the fraction of spectral energy that has leaked outside the primary frequency bins associated with the signals, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. These bins are identified by rounding the true frequencies normalized by the DFT frequency resolution, $f/\\Delta f$. A lower value of $L$ indicates better suppression of spectral leakage. We expect $L_{\\mathrm{rect}} > L_{\\mathrm{hann}} > L_{\\mathrm{black}}$.\n\n- **Peak Ratio, $R$**: This metric, defined as $R = M_{\\mathrm{second}} / M_{\\max}$, quantifies the resolvability of the two spectral components. If the two sinusoids are resolved into two distinct peaks in the spectrum, $R$ will be close to $1$ (since the sinusoids have equal amplitude). If they merge into a single, broad peak, $M_{\\max}$ will be this merged peak and $M_{\\mathrm{second}}$ will be the highest sidelobe, resulting in a small value of $R$. Since $|f_{1} - f_{2}| < \\Delta f$, the components are not resolvable according to the classic Rayleigh criterion for a rectangular window. We will investigate whether they are nonetheless distinguishable.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to solve the problem for each test case is as follows:\n\n$1$. Define the parameters $f_{s}$, $N$, $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$, $\\phi_{1}$, and $\\phi_{2}$.\n$2$. Generate the discrete time vector $n = [0, 1, \\dots, N-1]$.\n$3$. Construct the signal $x[n] = \\sin(2\\pi \\frac{f_{1}}{f_{s}} n + \\phi_{1}) + \\sin(2\\pi \\frac{f_{2}}{f_{s}} n + \\phi_{2})$.\n$4$. For each of the three specified window functions $w[n]$ (Rectangular, Hann, Blackman):\n    a. Generate the window sequence $w[n]$.\n    b. Apply the window to the signal: $y[n] = x[n] \\cdot w[n]$.\n    c. Compute the DFT of the windowed signal, $X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y[n]\\,e^{-j 2\\pi \\frac{k n}{N}}$, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for efficiency.\n    d. Extract the non-negative frequency magnitude spectrum, $M[k] = |X[k]|$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N/2$.\n    e. Calculate the DFT frequency resolution $\\Delta f = f_{s}/N$.\n    f. Determine the closest integer DFT bin indices for the two frequencies: $p_{1} = \\mathrm{round}(f_{1}/\\Delta f)$ and $p_{2} = \\mathrm{round}(f_{2}/\\Delta f)$, clipped to the valid range $[0, N/2]$.\n    g. Calculate the leakage fraction $L$ by summing the squared magnitudes of all bins except $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, and dividing by the total sum of squared magnitudes.\n    h. Calculate the peak ratio $R$ by finding the two largest values in the spectrum $M[k]$ and computing their ratio.\n$5$. Consolidate the six computed values ($L_{\\mathrm{rect}}, L_{\\mathrm{hann}}, L_{\\mathrm{black}}, R_{\\mathrm{rect}}, R_{\\mathrm{hann}}, R_{\\mathrm{black}}$) into a single list for the test case.\n$6$.

The signal is defined as $x[n] = e^{j 2 \\pi f_0 n / F_s}$ over a finite duration $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, which is equivalent to applying a rectangular window of length $N$ to an infinite-duration sinusoid. The task is to derive and implement an estimator for $f_0$ using only the magnitudes of the two largest adjacent DFT bins.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. The $N$-point DFT of the signal $x[n]$ is given by:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2 \\pi k n / N} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{j 2 \\pi f_0 n / F_s} e^{-j 2 \\pi k n / N}$$\nLet the true frequency be expressed as a bin index $k^\\ast = f_0 N / F_s$. This value $k^\\ast$ is generally not an integer. The expression for the DFT becomes:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{j 2 \\pi n (k^\\ast / N - k / N)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left( e^{j 2 \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N} \\right)^n$$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $r = e^{j 2 \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N}$. The sum is:\n$$X[k] = \\frac{1 - r^N}{1 - r} = \\frac{1 - e^{j 2 \\pi (k^\\ast - k)}}{1 - e^{j 2 \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N}}$$\nBy factoring out complex exponentials from the numerator and denominator, we can express this in terms of sine functions:\n$$X[k] = \\frac{e^{j \\pi (k^\\ast - k)} (e^{-j \\pi (k^\\ast - k)} - e^{j \\pi (k^\\ast - k)})}{e^{j \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N} (e^{-j \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N} - e^{j \\pi (k^\\ast - k) / N})} = e^{j \\pi (k^\\ast - k)(1 - 1/N)} \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(k^\\ast - k))}{\\sin(\\pi(k^\\ast - k)/N)}$$\nThis function is the aliased sinc function, also known as the Dirichlet kernel, centered at $k = k^\\ast$. The magnitude of the DFT at bin $k$ is:\n$$|X[k]| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(k^\\ast - k))}{\\sin(\\pi(k^\\ast - k)/N)} \\right|$$\nThe problem requires an estimator based on the two DFT bins adjacent to the true frequency $k^\\ast$. Let $k^\\ast = m + \\delta$, where $m = \\lfloor k^\\ast \\rfloor$ is an integer representing the bin index to the left of the true frequency, and $\\delta \\in [0, 1)$ is the fractional offset. The two bins with the largest magnitudes that bracket the true frequency are at indices $m$ and $m+1$.\n\nLet us evaluate the magnitudes at these two bins:\nFor bin $k=m$:\n$$A_m = |X[m]| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(m + \\delta - m))}{\\sin(\\pi(m + \\delta - m)/N)} \\right| = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\delta)}{\\sin(\\pi\\delta/N)}$$\nThe absolute value is removed because for $\\delta \\in [0, 1)$, both $\\pi\\delta$ and $\\pi\\delta/N$ are in the range $[0, \\pi)$, where the sine function is non-negative.\n\nFor bin $k=m+1$:\n$$A_{m+1} = |X[m+1]| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(m + \\delta - (m+1)))}{\\sin(\\pi(m + \\delta - (m+1))/N)} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(\\delta - 1))}{\\sin(\\pi(\\delta - 1)/N)} \\right|$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(x-\\pi) = -\\sin(\\pi-x)$, we have $\\sin(\\pi(\\delta - 1)) = -\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta))$. The magnitude is:\n$$A_{m+1} = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta))}{\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta)/N)}$$\nAgain, the arguments to the sine functions are in a range where they are non-negative.\n\nTo find an estimator for $\\delta$, we take the ratio of these two magnitudes, $\\alpha = A_{m+1} / A_m$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta)) / \\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta)/N)}{\\sin(\\pi\\delta) / \\sin(\\pi\\delta/N)}$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\pi - x) = \\sin(x)$, we note that $\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta)) = \\sin(\\pi\\delta)$. The numerators are equal and cancel out:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\delta/N)}{\\sin(\\pi(1-\\delta)/N)}$$\nThis relation is exact. However, solving for $\\delta$ is non-trivial. For a large number of samples $N$, the arguments of the sine functions in the denominators are small. We can therefore apply the small-angle approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$. This is a highly accurate approximation for the specified value of $N = 1024$.\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{\\pi\\delta/N}{\\pi(1-\\delta)/N} = \\frac{\\delta}{1-\\delta}$$\nWe can now solve this simple algebraic equation for $\\delta$:\n$$\\alpha (1-\\delta) \\approx \\delta \\Rightarrow \\alpha - \\alpha\\delta \\approx \\delta \\Rightarrow \\alpha \\approx \\delta(1+\\alpha)$$\n$$\\delta \\approx \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting the ratio of magnitudes $\\alpha = A_{m+1} / A_m$, we obtain the estimator for the fractional offset:\n$$\\delta_{est} = \\frac{A_{m+1}/A_m}{1 + A_{m+1}/A_m} = \\frac{A_{m+1}}{A_m + A_{m+1}}$$\nThis provides a simple, direct method to estimate the fractional offset from the magnitudes of the two bracketing bins.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n$1$. For a given signal, compute the $N$-point DFT and its magnitude spectrum, $|X[k]|$.\n$2$. Find the index $k_{peak}$ of the maximum value in $|X[k]|$. This bin is either $m$ or $m+1$.\n$3$. Identify the larger-magnitude immediate neighbor of the peak by comparing $|X[(k_{peak}-1+N)\\%N]|$ and $|X[(k_{peak}+1)\\%N]|$. The two bins used for estimation are $k_{peak}$ and this neighbor.\n$4$. Let $m$ be the smaller of these two bin indices. The other index is then $m+1$.\n$5$. Extract the magnitudes $A_m = |X[m]|$ and $A_{m+1} = |X[m+1]|$.\n$6$. Calculate the fractional offset estimate $\\delta_{est} = A_{m+1} / (A_m + A_{m+1})$.\n$7$. The estimated frequency bin is $k_{est} = m + \\delta_{est}$.\n$8$. Convert the estimated bin back to frequency in Hertz using the relation $f_{est} = k_{est} \\cdot (F_s/N)$.\n\nThis procedure provides a robust and accurate estimate of the tone frequency with sub-bin resolution, grounded in the fundamental properties of the DFT of a rectangularly windowed sinusoid.",
