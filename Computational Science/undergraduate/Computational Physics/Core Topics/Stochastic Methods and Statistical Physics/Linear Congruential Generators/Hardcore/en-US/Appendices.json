            "problem": "You are asked to reason from first principles about the reversibility of a linear congruential generator (LCG) and then implement a program that computes the complete set of one-step predecessors for given forward states. A linear congruential generator (LCG) produces a sequence $\\{X_n\\}$ in the ring of integers modulo $m$ by the recurrence\n$$\nX_{n+1} \\equiv a X_n + c \\pmod{m},\n$$\nwhere $a, c, m$ are fixed integers with $m \\ge 2$, and $X_n \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,m-1\\}$ for all $n$. The congruence relation is the equivalence relation defined on the integers by $u \\equiv v \\pmod{m}$ if and only if $m$ divides $u - v$.\n\nYour task:\n\n1) Starting only from the fundamental properties of congruences, the notion of greatest common divisor (gcd), and the fact that an integer $a$ has a modular multiplicative inverse modulo $m$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,m) = 1$, derive necessary and sufficient conditions for when a one-step predecessor $X_n$ exists for a given $X_{n+1}$, and determine how many distinct predecessors there are in $\\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ when they exist. You must not assume any pre-packaged \"shortcut\" formula; instead, reason from the definition of congruence and the divisibility properties implied by the greatest common divisor.\n\n2) Based on your derivation, design an algorithm that, given integers $m, a, c$ and a specific forward state $X_{n+1}$, computes the complete set of all $X_n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ that satisfy the one-step relation $X_{n+1} \\equiv a X_n + c \\pmod{m}$. Your algorithm must:\n- Decide whether a solution exists.\n- If no solution exists, return the empty set.\n- If solutions exist, return all of them without brute-force iteration over $\\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$, using only number-theoretic reasoning and the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n- Sort the returned solutions in strictly increasing order.\n\n3) Implement your algorithm as a complete, runnable program that solves the following test suite. For each test case, the input consists of $(m, a, c, X_{n+1})$. Your program should compute and return the list of all $X_n \\in \\{0,\\dots,m-1\\}$ that satisfy the one-step relation. The test cases are:\n- Case A (happy path, prime modulus, multiplicative LCG): $m = 2147483647$, $a = 16807$, $c = 0$, $X_{n+1} = 16807$.\n- Case B (power-of-two modulus, odd multiplier): $m = 2147483648$, $a = 65539$, $c = 0$, $X_{n+1} = 1663592255$.\n- Case C (no predecessor exists, non-coprime $a$ and $m$): $m = 12$, $a = 8$, $c = 3$, $X_{n+1} = 5$.\n- Case D (multiple predecessors exist, non-coprime $a$ and $m$): $m = 12$, $a = 8$, $c = 4$, $X_{n+1} = 8$.\n- Case E (full-period Java-style parameters, additive LCG): $m = 281474976710656$, $a = 25214903917$, $c = 11$, $X_{n+1} = 11$.\n\nFor numerical robustness, all arithmetic must be done exactly over the integers; there are no floating-point quantities in this task.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, output the complete list of integer predecessors $X_n$ in $\\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ that map forward to the given $X_{n+1}$, sorted increasingly. If there are no predecessors, output the empty list.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each element itself being a list, for example: $[ [x_{A,1},x_{A,2}], [x_{B,1}], [], [x_{D,1},x_{D,2},x_{D,3}], [x_{E,1}] ]$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed problem in computational number theory, grounded in the established principles of linear congruences. All definitions are standard and the parameters provided are unambiguous and computationally tractable. We shall now proceed with a formal derivation of the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the set of all integers $X_n$ in the range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ that satisfy the one-step recurrence relation of a linear congruential generator (LCG) for a given successor state $X_{n+1}$. The relation is defined as:\n$$\nX_{n+1} \\equiv a X_n + c \\pmod{m}\n$$\nHere, $a$, $c$, and $m$ are given integers with $m \\ge 2$. Our goal is to solve for $X_n$. This can be achieved by first rearranging the congruence to isolate the term containing the unknown, $X_n$:\n$$\na X_n \\equiv X_{n+1} - c \\pmod{m}\n$$\nThis is a linear congruence of the standard form $Ax \\equiv B \\pmod{N}$, where we identify $A=a$, $x=X_n$, $B = X_{n+1} - c$, and $N=m$. For conciseness, let us define $b = X_{n+1} - c$. The congruence to be solved is:\n$$\na X_n \\equiv b \\pmod{m}\n$$\nThe existence and number of solutions for $X_n$ are determined entirely by the properties of the greatest common divisor of the coefficient $a$ and the modulus $m$. Let us denote $d = \\gcd(a, m)$.\n\nBy the definition of congruence, $a X_n \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ is equivalent to the statement that $m$ divides $(a X_n - b)$. This, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of an integer $k$ such that:\n$$\na X_n - b = k m\n$$\nRearranging this gives the linear Diophantine equation in two variables, $X_n$ and $k$:\n$$\na X_n - k m = b\n$$\nAccording to the fundamental theory of linear Diophantine equations (a consequence of Bézout's identity), an equation of the form $Ax + By = C$ has integer solutions for $(x, y)$ if and only if $\\gcd(A, B)$ divides $C$. In our case, $A = a$, $B = -m$, and $C = b$. Since $\\gcd(a, -m) = \\gcd(a, m) = d$, a solution for $X_n$ (and $k$) exists if and only if $d$ divides $b$.\n\nThis establishes the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of at least one predecessor:\nA predecessor $X_n$ exists if and only if $\\gcd(a, m)$ divides $(X_{n+1} - c)$.\n\nIf this condition, $d | b$, is not met, no integer solution for $X_n$ exists, and thus the set of predecessors in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ is empty.\n\nIf the condition $d | b$ is met, solutions exist, and we must find all of them. Since $d$ is a common divisor of $a$, $m$, and $b$, we can divide the entire congruence $a X_n \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ by $d$. The congruence $aX_n \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $aX_n = b + km$ for some integer $k$. Dividing by $d$ gives $(a/d)X_n = (b/d) + k(m/d)$, which implies $(a/d)X_n \\equiv (b/d) \\pmod{m/d}$. Let us define $a' = a/d$, $b' = b/d$, and $m' = m/d$. The reduced congruence is:\n$$\na' X_n \\equiv b' \\pmod{m'}\n$$\nBy the properties of the greatest common divisor, we know that $\\gcd(a/d, m/d) = \\gcd(a', m') = 1$. This is a critical step, as it ensures that $a'$ has a unique modular multiplicative inverse modulo $m'$. The existence of this inverse allows us to solve the reduced congruence directly.\n\nWe find the inverse of $a'$ modulo $m'$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This algorithm finds a pair of integers, say $(u, v)$, such that $a'u + m'v = \\gcd(a', m') = 1$. Taking this identity modulo $m'$, we get $a'u \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m'}$. The integer $u$ (or $u \\pmod{m'}$) is the required modular inverse, which we denote as $(a')^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the reduced congruence $a' X_n \\equiv b' \\pmod{m'}$ by this inverse $(a')^{-1}$:\n$$\n(a')^{-1} a' X_n \\equiv (a')^{-1} b' \\pmod{m'}\n$$\n$$\n1 \\cdot X_n \\equiv (a')^{-1} b' \\pmod{m'}\n$$\nThis gives us a family of solutions for $X_n$. All integers $X_n$ satisfying this relation are solutions to the reduced congruence. The smallest non-negative solution, which we will call the particular solution $x_0$, is given by:\n$$\nx_0 = ((a')^{-1} \\cdot b') \\pmod{m'}\n$$\nThis means that any solution $X_n$ must be of the form $X_n = x_0 + j \\cdot m'$ for some integer $j$. We are interested in solutions that lie in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. We substitute the form of the solution into this range constraint:\n$$\n0 \\le x_0 + j \\cdot m' \\le m-1\n$$\nSince $m' = m/d$, we are looking for $0 \\le x_0 + j \\cdot (m/d) \\le m-1$. Given that $0 \\le x_0  m' = m/d$, the valid integer values for $j$ are $0, 1, 2, \\dots, d-1$. For $j=d$, the solution becomes $x_0 + d \\cdot (m/d) = x_0 + m$, which is outside the required range.\n\nTherefore, if solutions exist, there are exactly $d = \\gcd(a, m)$ distinct solutions in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. These solutions are:\n$$\n\\{ x_0 + j \\cdot (m/d) \\mid j = 0, 1, \\dots, d-1 \\}\n$$\nThis set is naturally sorted in increasing order.\n\nThe algorithm to find the predecessors is as follows:\n1.  Given $m, a, c, X_{n+1}$, calculate $b = X_{n+1} - c$.\n2.  Compute $d = \\gcd(a, m)$.\n3.  Check if $b$ is divisible by $d$. If not ($b \\pmod d \\neq 0$), return an empty set of solutions.\n4.  If $b$ is divisible by $d$, proceed. Define $a' = a/d$, $b' = b/d$, and $m' = m/d$.\n5.  Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of $a'$ modulo $m'$. Let this be $inv\\_a'$.\n6.  Calculate the particular solution $x_0 = (b' \\cdot inv\\_a') \\pmod{m'}$.\n7.  Generate the complete set of $d$ solutions: $\\{x_0, x_0+m', x_0+2m', \\dots, x_0+(d-1)m'\\}$.\n8.  Return this set of solutions, which is already sorted.\nThis algorithm avoids brute-force search and relies entirely on efficient number-theoretic computations.",

            "problem": "You are to implement a linear congruential generator (LCG) and rigorously quantify how performing the multiplication in fixed-width integer arithmetic can shorten the eventual cycle reached by the sequence. Start from the core definition that an LCG is a first-order recurrence on integers modulo a modulus, given by the map\n$$\nX_{n+1} = (a X_n + c) \\bmod m,\n$$\nwhere $X_n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ for all $n$, $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the increment, and $m$ is the modulus. In a correct implementation with unbounded precision (or exact modular arithmetic), this recursion defines a deterministic map on a finite state space of size $m$, and therefore every orbit is eventually periodic by finiteness of the state space. In practical code running on fixed-width hardware, the product $a \\cdot X_n$ may overflow when computed in $w$-bit arithmetic. An incorrect implementation that computes the product in unsigned $w$-bit arithmetic and only afterwards reduces modulo $m$ implicitly evolves according to the modified map\n$$\nX_{n+1}^{\\text{bug}} \\;=\\; \\big( \\, \\big( (a X_n) \\bmod 2^w \\big) + c \\, \\big) \\bmod m,\n$$\nwhich can destroy intended period properties.\n\nTask:\n- Implement both update rules: the correct LCG update $X_{n+1} = (a X_n + c) \\bmod m$ and the bugged update $X_{n+1}^{\\text{bug}} = \\big( \\big( (a X_n) \\bmod 2^w \\big) + c \\big) \\bmod m$.\n- For each test case, starting from the provided seed $X_0$, compute the length of the eventual cycle reached by iterating the update. Specifically, treat the map as a deterministic function on a finite set and determine the length of the cycle encountered by the orbit beginning at $X_0$ (ignore any transient prefix that does not repeat). For each case, report two integers: the cycle length for the correct update and the cycle length for the bugged update, and also a boolean indicating whether the bugged cycle is strictly shorter than the correct one.\n\nFoundational bases you may assume:\n- The state space $\\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ is finite, so every deterministic map on it yields orbits that are eventually periodic.\n- Integer arithmetic modulo $n$ defines the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, and reductions modulo powers of two $2^w$ model wrap-around behavior of $w$-bit unsigned integer arithmetic.\n\nAlgorithmic requirement:\n- Use first principles of finite-state iteration to detect cycles: track visited states and their first occurrence index; when a state repeats, the cycle length equals the difference between the current step index and the index of the first occurrence of that repeated state.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your program to run exactly the following four test cases, each specified as a tuple $\\big(m,a,c,X_0,w\\big)$:\n1. $\\big( m = 2^{16} = 65536,\\; a = 5,\\; c = 1,\\; X_0 = 0,\\; w = 12 \\big)$.\n2. $\\big( m = 2^{15} = 32768,\\; a = 1,\\; c = 1,\\; X_0 = 12345,\\; w = 8 \\big)$.\n3. $\\big( m = 2^{12} = 4096,\\; a = 109,\\; c = 0,\\; X_0 = 1,\\; w = 8 \\big)$.\n4. $\\big( m = 10007,\\; a = 1,\\; c = 4567,\\; X_0 = 789,\\; w = 32 \\big)$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, compute and collect a list with three entries: the correct cycle length (integer), the bugged cycle length (integer), and a boolean that is true exactly when the bugged length is strictly smaller than the correct length.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a list as just described.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It addresses a standard topic in computational science: the properties of pseudo-random number generators, specifically the cycle structure of Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs). The task of comparing a correct implementation against one with a simulated integer-overflow bug is a practical and meaningful exercise in understanding numerical stability and implementation pitfalls. All definitions and parameters are provided, rendering the problem unambiguous and solvable.\n\nThe solution is obtained by direct simulation of the state sequences generated by the two LCG update rules. The cycle length of any deterministic sequence on a finite state space is found by detecting the first repeated state.\n\nLet the state space be $S = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. A sequence $\\{X_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ is generated by a function $f: S \\to S$, where $X_{n+1} = f(X_n)$. Because $S$ is a finite set, any such sequence must eventually repeat a state, at which point it becomes periodic. The objective is to determine the length of this period, which is the cycle length.\n\nWe employ a standard algorithm for cycle detection. We iterate the map $f$ starting from the initial seed $X_0$. We maintain a dictionary, which we can call $visited$, to store each unique state encountered and the step index of its first appearance. At each step $n \\ge 0$, we compute the state $X_n$. If $X_n$ is already present in the $visited$ dictionary, a cycle has been found. The length of this cycle is given by $L = n - visited[X_n]$. The sequence of states for indices from $visited[X_n]$ to $n-1$ constitutes the first full cycle encountered.\n\nThe problem specifies $2$ distinct update functions, $f$.\n\n$1$. The correct LCG update rule is given by the affine transformation on the ring of integers modulo $m$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{correct}}(X_n) = (a X_n + c) \\bmod m\n$$\nThis calculation presupposes that the product $a X_n$ is computed with sufficient precision (i.e., using integers that can exceed the word size of the machine) before the final reduction modulo $m$.\n\n$2$. The bugged LCG update rule models the behavior of fixed-width $w$-bit unsigned integer arithmetic, where the multiplication may overflow. This is defined by the map:\n$$\nf_{\\text{bugged}}(X_n) = \\big( \\big( (a X_n) \\bmod 2^w \\big) + c \\big) \\bmod m\n$$\nIn this case, the product $a X_n$ is first implicitly reduced modulo $2^w$, which correctly simulates the wrap-around behavior of a $w$-bit unsigned integer. This intermediate result is then used in the rest of the LCG calculation.\n\nA single computational procedure is designed to find the cycle length. This procedure takes the generator parameters $(m, a, c, X_0, w)$ and a boolean flag to select between $f_{\\text{correct}}$ and $f_{\\text{bugged}}$.\n\nThe algorithm is structured as follows:\nLet the function be `find_cycle_length(m, a, c, x0, w, use_bugged_rule)`.\n$1$. Initialize an empty dictionary, $visited$.\n$2$. Initialize the current state $x = x_0$ and the step counter $step = 0$.\n$3$. Enter a loop that continues as long as the state $x$ has not yet been recorded in $visited$:\n    a. Record the current state and step: $visited[x] = step$.\n    b. Calculate the next state. If $use\\_bugged\\_rule$ is true, apply $f_{\\text{bugged}}(x)$. Otherwise, apply $f_{\\text{correct}}(x)$. Python's arbitrary-precision integers are ideal for this, as they naturally handle the \"unbounded precision\" requirement for the correct product $a \\cdot x$. The update rules are implemented as:\n       - Correct: `x = (a * x + c) % m`\n       - Bugged: `x = (((a * x) % (2**w)) + c) % m`\n    c. Increment the step counter: $step = step + 1$.\n$4$. The loop terminates when the newly computed state $x$ is found in $visited$. The index of its first appearance is $first\\_occurrence = visited[x]$.\n$5$. The cycle length is calculated as $length = step - first\\_occurrence$. This value is returned.\n\nThis procedure is executed for each of the $4$ test cases provided.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-defined computational exercise grounded in the fundamental principles of computational physics and number theory, specifically the generation and analysis of pseudorandom numbers using Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs). All parameters, definitions, and required outputs are specified with mathematical precision, and there are no scientific or logical contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. The problem is self-contained and computationally tractable.\n\nThe task is to simulate a random walk whose steps are determined by the parity of numbers generated by an LCG, and to compute several statistical properties of this walk. The LCG is defined by the recurrence relation:\n$$\nx_{n+1} \\equiv (a x_n + c) \\pmod m\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the increment, $m$ is the modulus, and $x_0$ is the initial seed. All of these are integers.\n\nThe simulation proceeds for $N$ steps. For each step $n$ from $1$ to $N$, we first generate the number $x_n$ and then determine the walker's step $s_n$. The sequence of pseudorandom numbers is $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N\\}$, which is generated starting from the given seed $x_0$. The step $s_n$ is defined based on the parity of $x_n$:\n$$\ns_n =\n\\begin{cases}\n+1,  \\text{if } x_n \\bmod 2 = 0 \\text{ (even)}\\\\\n-1,  \\text{if } x_n \\bmod 2 = 1 \\text{ (odd)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total displacement after $N$ steps, $S_N$, is the sum of the individual steps:\n$$\nS_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} s_n\n$$\n\nThe solution requires the computation of four quantities for each given test case $(a, c, m, x_0, N)$:\n1.  $S_N$: The net integer displacement.\n2.  $f_{\\mathrm{even}}$: The fraction of the generated numbers $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$ that are even.\n3.  $D$: A boolean value indicating significant drift.\n4.  $R$: A boolean value indicating if the LCG parameters correspond to the historical RANDU generator.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for a given test case is as follows:\n\nFirst, we handle the boundary case where $N=0$. No numbers are generated. The total displacement $S_0$ is an empty sum, which is $0$. The fraction of even numbers $f_{\\mathrm{even}}$ is defined to be $0.0$. The drift condition $D$ is $\\left|\\frac{S_0}{\\max(0,1)}\\right| \\ge \\theta$, which evaluates to $\\left|\\frac{0}{1}\\right| \\ge 0.9$, or $0 \\ge 0.9$, which is false. So, $D = \\mathrm{False}$. The RANDU check $R$ depends only on the input parameters $a$, $c$, and $m$.\n\nFor the general case where $N  0$, we perform an iterative simulation:\n1.  Initialize state variables: Let the current LCG value be `current_x` $= x_0$. Initialize the total displacement `displacement` $= 0$ and a counter for even numbers `num_even` $= 0$.\n2.  Iterate $n$ from $1$ to $N$:\n    a. Generate the next number in the sequence: `current_x` $= (a \\cdot \\text{current\\_x} + c) \\pmod m$. This value corresponds to $x_n$. Note that Python's `%` operator handles negative results differently from the mathematical modulus for negative numbers, but since $a, c, m, x_0$ are non-negative, this is not a concern. The intermediate product $a \\cdot \\text{current\\_x}$ can exceed the capacity of standard 64-bit integers, but Python's arbitrary-precision integers manage this automatically.\n    b. Check the parity of `current_x`. If `current_x` $\\bmod 2 = 0$, the step is $s_n = +1$ and `num_even` is incremented. Otherwise, the step is $s_n = -1$.\n    c. Update the total displacement: `displacement` = `displacement` $+ s_n$.\n3.  After the loop completes, the final `displacement` is $S_N$ and the total count of even numbers is `num_even`.\n\nWith $S_N$ and `num_even` computed, the remaining outputs are determined:\n1.  $S_N$ is the final value of `displacement`.\n2.  $f_{\\mathrm{even}} = \\frac{\\text{num\\_even}}{N}$. This must be a floating-point division.\n3.  $D$ is $\\mathrm{True}$ if $\\left|\\frac{S_N}{N}\\right| \\ge 0.9$, and $\\mathrm{False}$ otherwise. The absolute value is necessary.\n4.  $R$ is $\\mathrm{True}$ if $a = 65539$, $c = 0$, and $m = 2^{31}$, and $\\mathrm{False}$ otherwise. This is a direct comparison of the input parameters.\n\nSome test cases exhibit properties that can be deduced analytically. For example, the RANDU generator ($a=65539$, $c=0$, $m=2^{31}$) with an odd seed will only produce odd numbers. This is because $a$ is odd, and for any odd $x_n$, the product $a \\cdot x_n$ is also odd. The modulus $m=2^{31}$ is a power of two. The remainder of an odd number upon division by a power of two is always odd. Consequently, all steps $s_n$ will be $-1$, leading to $S_N = -N$ and $f_{\\mathrm{even}} = 0.0$. Conversely, if the seed is even, all subsequent numbers will be even, leading to $S_N = N$ and $f_{\\mathrm{even}} = 1.0$.\n\nAnother case involves parameters ($a=1664525$, $c=1013904223$, $m=2^{32}$) where $a$ and $c$ are odd, and $m$ is a power of two. If $x_n$ is even, $x_{n+1} = (a \\cdot x_n + c) \\pmod m = (\\text{odd} \\cdot \\text{even} + \\text{odd}) \\pmod {\\text{even}} = \\text{odd} \\pmod{\\text{even}}$, which is odd. If $x_n$ is odd, $x_{n+1} = (\\text{odd} \\cdot \\text{odd} + \\text{odd}) \\pmod {\\text{even}} = \\text{even} \\pmod{\\text{even}}$, which is even. The parity of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ will strictly alternate. This leads to perfectly balanced steps and a net displacement $S_N$ of $0$ or $\\pm 1$, depending on $N$ and the initial parity.\n\nFor a general-purpose LCG, such as the one with a prime modulus $m=2^{31}-1$, these simple correlations are not present, and direct simulation is required. The program below implements this full simulation for all test cases.",
