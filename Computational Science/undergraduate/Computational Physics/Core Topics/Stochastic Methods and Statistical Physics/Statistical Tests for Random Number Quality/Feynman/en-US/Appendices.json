            "solution": "The problem requires the application of two standard goodness-of-fit statistical tests—the chi-squared test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test—to a deterministically generated sequence to assess its uniformity. We must first validate the premise and then, if valid, construct a systematic solution.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the mathematical field of number theory, specifically the theory of uniform distribution of sequences, and in the statistical methodology for testing pseudorandom number generators. All parameters and definitions are provided, making the problem well-posed and objective. The conditions for the applicability of the chi-squared test, namely that expected frequencies should not be too small, are met in all test cases. For instance, in the most constrained case (Case 2), the expected count per bin is $E_j = N/K = 200/10 = 20$, which is well above the typical minimum requirement of $E_j \\ge 5$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in testing the null hypothesis, $H_0$, that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{N}$ defined by $x_n = \\{\\alpha n^2\\} = \\alpha n^2 - \\lfloor \\alpha n^2 \\rfloor$ behaves as a sample from the continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0,1)$. The behavior of such sequences is well-understood in number theory. According to Weyl's criterion, the sequence $\\{P(n)\\alpha\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is uniformly distributed in $[0,1)$ for any polynomial $P(n)$ with at least one irrational coefficient other than the constant term. For the polynomial $P(n) = n^2$, the sequence $\\{n^2 \\alpha\\}$ is uniformly distributed if and only if $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\nTherefore, for Case 1 ($\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$) and Case 2 ($\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$), where $\\alpha$ is irrational, we expect the sequence to be uniformly distributed for large $N$. Consequently, the statistical tests should fail to reject the null hypothesis, yielding high p-values. Conversely, for Case 3 ($\\alpha = 1/2$), where $\\alpha$ is rational, the sequence is not uniformly distributed. The values of $x_n$ are confined to a finite set; specifically, $x_n = 0$ if $n$ is even and $x_n = 0.5$ if $n$ is odd. This drastic departure from uniformity should be easily detected by both tests, resulting in extremely low p-values and a rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing these tests for each specified parameter set.\n\n**1. Sequence Generation**\nFor each case, we generate the sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{N}$ by computing $x_n = (\\alpha \\cdot n^2) \\pmod 1$ for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, N$. High-precision floating-point arithmetic is essential to minimize numerical errors.\n\n**2. Chi-Squared ($\\chi^2$) Goodness-of-Fit Test**\nThis test discretizes the sample space. The interval $[0,1)$ is divided into $K$ disjoint, equal-width bins, $I_j = [\\frac{j-1}{K}, \\frac{j}{K})$ for $j=1, \\dots, K$.\nThe number of observed data points, $O_j$, falling into each bin $I_j$ is counted.\nUnder the null hypothesis of uniformity, the expected number of points in each bin is $E_j = N/K$.\nThe chi-squared statistic is then calculated as:\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}\n$$\nUnder $H_0$, this statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with $K-1$ degrees of freedom. The p-value, which is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, is given by $P(\\chi^2_{K-1} \\ge \\chi^2_{obs})$. This is calculated using the survival function (1 - CDF) of the chi-squared distribution.\n\n**3. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test**\nThis test compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the sample, $F_N(u)$, with the CDF of the reference distribution, which for $U[0,1)$ is $F(u)=u$. The ECDF is defined as:\n$$\nF_N(u) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mathbf{1}_{x_n \\le u}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function. The test statistic is the maximum absolute difference between these two functions over the entire domain:\n$$\nD_N = \\sup_{u \\in [0,1]} |F_N(u) - u|\n$$\nThe distribution of the $D_N$ statistic under $H_0$ is known as the Kolmogorov distribution, which is used to compute the corresponding p-value. This test is generally more powerful than the chi-squared test as it does not lose information through binning.\n\n**4. Decision Rule**\nFor each test, the computed p-value is compared against the given significance level $\\delta$. The null hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected if and only if the p-value is less than $\\delta$. An indicator variable, $I_{\\chi^2}$ or $I_{\\mathrm{KS}}$, is set to $1$ for rejection and $0$ for failure to reject.\n\nThe implementation will utilize the `numpy` library for numerical operations and sequence generation, and the `scipy.stats` module for the statistical test implementations (`chisquare` and `kstest`), which provide direct computation of the p-values. The final output will be formatted into a nested list structure as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The task is a standard exercise in computational statistics, specifically concerning the quality assessment of random numbers generated via a well-established randomness extraction technique. All parameters, methods, and test statistics are clearly and correctly defined.\n\nThe solution is developed in three stages: first, the generation of a debiased binary sequence using the von Neumann extractor; second, the application of three distinct statistical tests to this sequence; and third, the implementation of this process for the specified test cases.\n\n**1. The Von Neumann Extractor**\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the von Neumann randomness extractor. It takes a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) biased bits, $X_i$, where the probability of a one is $\\Pr(X_i=1)=p$ and a zero is $\\Pr(X_i=0)=1-p$, with $p \\in (0,1)$. The extractor processes the input stream by taking non-overlapping pairs of bits, $(X_{2j-1}, X_{2j})$.\n\nThe operational rules are:\n-   If the pair is $(1,0)$, output a $1$.\n-   If the pair is $(0,1)$, output a $0$.\n-   If the pair is $(0,0)$ or $(1,1)$, produce no output and proceed to the next pair.\n\nThe theoretical justification for this method's effectiveness is based on simple probability. The probabilities of the generating pairs are $\\Pr(1,0) = p(1-p)$ and $\\Pr(0,1) = (1-p)p$. These probabilities are identical. The probability of a pair being discarded is $\\Pr(0,0) + \\Pr(1,1) = (1-p)^2 + p^2$.\n\nThe conditional probability of producing a $1$, given that an output bit is generated, is:\n$$ \\Pr(\\text{output}=1 | \\text{output is generated}) = \\frac{\\Pr(1,0)}{\\Pr(1,0) + \\Pr(0,1)} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{p(1-p) + (1-p)p} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSimilarly, the conditional probability of producing a $0$ is also $1/2$. Thus, the output sequence is perfectly unbiased. Further, because the input bits are i.i.d., the non-overlapping pairs are independent, which ensures that the resulting output bits are also independent of each other. The procedure therefore transforms a biased i.i.d. source into an unbiased i.i.d. source, which should pass statistical tests for randomness.\n\nThe simulation generates these output bits by creating a stream of pseudorandom bits with bias $p$, processing them in pairs according to the rules, and collecting the output until a sequence of the desired length $N$ is formed. For reproducibility, the pseudorandom number generator is seeded with $s+i$ for test case index $i$, where the base seed is $s=20240913$.\n\n**2. Statistical Quality Assessment**\n\nThe quality of the generated $N$-bit sequence is assessed using three standard statistical tests. Each test evaluates a specific null hypothesis ($H_0$) related to ideal randomness and yields a $p$-value. The $p$-value represents the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one measured, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n\n**2.1. Frequency (Monobit) Test**\nThis test checks for the most fundamental property of an unbiased binary sequence: an equal number of zeros and ones on average.\n-   $H_0$: The probability of a one is $1/2$.\n-   Let $k$ be the number of ones in the $N$-bit sequence. Under $H_0$, $k$ follows a binomial distribution, $B(N, 0.5)$.\n-   The two-sided $p$-value is the probability of observing a count of ones as far or farther from the expected mean $N/2$ than $k$. This is calculated using the exact binomial probability mass function.\n\n**2.2. Serial Test on Pairs**\nThis test examines for short-range correlations by checking if adjacent bits are independent.\n-   $H_0$: The bits are independent and fair. This implies that each of the four possible non-overlapping pairs—$(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$—should occur with equal probability, $1/4$.\n-   The first $2 \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ bits are formed into $M = \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ pairs. The number of occurrences of each pair type ($c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11}$) is counted.\n-   A chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test is performed to compare the observed counts to the expected count of $M/4$ for each pair type. The $\\chi^2$ statistic is:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{ij \\in \\{00,01,10,11\\}} \\frac{(c_{ij} - M/4)^2}{M/4} $$\n-   This statistic is compared against a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $4-1=3$ degrees of freedom to obtain the $p$-value.\n\n**2.3. Runs Test**\nThis test checks for independence by analyzing the number of \"runs\" in the sequence, where a run is a maximal consecutive subsequence of identical values.

This final, challenging practice demonstrates that the answer is a resounding yes. You will construct a pseudo-random number generator that is deliberately engineered to have a perfect one-dimensional uniform distribution but a fatal correlation in two dimensions, a flaw that will cause a simple Monte Carlo estimation of $ \\pi $ to fail dramatically. This exercise delivers a crucial lesson on the limitations of one-dimensional tests and the critical importance of multidimensional uniformity for reliable scientific simulations. ",

            "problem": "You are to construct and analyze a deterministic Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) that, for each provided seed, produces a finite sequence of real numbers in the open interval $(0,1)$ which passes a specified statistical battery while producing a systematically incorrect outcome in a simple Monte Carlo (MC) physical simulation. The program you write must implement the generator, apply the tests, run the simulation, and report a boolean result for each test case. All definitions and thresholds are given below.\n\nA PRNG with seed $s$ produces a sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ with each $x_n \\in (0,1)$. For a fixed seed $s$, define three hypothesis tests under the null hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_0$ that the sequence is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with common distribution $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$:\n\n- One-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test: Let $F_N(x)$ denote the empirical distribution function of $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ and $F(x)=x$ denote the cumulative distribution function of $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. Define the KS statistic $D_N=\\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} \\left| F_N(x) - F(x) \\right|$. The associated $p$-value is computed under $\\mathcal{H}_0$.\n\n- Chi-square test for equal-probability bins: Partition $(0,1)$ into $B$ equal-width bins. Let $O_j$ be the observed count in bin $j$ for $j=1,\\dots,B$, and let $E_j=N/B$ be the expected count under $\\mathcal{H}_0$. The chi-square statistic is $\\chi^2=\\sum_{j=1}^B \\frac{(O_j-E_j)^2}{E_j}$. The associated $p$-value is computed under a chi-square distribution with $B-1$ degrees of freedom under $\\mathcal{H}_0$.\n\n- Sample mean test: Let $\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n$. Under $\\mathcal{H}_0$, by the Central Limit Theorem, $Z=\\sqrt{12N}\\,(\\bar{X}-\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is approximately standard normal. The two-sided $p$-value is computed from the standard normal distribution.\n\nDefine a pass criterion threshold $\\varepsilon$ with $0<\\varepsilon<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and say that the statistical battery passes if and only if all three $p$-values lie strictly within the open interval $(\\varepsilon,1-\\varepsilon)$.\n\nIndependently of the above tests, define a physics-motivated MC estimator of $\\pi$ via the classical dart-throwing method on the unit square. Using the same PRNG and the same seed $s$, form $M$ consecutive pairs from a stream $(x_1,x_2,\\dots)$ as $(x_{2k-1},x_{2k})$ for $k=1,\\dots,M$. Define\n$$\n\\widehat{\\pi} = 4\\, \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^M \\mathbf{1}\\!\\left\\{ x_{2k-1}^2 + x_{2k}^2 \\le 1 \\right\\},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function. Given an absolute error tolerance $\\tau>0$, declare that the MC simulation fails if and only if $|\\widehat{\\pi} - \\pi| > \\tau$. All angles involved are implicitly in radians through the use of $\\pi$; no explicit angles are computed.\n\nYour program must implement a single deterministic PRNG design of your choosing and evaluate it on the following test suite. For each test case, the program must compute a boolean value that is true if and only if the PRNG passes the statistical battery and fails the MC simulation, and false otherwise.\n\nThe test suite consists of the following parameter sets $(s, N, B, M, \\varepsilon, \\tau)$:\n\n- Case $1$: $(s, N, B, M, \\varepsilon, \\tau) = (123456789, 100000, 100, 50000, 10^{-9}, 10^{-2})$.\n- Case $2$: $(s, N, B, M, \\varepsilon, \\tau) = (0, 50000, 50, 20000, 10^{-9}, 10^{-2})$.\n- Case $3$: $(s, N, B, M, \\varepsilon, \\tau) = (987654321098765432, 120000, 200, 60000, 10^{-9}, 10^{-2})$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the three boolean results for the cases above as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, `[True,False,True]`). No other output should be produced. All reported values are unitless; no physical units are required in the output. All internal computations must be deterministic and require no user input.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded exercise in computational physics that probes the critical distinction between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional properties of pseudorandom number sequences. An unsophisticated battery of one-dimensional statistical tests is insufficient to certify a generator for multi-dimensional applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations. We shall construct a generator that is deliberately flawed in two dimensions, yet whose one-dimensional marginal distribution remains uniform, thereby satisfying the stated criteria.\n\nThe core of the problem is to design a single deterministic Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) that, for a given seed $s$, produces a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ that simultaneously:\n$1$. Passes a statistical battery of three tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Chi-square, sample mean), meaning the $p$-value for each test falls within the interval $(\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon)$.\n$2$. Fails a Monte Carlo (MC) estimation of $\\pi$, meaning the estimated value $\\widehat{\\pi}$ differs from the true value $\\pi$ by more than a tolerance $\\tau$.\n\nWe will construct a PRNG with a specific, fatal correlation between adjacent numbers. Let a high-quality, cryptographically secure PRNG, such as the PCG64 generator provided by the `numpy` library, be used as a base source of randomness. Let this base generator be seeded with the given integer seed $s$ to produce a sequence of i.i.d. values $\\{u_k\\}$ from a $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ distribution.\n\nOur flawed PRNG will then construct the target sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ by forming pairs:\n$$ x_{2k-1} = u_k $$\n$$ x_{2k} = 1 - u_k $$\nfor $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nLet us analyze the properties of this sequence $\\{x_n\\}$.\n\nFirst, consider the one-dimensional statistical properties. The sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a mixture of two sequences, $\\{u_k\\}$ and $\\{1-u_k\\}$. If $u_k \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$, then it is a basic result of probability theory that the transformed variable $1-u_k$ is also distributed as $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. The combined sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ therefore has a marginal cumulative distribution function that is an equal-weighted average of the uniform CDF with itself, which is simply the uniform CDF. Thus, the marginal distribution of $\\{x_n\\}$ is $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. Consequently, it is expected to appear uniform to any one-dimensional test.\n- The **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** compares the empirical CDF of $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ to the uniform CDF $F(x)=x$. As the marginal distribution is uniform, the empirical CDF will converge to the true CDF, and the test is expected to pass with a high $p$-value.\n- The **Chi-square test** examines the frequency of numbers falling into $B$ bins. A uniform marginal distribution implies that counts should be evenly distributed, so this test is also expected to pass.\n- The **Sample mean test** relies on the mean of the sequence. The expectation is $E[x_n] = \\frac{1}{2} E[u_k] + \\frac{1}{2} E[1-u_k] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The sample mean $\\bar{X}$ will converge to $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the test statistic $Z=\\sqrt{12N}\\,(\\bar{X}-\\tfrac{1}{2})$ will be close to $0$, yielding a $p$-value close to $1$.\nGiven the extremely permissive pass-fail threshold of $\\varepsilon=10^{-9}$, it is virtually certain that all three statistical tests will pass.\n\nSecond, consider the two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. The method estimates $\\pi$ by sampling points $(x,y)$ in the unit square and finding the fraction that falls within the unit circle. Our generator produces pairs $(x_{2k-1}, x_{2k}) = (u_k, 1-u_k)$. These points are not uniformly distributed in the unit square; they all lie perfectly on the line segment $y = 1-x$ for $x \\in (0,1)$. This is a catastrophic failure of two-dimensional uniformity.\n\nThe MC estimator is $\\widehat{\\pi} = 4\\, \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^M \\mathbf{1}\\!\\left\\{ x_{2k-1}^2 + x_{2k}^2 \\le 1 \\right\\}$. Substituting our correlated pairs, the condition inside the indicator function becomes:\n$$ u_k^2 + (1-u_k)^2 \\le 1 $$\nExpanding the expression gives:\n$$ u_k^2 + 1 - 2u_k + u_k^2 \\le 1 $$\n$$ 2u_k^2 - 2u_k \\le 0 $$\n$$ 2u_k(u_k - 1) \\le 0 $$\nSince the base generator produces $u_k \\in [0,1)$, the term $u_k$ is non-negative and the term $(u_k-1)$ is non-positive. Their product is therefore always non-positive, and the inequality is always satisfied.\n\nEvery single pair $(x_{2k-1}, x_{2k})$ generated will be counted as a \"hit\" inside the circle. The sum in the estimator becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^M 1 = M$. The estimator for $\\pi$ will therefore be:\n$$ \\widehat{\\pi} = 4 \\frac{M}{M} = 4 $$\nThe MC simulation fails if $|\\widehat{\\pi} - \\pi| > \\tau$. In our case, this is $|4 - \\pi| > 10^{-2}$. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, the absolute error is $|4 - \\pi| \\approx 0.8584$, which is significantly larger than the tolerance $\\tau=10^{-2}$. The MC simulation is thus guaranteed to fail.\n\nThe final boolean result for each test case is true if and only if the statistical battery passes (which we expect) and the MC simulation fails (which is guaranteed). The implementation will proceed by generating the sequence as described, applying the specified statistical tests using functions from the `scipy.stats` library, and calculating the MC simulation result.",
