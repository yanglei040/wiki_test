            "solution": "The problem requires the generation of random samples from an exponential distribution using the inverse transform method, followed by a statistical validation of these samples using a goodness-of-fit test. The solution is developed in two parts: first, the derivation of the sampling algorithm, and second, the specification of the statistical test.\n\n**1. Inverse Transform Sampling for the Exponential Distribution**\n\nThe exponential distribution is characterized by a rate parameter $\\lambda > 0$. Its probability density function (PDF) for a random variable $X$ is given by:\n$$\nf(x; \\lambda) = \\begin{cases} \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x)$, represents the probability that the random variable $X$ takes a value less than or equal to $x$. It is obtained by integrating the PDF from $0$ to $x$:\n$$\nF(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\le x) = \\int_0^x \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t} dt = \\left[ -e^{-\\lambda t} \\right]_0^x = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x} \\quad \\text{for } x \\ge 0\n$$\nThe inverse transform sampling method is founded on the principle that if $U$ is a random variable drawn from a standard uniform distribution on the interval $(0, 1)$, then the random variable $X = F^{-1}(U)$ will have the distribution characterized by the CDF $F$.\n\nTo apply this method, we must first find the inverse of the CDF, denoted $F^{-1}(u)$. We set $u = F(x)$ and solve for $x$:\n$$\nu = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $x$:\n$$\ne^{-\\lambda x} = 1 - u\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\lambda x = \\ln(1 - u)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $x$ yields the inverse CDF:\n$$\nx = F^{-1}(u) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(1 - u)\n$$\nTherefore, to generate a sample $x$ from an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$, one generates a random number $u$ from $\\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ and applies the transformation $x = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(1 - u)$.\n\nA useful simplification arises from the property that if $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, then the random variable $V = 1 - U$ is also distributed as $\\text{Uniform}(0,1)$. This allows us to replace $1 - u$ with $u$ in the formula, leading to the computationally equivalent and more direct expression:\n$$\nx = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(u)\n$$\nThis formula will be implemented to generate the $n$ samples for each test case. The procedure commences by initializing a pseudo-random number generator with the specified seed $s=123456789$ to ensure reproducibility. Then, for each test case $(\\lambda, n, \\alpha)$, we draw $n$ independent values $u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n$ from $\\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ and compute the corresponding exponential samples $x_i = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(u_i)$.\n\n**2. Goodness-of-Fit Testing**\n\nAfter generating the sample data $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, a one-sample distributional goodness-of-fit test must be performed. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the data are drawn from an exponential distribution with the specified rate parameter $\\lambda$. The alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, is that the data are not from this distribution.\n\nA standard and appropriate test for this scenario is the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. This test compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the sample data, $F_n(x)$, with the theoretical CDF of the hypothesized distribution, $F(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}$. The ECDF is defined as:\n$$\nF_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{I}(x_i \\le x)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function. The K-S test statistic, $D_n$, is the maximum absolute difference between the ECDF and the theoretical CDF over all possible values of $x$:\n$$\nD_n = \\sup_x | F_n(x) - F(x) |\n$$\nThe distribution of the $D_n$ statistic under the null hypothesis is known and is independent of the specific continuous distribution being tested. This property allows for the calculation of a $p$-value, defined as the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one computed from the data, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n\nThe decision rule is based on the significance level $\\alpha$:\n- If the $p$-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n- If the $p$-value is greater than or equal to $\\alpha$, we do not reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n\nThe problem requires a boolean decision that is $\\text{True}$ if we do not reject $H_0$. Thus, the decision for a given test case will be the result of the comparison $p\\text{-value} \\ge \\alpha$. For implementation, we will use the `scipy.stats.kstest` function. The exponential distribution implementation in `scipy` is parameterized by a location `loc` and a `scale` parameter. To match our target PDF $\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$, we must set `loc`$=0$ and `scale`$=1/\\lambda$.\n\nThe complete algorithm for each test case $(\\lambda, n, \\alpha)$ is:\n1. Generate $n$ uniform random numbers $u_1, \\dots, u_n$ using a generator seeded with $s=123456789$.\n2. Transform these into exponential samples $x_i = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(u_i)$.\n3. Perform the K-S test on the samples $\\{x_i\\}$ against the 'expon' distribution with parameters `loc=0` and `scale=1/\\lambda`.\n4. Obtain the $p$-value from the test result.\n5. Compute the boolean decision as $p\\text{-value} \\ge \\alpha$.\n6. Report the $p$-value rounded to six decimal places and the boolean decision.\n\nThis procedure will be executed for all five specified test cases.",

It is entirely objective and free of subjective elements.\n- The problem is fully specified, internally consistent, and requires a formalizable solution based on standard statistical simulation techniques. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be developed.\n\nThe most efficient and robust method for generating random variates from this distribution is inverse transform sampling. This method relies on the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF), also known as the quantile function. It is superior to alternatives like rejection sampling, whose efficiency can degrade severely if the truncation interval lies in the tails of the underlying normal distribution.\n\nFirst, we derive the CDF of the truncated random variable $Y$. For any $x \\in [a, b]$, the CDF $F_Y(x)$ is given by:\n$$ F_Y(x) = P(Y \\le x) = \\int_a^x f_Y(t) \\, dt = \\int_a^x \\frac{\\varphi\\left(\\frac{t-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)}{\\sigma\\left[\\Phi\\left(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)-\\Phi\\left(\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right]} \\, dt $$\nLet us define the standardized bounds $\\alpha = \\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}$. The denominator is then $\\sigma[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)]$.\nFor the integral, we perform a change of variables: let $z = \\frac{t-\\mu}{\\sigma}$, which implies $dt = \\sigma \\, dz$. The integration limits change from $t=a$ to $z=\\alpha$, and from $t=x$ to $z=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n$$ F_Y(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)]} \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}} \\varphi(z) (\\sigma \\, dz) = \\frac{1}{\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)} \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}} \\varphi(z) \\, dz $$\nBy definition of the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(z)$, the integral is $\\Phi(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}) - \\Phi(\\alpha)$. Thus, the CDF is:\n$$ F_Y(x) = \\frac{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi(\\alpha)}{\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)} $$\nThe inverse transform sampling method states that if $U$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, then $X = F^{-1}(U)$ is a random variable with CDF $F$. We apply this principle. Let $u$ be a realization from a $U(0,1)$ distribution. We set $F_Y(y) = u$ and solve for $y$:\n$$ u = \\frac{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi(\\alpha)}{\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)} $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ u[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)] + \\Phi(\\alpha) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nTo isolate $y$, we apply the inverse standard normal CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}\\left( u[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)] + \\Phi(\\alpha) \\right) $$\nFinally, solving for $y$ yields the sampling formula:\n$$ y = \\mu + \\sigma \\Phi^{-1}\\left( \\Phi(\\alpha) + u[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)] \\right) $$\nThe term $\\Phi(\\alpha) + u[\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)]$ is simply a linear transformation of a uniform variate on $[0,1]$ to a uniform variate on $[\\Phi(\\alpha), \\Phi(\\beta)]$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Parse the parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma, a, b, n, \\text{seed})$.\n2.  Handle the degenerate case where $a=b$. The distribution is a point mass at $a$. All $n$ draws are equal to $a$, and the sample mean is therefore exactly $a$.\n3.  For the non-degenerate case ($a < b$):\n    a. Initialize a pseudorandom number generator with the given `seed`.\n    b. Generate $n$ independent random variates $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n$ from the uniform distribution $U(0,1)$.\n    c. Compute the standardized bounds $\\alpha = (a-\\mu)/\\sigma$ and $\\beta = (b-\\mu)/\\sigma$.\n    d. Evaluate the standard normal CDF at these bounds: $C_a = \\Phi(\\alpha)$ and $C_b = \\Phi(\\beta)$.\n    e. For each $u_i$, compute the transformed variate $v_i = C_a + u_i(C_b - C_a)$.\n    f. Apply the inverse standard normal CDF (quantile function) to each $v_i$ to get a standard normal variate $z_i = \\Phi^{-1}(v_i)$.\n    g. Transform each $z_i$ back to the scale of the original truncated distribution to get the final samples: $y_i = \\mu + \\sigma z_i$.\n    h. Compute the sample mean of the generated draws: $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the four test cases provided.",

Construct a program that, for each test case listed below, performs the following:\n   - Computes the function $F(x)$ and its inverse $G(u)$ such that for any $u \\in [0,1]$, the value $x = G(u)$ satisfies $\\lvert F(x) - u \\rvert \\le 10^{-12}$.\n   - Generates $N$ independent pseudorandom variates $u_1,\\dots,u_N$ that are uniformly distributed on the open interval $(0,1)$ using a pseudorandom number generator initialized with the specified integer seed for that test case.\n   - Transforms the uniform variates to samples $x_i = G(u_i)$ that follow the distribution with density $f(x)$ on $[0,L]$.\n   - Computes the following three summary statistics for the samples:\n     - The sample mean $m_N = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$ (express your answer in the same length unit as $L$).\n     - The sample second moment $s_N^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2$ (express your answer in the square of the length unit of $L$).\n     - The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic $D_N$ for the target cumulative distribution function $F$, defined by\n       $$D_N = \\max\\!\\left(\\max_{1\\le i\\le N}\\left(\\frac{i}{N} - F(x_{(i)})\\right), \\max_{1\\le i\\le N}\\left(F(x_{(i)}) - \\frac{i-1}{N}\\right)\\right)$$\n       where $x_{(1)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{(N)}$ is the non-decreasing ordering of the samples. The statistic $D_N$ is dimensionless.\n3. Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list of sublists, where each sublist contains the three values $[m_N, s_N^{(2)}, D_N]$ in that order. Each floating-point result in the output must be rounded to $6$ decimal places. For example, the required overall format is\n   $$\\big[\\,[m_{N,1}, s^{(2)}_{N,1}, D_{N,1}], [m_{N,2}, s^{(2)}_{N,2}, D_{N,2}], \\ldots \\big]$$\n   and the program must print exactly one line containing this list with the brackets and commas as shown.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$: $L = 1.0$, $N = 1000$, seed $= 12345$.\n- Case $2$: $L = 5.0$, $N = 2000$, seed $= 20231102$.\n- Case $3$: $L = 2.0$, $N = 1$, seed $= 42$.\n\nAngle unit specification: all angles appearing inside trigonometric functions must be in radians.\n\nPhysical units: report $m_N$ in the same unit as $L$, $s_N^{(2)}$ in the square of that unit, and $D_N$ as a unitless number.\n\nFinal Output Format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of sublists, each sublist of the form $[m_N,s_N^{(2)},D_N]$, enclosed in square brackets, for example: $[[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the application of the inverse transform sampling method to generate random variates from a distribution defined by the quantum mechanical probability density of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The steps involve analytical derivation of the probability and cumulative distribution functions, followed by a numerical implementation to generate samples and compute specified statistics. The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed.\n\nThe system is a particle in an infinite potential well on the interval $[0, L]$. The stationary state wavefunctions are $\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for an integer quantum number $n \\ge 1$. We are concerned with the first excited state, which corresponds to $n=2$.\n\n**1. Probability Density Function (PDF)**\n\nThe probability density function $f(x)$ is given by the squared modulus of the wavefunction, $f(x) = |\\psi_2(x)|^2$.\nFor $n=2$, the wavefunction is:\n$$ \\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nThe corresponding PDF for $x \\in [0, L]$ is:\n$$ f(x) = \\left| \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right|^2 = \\frac{2}{L} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nUsing the trigonometric power-reduction identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, we can rewrite the PDF as:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{2}{L} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis form is more convenient for integration.\n\n**2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**\n\nThe cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ is defined as the integral of the PDF from $0$ to $x$:\n$$ F(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{1}{L} \\left( 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right) dt $$\nWe perform the integration term by term:\n$$ F(x) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{x} 1 \\,dt - \\int_{0}^{x} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi t}{L}\\right) dt \\right] $$\n$$ F(x) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ t - \\frac{L}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{x} $$\nEvaluating at the limits gives:\n$$ F(x) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\left( x - \\frac{L}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right) - \\left( 0 - \\frac{L}{4\\pi} \\sin(0) \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ F(x) = \\frac{x}{L} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nAs a check, we evaluate the CDF at the boundaries: $F(0) = 0$ and $F(L) = \\frac{L}{L} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sin(4\\pi) = 1 - 0 = 1$. This confirms the normalization.\n\n**3. Invertibility of the CDF**\n\nTo apply inverse transform sampling, the CDF $F(x)$ must have a unique inverse. A continuous function has a unique inverse if it is strictly monotonic. We can prove that $F(x)$ is strictly increasing on $[0, L]$ by examining its derivative. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $F'(x) = f(x)$.\n$$ F'(x) = f(x) = \\frac{2}{L} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\frac{2}{L}$ is positive. The term $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is non-negative for all real $\\theta$. It is equal to $0$ only when $\\sin(\\theta)=0$. For $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi x}{L}$ with $x \\in [0, L]$, this occurs at $x=0$, $x=L/2$, and $x=L$.\nSince $F'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in [0, L]$ and $F'(x)$ is zero only at a finite number of isolated points, the function $F(x)$ is strictly increasing over the entire interval $[0, L]$. Therefore, a unique inverse function $G(u) = F^{-1}(u)$ exists for $u \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**4. The Inverse Transform Sampling Algorithm**\n\nThe inverse transform method consists of two steps:\n1. Generate a random variate $u$ from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, denoted $u \\sim U(0, 1)$.\n2. Compute the sample $x$ by applying the inverse CDF: $x = G(u) = F^{-1}(u)$.\n\nThe equation we must solve for $x$ is $F(x) = u$, or:\n$$ \\frac{x}{L} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) = u $$\nThis is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved for $x$ in a simple closed form. We must employ a numerical root-finding algorithm. For a given $u$, we seek the root $x$ of the function $h(x) = F(x) - u = 0$ on the interval $[0, L]$. Since $h(0) = F(0) - u = -u < 0$ and $h(L) = F(L) - u = 1 - u > 0$ for $u \\in (0, 1)$, the root is bracketed in $[0, L]$. A robust and efficient algorithm like Brent's method is suitable for finding this root to the required precision.\n\n**5. Computation of Summary Statistics**\n\nFor a set of $N$ samples $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N\\}$ generated by this method, we compute the following statistics:\n- **Sample Mean ($m_N$)**: The arithmetic average of the samples.\n$$ m_N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i $$\n- **Sample Second Moment ($s_N^{(2)}$)**: The arithmetic average of the squares of the samples.\n$$ s_N^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 $$\n- **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) Statistic ($D_N$)**: This statistic measures the maximum distance between the empirical distribution function (EDF) of the samples and the theoretical cumulative distribution function $F(x)$. For a sorted sample set $x_{(1)} \\le x_{(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{(N)}$, the statistic is defined as:\n$$ D_N = \\max\\left( \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N}\\left(\\frac{i}{N} - F(x_{(i)})\\right), \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N}\\left(F(x_{(i)}) - \\frac{i-1}{N}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe algorithm will be implemented for each test case, generating $N$ samples using the specified seed, calculating these three statistics, and reporting the results in the required format.",
