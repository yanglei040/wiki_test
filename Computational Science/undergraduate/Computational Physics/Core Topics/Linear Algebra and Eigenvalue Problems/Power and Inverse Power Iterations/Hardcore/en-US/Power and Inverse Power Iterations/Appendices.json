            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Rayleigh quotient $r_{1}$ for the first iterate of the power method applied to an orthogonal projector matrix $P$.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- A nonzero vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n- The orthogonal projector matrix $P = \\dfrac{v v^{T}}{v^{T} v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$.\n- An initial vector $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the property $v^{T} x_{0} \\neq 0$.\n- The first unnormalized iterate is $y_{1} = P x_{0}$.\n- The first normalized iterate is $x_{1} = \\dfrac{y_{1}}{\\|y_{1}\\|_{2}}$.\n- The Rayleigh quotient is $r_{1} = \\dfrac{x_{1}^{T} P x_{1}}{x_{1}^{T} x_{1}}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear algebra and numerical analysis. The definitions of the orthogonal projector, power iteration, and Rayleigh quotient are standard. The problem is well-posed; the condition $v^{T} x_{0} \\neq 0$ ensures that the first iterate $y_{1}$ is not the zero vector, so its normalization $x_{1}$ is well-defined. The problem is objective and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to compute $r_{1}$. We begin by analyzing the structure of the first iterate $x_{1}$.\nThe unnormalized iterate $y_{1}$ is given by:\n$$y_{1} = P x_{0} = \\left(\\dfrac{v v^{T}}{v^{T} v}\\right) x_{0} = \\dfrac{v (v^{T} x_{0})}{v^{T} v}$$\nLet us define the scalar $\\alpha = v^{T} x_{0}$. By the problem statement, $\\alpha \\neq 0$. Also, let us denote the scalar $v^{T} v = \\|v\\|_{2}^{2}$. Since $v$ is a nonzero vector, $v^{T} v  0$.\nWith these definitions, the expression for $y_{1}$ simplifies to:\n$$y_{1} = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{v^{T} v} v$$\nThis expression shows that $y_{1}$ is a non-zero scalar multiple of the vector $v$.\n\nNext, we normalize $y_{1}$ to obtain $x_{1}$. The normalization is with respect to the Euclidean norm, $\\| \\cdot \\|_{2}$.\nThe norm of $y_{1}$ is:\n$$\\|y_{1}\\|_{2} = \\left\\| \\dfrac{\\alpha}{v^{T} v} v \\right\\|_{2} = \\left| \\dfrac{\\alpha}{v^{T} v} \\right| \\|v\\|_{2} = \\dfrac{|\\alpha|}{v^{T} v} \\sqrt{v^{T} v} = \\dfrac{|\\alpha|}{\\sqrt{v^{T} v}}$$\nNow, we compute $x_{1}$:\n$$x_{1} = \\dfrac{y_{1}}{\\|y_{1}\\|_{2}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{\\alpha}{v^{T} v} v}{\\frac{|\\alpha|}{\\sqrt{v^{T} v}}} = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{|\\alpha|} \\dfrac{\\sqrt{v^{T} v}}{v^{T} v} v = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{|\\alpha|} \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{v^{T} v}} v$$\nRecognizing that $\\sqrt{v^{T} v} = \\|v\\|_{2}$, we can write $x_{1}$ as:\n$$x_{1} = \\text{sgn}(\\alpha) \\dfrac{v}{\\|v\\|_{2}}$$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha}{|\\alpha|}$ is the sign of $\\alpha$. This shows that $x_{1}$ is a unit vector pointing in the same or opposite direction as $v$. In other words, $x_{1}$ lies in the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $v$.\n\nNow we must evaluate the Rayleigh quotient $r_{1} = \\dfrac{x_{1}^{T} P x_{1}}{x_{1}^{T} x_{1}}$.\nBy definition of a normalized vector, the denominator is $x_{1}^{T} x_{1} = \\|x_{1}\\|_{2}^{2} = 1$.\nSo, the Rayleigh quotient simplifies to $r_{1} = x_{1}^{T} P x_{1}$.\n\nTo compute this, we first evaluate the action of $P$ on $x_{1}$.\n$$P x_{1} = P \\left( \\text{sgn}(\\alpha) \\dfrac{v}{\\|v\\|_{2}} \\right) = \\text{sgn}(\\alpha) \\dfrac{1}{\\|v\\|_{2}} (P v)$$\nLet us compute $P v$:\n$$P v = \\left(\\dfrac{v v^{T}}{v^{T} v}\\right) v = \\dfrac{v (v^{T} v)}{v^{T} v} = v$$\nThis confirms that $v$ is an eigenvector of the projector $P$ with a corresponding eigenvalue of $\\lambda = 1$.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P x_{1}$:\n$$P x_{1} = \\text{sgn}(\\alpha) \\dfrac{1}{\\|v\\|_{2}} (v) = x_{1}$$\nThis shows that $x_{1}$ is also an eigenvector of $P$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$. This is expected, as the power iteration has converged in a single step to an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue of $P$, which is $1$. The eigenvalues of $P$ are $1$ (with eigenvector $v$) and $0$ (with eigenspace being the orthogonal complement of the span of $v$).\n\nFinally, we calculate $r_{1}$:\n$$r_{1} = x_{1}^{T} (P x_{1}) = x_{1}^{T} x_{1}$$\nSince $x_{1}$ is a unit vector, $x_{1}^{T} x_{1} = 1$.\nTherefore, the value of the Rayleigh quotient is:\n$$r_{1} = 1$$\nThis result is independent of the choice of initial vector $x_{0}$, as long as $x_{0}$ has a non-zero component in the direction of $v$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a unique, verifiable solution. The problem requires the implementation of two fundamental numerical algorithms in linear algebra—the power iteration and the inverse iteration methods—to find the extremal eigenvalues of a matrix representing a discrete physical operator.\n\nThe matrix $A$ represents the five-point finite-difference discretization of the negative two-dimensional Laplacian operator, $-\\nabla^2 = -(\\partial^2/\\partial x^2 + \\partial^2/\\partial y^2)$, on a rectangular domain $[0, L_x] \\times [0, L_y]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The domain is discretized into a grid of $(n_x+2) \\times (n_y+2)$ points, with $n_x n_y$ interior points. The matrix $A$ acts on a vector of function values at these interior points.\n\nThe construction of $A$ as a Kronecker sum, $A = I_y \\otimes T_x + T_y \\otimes I_x$, is the standard mathematical formulation for separable two-dimensional operators. The matrices $T_x$ and $T_y$ are scaled discretizations of the one-dimensional second derivative operator, $-d^2/dx^2$, on their respective axes. Specifically, the matrix $\\mathrm{tridiag}(-1, 2, -1)$ is a scaled version of the discrete one-dimensional Laplacian. As the sum of symmetric positive-definite matrices (since $T_x$ and $T_y$ are scaled diagonally dominant M-matrices), $A$ is guaranteed to be symmetric and positive-definite, possessing real, positive eigenvalues.\n\nThe first sequence for computing $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{up}}$ is the Power Iteration method. This iterative algorithm repeatedly applies a matrix $A$ to a vector. For a given starting vector $u_0$ that has a non-zero component in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue (the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude), the sequence $u_k = A^k u_0 / \\|A^k u_0\\|_2$ converges to this eigenvector. For a positive-definite matrix $A$, the dominant eigenvalue is the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The core of the method is the recurrence relation $\\tilde{u}_{k+1} = A u_k$, followed by normalization $u_{k+1} = \\tilde{u}_{k+1} / \\|\\tilde{u}_{k+1}\\|_2$. After a sufficient number of iterations $t_{\\mathrm{up}}$, the vector $u_{t_{\\mathrm{up}}}$ is a good approximation of the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nThe second sequence for computing $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{low}}$ is the Inverse Power Iteration method. This is mathematically equivalent to applying the power method to the inverse matrix $A^{-1}$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $A$. Therefore, the largest eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue of $A$. The iteration step requires solving the linear system $A \\tilde{w}_{k+1} = w_k$ for $\\tilde{w}_{k+1}$, which is computationally more efficient than explicitly computing the inverse $A^{-1}$ and performing a matrix-vector multiplication. The subsequent normalization $w_{k+1} = \\tilde{w}_{k+1} / \\|\\tilde{w}_{k+1}\\|_2$ completes the iteration. After $t_{\\mathrm{low}}$ iterations, the vector $w_{t_{\\mathrm{low}}}$ converges to the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of $A$, $\\lambda_{\\min}$.\n\nFinally, the Rayleigh quotient, $R_A(v) = (v^\\top A v) / (v^\\top v)$, provides an estimate for an eigenvalue of $A$ given an approximate eigenvector $v$. For a normalized vector $v$ (i.e., $v^\\top v = \\|v\\|_2^2 = 1$), this simplifies to $R_A(v) = v^\\top A v$. The problem correctly defines $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{up}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{low}}$ as the Rayleigh quotients of the final iterated vectors $u_{t_{\\mathrm{up}}}$ and $w_{t_{\\mathrm{low}}}$, respectively. These will be highly accurate approximations of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and $\\lambda_{\\min}$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, define the parameters $n_x$, $n_y$, $L_x$, $L_y$, $t_{\\mathrm{up}}$, and $t_{\\mathrm{low}}$.\n$2$. Compute the grid spacings $h_x = L_x / (n_x+1)$ and $h_y = L_y / (n_y+1)$.\n$3$. Construct the one-dimensional operator matrices $T_x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_x \\times n_x}$ and $T_y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_y \\times n_y}$ as specified.\n$4$. Construct the full two-dimensional operator matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n_x n_y) \\times (n_x n_y)}$ using the Kronecker sum $A = I_y \\otimes T_x + T_y \\otimes I_x$.\n$5$. To compute $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{up}}$: initialize a unit vector $u_0$, and iterate $t_{\\mathrm{up}}$ times using the power method recursion $u_{k+1} \\propto A u_k$. Then compute the Rayleigh quotient $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{up}} = u_{t_{\\mathrm{up}}}^\\top A u_{t_{\\mathrm{up}}}$.\n$6$. To compute $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{low}}$: initialize a unit vector $w_0$, and iterate $t_{\\mathrm{low}}$ times by solving $A \\tilde{w}_{k+1} = w_k$ and normalizing $w_{k+1} = \\tilde{w}_{k+1} / \\|\\tilde{w}_{k+1}\\|_2$.

The Rayleigh quotient, defined for a nonzero vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ as $R(x) = \\frac{x^\\mathsf{T} A x}{x^\\mathsf{T} x}$, provides an estimate for an eigenvalue. If $x$ is an eigenvector, then $R(x)$ is the corresponding exact eigenvalue. For all algorithms, we start with an initial vector $x_0$ and generate a sequence of vectors $\\{x_k\\}$ that converges to an eigenvector, and a sequence of Rayleigh quotients $\\{\\lambda_k = R(x_k)\\}$ that converges to the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\n1.  **Power Iteration**\n\n    The power iteration method is the simplest algorithm for finding the dominant eigenpair of a matrix, i.e., the eigenpair $(\\lambda_1, v_1)$ where $|\\lambda_1|$ is the largest magnitude among all eigenvalues. The iterative step is defined as:\n    $$\n    x_{k+1} = \\frac{A x_k}{\\lVert A x_k \\rVert_2}\n    $$\n    Starting with an initial vector $x_0$ that has a non-zero component in the direction of the dominant eigenvector $v_1$, the sequence $x_k$ converges to $v_1$. The convergence is linear, with a rate determined by the ratio $|\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_1|$, where $\\lambda_2$ is the eigenvalue with the second-largest magnitude. If this ratio is close to $1$, convergence can be very slow. The eigenvalue is approximated at each step by the Rayleigh quotient, $\\lambda_k = R(x_k)$.\n\n2.  **Inverse Iteration with Fixed Shift**\n\n    Inverse iteration is a method to find the eigenpair corresponding to the eigenvalue closest to a given shift $\\sigma$. It applies the power method to the matrix $(A - \\sigma I)^{-1}$. The eigenvalues of $(A - \\sigma I)^{-1}$ are $(\\lambda_i - \\sigma)^{-1}$, where $\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. The dominant eigenvalue of $(A - \\sigma I)^{-1}$ corresponds to the smallest value of $|\\lambda_i - \\sigma|$, which means $\\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue of $A$ closest to $\\sigma$. The iterative step is:\n    $$\n    x_{k+1} = \\frac{(A - \\sigma I)^{-1} x_k}{\\lVert (A - \\sigma I)^{-1} x_k \\rVert_2}\n    $$\n    In practice, computing the matrix inverse is avoided. Instead, we solve the linear system $(A - \\sigma I) y_k = x_k$ for $y_k$, and then normalize:\n    $$\n    x_{k+1} = \\frac{y_k}{\\lVert y_k \\rVert_2}\n    $$\n    In this problem, a fixed shift $\\sigma_0 = R(x_0)$ is used throughout the process. Convergence is linear, but the rate is determined by the ratio of the two eigenvalues of $(A-\\sigma_0 I)^{-1}$ with largest magnitude. If $\\sigma_0$ is much closer to one eigenvalue $\\lambda_j$ than to any other, convergence to the eigenvector $v_j$ is very rapid.\n\n3.  **Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (RQI)**\n\n    Rayleigh quotient iteration is a powerful refinement of inverse iteration where the shift is updated at each step using the best current estimate for the eigenvalue: the Rayleigh quotient. The iterative process is defined by:\n    1.  Compute the shift: $\\sigma_k = R(x_k) = \\frac{x_k^\\mathsf{T} A x_k}{x_k^\\mathsf{T} x_k}$.\n    2.  Solve for $y_{k+1}$: $(A - \\sigma_k I) y_{k+1} = x_k$.\n    3.  Normalize: $x_{k+1} = \\frac{y_{k+1}}{\\lVert y_{k+1} \\rVert_2}$.\n\n    For a symmetric matrix, RQI exhibits cubic convergence once the iterate $x_k$ is sufficiently close to an eigenvector. This means that the number of correct digits in the approximation roughly triples with each iteration, leading to extremely fast convergence.\n\n**Stopping Criterion**\n\nFor all three methods, the iteration terminates when the norm of the residual vector, $\\lVert A x_k - \\lambda_k x_k \\rVert_2$, falls below a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon$, where $\\lambda_k = R(x_k)$. This residual measures how well the current approximate pair $( \\lambda_k, x_k )$ satisfies the eigenvalue equation. The iteration count $k$ at which this condition is first met is the desired output. If the condition is not met within a maximum number of iterations, that maximum number is recorded.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by defining three functions, one for each algorithm. Each function will iteratively generate the vector sequence and check the stopping criterion at each step, returning the iteration count. These functions will then be applied to the three specified test cases.",
