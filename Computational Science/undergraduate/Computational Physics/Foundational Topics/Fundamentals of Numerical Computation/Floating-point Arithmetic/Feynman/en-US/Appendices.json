            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the roots of a quadratic polynomial within a specified floating-point arithmetic system. Before proceeding to a solution, we must validate the problem statement.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The quadratic polynomial is $p(x) = x^2 - 10^8 x + 1$. From this, we identify the coefficients as $a=1$, $b=-10^8$, and $c=1$.\n2.  The arithmetic framework is a normalized base-$10$ floating-point system.\n3.  The precision is $t=8$ significant digits.\n4.  The rounding rule is round to nearest, with ties to even.\n5.  There is no overflow or underflow.\n6.  Each elementary arithmetic operation ($+$, $-$, $*$, $/$, $\\sqrt{\\cdot}$) is individually rounded.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a standard exercise in numerical analysis concerning loss of significance. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters defined. It is objective and its structure is sound. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by the standard quadratic formula:\n$$x_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nAll computations are performed in the specified floating-point system, which we denote by $\\text{fl}(\\cdot)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the discriminant, $D = b^2 - 4ac$.\nThe coefficients are $a = 1.0000000 \\times 10^0$, $b = -1.0000000 \\times 10^8$, and $c = 1.0000000 \\times 10^0$.\nThe term $b^2$ is $(-10^8)^2 = 10^{16}$. This is represented exactly as $1.0000000 \\times 10^{16}$.\nThe term $4ac$ is $4 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 4$. This is represented exactly as $4.0000000 \\times 10^0$.\n\nWe must now compute the subtraction $\\text{fl}(b^2 - 4ac) = \\text{fl}(10^{16} - 4)$. To perform this operation, the smaller number must be shifted to match the exponent of the larger number.\n$$10^{16} - 4 = (1.0000000 \\times 10^{16}) - (0.0000000000000004 \\times 10^{16})$$\nThe mantissa for $10^{16}$ is $1.0000000$. The system stores $t=8$ significant digits. The subtraction of $4$ affects digits far beyond the precision of the system. The subtraction of the mantissas is $1.0000000 - 0.0000000000000004$, which, when rounded back to $8$ significant digits, remains $1.0000000$. This is a classic example of absorption.\nThus, the computed discriminant is:\n$$\\hat{D} = \\text{fl}(b^2 - 4ac) = 1.0000000 \\times 10^{16}$$\nNext, we compute the square root of $\\hat{D}$.\n$$fl(\\sqrt{\\hat{D}}) = \\text{fl}(\\sqrt{1.0000000 \\times 10^{16}}) = 1.0000000 \\times 10^8$$\nThis is an exact computation. Let us denote this result $\\hat{S} = 1.0000000 \\times 10^8$.\n\nNow, we compute the two roots as specified in part (a).\nThe larger root, $\\hat{x}_1$, is computed using the '$+$' sign in the numerator, as $-b = 10^8$ is positive.\n$$\\hat{x}_1 = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{-b + \\hat{S}}{2a}\\right) = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{10^8 + 10^8}{2}\\right) = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{2}\\right) = 1.0000000 \\times 10^8$$\nThis computation is numerically stable, as it involves the addition of two positive numbers of similar magnitude.\n\nThe smaller root, $\\hat{x}_2$, is computed using the '$-$' sign.\n$$\\hat{x}_2 = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{-b - \\hat{S}}{2a}\\right) = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{10^8 - 10^8}{2}\\right) = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{0}{2}\\right) = 0$$\nThis computation suffers from catastrophic cancellation. The subtraction of two nearly identical numbers, $-b$ and $\\hat{S}$, results in a complete loss of significant digits. The computed root $\\hat{x}_2=0$ is grossly inaccurate. The true smaller root is approximately $10^{-8}$.\n\nFor part (b), we are instructed to use a numerically stabilized method. For a monic quadratic equation $x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + \\frac{c}{a} = 0$, Vieta's formulas state that the product of the roots is $x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$.\nIn our case, $a=1$ and $c=1$, so $x_1 x_2 = 1$.\n\nThe stable procedure is to first compute the larger-magnitude root $\\hat{x}_1$, which we have already found to be accurate:\n$$\\hat{x}_1 = 1.0000000 \\times 10^8$$\nThen, we use the product relation to find the smaller root, $\\hat{x}'_2$:\n$$\\hat{x}'_2 = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{c/a}{\\hat{x}_1}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\hat{x}'_2 = \\text{fl}\\left(\\frac{1}{1.0000000 \\times 10^8}\\right) = \\text{fl}(1.0000000 \\times 10^{-8})$$\nThe number $1.0000000 \\times 10^{-8}$ is exactly representable in the specified floating-point system. Therefore, the computation yields this value without any rounding error.\nThe stabilized smaller root is:\n$$\\hat{x}'_2 = 1.0000000 \\times 10^{-8}$$\nThis value is required as the final answer, expressed in scientific notation with eight significant figures.",

When dealing with floating-point numbers, however, a simple `==` check can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior. This practice uses an intuitive thermostat simulation to illustrate the dangers of direct equality comparison, which arise because many common decimal numbers do not have an exact binary representation. By building a simulation where a \"naive\" controller fails and a \"robust\" one succeeds, you will discover firsthand why tolerance-based comparisons are a crucial technique for writing reliable and accurate programs.

            "problem": "You will write a complete, runnable program that demonstrates, using a simple thermostat simulation, why the naive floating-point comparison pattern `if (a/b == c)` is dangerous. The scenario is a discrete-time thermostat controller that heats a system in steps toward a setpoint and decides when to switch the heater off by comparing the average of recent sensor readings to the setpoint. Your program must simulate two controllers: a naive one that uses exact equality `a/b == c` and a robust one that uses a tolerance to decide when the target is reached.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n\n1. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754 floating-point arithmetic represents real numbers in binary and rounds to a nearby representable number after each operation. Many decimal fractions such as $\\,0.1\\,$, $\\,0.2\\,$, and $\\,19.95\\,$ are not exactly representable in binary, so operations like addition and division yield rounding errors.\n2. A discrete-time controller samples at steps $\\,n = 0,1,2,\\dots\\,$ and computes averages over finite windows, which are of the form `a/b` where `a` is a running sum of floating-point readings and `b` is the window size (or the number of available samples up to the window size). This average is then compared to a target setpoint $c$.\n\nControl logic definitions:\n\n- Naive controller: Maintain a list of recent readings and compute the average $\\,\\bar{r} = a/b\\,$ of the last $\\,m\\,$ readings (or of all available readings if fewer than $\\,m\\,$ are available). The heater turns off at the first step $\\,n\\,$ where $\\bar{r}$ `==` $c$ in floating-point.\n- Robust controller: Turn off at the first step $\\,n\\,$ where $\\,\\bar{r} \\ge c - \\tau\\,$ for a small tolerance $\\,\\tau > 0\\,$. You must use $\\,\\tau = 10^{-12}\\,$.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each test case, simulates both controllers up to a maximum number of steps $\\,N_{\\text{max}}\\,$ and returns the number of steps each controller takes to turn the heater off. If a controller does not turn off within $\\,N_{\\text{max}}\\,$ steps, report $\\,{-1}\\,$ for that controller.\n\nAll temperatures are in degrees Celsius; however, the outputs are integers (step counts) and thus unitless. Angles are not involved. No percentages are involved.\n\nTest suite (each case specified as a tuple $\\,\\left(T_0, c, \\Delta, m, N_{\\text{max}}\\right)\\,$):\n\n1. Case A (happy path with exact binary fractions): $\\,\\left(19.0,\\, 20.0,\\, 0.5,\\, 1,\\, 20\\right)\\,$.\n2. Case B (inexact decimal average across three readings): $\\,\\left(20.0,\\, 20.1,\\, 0.1,\\, 3,\\, 20\\right)\\,$.\n3. Case C (target equals a simple average in decimal, likely not exactly representable in binary): $\\,\\left(19.8,\\, 19.95,\\, 0.05,\\, 2,\\, 20\\right)\\,$.\n4. Case D (triple average equals the target in exact decimal arithmetic, stressing rounding): $\\,\\left(17.2,\\, 17.3,\\, 0.1,\\, 3,\\, 20\\right)\\,$.\n5.

Initialize with the reading $\\,r_0 = T_0\\,$ and check both controllers at step $\\,n=0\\,$.\n2. At each step $\\,n \\to n+1\\,$ while the heater is on, update $\\,T_{n+1} = T_n + \\Delta\\,$, append $\\,r_{n+1} = T_{n+1}\\,$, and recompute the average $\\,\\bar{r}\\,$ over the last $\\,m\\,$ readings (or over all available readings if fewer than $\\,m\\,$ exist).

            "solution": "The problem requires an implementation of a discrete-time simulation for a thermostat to demonstrate the unreliability of direct equality comparison with floating-point numbers. This is a classic issue in computational science, rooted in the principles of digital number representation.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. Real numbers are stored in a binary format with a finite number of bits. Consequently, decimal fractions that do not have a finite binary representation, such as $0.1$ (which is $0.0001100110011...$ in binary), cannot be stored exactly. Each arithmetic operation may introduce a small rounding error. When these operations are chained, as in a summation for calculating an average, these errors can accumulate. As a result, a calculation that should yield an exact value in pure mathematics, for example $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x + (i-1)\\Delta) / 3 = x+\\Delta$, might produce a value in a computer that is infinitesimally different from the true mathematical result. This makes the direct comparison `a/b == c` fragile and likely to fail.\n\nThe simulation will model a system's temperature $T_n$ over discrete time steps $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The system starts at an initial temperature $T_0$. At each step, a heater adds a constant increment $\\Delta$, so the temperature evolves according to the rule $T_{n+1} = T_n + \\Delta$. The sensor reading at step $n$ is simply $r_n = T_n$.\n\nTwo controller strategies are simulated to decide when to turn off the heater:\n\n1.  **Naive Controller**: This controller calculates the average of the most recent readings. Let $S_n = \\{r_i | \\max(0, n-m+1) \\le i \\le n\\}$ be the set of readings in the averaging window of size $m$ at step $n$. The window size is $\\min(n+1, m)$. The average is $\\bar{r}_n = \\frac{1}{|S_n|} \\sum_{r \\in S_n} r$. The controller's logic is to turn off the heater at the first step $n$ where the condition $\\bar{r}_n$ `==` $c$ is met, with $c$ being the target setpoint. This is a direct floating-point comparison.\n\n2.  **Robust Controller**: This controller uses the same average calculation $\\bar{r}_n$. However, its deactivation condition is $\\bar{r}_n \\ge c - \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a small, positive tolerance, given as $\\tau = 10^{-12}$. This approach acknowledges that the computed average may not be exactly equal to the setpoint due to discretization and rounding. It turns off the heater once the average is \"close enough\" to, or has slightly surpassed, the setpoint.\n\nThe simulation algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(T_0, c, \\Delta, m, N_{\\max})$:\n\n1.  Initialize the temperature $T_{\\text{current}} = T_0$ and a list of readings with the first value $r_0 = T_0$.\n2.  Initialize stop steps for both controllers to $-1$.\n3.  **Step $n=0$**: Check the conditions for both controllers using the initial average $\\bar{r}_0 = r_0$. If a condition is met, record the stop step as $0$.\n4.  **Steps $n=1, \\dots, N_{\\max}$**:\n    a. Update the temperature: $T_{\\text{current}} \\leftarrow T_{\\text{current}} + \\Delta$.\n    b. Append the new reading, $r_n = T_{\\text{current}}$, to the list of readings.\n    c. Compute the average $\\bar{r}_n$ over the last $\\min(n+1, m)$ readings.\n    d. For each controller that has not yet stopped, check its condition. If the condition is met, record the current step $n$ as its stop step.\n5.  If any controller's stop step remains $-1$ after iterating up to $N_{\\max}$, it means the condition was never met.\n\nLet us analyze an example, Case D: $(T_0, c, \\Delta, m) = (17.2, 17.3, 0.1, 3)$.\nIn ideal arithmetic:\n-   At $n=0$, $T_0 = 17.2$. Average is $17.2$.\n-   At $n=1$, $T_1 = 17.2 + 0.1 = 17.3$. Average of $\\{17.2, 17.3\\}$ is $17.25$.\n-   At $n=2$, $T_2 = 17.3 + 0.1 = 17.4$. Average of $\\{17.2, 17.3, 17.4\\}$ is $\\frac{17.2+17.3+17.4}{3} = \\frac{51.9}{3} = 17.3$.\nSo, mathematically, the average equals the setpoint $c=17.3$ at step $n=2$.\n\nHowever, in floating-point arithmetic, the value $0.1$ is not exactly representable. The repeated addition of this inexact value leads to an accumulated error. The temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ and their subsequent sum will not be the exact mathematical values. The computed average $\\bar{r}_2$ will be a value extremely close to, but not identical to, $17.3$. A typical floating-point result might be $17.300000000000004$.\n\n-   **Naive Controller**: The check $\\bar{r}_2$ `==` `17.3` will evaluate to false. As the temperature continues to rise, the average will further deviate from $17.3$, so the naive controller will never turn off.\n-   **Robust Controller**: The check $\\bar{r}_2 \\ge 17.3 - 10^{-12}$ will evaluate to true, since $17.300000000000004 \\ge 17.299999999999$. The robust controller correctly turns off at step $n=2$.\n\nThis discrepancy illustrates why tolerance-based comparisons are essential for reliable control systems and other applications involving floating-point numbers.",

Your program must not read any input and must print a single line of output as specified below.\n\nThe fundamental base to be used is the standard rounding-error model for floating-point arithmetic with rounding to nearest: for any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, the computed floating-point addition satisfies $\\text{fl}(a+b) = (a+b)(1+\\delta)$ with $|\\delta|\\le u$, where $u$ is the unit roundoff of the chosen format.

Aggregate the four records into one list and print it as a single line with comma-separated elements enclosed in square brackets, for example\n  $[\\, [\\,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot\\,], [\\,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot\\,], [\\,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot\\,], [\\,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot\\,] \\,]$.\n\nNotes:\n- No physical units are involved.\n- Angles are not used.\n- Percentages are not used; all quantities are real numbers in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The implementation must be self-contained and runnable without user input. Use exact rational arithmetic or a multiple-precision facility available in your language’s standard library to compute $s_{\\star}$ so that the comparisons of $e_{\\text{naive}}$ and $e_{\\text{kahan}}$ are meaningful.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of numerical analysis, specifically floating-point arithmetic. It is well-posed, providing a clear definition of the algorithms to be implemented, a complete set of test data, and an unambiguous output format. The problem is objective and free of contradictions or missing information. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental issue addressed is that computer floating-point addition is not associative and is subject to rounding error. For two real numbers $a$ and $b$, their floating-point sum is modeled as $\\text{fl}(a+b) = (a+b)(1+\\delta)$, where the relative error $\\lvert\\delta\\rvert$ is bounded by the unit roundoff $u$. When summing a sequence of numbers, these small errors can accumulate. This analysis will contrast a naive summation approach with a compensated method designed to mitigate this error accumulation.\n\n**1. Naive Summation**\n\nThe most direct method is to iterate through the list of numbers $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and accumulate the sum in a single floating-point variable $s$. The update rule is $s \\leftarrow \\text{fl}(s + x_i)$. The primary weakness of this method is **swamping**. If the magnitude of the running sum $s$ is much larger than the term $x_i$ being added, the contribution of $x_i$ may be partially or completely lost in the rounding process. For instance, in standard double-precision arithmetic, if $s \\approx 10^{16}$ and $x_i = 1$, the operation $\\text{fl}(10^{16} + 1)$ evaluates to $10^{16}$, as the precision is insufficient to represent the result exactly. The term $x_i$ is effectively discarded.\n\n**2. Kahan Compensated Summation**\n\nThe Kahan summation algorithm is a technique that significantly reduces the accumulation of roundoff error. It maintains a second variable, a compensation $c$, which accumulates the errors that occur at each step. For each term $x_i$ in the input sequence, the algorithm performs the following operations:\n1.  Correct the current term: $y \\leftarrow x_i - c$. This step subtracts the accumulated error from the previous additions from the current term.\n2.  Add to the sum: $t \\leftarrow s + y$. This is the standard floating-point addition, where low-order bits of $y$ might be lost if $s$ is large.\n3.  Recover the error: $c \\leftarrow (t - s) - y$. This is the critical step. The term $(t - s)$ represents the part of $y$ that was successfully added to $s$. By subtracting the original (corrected) term $y$, we isolate the negative of the roundoff error from the addition $s+y$. This error is stored in $c$.\n4.  Update the sum: $s \\leftarrow t$.\n\nThis iterative process carries forward the lost \"change\" from each addition and incorporates it into the next, ensuring that the final accumulated error is dramatically smaller than in the naive case. The error bound for Kahan summation is of the order $O(u + N\\epsilon u)$, where $\\epsilon$ is related to machine precision, a vast improvement over the worst-case $O(Nu)$ error for naive summation.\n\n**3. Exact Rational Arithmetic**\n\nTo establish an authoritative ground truth, designated $s_{\\star}$, we must compute the sum without any floating-point error. This is achieved by using exact rational arithmetic. Each input number, which is given as a floating-point value, is first converted to its exact rational representation, i.e., a fraction $p/q$ where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. All subsequent additions are performed using the exact rules of fraction arithmetic, e.g., $\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}$. This procedure is free from the representational and computational errors of floating-point systems, yielding the true mathematical sum of the input values.\n\n**Evaluation Procedure**\n\nFor each of the four specified test cases, we compute the naive sum $s_{\\text{naive}}$, the Kahan sum $s_{\\text{kahan}}$, and the exact reference sum $s_{\\star}$. The test cases are specifically designed to expose the failure modes of naive summation, particularly swamping and catastrophic cancellation, by mixing numbers of vastly different magnitudes. We then compute the absolute errors $e_{\\text{naive}} = \\lvert s_{\\text{naive}} - s_{\\star} \\rvert$ and $e_{\\text{kahan}} = \\lvert s_{\\text{kahan}} - s_{\\star} \\rvert$. The boolean flag $\\text{better}$ is set to $\\text{True}$ if and only if $e_{\\text{kahan}}  e_{\\text{naive}}$, quantitatively demonstrating the superior accuracy of the Kahan algorithm for the given input. The final output is structured as a list of records, with each record containing $[s_{\\text{naive}}, s_{\\text{kahan}}, s_{\\star}, \\text{better}]$.",
