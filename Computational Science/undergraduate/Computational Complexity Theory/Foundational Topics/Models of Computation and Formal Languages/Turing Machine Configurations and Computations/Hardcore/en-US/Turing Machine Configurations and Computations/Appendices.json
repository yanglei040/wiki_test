            "problem": "A single-tape Turing Machine (TM) is formally defined by its set of states, tape alphabet, and transition function. Consider a TM with the set of states $Q = \\{q_0, q_1, q_{halt}\\}$, where $q_0$ is the initial state and $q_{halt}$ is the halting state. The tape alphabet is $\\Gamma = \\{0, 1, \\sqcup\\}$, where $\\sqcup$ is the blank symbol that initially occupies the entire infinite tape except for a finite input segment.\n\nThe TM's behavior is governed by the transition function $\\delta$, defined as follows:\n$\\delta(q, a) = (q', b, D)$, which instructs the machine, when in state $q$ and reading symbol $a$ under the tape head, to transition to state $q'$, write symbol $b$ on the tape at the current position, and move the tape head in direction $D \\in \\{L, R, S\\}$ (Left, Right, or Stationary).\n\nThe transition rules for this particular TM are:\n1. $\\delta(q_0, 1) = (q_1, 0, R)$\n2. $\\delta(q_1, 1) = (q_1, 1, R)$\n3. $\\delta(q_1, 0) = (q_0, 1, L)$\n4. $\\delta(q_0, 0) = (q_{halt}, 0, S)$\n\nInitially, the machine is in state $q_0$ with the tape containing the finite string `110`.
