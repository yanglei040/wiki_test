            "problem": "In the theory of computation, a language is a set of strings over a given alphabet. Consider the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$. We can interpret any non-empty binary string $w = b_k b_{k-1} \\dots b_1 b_0$ (where each $b_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) as a positive integer $N(w)$ using the standard base-2 representation:\n$$N(w) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} b_i \\cdot 2^i$$\nFor example, the string \"101\" represents the number $1\\cdot2^2 + 0\\cdot2^1 + 1\\cdot2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5$.\n\nLet $L$ be the language consisting of all non-empty binary strings $w$ such that the integer $N(w)$ they represent satisfies the condition $N(w) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. For instance, the string \"10\" is in $L$ because it represents the number 2, and $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The string \"101\" is also in $L$ because it represents the number 5, and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The string \"11\" is not in $L$ because it represents 3, and $3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. The empty string is not in $L$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of states required for a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts the language $L$?",
            "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of states in the minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for the language $L$. The language $L$ consists of binary strings $w$ representing a number $N(w)$ such that $N(w) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nA DFA processes a string from left to right. To determine if a string is in $L$, the DFA must effectively calculate the value of the number represented by the string modulo 3. The states of our DFA can represent the running value of the number modulo 3. Since there are three possible remainders when dividing by 3 (0, 1, and 2), we can design a DFA with three states, let's call them $q_0, q_1, q_2$. State $q_i$ will correspond to the set of strings processed so far that represent a number congruent to $i \\pmod{3}$.\n\nLet's define the components of the DFA:\nStates $Q = \\{q_0, q_1, q_2\\}$.\nAlphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$.\nStart-State: The process begins before any characters are read. This corresponds to the empty string, which we can consider as representing the number 0. Since $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, the start state must be $q_0$.\n\nTransition Function $\\delta$: Let's analyze how the value of the number (modulo 3) changes as we append a bit. Suppose we have already processed a string $w$ which represents the number $N(w)$, and the DFA is in state $q_i$, meaning $N(w) \\equiv i \\pmod{3}$.\nIf we read a '0', the new string is $w0$. Its value is $N(w0) = 2 \\cdot N(w) + 0$. Modulo 3, this is $N(w0) \\equiv 2 \\cdot N(w) \\pmod{3}$. If $N(w) \\equiv i \\pmod{3}$, then $N(w0) \\equiv 2i \\pmod{3}$.\nIf we read a '1', the new string is $w1$. Its value is $N(w1) = 2 \\cdot N(w) + 1$. Modulo 3, this is $N(w1) \\equiv 2 \\cdot N(w) + 1 \\pmod{3}$. If $N(w) \\equiv i \\pmod{3}$, then $N(w1) \\equiv 2i + 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nUsing these rules, we can define the transitions:\n- State $q_0$ ($i=0$):\n  - On input '0': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 0) \\pmod{3}} = q_0$. So, $\\delta(q_0, 0) = q_0$.\n  - On input '1': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) \\pmod{3}} = q_1$. So, $\\delta(q_0, 1) = q_1$.\n- State $q_1$ ($i=1$):\n  - On input '0': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 1) \\pmod{3}} = q_2$. So, $\\delta(q_1, 0) = q_2$.\n  - On input '1': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) \\pmod{3}} = q_0$. So, $\\delta(q_1, 1) = q_0$.\n- State $q_2$ ($i=2$):\n  - On input '0': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 2) \\pmod{3}} = q_{4 \\pmod{3}} = q_1$. So, $\\delta(q_2, 0) = q_1$.\n  - On input '1': the new state is $q_{(2 \\cdot 2 + 1) \\pmod{3}} = q_{5 \\pmod{3}} = q_2$. So, $\\delta(q_2, 1) = q_2$.\n\nAccepting States $F$: The language $L$ accepts strings $w$ where $N(w) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. Therefore, the only accepting state is $q_2$. So, $F = \\{q_2\\}$.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the empty string is not in $L$. Our start state is $q_0$, which is not an accepting state. Thus, the empty string is rejected, which is correct.\n\nWe have constructed a 3-state DFA. Now we must confirm that it is minimal. A DFA is minimal if all its states are reachable from the start state and all pairs of states are distinguishable.\n\n1.  Reachability:\n    - $q_0$ is the start state, so it's reachable.\n    - $q_1$ is reachable from $q_0$ on input \"1\".\n    - $q_2$ is reachable from $q_0$ on input \"10\" ($\\delta(q_0, 1) = q_1$, $\\delta(q_1, 0) = q_2$).\n    All three states are reachable.\n\n2.  Distinguishability: Two states are distinguishable if there is a string that leads one to an accepting state and the other to a non-accepting state.\n    - $q_0$ and $q_2$: $q_2$ is an accepting state while $q_0$ is not. They are distinguishable by the empty string.\n    - $q_1$ and $q_2$: $q_2$ is an accepting state while $q_1$ is not. They are distinguishable by the empty string.\n    - $q_0$ and $q_1$: From $q_0$, the input \"0\" leads to $q_0$ (non-accepting). From $q_1$, the input \"0\" leads to $q_2$ (accepting). Thus, $q_0$ and $q_1$ are distinguishable.\n\nSince all three states are reachable and pairwise distinguishable, the DFA we constructed is minimal. The minimal number of states required is 3.\nThis result is also predicted by the Myhill-Nerode theorem, which states that the number of states in a minimal DFA for a language is equal to the number of equivalence classes of the Nerode relation. For this language, the equivalence classes correspond to the three possible remainders modulo 3.",
