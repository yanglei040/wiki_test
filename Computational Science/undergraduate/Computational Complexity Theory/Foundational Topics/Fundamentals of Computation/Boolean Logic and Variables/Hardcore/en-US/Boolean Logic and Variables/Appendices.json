            "introduction": "Understanding Boolean logic often begins with representing problems as formulas. This first practice challenges you to think like a designer, using the building blocks of 3-Conjunctive Normal Form (3-CNF) to engineer a formula with a precise outcome. By determining the minimum number of clauses needed to force a unique solution, you will gain a deeper intuition for how logical constraints work together to narrow down possibilities, a core concept in the study of satisfiability problems .",

            "problem": "A computer scientist is designing a logic circuit whose behavior is modeled by a Boolean formula in 3-Conjunctive Normal Form (3-CNF) over four variables: $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$. A formula is in 3-CNF if it is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of exactly three literals (a variable or its negation). The final formula, denoted by $\\Phi$, must have exactly one satisfying truth assignment.\n\nThe formula $\\Phi$ is constructed by conjoining two sub-formulas: $\\Phi = \\Phi_{equiv} \\land \\Psi$.\n\nThe first sub-formula, $\\Phi_{equiv}$, is designed to establish logical equivalences among a subset of the variables. Specifically, it enforces $x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2$ and $x_2 \\leftrightarrow x_3$. This is achieved by converting the 2-CNF representation of equivalence into 3-CNF. The method for converting a 2-literal clause $(l_1 \\lor l_2)$ to a set of 3-literal clauses using an auxiliary variable $x_k$ is to replace it with the pair of clauses $(l_1 \\lor l_2 \\lor x_k) \\land (l_1 \\lor l_2 \\lor \\neg x_k)$.\nIn this specific construction:\n- To enforce $x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2$, which is equivalent to $(\\neg x_1 \\lor x_2) \\land (x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2)$, the variable $x_4$ is used as the auxiliary variable for both 2-literal clauses.\n- To enforce $x_2 \\leftrightarrow x_3$, which is equivalent to $(\\neg x_2 \\lor x_3) \\land (x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3)$, the variable $x_1$ is used as the auxiliary variable for both 2-literal clauses.\n\nThe second sub-formula, $\\Psi$, consists of an additional set of 3-CNF clauses that must also be satisfied.\n\nAfter combining both parts, the complete formula $\\Phi$ is known to be satisfied by exactly one assignment of truth values to the four variables, which is $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (\\text{false, false, false, true})$.\n\nGiven this design, what is the minimum number of clauses that the sub-formula $\\Psi$ must contain?",
            "solution": "By construction, each 2-literal clause is converted to two 3-literal clauses with an auxiliary variable via the identity\n$$(A \\lor z) \\land (A \\lor \\neg z) \\equiv A.$$\nThis follows from distributivity: $(A \\lor z) \\land (A \\lor \\neg z) \\equiv A \\lor (z \\land \\neg z) \\equiv A \\lor \\bot \\equiv A$. Therefore $\\Phi_{equiv}$ is logically equivalent to the 2-CNF\n$$(\\neg x_{1} \\lor x_{2}) \\land (x_{1} \\lor \\neg x_{2}) \\land (\\neg x_{2} \\lor x_{3}) \\land (x_{2} \\lor \\neg x_{3}),$$\nwhich enforces $x_{1} \\leftrightarrow x_{2}$ and $x_{2} \\leftrightarrow x_{3}$, i.e., $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}$. The variable $x_{4}$ is unconstrained by $\\Phi_{equiv}$. Hence the satisfying assignments of $\\Phi_{equiv}$ are exactly\n$$(0,0,0,0),\\quad (0,0,0,1),\\quad (1,1,1,0),\\quad (1,1,1,1),$$\nwhere we write $0$ for false and $1$ for true. The target unique model for $\\Phi=\\Phi_{equiv}\\land\\Psi$ is $(0,0,0,1)$, so $\\Psi$ must eliminate the other three assignments while remaining true on $(0,0,0,1)$.\n\nA single 3-literal clause $C=(\\ell_{1}\\lor \\ell_{2}\\lor \\ell_{3})$ is false on an assignment precisely when all three literals are false. Consider whether one clause can rule out all three undesired assignments:\n- No clause can be false simultaneously on $(0,0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1,1)$, because for each variable $x_{i}$, exactly one of $x_{i}$ or $\\neg x_{i}$ is false at $(0,0,0,0)$ and the other is false at $(1,1,1,1)$, so there is no literal that is false in both assignments.\n- No clause can be false simultaneously on $(0,0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1,0)$ for the same reason on $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}$; the only common false literal is $x_{4}$, which is insufficient since a 3-clause needs three literals all false.\n- A clause can be false simultaneously on $(1,1,1,0)$ and $(1,1,1,1)$ by choosing literals $\\neg x_{1},\\neg x_{2},\\neg x_{3}$, which are all false when $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=1$ regardless of $x_{4}$.\n\nTherefore any single 3-literal clause can eliminate at most two of the three undesired assignments, so $|\\Psi|\\geq 2$.\n\nIt remains to show that two clauses suffice. Take\n$$C_{1}=(\\neg x_{1}\\lor \\neg x_{2}\\lor \\neg x_{3}),\\qquad C_{2}=(x_{4}\\lor x_{1}\\lor x_{2}).$$\nThen:\n- At $(0,0,0,1)$, $C_{1}$ is true (since $\\neg x_{1}$ is true) and $C_{2}$ is true (since $x_{4}$ is true).\n- At $(0,0,0,0)$, $C_{1}$ is true but $C_{2}$ is false (all three literals are false), so it is eliminated.\n- At $(1,1,1,0)$ and $(1,1,1,1)$, $C_{1}$ is false (all three literals are false), so both are eliminated.\n\nThus $\\Psi=\\{C_{1},C_{2}\\}$ eliminates exactly the three non-target assignments while keeping the target, and together with $\\Phi_{equiv}$ yields a unique satisfying assignment. Hence the minimum number of clauses in $\\Psi$ is $2$.",
