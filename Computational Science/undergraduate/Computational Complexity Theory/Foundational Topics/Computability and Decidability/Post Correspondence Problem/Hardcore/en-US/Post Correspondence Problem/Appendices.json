            "introduction": "Getting started with the Post Correspondence Problem often feels like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, we can use logical constraints to narrow our search significantly. This first exercise  demonstrates a powerful and fundamental technique: checking the prefix property. By observing which strings can be prefixes of others, you can eliminate invalid starting dominoes and guide your path toward a solution much more efficiently than by brute force.",

            "problem": "The Post's Correspondence Problem (PCP) is a classic undecidable decision problem in theoretical computer science. An instance of the PCP consists of a finite set of \"dominoes,\" where each domino has a \"top\" string and a \"bottom\" string over some alphabet $\\Sigma$. A solution to a PCP instance is a non-empty sequence of domino indices $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ (where repetition is allowed) such that the concatenation of the top strings equals the concatenation of the bottom strings. That is, if domino $j$ is the pair $(t_j, b_j)$, a solution is a sequence of indices $[i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k]$ with $k \\ge 1$ such that $t_{i_1}t_{i_2}\\ldots t_{i_k} = b_{i_1}b_{i_2}\\ldots b_{i_k}$. The integer $k$ is called the length of the solution.\n\nConsider the following PCP instance $P$ over the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$. The dominoes are given as pairs of (top string, bottom string):\n- Domino 1: $(01, 1)$\n- Domino 2: $(0, 00)$\n\nWhich of the following statements is true for this PCP instance $P$?\n\nA. The shortest solution has length 2.\n\nB. The shortest solution has length 3.\n\nC. The shortest solution has length 4.\n\nD.

            "solution": "We are given the PCP instance with dominoes:\n1: top $t_{1}=\\text{``01''}$, bottom $b_{1}=\\text{``1''}$,\n2: top $t_{2}=\\text{``0''}$, bottom $b_{2}=\\text{``00''}$.\n\nA necessary condition for any partial sequence of dominoes to be extendable to a solution is the prefix property: after placing any initial subsequence, the two concatenated strings must agree up to the length of the shorter one, i.e., one must be a prefix of the other. In particular, the very first domino in any solution must have its top and bottom in a prefix relation.\n\nCheck each domino as a possible first tile:\n- Domino 1: $t_{1}=\\text{``01''}$ and $b_{1}=\\text{``1''}$ are not in a prefix relation because the first symbols differ. Hence domino 1 cannot start any valid sequence.\n- Domino 2: $t_{2}=\\text{``0''}$ is a prefix of $b_{2}=\\text{``00''}$. Thus any solution must start with domino 2.\n\nAfter placing domino 2 first, the bottom string is ahead of the top by the overhang $\\text{``0''}$. To continue, we must use a domino whose top begins with this overhang, and then cancel accordingly.\n\nConsider the two choices for the second tile:\n- Second tile 1: Here $s=\\text{``0''}$, $t_{1}=\\text{``01''}$, $b_{1}=\\text{``1''}$. Since $t_{1}=s\\,r$ with $r=\\text{``1''}$, we cancel $s$ against the beginning of $t_{1}$, then compare $r$ with $b_{1}$. Because $r=b_{1}=\\text{``1''}$, the new overhang becomes empty, yielding equality after two tiles. Explicitly,\n$$\nt_{2}t_{1}=\\text{``0''}\\,\\text{``01''}=\\text{``001''},\\qquad\nb_{2}b_{1}=\\text{``00''}\\,\\text{``1''}=\\text{``001''}.\n$$\nThus $[2,1]$ is a solution of length $2$.\n\n- Second tile 2: Here $s=\\text{``0''}$, $t_{2}=\\text{``0''}$, $b_{2}=\\text{``00''}$. Since $s=t_{2}$, cancellation leaves a new bottom overhang $s' b_{2}=\\text{``00''}$, so equality is not yet achieved in two steps.\n\nFinally, no solution of length $1$ exists because $t_{1}\\ne b_{1}$ and $t_{2}\\ne b_{2}$. Therefore the shortest solution length is $2$, realized by the sequence $[2,1]$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks us to identify a Post's Correspondence Problem (PCP) instance that has a solution, but for which the corresponding Modified Post's Correspondence Problem (MPCP) does not have a solution. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: $P_A = \\{ (1: 0, 01), (2: 10, 0) \\}$**\n\nFirst, let's check for an MPCP solution. An MPCP solution must start with domino 1.\n- Initial sequence: `1`\n- Top string: $t_1 = 0$\n- Bottom string: $b_1 = 01$\nThe top string is a prefix of the bottom string. The bottom string has a remainder of '1'. To find a match, the next top string we add must start with '1'. Domino 2 has $t_2 = 10$. Let's try appending domino 2.\n- Sequence: `1, 2`\n- Top string: $t_1t_2 = 010$\n- Bottom string: $b_1b_2 = 010$\nThe strings match. Thus, the sequence `1, 2` is a solution to the MPCP for this instance. Since any MPCP solution is also a PCP solution, this instance has a solution for both PCP and MPCP. This option does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: $P_B = \\{ (1: 1, 101), (2: 10, 1), (3: 0, 00) \\}$**\n\nFirst, let's check for a general PCP solution. We can start with any domino. Let's try starting with domino 2.\n- Initial sequence: `2`\n- Top string: $t_2 = 10$\n- Bottom string: $b_2 = 1$\nThe bottom string is a prefix of the top string. The top string has a remainder of '0'. To find a match, the next bottom string we add must start with '0'. Domino 3 has $b_3 = 00$. Let's try appending domino 3.\n- Sequence: `2, 3`\n- Top string: $t_2t_3 = 100$\n- Bottom string: $b_2b_3 = 100$\nThe strings match. The sequence `2, 3` is a solution to the PCP. So, this instance has a PCP solution.\n\nNow, let's check for an MPCP solution. The sequence must start with domino 1.\n- Initial sequence: `1`\n- Top string: $t_1 = 1$\n- Bottom string: $b_1 = 101$\nThe top string is a prefix of the bottom string, with a remainder of `01`. The next domino must have a top string starting with `0`. Only domino 3 ($t_3=0$) qualifies.\n- Sequence: `1, 3`\n- Top string: $t_1t_3 = 10$\n- Bottom string: $b_1b_3 = 10100$\nThe top string is a prefix of the bottom string, with a remainder of `100`. The next domino must have a top string starting with `1`. We can choose domino 1 ($t_1=1$) or domino 2 ($t_2=10$).\n- Path 1 (append domino 2): The remainder is `100`, and $t_2=10$ is a prefix of it.\n  - Sequence: `1, 3, 2`\n  - Top string: $t_1t_3t_2 = 1010$\n  - Bottom string: $b_1b_3b_2 = 101001$\n  The top string is a prefix of the bottom string, with a remainder of `01`. This is the same remainder state we had after the first step. This leads to a non-terminating loop of states: a remainder of `01` forces us to pick domino 3, leading to remainder `100`, which allows us to pick domino 2, leading back to remainder `01`. A solution is never reached.\n- Path 2 (append domino 1): The remainder is `100`, and $t_1=1$ is a prefix of it.\n  - Sequence `1, 3, 1`\n  - Top string: $t_1t_3t_1 = 101$\n  - Bottom string: $b_1b_3b_1 = 10100101$\n  The top string is a prefix of the bottom, with remainder `00101`. The length difference $|B|-|T|$ is increasing: it was 2, then 3, and now 5. This path will also not terminate in a solution.\n\nSince there is no sequence starting with domino 1 that yields a solution, there is no solution to the MPCP. Therefore, this instance has a PCP solution but no MPCP solution. This option satisfies the condition.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: $P_C = \\{ (1: 01, 1), (2: 10, 0) \\}$**\n\nLet's compare the lengths of the top and bottom strings for each domino.\n- For domino 1: $|t_1| = |01| = 2$, $|b_1| = |1| = 1$. The top string is longer.\n- For domino 2: $|t_2| = |10| = 2$, $|b_2| = |0| = 1$. The top string is longer.\nFor any sequence of dominoes $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_m$, the length of the concatenated top string will be $\\sum_{j=1}^m |t_{i_j}|$, and the length of the bottom string will be $\\sum_{j=1}^m |b_{i_j}|$. Since $|t_i| > |b_i|$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, the total length of the top string will always be strictly greater than the total length of the bottom string. Therefore, a match is impossible. This instance has no PCP solution (and thus no MPCP solution). This option does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: $P_D = \\{ (1: 10, 1), (2: 0, 10) \\}$**\n\nLet's check for a PCP solution. Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the number of times domino 1 and domino 2 are used in a potential solution sequence. For the total lengths of the top and bottom strings to be equal, we need the sum of length differences to be zero.\n- Domino 1 length difference: $|t_1| - |b_1| = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n- Domino 2 length difference: $|t_2| - |b_2| = 1 - 2 = -1$.\nA solution must have $n_1 \\cdot (1) + n_2 \\cdot (-1) = 0$, which implies $n_1 = n_2$. Any solution must use an equal number of domino 1's and domino 2's.\nLet's test the simplest case: $n_1 = 1, n_2 = 1$. The possible sequences are `1, 2` and `2, 1`.\n- Sequence `1, 2`: Top is $t_1t_2 = 100$, Bottom is $b_1b_2 = 110$. No match.\n- Sequence `2, 1`: Top is $t_2t_1 = 010$, Bottom is $b_2b_1 = 101$. No match.\nTesting further combinations (e.g., $n_1=n_2=2$) also fails to produce a match. This instance appears to have no PCP solution. Therefore, it does not satisfy the condition.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option B has a PCP solution but lacks an MPCP solution.",
