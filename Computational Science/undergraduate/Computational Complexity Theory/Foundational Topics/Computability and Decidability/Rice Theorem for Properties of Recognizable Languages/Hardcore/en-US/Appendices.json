This exercise  presents a quintessential semantic property: one that depends entirely on the characteristics of the strings within the language accepted by a Turing machine.

            "problem": "In the field of theoretical computer science, a Turing machine (TM) is a mathematical model of computation. The set of all input strings that a given Turing machine $M$ accepts is called the language of $M$, denoted as $L(M)$. A language $L$ is said to be decidable if there exists a Turing machine that halts on every input string and accepts strings in $L$ while rejecting strings not in $L$. A problem is called decidable if the language corresponding to its \"yes\" instances is decidable.\n\nConsider the following problem: Given the description of an arbitrary Turing machine $\\langle M \\rangle$, determine whether its language $L(M)$ has the property that every string $w \\in L(M)$ has an even length. In other words, we want to know if $|w|$ is even for all $w \\in L(M)$. Let's call this property $P_{\\text{even}}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the decidability of this problem?\n\nA. The problem is decidable, and a general algorithm can be constructed to solve it for any given Turing machine.\n\nB. The problem is undecidable, meaning no general algorithm can exist to solve it for all possible Turing machines.\n\nC. The problem is decidable only for the subset of Turing machines that are guaranteed to halt on all inputs (i.e., deciders).\n\nD. The problem is decidable, but any algorithm that solves it is known to require a time complexity that is at least exponential in the size of the description of the Turing machine.",
            "solution": "We formalize the property as follows. Let $E = \\{ w \\mid |w| \\text{ is even} \\}$. The property in question is\n$$\nP_{\\text{even}}(M) \\iff L(M) \\subseteq E.\n$$\nThis property is semantic: it depends only on the language $L(M)$ recognized by $M$, not on the particular description of $M$.\n\nWe first show $P_{\\text{even}}$ is nontrivial. There exists a Turing machine $M_{\\emptyset}$ with $L(M_{\\emptyset}) = \\emptyset$, hence $L(M_{\\emptyset}) \\subseteq E$ and $P_{\\text{even}}(M_{\\emptyset})$ holds. There also exists a Turing machine $M_{1}$ with $L(M_{1}) = \\{1\\}$, so $L(M_{1}) \\nsubseteq E$ and $P_{\\text{even}}(M_{1})$ fails. Therefore $P_{\\text{even}}$ is neither true for all languages nor false for all languages; it is nontrivial.\n\nBy Rice's theorem, any nontrivial semantic property of the language recognized by a Turing machine is undecidable. Since $P_{\\text{even}}$ is such a property, the problem of deciding, given $\\langle M \\rangle$, whether $L(M) \\subseteq E$ is undecidable. This rules out options A and D and establishes option B.\n\nTo address option C, we consider the restriction to inputs that are guaranteed to be deciders (halt on every input). We show that $P_{\\text{even}}$ remains undecidable even under this promise by reducing the halting problem to it. Given an arbitrary Turing machine $N$ and input $y$, construct a total Turing machine $D_{N,y}$ defined on input $w$ by:\n- If $|w|$ is even, reject.\n- If $|w|$ is odd, simulate $N$ on $y$ for exactly $|w|$ steps; accept if $N$ halts within those $|w|$ steps, otherwise reject.\n\nThis $D_{N,y}$ halts on all inputs by construction (bounded simulation), so it is a decider. Moreover,\n$$\nN \\text{ halts on } y \\iff \\exists w \\text{ with } |w| \\text{ odd and } w \\in L(D_{N,y}) \\iff L(D_{N,y}) \\nsubseteq E.\n$$\nEquivalently,\n$$\n\\neg\\big(P_{\\text{even}}(D_{N,y})\\big) \\iff N \\text{ halts on } y.\n$$\nThus, if we could decide $P_{\\text{even}}$ for deciders, we could decide the halting problem, a contradiction. Therefore option C is false.\n\nConsequently, the correct statement is that the problem is undecidable, which is option B.",

It's crucial to learn to distinguish questions about a Turing machine's language from other types of questions.

            "problem": "A central theme in computability theory is distinguishing between questions about algorithms that can be answered algorithmically (decidable problems) and those that cannot (undecidable problems). Consider a standard model of a Turing Machine (TM) with a single tape, operating over a binary input alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$. The language recognized by a TM $M$, denoted $L(M)$, is the set of all strings on which $M$ halts and accepts. Such a language is called a recursively enumerable language.\n\nA property $P$ of recursively enumerable languages is a set of recursively enumerable languages. We say a TM $M$ has property $P$ if its language $L(M)$ is in the set $P$. This means the property depends only on the language itself, not the specific machine that recognizes it. A property $P$ is called trivial if either all recursively enumerable languages are in $P$, or no recursively enumerable languages are in $P$. Rice's Theorem states that any non-trivial property of recursively enumerable languages is undecidable. Formally, for any such property $P$, the language $L_P = \\{ \\langle M \\rangle \\mid L(M) \\in P \\}$ is undecidable, where $\\langle M \\rangle$ is the encoding of machine $M$.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we define the **DFA-complexity** of a language $L$ as the number of states in the minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts $L$, if $L$ is regular. If $L$ is not a regular language, its DFA-complexity is considered infinite.\n\nYou are given a Turing Machine $M$ by its encoding $\\langle M \\rangle$.

For non-trivial semantic properties of recursively enumerable languages, Rice's Theorem implies undecidability. For properties about the syntactic encoding or a specific computation behavior not determined solely by $L(M)$, we examine direct decidability or give a reduction from the halting problem.\n\nA. Define the property\n$$\nP_{A}=\\{L \\text{ recursively enumerable} : \\text{the minimal DFA for } L \\text{ has a finite number of states greater than } 1\\}.\n$$\nThis is a property depending only on $L(M)$ and thus is semantic. It is non-trivial: for example, $L=0^{*}$ over alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ satisfies $P_{A}$ (its minimal DFA has $2$ states), while $L=\\emptyset$ does not (its DFA-complexity is $1$), and any non-regular language (e.g., $\\{0^{n}1^{n} : n \\ge 0\\}$) does not (its DFA-complexity is infinite).

The question asks whether the finite binary string encoding $\\langle M\\rangle$ contains the substring 10101. This is a decidable problem: given $\\langle M\\rangle$, perform a finite substring search and accept iff 10101 occurs. This property depends on the syntactic encoding, not on $L(M)$, and is trivially decidable. Hence D is decidable.\n\nE. Let $S_{0}=\\{0^{n}1^{n} : 0\\le n\\le 10\\}$.

If no such witness exists, run forever (do not accept).\n\nWe verify correctness:\n- If $L(M_{1})=L(M_{2})$, then for all $x$ and all $t$ the dovetail never finds a disagreement witness.
