            "introduction": "Understanding the boundaries between different classes of languages often begins by challenging our initial intuitions. This first exercise explores the relationship between a language and its subsets, asking a fundamental question: if a language is computationally \"simple\" (decidable), must all of its component parts also be simple? As you will see, the answer reveals a crucial subtlety about the nature of decidability and lays the groundwork for more complex analyses .",

            "problem": "In the theory of computation, we classify languages based on the capabilities of abstract machines required to recognize them. A **language** is defined as a set of strings over a finite alphabet $\\Sigma$. A **Turing Machine (TM)** is a mathematical model of computation that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.\n\nWe define two important classes of languages:\n- A language $L$ is **Turing-decidable** (or simply, decidable) if there exists a TM that halts on every input string, accepting those in $L$ and rejecting those not in $L$.\n- A language $L$ is **Turing-recognizable** (or simply, recognizable) if there exists a TM that halts and accepts every input string in $L$, but for strings not in $L$, it may either halt and reject or loop forever.\n\nEvery decidable language is also recognizable, but the reverse is not true. There exist languages that are recognizable but not decidable.\n\nConsider the following claim: \"It is possible for a non-empty, recognizable but undecidable language to be a subset of a decidable language.\"\n\nEvaluate the validity of this claim by selecting the most accurate statement from the options below.\n\nA. The claim is true. A simple example is when the decidable language is the set of all possible strings, $\\Sigma^*$.\n\nB. The claim is false.

The claim is false. Any subset of a decidable language must also be decidable.\n\nD. The claim is true, but this is only possible if the recognizable but undecidable language is finite.",
            "solution": "We use the given definitions. A language $L$ is decidable if some Turing machine halts on every input and decides membership in $L$. A language $L$ is recognizable if some Turing machine halts and accepts exactly the strings in $L$, possibly looping on strings not in $L$. It is known that there exist languages that are recognizable but not decidable.\n\nTo evaluate the claim, construct the following argument:\n1. Existence step: There exists a non-empty language $L_{R}$ that is recognizable but not decidable. For example, any standard halting-type language serves, but its specific identity is not required; only existence is needed.\n2. Decidable superset step: The language $\\Sigma^{*}$ (the set of all strings over the alphabet $\\Sigma$) is decidable because a Turing machine can halt and accept every input, thereby deciding $\\Sigma^{*}$.\n3. Subset relation step: For any language $L_{R}$ over $\\Sigma$, we have $L_{R} \\subseteq \\Sigma^{*}$ by definition.\n4. Conclusion: Combining the above, there is a non-empty, recognizable but undecidable language $L_{R}$ that is a subset of the decidable language $\\Sigma^{*}$. Hence, the claim is true.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- Option A states exactly the construction above: choose $L_{D} = \\Sigma^{*}$, which is decidable, and any non-empty recognizable but undecidable $L_{R} \\subseteq \\Sigma^{*}$. This is correct.\n- Option B is incorrect because having a decider $M_{D}$ for a superset $L_{D}$ does not by itself decide a proper subset $L_{R} \\subseteq L_{D}$; $M_{D}$ only decides membership in $L_{D}$, not in $L_{R}$.\n- Option C is false because not every subset of a decidable language is decidable; the counterexample above shows a non-decidable subset of $\\Sigma^{*}$.\n- Option D is false because any finite language is decidable, so a recognizable but undecidable language cannot be finite.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is Option A.",

            "solution": "We consider the reversal function $r:\\Sigma^{*}\\to\\Sigma^{*}$ defined by $r(w)=w^{R}$. This function is a total computable bijection with computable inverse $r^{-1}=r$. For any language $L \\subseteq \\Sigma^{*}$, its reversal is $L_{R}=\\{w^{R}\\mid w\\in L\\}=\\{x\\mid r(x)\\in L\\}$.\n\nTo analyze closure properties:\n\n1) If $L$ is recognizable, there exists a Turing machine $M$ such that for all $w$:\n- If $w\\in L$, then $M$ halts and accepts $w$.\n- If $w\\notin L$, then $M$ either halts and rejects $w$ or does not halt.\n\nConstruct a Turing machine $N$ to recognize $L_{R}$:\n- On input $x$, compute $r(x)=x^{R}$ (this always halts).\n- Run $M$ on input $r(x)$.\n- If $M$ accepts, accept; if $M$ rejects, reject; if $M$ does not halt, do not halt.\n\nCorrectness: If $x\\in L_{R}$, then $r(x)\\in L$, so $M$ accepts $r(x)$ and $N$ accepts $x$. If $x\\notin L_{R}$, then $r(x)\\notin L$, so $M$ either rejects or does not halt on $r(x)$, and accordingly $N$ either rejects or does not halt on $x$. Therefore $L_{R}$ is recognizable. Hence statement A is true.\n\n2) Statement B is false. There exist recognizable languages that are not decidable, for example the halting language $HALT=\\{\\langle M,w\\rangle \\mid M \\text{ halts on } w\\}$, which is recognizable and not decidable. If $L=HALT$, then $L_{R}$ cannot be decidable because, since $r$ is a computable bijection with computable inverse, $L$ would be decidable if and only if $L_{R}$ were decidable. Thus recognizability of $L$ does not imply decidability of $L_{R}$.\n\n3) Statement C is false. Taking any recognizable but undecidable $L$ (such as $HALT$), $L$ is recognizable while $L_{R}$ is not decidable, contradicting the “if and only if” claim.\n\n4) Statement D is false. If $L$ is decidable by a decider $D$, construct a decider $D_{R}$ for $L_{R}$ by computing $r(x)$ and running $D$ on $r(x)$. Since $D$ halts on all inputs and $r$ is total computable, $D_{R}$ halts on all inputs, so $L_{R}$ is decidable.

A language is called **decidable** if a Turing Machine (TM) exists that halts on every input string, accepting those in the language and rejecting those not in it.

A language is **co-recognizable** if its complement is recognizable.\n\nLet $D$ and $L$ be two languages over the binary alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$.

            "solution": "We use the standard definitions from computability theory. A language is decidable if there exists a Turing machine that halts and correctly decides membership for every input. A language is recognizable if there exists a Turing machine that halts and accepts exactly the strings in the language (and may reject or loop otherwise). A language is co-recognizable if its complement is recognizable. It is a standard theorem that a language is decidable if and only if it is both recognizable and co-recognizable.\n\nFirst, we show that $J$ is recognizable. Since $D$ is decidable, there exists a decider $M_{D}$ for $D$. Since $L$ is recognizable, there exists a recognizer $M_{L}$ for $L$. Construct a recognizer $M_{J}$ for $J$ as follows: On input $x$, if $x$ does not begin with $0$ or $1$, reject. If $x = 0w$, run $M_{D}$ on $w$ and accept iff $M_{D}$ accepts (otherwise reject). If $x = 1w$, simulate $M_{L}$ on $w$ and accept iff $M_{L}$ accepts (and otherwise continue simulating). This machine halts and accepts exactly those strings in $J$, and on nonmembers starting with $1$ it may run forever. Therefore $J$ is recognizable.\n\nNext, we show $J$ is not decidable. Suppose, for contradiction, that $J$ were decidable. Then the decider for $J$ would decide $L$ by mapping any $w$ to $1w$ and deciding whether $1w \\in J$. This would decide $L$, contradicting that $L$ is undecidable. Hence $J$ is not decidable.\n\nFinally, we show that $J$ is not co-recognizable. A language is co-recognizable if its complement is recognizable. The complement of $J$ is $\\overline{J} = \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup \\{0w \\mid w \\notin D\\} \\cup \\{1w \\mid w \\notin L\\}$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\overline{J}$ is recognizable. Since the class of recognizable languages is closed under intersection with decidable languages, the intersection of $\\overline{J}$ with the decidable language $\\{1w \\mid w \\in \\Sigma^*\\}$ must also be recognizable. This intersection is exactly the language $\\{1w \\mid w \\notin L\\}$. If we have a recognizer for $\\{1w \\mid w \\notin L\\}$, we can easily construct a recognizer for $\\overline{L}$: on input $w$, we construct $1w$ and run the recognizer for $\\{1w \\mid w \\notin L\\}$. This would mean $\\overline{L}$ is recognizable. However, we know that a language is decidable if and only if it is both recognizable and co-recognizable. Since $L$ is given as recognizable but undecidable, its complement $\\overline{L}$ cannot be recognizable. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $\\overline{J}$ is not recognizable, and $J$ is not co-recognizable.\n\nCombining the conclusions: $J$ is recognizable, not decidable, and not co-recognizable. Thus the correct classification is that $J$ is recognizable but not co-recognizable.",
