The eigenvalues of a graph's adjacency matrix, collectively known as its spectrum, provide deep insights into its connectivity and behavior. This first exercise provides a concrete, hands-on calculation of the spectrum for one of the simplest yet most important regular graphs, the complete graph on three vertices, $K_3$.",

            "problem": "A small-scale, decentralized data storage network consists of three identical server nodes. To ensure maximum fault tolerance and data redundancy, each server is directly connected to every other server in the network. The connectivity of this network can be represented by a 3x3 adjacency matrix $A$, where the entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if server $i$ and server $j$ are connected, and 0 otherwise. By convention, diagonal entries $A_{ii}$ are 0, as a server is not considered connected to itself.\n\nThe performance of such a network, particularly how quickly information disseminates or consensus is reached, is deeply related to the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix are of particular importance.\n\nDetermine the three eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$ for this three-server network.",

Since $J$ has $1$ in every entry, we have\n$$\nA=J-I,\n$$\nbecause subtracting $I$ zeroes the diagonal entries of $J$ while keeping all off-diagonal entries equal to $1$.\n\nConsider the vector $u=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. Then\n$$\nJu=3u \\quad\\text{and}\\quad Au=(J-I)u=3u-u=2u,\n$$\nso $u$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $2$.\n\nNow take any vector $v=\\begin{pmatrix}v_{1}\\\\v_{2}\\\\v_{3}\\end{pmatrix}$ satisfying $v_{1}+v_{2}+v_{3}=0$. For such $v$,\n$$\nJv=\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_{1}+v_{2}+v_{3}\\\\\nv_{1}+v_{2}+v_{3}\\\\\nv_{1}+v_{2}+v_{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nhence\n$$\nAv=(J-I)v=-v.\n$$\nTherefore every vector orthogonal to $u$ (i.e., with zero coordinate sum) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $-1$.
