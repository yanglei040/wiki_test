This exercise directly contrasts two algorithms: one whose running time depends polynomially on the parameter $k$, and another whose dependency is exponential. By calculating the performance difference on a realistic, large-scale dataset, you will gain an intuition for why algorithms in the FPT class are considered efficient for small parameters, even if their counterparts with exponential parameter-dependency are not .",

            "problem": "A bioinformatics research team is developing algorithms to search for a specific functional motif within a very large Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence. The size of the DNA sequence is denoted by $n$, and a key structural property of the motif is described by an integer parameter $k$. The team has two competing algorithms, `PolyScan` and `ExpoScan`.\n\nThe computational cost of each algorithm, measured in the total number of elementary operations, has been determined through theoretical analysis and experimental benchmarks.\n- The cost for `PolyScan`, $N_P$, is given by the function $N_P(n, k) = c_P k^2 n^2$.\n- The cost for `ExpoScan`, $N_E$, is given by the function $N_E(n, k) = c_E 2^k n^2$.\n\nFrom benchmarks on a particular high-performance computing cluster, the scaling constants have been estimated as $c_P = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}$ operations/unit and $c_E = 8.0 \\times 10^{-16}$ operations/unit.\n\nThe team needs to process a newly sequenced genome where the main input size is $n = 5.0 \\times 10^6$ and the relevant motif parameter is $k = 20$. Calculate the ratio of the total number of operations required by `ExpoScan` to the total number of operations required by `PolyScan` for this specific task.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The goal is to find the ratio of the total number of operations for `ExpoScan` to that of `PolyScan`, which we can denote as $R = \\frac{N_E}{N_P}$.\n\nThe number of operations for each algorithm is given by the following functions:\nFor `PolyScan`:\n$$N_P(n, k) = c_P k^2 n^2$$\nFor `ExpoScan`:\n$$N_E(n, k) = c_E 2^k n^2$$\n\nWe are given the following values for the constants and parameters:\n- $c_P = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- $c_E = 8.0 \\times 10^{-16}$\n- $n = 5.0 \\times 10^6$\n- $k = 20$\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{N_E}{N_P} = \\frac{c_E 2^k n^2}{c_P k^2 n^2}$$\n\nNotice that the term $n^2$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator. We can cancel this term, which simplifies the expression for the ratio. This illustrates a key idea in parameterized complexity: for a fixed parameter $k$, the scaling with the input size $n$ might be the same, so the choice of algorithm depends critically on the behavior with respect to $k$.\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{c_E 2^k}{c_P k^2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this simplified expression:\n$$R = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{-16}) \\cdot 2^{20}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot 20^2}$$\n\nLet's evaluate the powers of $k$ and 2:\n- $k^2 = 20^2 = 400 = 4.0 \\times 10^2$\n- $2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = (1024)^2 = 1048576 \\approx 1.048576 \\times 10^6$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{-16}) \\cdot (1.048576 \\times 10^6)}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^2)}$$\n\nNow, let's group the numerical parts and the powers of 10:\n$$R = \\frac{8.0 \\cdot 1.048576}{1.0 \\cdot 4.0} \\times \\frac{10^{-16} \\cdot 10^6}{10^{-12} \\cdot 10^2}$$\n$$R = \\frac{8.388608}{4.0} \\times \\frac{10^{-10}}{10^{-10}}$$\n$$R = 2.097152 \\times 1$$\n$$R = 2.097152$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.

            "introduction": "Parameterized complexity is not just about designing algorithms; it is also about classifying problems to understand their inherent difficulty. The primary tool for this is the parameterized reduction, which transforms one problem into another while preserving the parameter. This final exercise guides you through the construction of a classic reduction from $k$-Vertex Cover to $k$-Bounded SAT, demonstrating how we can prove that one problem is 'no harder' than another in the parameterized setting . Mastering this technique is essential for understanding the structure of the W-hierarchy and the limits of fixed-parameter tractability.",

            "problem": "An engineering team is tackling a network monitoring problem. The problem, known as $k$-VERTEX-COVER, is to determine if a given network graph $G=(V,E)$ can be \"monitored\" by placing at most $k$ sensors on a subset of nodes $V' \\subseteq V$, such that every link $(u, v) \\in E$ has at least one sensor on either node $u$ or $v$.\n\nThe team only has access to a specialized solver for a different type of problem, called $k$-BOUNDED-SAT. This solver takes a Boolean formula $\\phi$ in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)—a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals—and an integer $k$. It determines if there is a satisfying truth assignment for $\\phi$ that sets at most $k$ variables to TRUE.\n\nTo use their solver, the team needs to transform any instance $(G, k)$ of $k$-VERTEX-COVER into an instance $(\\phi, k)$ of $k$-BOUNDED-SAT. The transformation works as follows:\n1. For each vertex $v \\in V$ in the graph, a unique Boolean variable $x_v$ is created.\n2. For each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ in the graph, a single clause is constructed using the variables $x_u$ and $x_v$.\n3. The final formula $\\phi$ is the conjunction of all clauses generated in step 2.\n\nThis transformation is designed to have the property that the graph $G$ has a vertex cover of size at most $k$ if and only if the resulting formula $\\phi$ has a satisfying assignment with at most $k$ variables set to TRUE.\n\nConsider a specific graph $G$ with the set of vertices $V = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and the set of edges $E = \\{(a, b), (b, c), (c, d), (d, a)\\}$. Following the transformation described, which of the following CNF formulas is the correct output $\\phi$? The variables corresponding to vertices $a, b, c, d$ are $x_a, x_b, x_c, x_d$, respectively.\n\nA. $(x_a \\land x_b) \\lor (x_b \\land x_c) \\lor (x_c \\land x_d) \\lor (x_d \\land x_a)$\n\nB. $(\\neg x_a \\lor \\neg x_b) \\land (\\neg x_b \\lor \\neg x_c) \\land (\\neg x_c \\lor \\neg x_d) \\land (\\neg x_d \\lor \\neg x_a)$\n\nC. $(x_a \\lor x_b) \\land (x_b \\lor x_c) \\land (x_c \\lor x_d) \\land (x_d \\lor x_a)$\n\nD. $(x_a \\leftrightarrow x_b) \\land (x_b \\leftrightarrow x_c) \\land (x_c \\leftrightarrow x_d) \\land (x_d \\leftrightarrow x_a)$\n\nE. $(x_a \\land x_b \\land x_c \\land x_d)$",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to construct a specific Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula, $\\phi$, from a given graph, $G=(V, E)$, according to a described transformation rule. This transformation bridges the $k$-VERTEX-COVER problem and the $k$-BOUNDED-SAT problem.\n\nThe core idea of the transformation is to establish a direct correspondence between the elements of the two problems. A vertex $v$ being in the vertex cover is mapped to its corresponding Boolean variable $x_v$ being assigned the value TRUE. The size constraint $k$ is kept the same for both problems.\n\nThe defining property of a vertex cover $V'$ is that for every edge $(u, v) \\in E$, at least one of its endpoints must be in the cover. In set-theoretic notation, this is $u \\in V'$ or $v \\in V'$.\n\nUsing the established correspondence, the condition \"$u \\in V'$ or $v \\in V'$\" translates into the logical condition \"$x_u$ is TRUE or $x_v$ is TRUE\". This is precisely the logical disjunction $(x_u \\lor x_v)$. To be a valid vertex cover, this condition must hold for *every* edge in the graph.\n\nThe transformation constructs the final formula $\\phi$ by ensuring this property for all edges simultaneously. It does this by creating one clause of the form $(x_u \\lor x_v)$ for each edge $(u, v) \\in E$. The final formula $\\phi$ is the conjunction (logical AND) of all these clauses, which is required for a CNF formula. Thus, the general form of the transformation is:\n$$ \\phi = \\bigwedge_{(u,v) \\in E} (x_u \\lor x_v) $$\n\nNow, we apply this general rule to the specific instance given in the problem.\nThe graph is $G=(V,E)$ where:\n- The set of vertices is $V = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$.\n- The set of edges is $E = \\{(a, b), (b, c), (c, d), (d, a)\\}$.\n\nThe corresponding Boolean variables are $x_a, x_b, x_c, x_d$. We generate one clause for each edge in $E$:\n1. The edge $(a, b)$ yields the clause $(x_a \\lor x_b)$.\n2. The edge $(b, c)$ yields the clause $(x_b \\lor x_c)$.\n3. The edge $(c, d)$ yields the clause $(x_c \\lor x_d)$.\n4. The edge $(d, a)$ yields the clause $(x_d \\lor x_a)$.\n\nThe final formula $\\phi$ is the conjunction of these four clauses:\n$$ \\phi = (x_a \\lor x_b) \\land (x_b \\lor x_c) \\land (x_c \\lor x_d) \\land (x_d \\lor x_a) $$\n\nLet's compare this result with the given choices:\n- A: $(x_a \\land x_b) \\lor (x_b \\land x_c) \\lor (x_c \\land x_d) \\lor (x_d \\land x_a)$ is in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), not CNF. It incorrectly swaps the roles of AND and OR.\n- B: $(\\neg x_a \\lor \\neg x_b) \\land (\\neg x_b \\lor \\neg x_c) \\land (\\neg x_c \\lor \\neg x_d) \\land (\\neg x_d \\lor \\neg x_a)$. The clauses $(\\neg x_u \\lor \\neg x_v)$ are equivalent to $\\neg(x_u \\land x_v)$, meaning that $u$ and $v$ cannot both be in the chosen set. This corresponds to the definition of an Independent Set, not a Vertex Cover.\n- C: $(x_a \\lor x_b) \\land (x_b \\lor x_c) \\land (x_c \\lor x_d) \\land (x_d \\lor x_a)$. This perfectly matches our derived formula.\n- D: This option uses biconditionals ($\\leftrightarrow$), which is not part of the described transformation logic.\n- E: This option is a single clause, which implies all edges are connected to all vertices in a specific way that is not true for the given graph. It would only be correct if the problem reduced to a single giant OR clause, which isn't the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct CNF formula is given in option C.",
