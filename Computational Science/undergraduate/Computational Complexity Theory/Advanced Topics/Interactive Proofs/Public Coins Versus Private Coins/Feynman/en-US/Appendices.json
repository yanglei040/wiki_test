The Arthur-Merlin (AM) protocol is a cornerstone of this field, illustrating how a probabilistic verifier can leverage a powerful prover using public randomness.

            "solution": "We recall the definition of an $\\mathrm{AM}[k]$ protocol: it is a public-coin interactive proof with $k$ messages where Arthur (a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier) moves first, and all of Arthur’s random choices are public, i.e., revealed to Merlin. For $\\mathrm{AM}[2]$ specifically, the canonical protocol consists of exactly two messages: Arthur sends a single public random challenge, and Merlin replies with a message; Arthur then decides based on a deterministic polynomial-time predicate of the input, the public randomness, and Merlin’s reply.\n\nWe analyze each option against this definition.\n\n1. In option A, Arthur on input $x$ generates a random string $r$ of length polynomial in $|x|$ and sends $r$ to Merlin. Merlin responds with a message $m$. Arthur then performs a deterministic polynomial-time computation on $(x, r, m)$ to accept or reject. This matches the standard $\\mathrm{AM}[2]$ model: two messages, Arthur moves first with public coins, and the final decision can be taken to be deterministic given the public coins since any additional public randomness could be folded into $r$ without changing the model.\n\n2. In option B, Merlin sends a proof $m$ first, then Arthur generates randomness $r$ and decides. This is the $\\mathrm{MA}$ pattern (Merlin first, Arthur second) with Arthur’s coins not necessarily public to Merlin at the time Merlin forms $m$. It does not fit $\\mathrm{AM}[2]$ because Arthur does not start.\n\n3. In option C, there are more than two messages: Arthur sends $r_{1}$, Merlin replies $m$, Arthur sends $r_{2}$, Merlin replies again, and then Arthur decides. This is not $\\mathrm{AM}[2]$ but a longer public-coin protocol (at least $\\mathrm{AM}[3]$).\n\n4. In option D, Merlin generates the “random” string $r$ and sends it with $m$ to Arthur. In a public-coin protocol, the randomness is generated by Arthur and made public; Merlin cannot be trusted to generate Arthur’s randomness. Hence this violates the model.\n\n5. In option E, Arthur sends a public random string $r$ to Merlin, Merlin replies $m$, and then Arthur uses a new set of private random coins to decide. This violates the public-coin condition because Arthur’s new coins are private. In the public-coin setting, any randomness used by Arthur must be public; moreover, even if Arthur used additional public randomness at the end, it can be folded into the initial $r$, making the final decision deterministic given $(x, r, m)$.\n\nTherefore, only option A correctly describes the fundamental $\\mathrm{AM}[2]$ protocol.",

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, interactive proof systems are abstract models that describe computations involving a verifier and a prover. The Arthur-Merlin (AM) protocol is a specific type of interactive proof system for a decision problem concerning a language $L$. It involves a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier, named Arthur, and an all-powerful, untrustworthy prover, named Merlin.\n\nFor an input string $x$ of length $n$, the standard AM protocol is defined as follows:\n1.  Arthur, the verifier, receives the input $x$. He generates a random string $r$ of length polynomial in $n$ and sends it to Merlin. This string is considered \"public\" as Merlin can see it.\n2.  Merlin, the prover, upon receiving $x$ and $r$, computes and sends a response string $y$, of length polynomial in $n$, back to Arthur.\n3.  Arthur then runs a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm, let's call its decision function $V(x, y, r)$, to either accept or reject the input $x$ based on the proof $y$ and his random string $r$.\n\nA language $L$ is in the complexity class AM if the following two conditions are met:\n- **Completeness:** For any string $x \\in L$, there exists a response $y$ from Merlin that makes Arthur accept with high probability. Formally: $\\forall x \\in L$, Merlin can choose a proof $y$ such that $\\Pr_{r}[V(x, y, r) = \\text{accept}] \\geq \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- **Soundness:** For any string $x \\notin L$, no matter what response $y$ Merlin provides, Arthur will accept with low probability. Formally: $\\forall x \\notin L$, for any proof $y$, $\\Pr_{r}[V(x, y, r) = \\text{accept}] \\leq \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, consider a modified version of this protocol where Arthur is stripped of his ability to use randomness. He becomes a purely deterministic polynomial-time verifier, meaning he does not generate or use any random string $r$. Which of the following well-known complexity classes is equivalent to the class of languages decidable by this modified, deterministic Arthur-Merlin protocol?\n\nA. P (Polynomial-Time)\nB.

            "solution": "We restate the standard AM definition and then remove randomness to derive the resulting class.\n\nIn AM, the verifier uses a polynomial-length random string $r$ and a deterministic decision procedure $V(x,y,r)$. The completeness and soundness conditions are:\n$$\n\\forall x \\in L,\\ \\exists y \\text{ of length poly}(|x|):\\ \\Pr_{r}\\big[V(x,y,r)=\\text{accept}\\big] \\geq \\frac{2}{3},\n$$\n$$\n\\forall x \\notin L,\\ \\forall y \\text{ of length poly}(|x|):\\ \\Pr_{r}\\big[V(x,y,r)=\\text{accept}\\big] \\leq \\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\n\nNow remove Arthur’s randomness. This yields a deterministic polynomial-time verifier, so there is no $r$. Equivalently, let $r$ be the empty string $\\epsilon$, and define a deterministic decision predicate $V'(x,y) \\coloneqq V(x,y,\\epsilon)$. The probability over $r$ becomes trivial: for any fixed input and proof, the acceptance probability is either $0$ or $1$.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, an Interactive Proof (IP) system involves a powerful Prover trying to convince a randomized Verifier about the truth of a statement. Consider a \"private-coin\" IP system for a language $L$. For a given input string $x$, the Verifier uses a private random string $r$, drawn uniformly from a set $\\mathcal{R}$ of $2^k$ possible strings, to conduct a dialogue with the Prover.

In this system, to prove that $x$ is in $L$, the Prover provides a single certificate to a deterministic Verifier. The proposed certificate is a pair $(r_{guess}, T)$, where $r_{guess}$ is a specific string from the set $\\mathcal{R}$, and $T$ is a full transcript of a conversation. The deterministic Verifier for $\\mathcal{P}_{cert}$ performs a single check: it verifies if the provided transcript $T$ represents an interaction that would cause the original private-coin Verifier to accept the input $x$, had its private random string been $r_{guess}$.

Equivalently, there exists a set $S \\subseteq \\mathcal{R}$ of “accepting” random strings (those for which some interaction with a prover can lead the original verifier to accept) such that\n$$\n\\frac{|S|}{|\\mathcal{R}|} \\le s \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad |S| \\le s \\cdot 2^{k}.\n$$\nThe problem assumes $S \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nIn the certificate-based system $\\mathcal{P}_{cert}$, the verifier is deterministic and performs a single check on a certificate $(r_{guess}, T)$.
