This practice  provides a concrete starting point, demonstrating how a device with a clear operational behavior—selecting one of two inputs—can be elegantly captured by an algebraic expression. Mastering this translation is the first step toward applying algebraic techniques to more complex logical systems.",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, particularly in the context of interactive proof systems, it is often useful to translate Boolean formulas into multivariate polynomials. This process, known as arithmetization, allows algebraic techniques to be applied to logical problems.\n\nConsider a translation scheme where Boolean variables $x, y, \\dots$ that take values in $\\{0, 1\\}$ are treated as integer variables over the same set. The logical operations are mapped to polynomials as follows:\n- The negation `NOT x` is translated to the polynomial $1 - x$.\n- The conjunction `x AND y` is translated to the polynomial $xy$.\n- The disjunction `x OR y` is translated to the polynomial $x + y - xy$.\n\nA 2-to-1 multiplexer is a standard digital logic component with two data inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and a select input, $s$. The output of the multiplexer is $x_1$ if the select line $s$ is false (0), and $x_2$ if $s$ is true (1). The Boolean expression describing the output, $M$, of this device is:\n\n$$M(x_1, x_2, s) = (\\text{NOT } s \\text{ AND } x_1) \\text{ OR } (s \\text{ AND } x_2)$$\n\nYour task is to apply the arithmetization rules to this Boolean expression. Determine the multivariate polynomial $P(x_1, x_2, s)$ that is equivalent to the multiplexer's output function. Present your answer as a fully simplified polynomial in terms of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $s$.",

            "introduction": "Moving beyond direct translation, this next exercise challenges you to construct a polynomial from a logical specification. Instead of being given a boolean formula, you must design a polynomial that enforces the condition that 'exactly one' of its inputs is true .
