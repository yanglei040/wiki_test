Let $n = \\lfloor \\log_2 N \\rfloor + 1$ be the number of bits in the standard binary representation of $N$. The machine $M$ performs the following steps:\n\n1.  It non-deterministically chooses a binary string $y$ of length $n$ and a bit $b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This process defines $2^{n+1}$ distinct computation paths, one for each unique pair $(y, b)$.\n2.  Let $d$ be the positive integer value represented by the binary string $y$.\n3.
