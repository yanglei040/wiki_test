This exercise explores what happens when there is a clear, predictable relationship between different parts of the output string.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, a Pseudorandom Generator (PRG) is an efficient, deterministic algorithm that takes a short, truly random seed and expands it into a longer string that is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random string of the same length.\n\nLet's analyze a simple candidate for a PRG. Consider the generator $G: \\{0,1\\}^s \\to \\{0,1\\}^{s+1}$ defined for any integer $s \\ge 1$. For any input seed $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^s$, the generator produces the output $G(x) = x \\| \\text{parity}(x)$, where `\\|` denotes string concatenation and $\\text{parity}(x)$ is the sum of the bits of $x$ modulo 2. For instance, if $s=3$ and $x=101$, then $\\text{parity}(x) = (1+0+1) \\pmod 2 = 0$, so $G(101) = 1010$.\n\nA PRG is considered \"broken\" if there exists an efficient algorithm, called a distinguisher $D$, that can tell its output apart from a truly random string with a non-negligible advantage. A distinguisher $D$ is an algorithm that takes a string of length $s+1$ as input and outputs either 1 (guessing the input is from the PRG) or 0 (guessing the input is truly random).\n\nThe advantage of a distinguisher $D$ for a generator $G$ is defined as:\n$$ \\text{Adv}_G(D) = \\left| \\Pr_{x \\sim U_s}[D(G(x)) = 1] - \\Pr_{y \\sim U_{s+1}}[D(y) = 1] \\right| $$\nwhere $U_n$ denotes the uniform distribution over all binary strings of length $n$.\n\nYour task is to demonstrate that the generator $G(x) = x \\| \\text{parity}(x)$ is not a secure PRG. First, devise a simple, efficient algorithm for a distinguisher $D$. Then, calculate the exact advantage, $\\text{Adv}_G(D)$, of your proposed distinguisher. The final answer should be this single numerical value.",

This is efficient because computing parity and a single comparison are both polynomial-time operations.\n\nWhen $y$ is of the form $G(x)$ for $x \\sim U_{s}$, we have by definition $G(x)=x\\|\\text{parity}(x)$, so the last bit equals the parity of the first $s$ bits for every input.
