This practice explores the concept of pairwise independence, a weaker but highly useful form of randomness that can be generated from a much smaller sample space.

            "problem": "In the field of theoretical computer science, particularly in the study of randomized algorithms, the concept of pairwise independence serves as a powerful tool for derandomization. Fully independent random variables require a large sample space, which can be computationally expensive. Pairwise independent variables, a weaker notion, can often be used instead with a significantly smaller sample space.\n\nLet $S$ be a sample space consisting of four distinct strings, each of length three. We define a uniform probability distribution over $S$, meaning each string has a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ of being chosen. Let $X_1, X_2,$ and $X_3$ be random variables representing the first, second, and third bits, respectively, of a string chosen uniformly at random from $S$.\n\nFor these variables to be useful in many applications, they must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Uniformity**: Each variable $X_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ must be uniformly distributed, meaning the probability of it being 0 is equal to the probability of it being 1. That is, $P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  **Pairwise Independence**: For every distinct pair of indices $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the random variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ must be independent. This means that for all values $b_1, b_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the joint probability satisfies $P(X_i=b_1, X_j=b_2) = P(X_i=b_1)P(X_j=b_2)$.\n\nWhich of the following sample spaces $S$ satisfies both the uniformity and pairwise independence conditions for the random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$?\n\nA. $S = \\{000, 001, 010, 100\\}$\n\nB. $S = \\{000, 011, 100, 111\\}$\n\nC. $S = \\{000, 011, 101, 110\\}$\n\nD. $S = \\{000, 111, 001, 110\\}$",
            "solution": "We work under the uniform distribution on a sample space with four strings, so each string has probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. For $X_i$ to be uniform, for each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ we need $P(X_i=0)=P(X_i=1)=\\frac{1}{2}$. Since the distribution assigns equal weight to the four strings, this requires that in the multiset of the $i$-th coordinates across $S$ there are exactly two zeros and two ones. For pairwise independence of $X_i$ and $X_j$, because the marginals must be uniform, we need for every $b_1, b_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ that\n$$\nP(X_i=b_1,X_j=b_2)=P(X_i=b_1)P(X_j=b_2)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nUnder the uniform distribution on four strings, this condition holds if and only if, among the four strings, each ordered pair $(b_1,b_2)$ appears exactly once as the $(i,j)$-coordinates.\n\nCheck option A: $S=\\{000,001,010,100\\}$. The first coordinates are $0,0,0,1$, hence\n$P(X_1=0)=\\frac{3}{4}\\neq \\frac{1}{2}$,\nso uniformity fails and thus A is invalid.\n\nCheck option B: $S=\\{000,011,100,111\\}$. The coordinates for $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are $(0,0,1,1)$, $(0,1,0,1)$, and $(0,1,0,1)$ respectively. Since each column has two zeros and two ones, each variable $X_i$ is uniform. Now we check pairwise independence. For the pair $(X_2, X_3)$, the observed value pairs are: from 000 we get (0,0); from 011 we get (1,1); from 100 we get (0,0); from 111 we get (1,1). Here only the pairs $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ appear, each twice. The pairs $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ never occur. Thus\n$$\nP(X_2=0,X_3=1)=0 \\neq \\frac{1}{4},\n$$\nso pairwise independence fails; B is invalid.\n\nCheck option D: $S=\\{000,111,001,110\\}$. Each position has two zeros and two ones, so each $X_i$ is uniform. For $(X_1,X_2)$, the pairs are: from 000 get (0,0); from 111 get (1,1); from 001 get (0,0); from 110 get (1,1). Thus\n$$\nP(X_1=0,X_2=1)=0 \\neq \\frac{1}{4},\n$$\nso pairwise independence fails; D is invalid.\n\nCheck option C: $S=\\{000,011,101,110\\}$. The first, second, and third coordinates across $S$ are each two zeros and two ones, so for each $i$,\n$P(X_i=0)=P(X_i=1)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor pairwise independence, we enumerate the pairs:\n- For $(X_1,X_2)$: from 000 get (0,0); from 011 get (0,1); from 101 get (1,0); from 110 get (1,1). Each of the four possible pairs appears exactly once, so\n$$P(X_1=b_1,X_2=b_2)=\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}.$$\n- For $(X_1,X_3)$: from 000 get (0,0); from 011 get (0,1); from 101 get (1,1); from 110 get (1,0). Again, each pair appears once, so\n$$P(X_1=b_1,X_3=b_2)=\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}.$$\n- For $(X_2,X_3)$: from 000 get (0,0); from 011 get (1,1); from 101 get (0,1); from 110 get (1,0). Again, each pair appears once, so\n$$P(X_2=b_1,X_3=b_2)=\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}.$$\nThus all marginals are uniform and all pairs are independent.\n\nTherefore, the unique valid choice among the given options is C.",
