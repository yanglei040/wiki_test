A seed string $x$ of length $n$, i.e., $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. We denote the bits of the seed as $x = x_1x_2...x_n$.\n2.  A boolean function $f: \\{0,1\\}^k \\to \\{0,1\\}$ for some integer $k < n$.\n3.

A key result is that if $f$ is sufficiently hard (i.e., for large $S$ and small $\\delta$), then the output of $G_f$ is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random string for any circuit of a certain size.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where we construct a new generator, $G_h$, using the exact same combinatorial design as $G_f$, but we replace the hard function $f$ with a modified function $h: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$. This new function is defined as $h(y) = f(y \\oplus c)$, where $c \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ is a fixed, publicly known, non-zero constant vector, and $\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nAssume that the original function $f$ is sufficiently hard to make $G_f$ a cryptographically secure pseudorandom generator against all polynomial-time adversaries. How does the security of the new generator $G_h$ compare to the security of the original generator $G_f$?\n\nA. The generator $G_h$ is completely insecure. An adversary can easily distinguish its output from random because the linear transformation of XORing with `c` is public knowledge.\n\nB.

It is guaranteed to be secure against a class of circuits that is marginally smaller than the class of circuits $G_f$ is secure against.\n\nD. The security of $G_h$ is significantly reduced (e.g., by a constant factor greater than 2). The linear nature of the modification makes $h$ much easier to approximate than $f$.\n\nE. The security of $G_h$ is provably stronger than that of $G_f$. The constant $c$ acts as a \"tweak\" that increases the complexity of the underlying function, making it harder for circuits to compute.",

Therefore, if $h$ were not $(S-t,\\delta)$-hard, then $f$ would not be $(S,\\delta)$-hard. Equivalently, from $f$ being $(S,\\delta)$-hard we conclude $h$ is $(S-t,\\delta)$-hard. The reverse direction (from a circuit for $f$ to one for $h$) is symmetric and yields the same $O(n)$ additive overhead. Thus, the hardness parameters of $f$ and $h$ agree up to an additive $O(n)$ shift in circuit size, with identical advantage $\\delta$.\n\nImplication for the NW generator: The standard NW security reduction states that if $f$ is $(S,\\delta)$-hard and the design has appropriate parameters, then any distinguisher $D$ of size at most $T$ that separates $G_{f}$ from uniform with advantage at least $\\varepsilon$ yields a circuit of size at most $\\mathrm{poly}(T)$ that computes $f$ on a random input with advantage related to $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$. Running the same reduction with $h$ in place of $f$ produces a predictor for $h$ with size at most $\\mathrm{poly}(T)$ and comparable advantage; composing with $y\\mapsto y\\oplus c$ converts it into a predictor for $f$ with the same advantage and an additive $O(n)$ size overhead. Consequently, the class of distinguishers $D$ for which we obtain a contradiction to the assumed hardness shrinks only by the polynomial that accounts for the additive $O(n)$ overhead. In asymptotic terms, $G_{h}$ remains secure against all polynomial-time adversaries if $G_{f}$ is, but the exact quantitative bound on the circuit size against which we can prove security is slightly weaker by at most an additive $O(n)$ in the corresponding hardness parameter.\n\nTherefore, the public, fixed XOR by $c$ does not make the generator insecure nor strictly stronger; it preserves security up to a minor, purely technical degradation in the provable parameters, not a significant one nor an exact identity at the level of strict $(S,\\delta)$ counts.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that $G_{h}$ remains secure, but its provable security is slightly weaker due to the small additive overhead in translating predictors between $h$ and $f$.",
