            "problem": "In the field of communication complexity, a \"fooling set\" is a technique used to establish a lower bound on the amount of communication required for two parties, Alice and Bob, to compute a function `f(x, y)`. Alice holds an input `x`, and Bob holds an input `y`.\n\nLet's consider the Greater-Than function, `GT(x, y)`, defined for two 3-bit unsigned integers `x` and `y`. The function is defined as:\n`GT(x, y) = 1` if the integer value of `x` is greater than the integer value of `y`.\n`GT(x, y) = 0` otherwise.\n\nA set of input pairs `S = {(x_i, y_i)}` for `i=1, ..., k` is called a fooling set for the function `f` with respect to a value `v` if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  `f(x_i, y_i) = v` for all pairs `(x_i, y_i)` in `S`.\n2.  For any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (i.e., `i \\neq j`), at least one of the \"crossed\" evaluations `f(x_i, y_j)` or `f(x_j, y_i)` is not equal to `v`.\n\nConsider the following set `S` of four input pairs, where each input is a 3-bit binary string:\n`S = {(101_2, 010_2), (110_2, 100_2), (011_2, 001_2), (111_2, 000_2)}`\n\nWhich of the following statements is true about the set `S` in the context of the `GT` function?\n\nA. `S` is a fooling set for `GT` with respect to the value `v=1`.\n\nB. `S` is a fooling set for `GT` with respect to the value `v=0`.\n\nC. `S` is a fooling set for `GT` with respect to both `v=0` and `v=1`.\n\nD. `S` is not a fooling set for `GT` for any value `v`.",
            "solution": "We are given the Greater-Than function $GT(x,y)$ on $3$-bit unsigned integers, where $GT(x,y)=1$ if and only if $x>y$, and $GT(x,y)=0$ otherwise.

For each, we have\n$$\nGT(5,2)=1,\\quad GT(6,4)=1,\\quad GT(3,1)=1,\\quad GT(7,0)=1.\n$$\nTherefore, condition 1 holds for $v=1$, and fails for $v=0$ (since none of the $GT(x_{i},y_{i})$ equals $0$).\n\nTo test condition 2 for $v=1$, we must check whether for every $i\\neq j$ at least one of $GT(x_{i},y_{j})$ or $GT(x_{j},y_{i})$ is not equal to $1$. It suffices to exhibit a counterexample. Take $i=1$ with $(x_{1},y_{1})=(5,2)$ and $j=2$ with $(x_{2},y_{2})=(6,4)$. Then\n$$\nGT(x_{1},y_{2})=GT(5,4)=1,\\quad GT(x_{2},y_{1})=GT(6,2)=1.\n$$\nBoth crossed evaluations equal $1$, which violates condition 2 for $v=1$ (since at least one should not equal $1$). Hence $S$ is not a fooling set for $v=1$.\n\nCombining these findings:\n- $v=0$: condition 1 fails, so $S$ is not a fooling set.\n- $v=1$: condition 2 fails, so $S$ is not a fooling set.\n\nTherefore, $S$ is not a fooling set for $GT$ for any value $v$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond simply verifying a fooling set, a crucial skill is to find the largest possible one for a given function, as its size provides a direct lower bound on communication.

            "solution": "We are given $X = Y = \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $f(x,y) = x+y$. The communication matrix $M_{f}$ has entries $M_{f}[x,y] = x+y$. Writing rows in the order $x=0,1,2$ and columns in the order $y=0,1,2$, we obtain\n$$\nM_{f} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine the size $s$ of the largest fooling set. By the monochromaticity condition, a fooling set must lie within a level set of $f$, i.e., a set of pairs satisfying $x+y = z_{0}$ for some fixed $z_{0}$. Over $X \\times Y = \\{0,1,2\\}^{2}$, the possible sums are $z_{0} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. The corresponding level sets have sizes:\n- $z_{0}=0$: $\\{(0,0)\\}$, size $1$;\n- $z_{0}=1$: $\\{(0,1),(1,0)\\}$, size $2$;\n- $z_{0}=2$: $\\{(0,2),(1,1),(2,0)\\}$, size $3$;\n- $z_{0}=3$: $\\{(1,2),(2,1)\\}$, size $2$;\n- $z_{0}=4$: $\\{(2,2)\\}$, size $1$.\n\nThus any monochromatic set has size at most $3$, hence $s \\leq 3$. We now exhibit a fooling set of size $3$ to show that this bound is tight. Take\n$$\nS = \\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\\},\n$$\nfor which $f(x,y)=2$ for all $(x,y)\\in S$. For the fooling condition, consider any two distinct elements and check the crossed pairs:\n- For $(0,2)$ and $(1,1)$, the crossed values are $f(0,1)=1 \\neq 2$ and $f(1,2)=3 \\neq 2$.\n- For $(0,2)$ and $(2,0)$, the crossed values are $f(0,0)=0 \\neq 2$ and $f(2,2)=4 \\neq 2$.\n- For $(1,1)$ and $(2,0)$, the crossed values are $f(1,0)=1 \\neq 2$ and $f(2,1)=3 \\neq 2$.\nIn each case at least one crossed value is not equal to $2$ (indeed both differ), so $S$ is a valid fooling set. Therefore the largest fooling set has size $s=3$.\n\nNext, we determine the rank $r$ of $M_{f}$ over the reals. Observe that for $a = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, and $1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, we can write\n$$\nM_{f} = a 1^{T} + 1 b^{T},\n$$\nsince $(a 1^{T})_{xy} = x$ and $(1 b^{T})_{xy} = y$, so their sum is $x+y$. Each summand has rank $1$, hence $\\operatorname{rank}(M_{f}) \\leq 2$. To see that the rank is exactly $2$, note that the first two rows, $\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 2\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\end{pmatrix}$, are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $\\operatorname{rank}(M_{f}) \\geq 2$, and combining the bounds gives $r=2$.\n\nThus the ordered pair is $(s,r) = (3,2)$.",
