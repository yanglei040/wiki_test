Instead of performing a standard measurement in the computational basis, a measurement is performed in the Hadamard basis, which is defined by the states $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the probabilities of measuring a qubit, initially in the state $|\\psi\\rangle = |1\\rangle$, in the Hadamard basis $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$.\n\nAccording to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and obtaining the outcome corresponding to a basis state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product. This is known as the Born rule: $P(\\phi) = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\nFirst, we need to express the states in a consistent vector representation.

These are the conjugate transposes of the kets:\n$\\langle +| = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle -| = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we can calculate the probability $P(+)$ of measuring the outcome corresponding to the state $|+\\rangle$.\nThe inner product is:\n$\\langle + | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle + | 1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}((1)(0) + (1)(1)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of this complex number:\n$P(+) = |\\langle + | 1 \\rangle|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability $P(-)$ of measuring the outcome corresponding to the state $|-\\rangle$.\nThe inner product is:\n$\\langle - | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle - | 1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}((1)(0) + (-1)(1)) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of this complex number:\n$P(-) = |\\langle - | 1 \\rangle|^2 = \\left|-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, the respective probabilities are $P(+) = 1/2$ and $P(-) = 1/2$. This corresponds to option A. As a check, the probabilities must sum to 1, which they do: $P(+) + P(-) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.",
