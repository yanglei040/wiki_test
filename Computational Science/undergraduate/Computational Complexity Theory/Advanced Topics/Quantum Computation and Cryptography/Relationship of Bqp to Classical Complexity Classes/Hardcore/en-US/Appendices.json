This exercise asks you to consider a hypothetical \"quantum\" device stripped of its most essential quantum features—superposition and interference—leaving only classical reversible operations.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the class BQP, which stands for Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time, represents the set of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time with an error probability of at most 1/3. A universal quantum computer can implement a set of gates including the Hadamard gate and the Toffoli gate.\n\nConsider a hypothetical computing device that is constructed based on quantum principles, but its gate set is restricted. Specifically, it can only implement classical reversible gates, such as the CNOT gate and the Toffoli gate. This machine cannot create superpositions (e.g., it has no Hadamard gate) or utilize quantum interference. All computations are performed deterministically on basis states.\n\nWhich of the following classical complexity classes precisely characterizes the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by this restricted computing device?\n\nA.

            "solution": "We analyze the computational power of the restricted device that can only implement classical reversible gates (such as CNOT and Toffoli), cannot create superpositions, and evolves deterministically on computational basis states.\n\nFirst, characterize the device’s operations. Since no superposition is allowed, the state is always a basis string, and each gate maps basis strings to basis strings deterministically. Therefore any circuit on $n$ bits computes a bijection\n$$\nF:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n},\n$$\ni.e., a permutation on bit strings. In quantum terms, the overall unitary is a permutation matrix on the computational basis; in classical terms, it is a reversible circuit.\n\nUpper bound: simulation by deterministic polynomial time. Each gate (CNOT, Toffoli) is a constant-size, deterministic operation on a constant number of bits, so a standard deterministic Turing machine can simulate each gate application in time bounded by a constant factor per gate. Thus a circuit of size polynomial in the input length can be simulated in deterministic polynomial time. Therefore, the class of languages decidable by this device in polynomial time is a subset of P.\n\nLower bound: realization of any deterministic polynomial-time computation. Any function $f:\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{k}$ computable by a deterministic Turing machine in time $T(m)$ can be simulated reversibly with at most polynomial overhead in time and space by Bennett’s reversible simulation method. Concretely, one can embed $f$ into a reversible map\n$$\n(x,0^{a})\\mapsto (x,f(x),g(x)),\n$$\nfor some number $a$ of ancilla bits and some garbage $g(x)$, using a reversible gate set. Using uncomputation, one can clean the garbage to obtain\n$$\n(x,0^{a})\\mapsto (x,f(x),0^{a}),\n$$\nwith only polynomial overhead. Since the Toffoli gate is universal for classical reversible computation, and CNOT is a standard reversible gate, this device can implement the required reversible circuits with polynomial overhead. Therefore, any language in P can be decided by this device in polynomial time. Hence P is a subset of the device’s power.\n\nCombining both inclusions, the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by this restricted device is exactly P.\n\nExcluding other options: BQP requires superposition and interference, which are absent; BPP requires randomness, which is absent since the evolution is deterministic; NP is a nondeterministic class and would strictly contain problems believed to be harder than P; L is a strict subclass of P in general and is too restrictive given that the device is not limited to logarithmic space.\n\nTherefore, the correct classical complexity class is P.",

Thus the decision problem reduces to distinguishing a $1$-to-$1$ function from a $2$-to-$1$ function on a domain of size $|G| = 2^{n+1}$ under a standard black-box oracle model (the abstract knowledge that $Z(G)$ has size $2$ does not tell us, for a given input $g$, which other input shares its label without using the oracle).\n\nClassical lower bound. Let $N := |G| = 2^{n+1}$. Consider any randomized classical algorithm making $q$ oracle queries (possibly adaptively). Under Yao’s minimax principle, it suffices to consider a hard distribution over oracles: choose uniformly at random a $1$-to-$1$ oracle or a $2$-to-$1$ oracle satisfying the promise. Before the algorithm observes any collision among the $q$ queried outputs, its transcript (the multiset of queried inputs together with their distinct outputs) has the same distribution in both cases, so no information distinguishing the cases is available. In the $2$-to-$1$ case, the probability that $q$ queries produce any collision is upper bounded by\n$$\n\\Pr[\\text{some collision among }q\\text{ outputs}] \\leq \\frac{q(q-1)}{N}.\n$$\nTherefore, unless $q = \\Omega(N^{1/2})$, the distinguishing advantage is $o(1)$, and achieving success probability at least $2/3$ requires\n$$\nq = \\Omega\\!\\left( N^{1/2} \\right) = \\Omega\\!\\left( 2^{(n+1)/2} \\right) = \\Omega\\!\\left( 2^{n/2} \\right).\n$$\nHence $Q_{BPP}(n) = \\Omega(2^{n/2})$.\n\nQuantum upper bound.
