This first exercise challenges you to build a constant-depth, polynomial-size circuit for the threshold-2 function, $T_2^n$. This function is a fundamental computational primitive that determines if at least two inputs are 'on', and designing a circuit for it provides a clear, hands-on demonstration of how the unbounded fan-in of AC^0 gates can be leveraged for efficient computation.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the class **AC^0** (Alternating Circuits, constant depth) consists of families of circuits $\\{C_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, one for each input size $n$, that satisfy two conditions: the size of $C_n$ is bounded by a polynomial in $n$, and the depth of $C_n$ is a constant, independent of $n$. These circuits are built from AND and OR gates with unbounded fan-in (i.e., they can have any number of inputs) and NOT gates which are only applied directly to the circuit inputs. The size of a circuit is its total number of gates, and its depth is the length of the longest path from any input variable to the output gate.\n\nConsider the threshold-2 function, denoted $T_2^n(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, which takes $n$ boolean inputs and outputs 1 if and only if at least two of the inputs are 1. Your task is to design a family of circuits $\\{C_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ within the class AC^0 that computes the $T_2^n$ function.\n\nDetermine the exact size and depth of your proposed circuit $C_n$. Express the size as a simplified polynomial in $n$ and the depth as an integer. Provide your answer as an ordered pair (Size, Depth).",
            "solution": "We want a constant-depth, polynomial-size circuit over unbounded fan-in AND/OR gates (and NOT gates allowed only on inputs) that computes the threshold-2 function $T_{2}^{n}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})$, which is $1$ if and only if at least two inputs are $1$.\n\nDefine the following circuit family. For each $n$, introduce, for every unordered pair of distinct indices $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i  j \\leq n$, an AND gate\n$$\nA_{i,j} \\;=\\; x_{i} \\wedge x_{j}.\n$$\nFeed all these $A_{i,j}$ into a single OR gate at the output:\n$$\nC_{n}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}) \\;=\\; \\bigvee_{1 \\leq i  j \\leq n} \\left(x_{i} \\wedge x_{j}\\right).\n$$\n\nCorrectness: If at least two inputs are $1$, then there exist indices $ij$ with $x_{i}=1$ and $x_{j}=1$, which makes $A_{i,j}=1$ and hence the final OR outputs $1$. Conversely, if the final OR outputs $1$, then some $A_{i,j}=1$, implying $x_{i}=x_{j}=1$, so there are at least two $1$’s among the inputs. If there are fewer than two $1$’s, then every conjunction $x_{i}\\wedge x_{j}$ is $0$, and the OR outputs $0$. Therefore\n$$\nC_{n}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}) \\;=\\; T_{2}^{n}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}).\n$$\n\nDepth: Each input $x_{k}$ feeds into some AND gate $A_{i,j}$ (depth $1$), and all $A_{i,j}$ feed directly into the single OR output gate (depth $2$). Because fan-in is unbounded, no additional layers are needed. Thus the depth is exactly $2$, a constant independent of $n$.\n\nSize: The number of AND gates equals the number of unordered pairs of inputs, which is $\\binom{n}{2}$. There is one additional OR gate at the top. Hence the total number of gates is\n$$\nS(n) \\;=\\; \\binom{n}{2} + 1 \\;=\\; \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 \\;=\\; \\frac{n^{2}-n+2}{2}.\n$$\nThis is a polynomial in $n$, as required. No NOT gates are used beyond inputs, satisfying the AC^0 model.\n\nTherefore, the circuit family $\\{C_{n}\\}$ lies in AC^0 with exact size $\\frac{n^{2}-n+2}{2}$ and exact depth $2$.",

To understand why it's so challenging for constant-depth circuits, we will first zoom in on a small, manageable case. This practice asks you to construct an optimal depth-2 circuit for 4-input PARITY, providing concrete insights into the structural requirements and gate costs that foreshadow the difficulties of the general problem.

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, boolean circuits provide a formal model for computation. A boolean circuit is constructed from input nodes and logic gates. For this problem, we consider a specific type of circuit with the following properties:\n1.  The inputs to the circuit are a set of boolean variables, along with their negations. These are called literals. We can consider these to be available at the \"input layer\" of the circuit, at depth 0.\n2.  The circuit is composed of AND gates and OR gates. These gates are assumed to have unbounded fan-in, meaning they can take any number of inputs.\n3.  The depth of a circuit is the number of gates on the longest path from any input literal to the final output gate.\n\nConsider the boolean function $f: \\{0,1\\}^4 \\to \\{0,1\\}$ that takes four input variables, $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, and outputs 1 if and only if an even number of these inputs are equal to 1. Otherwise, the function outputs 0.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of gates required to implement this function $f$ using a circuit of depth 2, with the constraint that the gate at the final layer (depth 2) must be an OR gate.",
            "solution": "We are restricted to depth-2 circuits whose final (depth-2) gate is an OR. Any such circuit computes a formula of the form\n$$\nf=\\bigvee_{j=1}^{m} g_{j},\n$$\nwhere each depth-1 gate output $g_{j}$ is either an AND of literals or an OR of literals. If some $g_{j}$ is an OR of literals, say $g_{j}=\\bigvee_{\\ell \\in S_{j}} \\ell$, then\n$$\n\\bigvee_{j=1}^{m} g_{j}=\\left(\\bigvee_{\\substack{j:\\ g_{j}\\ \\text{is AND}}} g_{j}\\right)\\ \\vee\\ \\left(\\bigvee_{\\substack{j:\\ g_{j}\\ \\text{is OR}}}\\ \\bigvee_{\\ell \\in S_{j}} \\ell\\right),\n$$\nso replacing that bottom OR gate by wiring its input literals directly to the top OR strictly reduces the gate count without changing the function or the depth. Therefore, in any size-minimal circuit under the stated constraints, all depth-1 gates can be assumed to be AND gates, and the circuit is an OR of ANDs (a DNF).\n\nLet a depth-1 AND gate compute a conjunction of literals\n$$\nA=\\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in P} x_{i}\\right)\\ \\wedge\\ \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in N} \\neg x_{j}\\right),\n$$\nwith disjoint $P,N \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. If $P \\cup N \\subsetneq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, pick any $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus (P \\cup N)$. Fix the variables in $P \\cup N$ so that $A=1$. Then there are two assignments differing only in $x_{t}$, one with even Hamming weight and the other with odd Hamming weight, both satisfying $A=1$. Since $f$ outputs $1$ exactly on even-parity inputs, $A$ cannot be an implicant of $f$ unless it fixes all four variables. Hence every valid conjunction in a DNF for $f$ must include all four variables (each as either $x_{i}$ or $\\neg x_{i}$), i.e., must be a minterm.\n\nEach such minterm is true on exactly one input assignment. Therefore, any DNF for $f$ must include at least one distinct minterm for each input on which $f=1$. The number of even-parity assignments on four bits is\n$$\n\\sum_{\\substack{k=0 \\\\ k\\ \\text{even}}}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} \\;=\\; \\binom{4}{0}+\\binom{4}{2}+\\binom{4}{4}\\;=\\;1+6+1\\;=\\;8.\n$$\nThus at least $8$ depth-1 AND gates are necessary. This lower bound is tight, since the DNF consisting of exactly these $8$ minterms correctly computes $f$. With the required final OR gate at depth 2 that aggregates these $8$ outputs, the total gate count is\n$$\n8\\ (\\text{AND gates})\\ +\\ 1\\ (\\text{final OR})\\ =\\ 9.\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum number of gates is $9$.",

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, a Boolean function can be represented by various logical formulas. A formula is in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) if it is an OR of one or more clauses, where each clause is an AND of one or more literals. A literal is either a variable $x_i$ or its negation $\\neg x_i$. For example, if we have variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$, the expression $(x_1 \\land \\neg x_2) \\lor (\\neg x_3)$ is a DNF with two clauses. The size of a DNF formula is commonly measured by the number of clauses it contains.\n\nConsider the $n$-variable PARITY function, denoted $\\text{PARITY}_n(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, which outputs $1$ if the number of input variables with the value $1$ is odd, and outputs $0$ otherwise.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of clauses required for any DNF formula that correctly represents the $\\text{PARITY}_n$ function for $n \\ge 1$?

The satisfying assignments of $C$ form a subcube of dimension $n-k$.\n\nKey property of parity: flipping any single variable toggles the parity. Formally, for any $\\ell\\in[n]$ and any assignment $x$, letting $x^{(\\ell)}$ be $x$ with the $\\ell$th bit flipped, we have\n$$\nf\\bigl(x^{(\\ell)}\\bigr)=f(x)+1 \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nTherefore, any subcube of dimension at least $1$ (i.e., any clause with $kn$ literals) contains two satisfying assignments $x$ and $x^{(\\ell)}$ with opposite parity values. Hence such a clause is satisfied by at least one negative example of $f$, and including it in a DNF would force the DNF to output $1$ on that negative example, contradicting correctness.\n\nIt follows that every clause in any correct DNF for $f$ must have $k=n$, i.e., be a minterm fixing all variables. Each such clause corresponds to exactly one assignment. To output $1$ exactly on the odd-parity assignments, the DNF must include a distinct clause for each odd-parity assignment. The number of odd-parity assignments is\n$$\n\\sum_{\\substack{t=0 \\\\ t\\ \\text{odd}}}^{n} \\binom{n}{t}=\\frac{(1+1)^{n}-(1-1)^{n}}{2}=2^{n-1}.\n$$\nA DNF achieving this bound is the disjunction of all $2^{n-1}$ minterms corresponding to odd Hamming-weight assignments.
