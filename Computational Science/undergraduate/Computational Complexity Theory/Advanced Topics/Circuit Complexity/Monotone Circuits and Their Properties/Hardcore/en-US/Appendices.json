This exercise requires you to translate a real-world specification—a safety protocol for an autonomous vehicle—into an optimal network of logic gates. You will explore the trade-offs between different circuit constructions and learn to evaluate their efficiency using the fundamental metrics of size and depth, which are central to circuit complexity .",

            "problem": "A safety-critical system for an autonomous vehicle relies on three independent sensors, $S_1, S_2,$ and $S_3$, to monitor an environmental condition. The system is designed with redundancy to ensure reliability. The system's control unit will engage a safety protocol if and only if at least two of the three sensors are triggered simultaneously.\n\nLet the state of each sensor be represented by a Boolean variable $x_i$, where $x_i=1$ if sensor $S_i$ is triggered, and $x_i=0$ otherwise. The decision to engage the safety protocol can be described by a Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, which outputs 1 if the protocol should be engaged and 0 otherwise.\n\nThis logic must be implemented using a **monotone Boolean circuit**. For the purpose of this problem, a monotone Boolean circuit is a network of gates built under the following rules:\n-   The circuit inputs are the variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$.\n-   The circuit contains only AND ($\\land$) gates and OR ($\\lor$) gates. No other type of gate (like NOT) is permitted.\n-   Each gate must have exactly two inputs (i.e., a fan-in of 2).\n-   The circuit must have a single output that corresponds to the function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\n\nThe **size** of a circuit is defined as the total number of gates it contains. The **depth** of a circuit is the length of the longest path from any input variable to the final output gate.\n\nFind the size, $S$, and the depth, $D$, of the most efficient (i.e., smallest possible size) monotone Boolean circuit that implements the function $f$. Provide your answer as a pair of integers $(S, D)$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the size $S$ and depth $D$ of the smallest-size monotone circuit that computes a function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ which is true if at least two of its inputs are true. This is also known as the Threshold-2 function on three variables, $Th_2^3$.\n\nFirst, we must express the function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ in terms of Boolean operations. The condition \"at least two of $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are true\" can be written as a disjunction of all possible pairs being true:\n$(x_1 \\text{ is true AND } x_2 \\text{ is true}) \\text{ OR } (x_1 \\text{ is true AND } x_3 \\text{ is true}) \\text{ OR } (x_2 \\text{ is true AND } x_3 \\text{ is true})$.\nIn Boolean algebra notation, this is:\n$$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_1 \\land x_3) \\lor (x_2 \\land x_3)$$\nThis is the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) of the function.\n\nA straightforward way to construct a circuit is to directly implement this expression.\n1.  Compute the three AND terms:\n    -   $g_1 = x_1 \\land x_2$ (1 AND gate)\n    -   $g_2 = x_1 \\land x_3$ (1 AND gate)\n    -   $g_3 = x_2 \\land x_3$ (1 AND gate)\n2.  Combine these terms using OR gates. Since the gates are restricted to 2 inputs, we need two OR gates to combine the three terms:\n    -   $g_4 = g_1 \\lor g_2$ (1 OR gate)\n    -   $f = g_4 \\lor g_3$ (1 OR gate)\n\nCounting the gates, we have 3 AND gates and 2 OR gates, for a total size of 5. While this construction is valid, we must determine if it is the most efficient (smallest size). Let's investigate if we can simplify the Boolean expression to use fewer gates.\n\nWe can factor the expression. Let's factor out $x_1$ from the first two terms:\n$$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 \\land (x_2 \\lor x_3)) \\lor (x_2 \\land x_3)$$\nLet's verify this is the same function. By the distributive law, $x_1 \\land (x_2 \\lor x_3) = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_1 \\land x_3)$. Substituting this back gives the original expression, so the factorization is correct.\n\nNow, let's construct a circuit based on this new expression, $f = (x_1 \\land (x_2 \\lor x_3)) \\lor (x_2 \\land x_3)$. We can build it as follows:\n1.  Compute the term in the innermost parenthesis: $g_1 = x_2 \\lor x_3$. This requires one OR gate.\n2.  Compute the second term in the final disjunction: $g_2 = x_2 \\land x_3$. This requires one AND gate.\n3.  Compute the first major term: $g_3 = x_1 \\land g_1 = x_1 \\land (x_2 \\lor x_3)$. This requires one AND gate, taking $x_1$ and the output of $g_1$ as its inputs.\n4.  Compute the final function: $f = g_3 \\lor g_2$. This requires one OR gate, taking the outputs of $g_3$ and $g_2$ as its inputs.\n\nIn total, this circuit uses 1 OR gate (for $g_1$), 1 AND gate (for $g_2$), 1 AND gate (for $g_3$), and 1 OR gate (for $f$). The total number of gates is $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\nSince this is smaller than the initial size of 5, this is a more efficient design. It can be shown (though is not required for this problem) that a size of 4 is indeed optimal for this function with 2-input monotone gates. Therefore, the minimal size is $S=4$.\n\nNext, we calculate the depth $D$ of this size-4 circuit. The depth is the longest path from an input to the output.\n-   The inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are at depth 0.\n-   The gates $g_1 = x_2 \\lor x_3$ and $g_2 = x_2 \\land x_3$ take inputs directly from the source variables. Their depth is 1.\n-   The gate $g_3 = x_1 \\land g_1$ depends on an input variable $x_1$ (depth 0) and the output of gate $g_1$ (depth 1). Its depth is $1 + \\max(\\text{depth}(x_1), \\text{depth}(g_1)) = 1 + \\max(0, 1) = 2$.\n-   The final output gate $f = g_3 \\lor g_2$ depends on the outputs of $g_3$ (depth 2) and $g_2$ (depth 1). Its depth is $1 + \\max(\\text{depth}(g_3), \\text{depth}(g_2)) = 1 + \\max(2, 1) = 3$.\n\nThe longest path goes through gates $g_1$, then $g_3$, then $f$. For example, the path from $x_2$ to $f$ via $g_1$ and $g_3$ has a length of 3. Thus, the depth of the circuit is $D=3$.\n\nThe minimal size is $S=4$ and the corresponding depth is $D=3$. The answer is the pair $(4, 3)$.",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, a Boolean function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is called **monotone** if for any two input vectors $u = (u_1, \\dots, u_n)$ and $v = (v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ such that $u_i \\le v_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$, it holds that $f(u) \\le f(v)$. Informally, this means that changing an input from 0 to 1 can never change the function's output from 1 to 0. Such functions can be expressed using only the logical AND ($\\land$) and OR ($\\lor$) operators.\n\nA **minimal true input** for a monotone function $f$ is an input vector $v$ such that $f(v) = 1$, but for any vector $v'$ obtained by changing a single 1 to a 0 in $v$, we have $f(v') = 0$. The set of all minimal true inputs completely characterizes a monotone function.\n\nConsider the 4-variable monotone Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ defined as:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_3 \\land (x_1 \\lor x_4))\n$$\nWhich of the following options represents the complete set of all minimal true inputs for the function $f$?

            "solution": "The problem asks for the complete set of minimal true inputs for the monotone Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_3 \\land (x_1 \\lor x_4))$.\n\nA standard method to find the minimal true inputs of a monotone function is to first express the function in its minimal Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). For a monotone function, each term in its minimal DNF corresponds to exactly one minimal true input.\n\nFirst, let's expand the given expression for $f$ into its DNF by applying the distributive property of $\\land$ over $\\lor$. The distributive law states that $A \\land (B \\lor C) = (A \\land B) \\lor (A \\land C)$.\nApplying this to the second part of the function expression:\n$$\nx_3 \\land (x_1 \\lor x_4) = (x_3 \\land x_1) \\lor (x_3 \\land x_4)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor \\left( (x_1 \\land x_3) \\lor (x_3 \\land x_4) \\right)\n$$\nSo, the DNF for $f$ is:\n$$\nf = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_1 \\land x_3) \\lor (x_3 \\land x_4)\n$$\n\nNext, we need to ensure this is the minimal DNF. We can check for redundancy using the absorption law, which states that $P \\lor (P \\land Q) = P$. A term in a DNF is redundant if it is implied by another term. For monotone functions, this means checking if one term (conjunction of variables) is a superset of another. For example, $(x_1 \\land x_2 \\land x_3)$ is absorbed by $(x_1 \\land x_2)$.\nLet's examine the three terms in our DNF:\n1. $T_1 = x_1 \\land x_2$\n2. $T_2 = x_1 \\land x_3$\n3. $T_3 = x_3 \\land x_4$\n\nNone of these terms contains all the variables of another term. For instance, $T_1$ does not contain $x_3$ (from $T_2$) or $x_4$ (from $T_3$), so it cannot be absorbed. Similarly, $T_2$ cannot be absorbed by $T_1$ or $T_3$, and $T_3$ cannot be absorbed by $T_1$ or $T_2$. Therefore, the DNF $f = (x_1 \\land x_2) \\lor (x_1 \\land x_3) \\lor (x_3 \\land x_4)$ is minimal.\n\nEach term in this minimal DNF corresponds to a minimal true input. A term of the form $x_{i_1} \\land x_{i_2} \\land \\dots \\land x_{i_k}$ corresponds to an input vector where the variables $x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \\dots, x_{i_k}$ are set to 1 and all other variables are set to 0. This input is minimal because setting any one of these specified variables to 0 would make the term false, and since all other variables are already zero, the other terms in the DNF would also be false, resulting in the function evaluating to 0.\n\nLet's derive the minimal true inputs from the terms:\n- From the term $x_1 \\land x_2$: We set $x_1=1$, $x_2=1$, and the rest to 0. This gives the input vector $(1,1,0,0)$, which corresponds to the binary string `1100`.\n- From the term $x_1 \\land x_3$: We set $x_1=1$, $x_3=1$, and the rest to 0. This gives the input vector $(1,0,1,0)$, which corresponds to the binary string `1010`.\n- From the term $x_3 \\land x_4$: We set $x_3=1$, $x_4=1$, and the rest to 0. This gives the input vector $(0,0,1,1)$, which corresponds to the binary string `0011`.\n\nThus, the complete set of minimal true inputs is {`1100`, `1010`, `0011`}.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n- A. {`1100`, `1010`} is incomplete; it is missing `0011`.\n- B. {`1100`, `1010`, `1110`} includes `1110`, which is not a minimal true input. For the input `1110`, we have $f(1,1,1,0) = (1\\land1)\\lor(1\\land(1\\lor0)) = 1$. However, if we change $x_3$ from 1 to 0, we get the input `1100`. For `1100`, $f(1,1,0,0)=(1\\land1)\\lor(0\\land(1\\lor0))=1$. Since changing a 1 to a 0 does not make the function 0, `1110` is not minimal. It is \"covered\" by the minimal true input `1100`.\n- C. {`1100`, `1010`, `0011`} is the correct set we derived.\n- D. {`0100`, `0010`, `0001`} represents inputs with a single 1. None of these make the function true. For example, $f(0,1,0,0) = (0\\land1)\\lor(0\\land(0\\lor0)) = 0$.\n- E. {`1100`, `1010`, `0011`, `1011`} includes the correct set but also `1011`. The input `1011` is not minimal. $f(1,0,1,1)=(1\\land0)\\lor(1\\land(1\\lor1))=1$. However, it contains two minimal true inputs as sub-vectors (in the component-wise order): `1010` and `0011`. For example, $f(1,0,1,0)=1$, so changing $x_4$ from 1 to 0 doesn't flip the function's output. Thus `1011` is not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.",
