By mapping Boolean values `FALSE` and `TRUE` to the field elements $0$ and $1$, we can find a polynomial that perfectly mimics a gate's input-output behavior. This exercise  provides a foundational starting point for this powerful technique by asking you to find the unique, simple polynomial that represents the logical NOT gate over any prime field.",

The only integer that is congruent to $1$ modulo every prime is $b=1$. Thus,\n$$\nb=1.\n$$\nNext, evaluate $P(1)$:\n$$\nP(1)=a+b=a+1.\n$$\nThe requirement $P(1)=0$ in $F_{p}$ for every prime $p$ means $a+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ for all primes $p$.

            "introduction": "When combining polynomials to represent larger circuits, we often generate expressions with variables raised to powers greater than one, such as $x_1^2$ or $x_2^3$. However, since the inputs to our original Boolean functions are restricted to $\\{0, 1\\}$, any power of a variable $x^k$ (for $k \\ge 1$) behaves identically to $x$ itself. This exercise  introduces the essential simplification technique of multilinearization, which allows us to convert any polynomial into a unique, equivalent form where no variable has a power greater than one. Mastering this process is crucial for managing the complexity of polynomials in this context and for defining their degree in a meaningful way.",
