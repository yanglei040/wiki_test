We will examine a \"tally language,\" which contains only strings of the form $1^n$, whose membership is linked to an undecidable property of Turing machines established by Rice's Theorem.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the class **P/poly** consists of languages that can be decided by polynomial-time algorithms which are given a polynomial-sized \"advice string\" that depends only on the length of the input. While most common decidable problems reside in this class, **P/poly** is vast enough to contain even undecidable languages.\n\nConsider the following definitions:\n- A **tally language** is a language where all strings consist only of the symbol '1'. That is, it is a subset of $\\{1\\}^*$.\n- A property of Turing Machines (TMs) is **semantic** if it only depends on the language the machine accepts, not on the machine's specific implementation.\n- **Rice's Theorem** states that any non-trivial semantic property of recursively enumerable languages is undecidable. A property is non-trivial if there exists at least one Turing machine whose language has the property, and at least one whose language does not.\n\nLet's define a specific language. Consider the property $P_{\\text{FIN}}$ of a Turing machine's language being finite. This is a non-trivial semantic property. For any positive integer $n$, let $M_n$ be the Turing machine corresponding to the integer $n$ under a standard, fixed enumeration of all possible Turing machine encodings.\n\nWe define the tally language $L$ as:\n$$L = \\{ 1^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\text{ and } L(M_n) \\text{ is a finite language} \\}$$\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the language $L$?\n\nA. $L$ is decidable and can be recognized by a standard Turing machine without advice.\n\nB. $L$ is undecidable, and it does not belong to the complexity class P/poly.\n\nC. $L$ is undecidable, and it does belong to the complexity class P/poly.\n\nD. $L$ is a regular language.\n\nE. The decidability of $L$ is an open problem in computer science.",
            "solution": "We first analyze decidability. The property $P_{\\text{FIN}}$ that the language recognized by a Turing machine is finite is a semantic property (it depends only on the language accepted, not the particular machine) and it is non-trivial (some Turing machines accept finite languages, some accept infinite ones). By Rice's Theorem, deciding, given an encoding of a Turing machine $M$, whether $L(M)$ is finite is undecidable.\n\nIn the definition of $L$, inputs are unary strings $1^{n}$ and the membership condition is that $1^{n} \\in L$ if and only if $L(M_{n})$ is finite, where $M_{n}$ is the $n$-th Turing machine in a fixed standard effective enumeration. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $L$ were decidable. Given an arbitrary Turing machine $M$ (specified by its encoding), we can effectively compute its index $n$ in the fixed enumeration, because the enumeration is standard and effective. Then we could decide $P_{\\text{FIN}}$ for $M$ by deciding whether $1^{n} \\in L$. This would decide a non-trivial semantic property, contradicting Rice's Theorem. Therefore $L$ is undecidable. Consequently, $L$ cannot be regular, since every regular language is decidable.\n\nNext we analyze membership in $\\mathrm{P/poly}$. By definition, $\\mathrm{P/poly}$ consists of languages decidable by a polynomial-time Turing machine equipped with an advice string $a_{n}$ that depends only on the input length $n$ and has length polynomial in $n$. For unary languages, there is exactly one string of each length $n$, namely $1^{n}$. Define the advice function so that for each length $n$, the advice $a_{n}$ is a single bit $b_{n}$, where $b_{n} = 1$ if $1^{n} \\in L$ and $b_{n} = 0$ otherwise. The decider on input $x$ of length $n$ first checks in polynomial time whether $x$ is of the form $1^{n}$; if not, it rejects. If yes, it outputs the bit $b_{n}$ from the advice. The advice length is $1$, which is polynomial in $n$, and the running time is polynomial. Hence $L \\in \\mathrm{P/poly}$.\n\nCombining the two conclusions, $L$ is undecidable and $L \\in \\mathrm{P/poly}$. Among the options, this corresponds to statement C. Statements A and D are false since $L$ is undecidable, and statement B is false since $L$ is in **P/poly**. Statement E is false because the status is not open; it is settled by Rice's Theorem and the standard characterization of unary languages in $\\mathrm{P/poly}$.",

Also, any language that has at most one string of each length belongs to **P/poly**, because for each input length $n$ one can build a circuit of size $O(n)$ that hardwires (as nonuniform advice) the unique length-$n$ string to accept (or knows there is none) and checks equality with the input.\n\nCheck the one-per-length property:\n\n- For $L_{A} = \\{ 1^{n} \\mid n \\in U \\}$: For each length $n$, $L_{A}$ contains $1^{n}$ if and only if $n \\in U$; otherwise it contains no string of length $n$. Thus some lengths have zero strings, so it does not have exactly one string for every $n$.

Hence it satisfies property 3.\n\n- For $L_{D} = \\{ \\mathrm{bin}(i) \\mid i \\in U \\}$: For length $n$, the strings correspond to $\\mathrm{bin}(i)$ with $i \\in [2^{n-1}, 2^{n}-1] \\cap U$, and the count can be zero, one, or many, so it does not guarantee exactly one per length. Hence it fails property 3.\n\n- For $L_{E} = \\{ 0^{n}1^{n} \\mid n \\in U \\}$: For odd lengths there are no strings, and for even lengths there is at most one, so it fails property 3.\n\nThus only $L_{C}$ satisfies the one-per-length property.\n\nNow verify the remaining two properties for $L_{C}$:\n\nUndecidability of $L_{C}$: Define the total computable mapping $f \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0,1\\}^{*}$ by $f(n) = 1^{n}$.

Therefore $L_{C}$ is undecidable.\n\nMembership of $L_{C}$ in P/poly: For each input length $n$, there is exactly one string $s_{n} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n}$ that belongs to $L_{C}$; it is either $1^{n}$ or $0^{n}$. A nonuniform circuit for length $n$ can hardwire $s_{n}$ and implement an equality test that accepts exactly when the input equals $s_{n}$. This requires $O(n)$ size, thus polynomial in $n$.
