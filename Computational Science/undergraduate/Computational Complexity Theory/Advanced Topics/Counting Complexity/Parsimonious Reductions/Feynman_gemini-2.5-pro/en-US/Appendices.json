We will establish a direct, one-to-one correspondence between the set of all matchings in a graph $G$ and the set of all independent sets in its line graph $L(G)$.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, a key technique for relating the difficulty of counting problems is the parsimonious reduction. This type of reduction maps instances of one problem to instances of another in a way that preserves the number of solutions.\n\nConsider the following definitions from graph theory:\n- A **graph** $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, where each edge connects a pair of vertices.\n- A **matching** in a graph $G$ is a subset of its edges, $M \\subseteq E$, such that no two edges in $M$ share a common vertex.\n- An **independent set** in a graph $G$ is a subset of its vertices, $S \\subseteq V$, such that no two vertices in $S$ are connected by an edge.\n- The **line graph** of a graph $G$, denoted $L(G)$, is another graph constructed as follows: for each edge in $G$, there is a corresponding vertex in $L(G)$. Two vertices in $L(G)$ are connected by an edge if and only if their corresponding edges in $G$ share a common endpoint (i.e., are incident).\n\nLet $\\#\\text{Match}(G)$ denote the total number of distinct matchings in an arbitrary simple graph $G$. This count includes matchings of all possible sizes, from the empty matching (with zero edges) to the maximum possible matching. Similarly, let $\\#\\text{IndSet}(H)$ denote the total number of distinct independent sets in a graph $H$, including the empty set.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the universal relationship between the number of matchings in a graph $G$ and the number of independent sets in its line graph $L(G)$?\n\nA) $\\#\\text{Match}(G) = \\#\\text{IndSet}(L(G))$\n\nB) $\\#\\text{Match}(G) = 2 \\cdot \\#\\text{IndSet}(L(G))$\n\nC) $\\#\\text{Match}(G) = (\\#\\text{IndSet}(L(G)))^{2}$\n\nD) $\\#\\text{Match}(G) = \\#\\text{IndSet}(L(G)) + |V(G)|$, where $|V(G)|$ is the number of vertices in $G$.\n\nE) The relationship is not fixed and depends on the specific structure of $G$.",
            "solution": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph and let $L(G)$ denote its line graph. By definition of the line graph, there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between edges $e \\in E$ of $G$ and vertices $v_{e} \\in V(L(G))$, with adjacency in $L(G)$ given by\n$$\n\\{v_{e},v_{e'}\\} \\in E(L(G)) \\iff e \\text{ and } e' \\text{ share a common endpoint in } G.\n$$\nDefine the map $\\phi$ from subsets of $E$ to subsets of $V(L(G))$ by\n$$\n\\phi(M)=\\{v_{e} : e \\in M\\}.\n$$\nWe claim that $M \\subseteq E$ is a matching in $G$ if and only if $\\phi(M)$ is an independent set in $L(G)$. Indeed, by the definitions:\n- If $M$ is a matching, then for any distinct $e,e' \\in M$, the edges $e$ and $e'$ do not share an endpoint in $G$. Hence $v_{e}$ and $v_{e'}$ are not adjacent in $L(G)$, so $\\phi(M)$ is an independent set.\n- Conversely, if $\\phi(M)$ is an independent set in $L(G)$, then for any distinct $e,e' \\in M$, $v_{e}$ and $v_{e'}}$ are not adjacent in $L(G)$, which means $e$ and $e'$ do not share an endpoint in $G$. Thus $M$ is a matching.\n\nTherefore, the restriction of $\\phi$ to the family of matchings of $G$ is a bijection onto the family of independent sets of $L(G)$. This bijection also maps the empty matching to the empty independent set. Consequently, the total number of matchings in $G$ equals the total number of independent sets in $L(G)$:\n$$\n\\#\\text{Match}(G)=\\#\\text{IndSet}(L(G)).\n$$\nHence the universally correct statement is option A.",

It maps an instance of Problem A to an instance of Problem B such that the number of solutions for the original instance of A is exactly equal to the number of solutions for the resulting instance of B.\n\nConsider the counting problem `#SUBSET-SUM`, which is defined as follows: given a set of positive integers $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n\\}$ and a target integer $T$, find the number of distinct subsets of $S$ whose elements sum to exactly $T$.\n\nA parsimonious reduction exists from `#SUBSET-SUM` to the problem of counting paths in a specially constructed Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The procedure to construct this DAG, denoted $G=(V, E)$, from a given instance of `#SUBSET-SUM` (with set $S=\\{s_1, \\ldots, s_n\\}$ and target $T$) is as follows:\n\n1.  **Vertices**: The set of vertices $V$ consists of nodes labeled $v_{i,j}$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ where $0 \\le i \\le n$ and $0 \\le j \\le T$. The index $i$ represents having considered the first $i$ elements of the set $S$, and the index $j$ represents a possible accumulated sum.\n2.  **Source and Sink**: The source vertex is $s = v_{0,0}$, representing a sum of 0 before considering any elements. The sink vertex is $t = v_{n,T}$, representing a target sum of $T$ after considering all $n$ elements.\n3.  **Edges**: For each vertex $v_{i-1, j}$ where $1 \\le i \\le n$ and $0 \\le j \\le T$, we consider the element $s_i$ and create directed edges corresponding to the two choices for this element:\n    *   **Exclude**: An edge is created from $v_{i-1, j}$ to $v_{i, j}$.
