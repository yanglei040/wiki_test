This exercise connects the abstract algebraic formula for the permanent to a concrete, visual problem in graph theory—counting perfect matchings. By examining the simplest possible case, the identity matrix, you will build a foundational intuition for how the structure of a matrix corresponds to the connectivity of a graph and the number of ways its vertices can be perfectly paired.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the permanent of a matrix plays a crucial role. While its definition is similar to the determinant, its computation is known to be much harder. For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, the permanent is defined as:\n$$ \\text{perm}(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\prod_{i=1}^n A_{i, \\sigma(i)} $$\nwhere $S_n$ is the set of all permutations of the numbers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe permanent has a natural interpretation in graph theory. Given a bipartite graph $G = (U \\cup V, E)$ with partitions $U=\\{u_1, \\dots, u_n\\}$ and $V=\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$ of equal size, we can define its $n \\times n$ biadjacency matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}=1$ if an edge exists between $u_i$ and $v_j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. The value of $\\text{perm}(A)$ is equal to the number of perfect matchings in the graph $G$. A perfect matching is a set of $n$ edges where no two edges share a common vertex.\n\nConsider the specific case where the biadjacency matrix of a bipartite graph is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_n$. What is the value of the permanent of $I_n$, and what is the corresponding structure of the perfect matching(s) in the graph?\n\nA.

            "solution": "Start from the definition of the permanent. For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, the permanent is\n$$\n\\operatorname{perm}(A)=\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_{n}} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} A_{i,\\sigma(i)}.\n$$\nFor the identity matrix $I_{n}$, each entry is $A_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting $A_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$ gives\n$$\n\\operatorname{perm}(I_{n})=\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_{n}} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\delta_{i,\\sigma(i)}.\n$$\nFor any permutation $\\sigma \\in S_{n}$, the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\delta_{i,\\sigma(i)}$ equals $1$ if and only if $\\sigma(i)=i$ for all $i$, i.e., $\\sigma$ is the identity permutation; otherwise, there exists some $i$ with $\\sigma(i)\\neq i$, making at least one factor $\\delta_{i,\\sigma(i)}=0$, and hence the entire product is $0$. Therefore, exactly one term in the sum is $1$ (corresponding to the identity permutation), and all others are $0$, yielding\n$$\n\\operatorname{perm}(I_{n})=1.\n$$\nIn the bipartite graph interpretation, the biadjacency matrix $I_{n}$ means there is an edge only between $u_{i}$ and $v_{i}$ for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$. A perfect matching must include exactly one edge incident to each vertex; the only possibility is to take all edges $\\{(u_{i},v_{i}) : i=1,\\dots,n\\}$.

            "introduction": "Valiant's theorem famously establishes that computing the permanent is, in general, a computationally formidable task. However, a key principle in complexity theory is that restricting a problem's inputs can dramatically reduce its difficulty. This practice explores such a scenario, asking you to analyze the complexity of computing the permanent for a special class of matrices: triangular matrices. Resolving this will reveal why the general permanent problem is so hard, clarifying that the difficulty arises from combinatorial interactions, not the definition itself. ",

While the definition of the permanent is similar to that of the determinant, its computational properties are vastly different. Valiant's theorem states that the general problem of computing the permanent is #P-complete, meaning it is among the hardest counting problems.\n\nNow, consider a restricted version of this problem, which we will call TRI-PERM. In TRI-PERM, the input matrix $A$ is guaranteed to be an upper triangular matrix. An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is upper triangular if all of its entries below the main diagonal are zero; that is, $a_{ij} = 0$ for all pairs of indices $(i, j)$ where $i > j$.\n\nGiven your understanding of computational complexity, which of the following classes best classifies the TRI-PERM problem? Assume familiarity with the definitions of standard complexity classes.\n\nA. P\n\nB. NP-complete\n\nC. #P-complete\n\nD. L (Logarithmic Space)\n\nE. PSPACE-complete",
            "solution": "We recall the definition of the permanent:\n$$\n\\operatorname{perm}(A)=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_{n}}\\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_{i,\\sigma(i)}.\n$$\nSuppose $A$ is upper triangular, so $a_{ij}=0$ whenever $i>j$. Consider any permutation $\\sigma\\in S_{n}$. If there exists an index $i$ such that $\\sigma(i)<i$, then $a_{i,\\sigma(i)}=0$ by the upper triangularity of $A$, and hence the corresponding product term $\\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_{i,\\sigma(i)}$ equals $0$. Therefore, only those permutations with $\\sigma(i)\\geq i$ for all $i$ can contribute nonzero terms.\n\nWe now show that the only permutation satisfying $\\sigma(i)\\geq i$ for all $i$ is the identity permutation. Indeed, summing the inequalities gives\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma(i)\\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{n}i.\n$$\nBut since $\\sigma$ is a permutation of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, we have\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma(i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}i.\n$$\nThus equality must hold in each inequality $\\sigma(i)\\geq i$, implying $\\sigma(i)=i$ for all $i$. Therefore, only the identity permutation contributes, and hence\n$$\n\\operatorname{perm}(A)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}.\n$$\n\nConsequently, TRI-PERM reduces to computing the product of the $n$ diagonal entries. This can be done by a straightforward algorithm that reads the diagonal entries and multiplies them, which runs in time polynomial in the input size. Hence TRI-PERM is in class P. (In fact, it can be computed even more efficiently in very low resource classes, but among the provided options, the appropriate classification is P.)",
