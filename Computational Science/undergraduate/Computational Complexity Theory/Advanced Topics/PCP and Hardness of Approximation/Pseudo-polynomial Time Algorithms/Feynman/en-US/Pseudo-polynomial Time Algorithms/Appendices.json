            "introduction": "Often, a complex-sounding problem is a classic computational challenge in disguise. This first exercise asks you to partition a set of masses based on a differential constraint, a scenario that initially seems unique . The key to solving this is to translate the problem's requirements into algebraic relationships, which elegantly reduces it to the famous Subset Sum problem, a foundational case study for pseudo-polynomial time algorithms. This practice hones your ability to look past narrative details and identify the underlying mathematical structure of a problem.",

            "problem": "A deep-space observation mission is mapping a newly discovered system of rogue planets. For navigational stability, the probe's guidance system requires a precise gravitational balance. The planets, with known integer masses, must be partitioned into two conceptual groups, Group A and Group B. The stability requirement is that the absolute difference between the total mass of Group A and the total mass of Group B must be exactly equal to a given differential parameter, $D$.\n\nYou are given the set of planet masses, $M = \\{3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18\\}$, and the required mass differential, $D = 4$.\n\nIf it is possible to partition the set of planets $M$ into two such groups, determine the total mass of the group with the smaller total mass. If no such partition exists, your answer should be -1.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a partition of the set of masses $M$ into two disjoint subsets, let's call them $A$ and $B$, such that they cover all of $M$ ($A \\cup B = M$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$). Let $S_A$ be the sum of masses in group $A$, and $S_B$ be the sum of masses in group $B$. The condition is that $|S_A - S_B| = D$. We need to find $\\min(S_A, S_B)$ if such a partition exists, otherwise return -1.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between $S_A$, $S_B$, the total sum of masses, and the difference $D$.\nLet $S_{total}$ be the sum of all masses in $M$.\n$$S_{total} = \\sum_{m \\in M} m = S_A + S_B$$\n\nWe are given the condition $|S_A - S_B| = D$. This implies two possibilities:\n1. $S_A - S_B = D$\n2. $S_B - S_A = D$\n\nLet's analyze the first case, $S_A - S_B = D$. We have a system of two linear equations:\n(i) $S_A + S_B = S_{total}$\n(ii) $S_A - S_B = D$\n\nAdding (i) and (ii) gives $2S_A = S_{total} + D$, which means $S_A = \\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$.\nSubtracting (ii) from (i) gives $2S_B = S_{total} - D$, which means $S_B = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\n\nIf we analyzed the second case ($S_B - S_A = D$), we would find the same two values for the sums, just assigned to the opposite groups: $S_B = \\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$ and $S_A = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\n\nIn any valid partition, the sums of the two groups must be $\\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$ and $\\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\nThe group with the smaller total mass will have a sum of $S_{small} = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$, provided a valid partition exists.\n\nBefore proceeding, we must check if a solution is even possible. Since the masses are integers, the sums $S_A$ and $S_B$ must be integers. This imposes two conditions:\na) $S_{total} - D$ must be non-negative, which means $S_{total} \\ge D$.\nb) $S_{total} + D$ (and $S_{total} - D$) must be an even number. This is true if and only if $S_{total}$ and $D$ have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).\n\nLet's apply this to the given values:\n$M = \\{3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18\\}$\n$D = 4$\n\nFirst, calculate $S_{total}$:\n$S_{total} = 3 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 15 + 18 = 80$.\n\nNow, check the feasibility conditions:\na) Is $S_{total} \\ge D$? $80 \\ge 4$. Yes.\nb) Do $S_{total}$ and $D$ have the same parity? $S_{total} = 80$ is even, and $D = 4$ is even. Yes.\nSince the conditions are met, a solution might exist.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding if there exists a subset of $M$ whose elements sum to one of the target values. Let's calculate the smaller sum:\n$$S_{small} = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2} = \\frac{80 - 4}{2} = \\frac{76}{2} = 38$$\n\nSo, the original problem is equivalent to the following: Does there exist a subset of $M$ that sums to exactly 38? This is a classic instance of the Subset Sum Problem. If such a subset exists, the answer is 38. If not, the answer is -1.\n\nWe can solve the Subset Sum Problem using dynamic programming. Let's define a boolean array `dp` of size $S_{small} + 1$, where `dp[j]` is true if a sum of `j` can be formed using a subset of the masses from $M$, and false otherwise. The array is indexed from 0 to 38.\n\nWe initialize `dp[0] = true` (an empty set has a sum of 0) and all other `dp[j] = false`.\nThen, we iterate through each mass $m$ in the set $M$. For each mass, we update the `dp` array. To avoid using the same mass multiple times in a single subset, we iterate the sum `j` downwards from $S_{small}$ to $m$:\nFor each $m \\in M$:\n  For `j` from $S_{small}$ down to $m$:\n    `dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - m]`\n\nLet's trace this for our set $M$ and target sum 38.\n`dp` has size 39. `dp[0]=true`.\nReachable sums start as `{0}`.\n\n- For $m=3$: New reachable sums are `{3}`. Total reachable: `{0, 3}`.\n- For $m=5$: New reachable sums `{0+5, 3+5}` = `{5, 8}`. Total: `{0, 3, 5, 8}`.\n- For $m=6$: New reachable sums `{0+6, 3+6, 5+6, 8+6}` = `{6, 9, 11, 14}`. Total: `{0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14}`.\n- For $m=8$: New sums from previous totals: `{8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22}`. Total reachable (unioned and sorted): `{0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22}`.\n- For $m=11$: New sums include $22+11=33$, $19+11=30$, $17+11=28$, $16+11=27$, $14+11=25$, $13+11=24$, `...`.\n- For $m=14$: We check if a sum $j-14$ was previously possible. For our target $j=38$, we check `dp[38-14] = dp[24]`. Was a sum of 24 possible with the masses processed so far: `{3, 5, 6, 8, 11}`? Let's check: $5+8+11 = 24$. Yes. Since `dp[24]` would be true, processing $m=14$ would make `dp[38]` true (`dp[38] = dp[38] or dp[24]`).\n\nSince we have found that a sum of 24 is possible with the subset `{5, 8, 11}`, by including the mass 14, we can form the sum $24 + 14 = 38$ with the subset `{5, 8, 11, 14}`.\nTherefore, `dp[38]` is true.\n\nA partition that satisfies the condition exists. The smaller of the two subset sums is 38.\nThe two subsets are:\n- $A = \\{5, 8, 11, 14\\}$ with sum $S_A = 38$.\n- $B = \\{3, 6, 15, 18\\}$ with sum $S_B = 42$.\nThe absolute difference is $|S_A - S_B| = |38 - 42| = 4$, which matches the required differential $D$.\nThe smaller sum is 38.",

The security of the protocol relies on the difficulty of finding a subset of $S$ whose elements multiply to a secret target value, $P$.

The steps are as follows:\n1.

The mission is to travel from the starting system, node `S`, to the destination system, node `T`.\n\nEach stargate jump, represented by a directed edge from a node `U` to a node `V`, has two associated integer properties:\n1.
