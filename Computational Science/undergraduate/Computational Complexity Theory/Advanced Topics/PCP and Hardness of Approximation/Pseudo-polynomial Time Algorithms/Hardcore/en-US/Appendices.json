            "problem": "A network engineer is configuring a traffic-shaping policy for a core router. The router has a staging buffer designed to hold a batch of data packets before forwarding. To prevent bufferbloat and ensure low latency, a rule is implemented: the total size of any single batch of packets must be strictly less than the buffer's total capacity. The buffer has a total capacity of $W = 50$ kilobytes (KB).\n\nAt a certain moment, there is a set of five incoming data packets with the following sizes in KB: $\\{10, 15, 22, 27, 34\\}$. The engineer needs to select a subset of these packets to form a batch for immediate forwarding. The goal is to maximize the total size of the selected packets in the batch, subject to the constraint that this total size must be strictly less than the buffer capacity $W$. Each packet can either be included in the batch in its entirety or not at all; it cannot be fragmented.\n\nWhat is the maximum total size of a batch of packets that can be created from the given set, adhering to the specified constraint?

The key to this gravitational balancing puzzle  lies in a clever algebraic insight that transforms the problem of partitioning a set into an equivalent Subset Sum problem. This demonstrates a crucial skill in algorithm design: reducing an unfamiliar problem to a known, solvable one.",

            "problem": "A deep-space observation mission is mapping a newly discovered system of rogue planets. For navigational stability, the probe's guidance system requires a precise gravitational balance. The planets, with known integer masses, must be partitioned into two conceptual groups, Group A and Group B. The stability requirement is that the absolute difference between the total mass of Group A and the total mass of Group B must be exactly equal to a given differential parameter, $D$.\n\nYou are given the set of planet masses, $M = \\{3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18\\}$, and the required mass differential, $D = 4$.\n\nIf it is possible to partition the set of planets $M$ into two such groups, determine the total mass of the group with the smaller total mass. If no such partition exists, your answer should be -1.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a partition of the set of masses $M$ into two disjoint subsets, let's call them $A$ and $B$, such that they cover all of $M$ ($A \\cup B = M$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$). Let $S_A$ be the sum of masses in group $A$, and $S_B$ be the sum of masses in group $B$. The condition is that $|S_A - S_B| = D$. We need to find $\\min(S_A, S_B)$ if such a partition exists, otherwise return -1.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between $S_A$, $S_B$, the total sum of masses, and the difference $D$.\nLet $S_{total}$ be the sum of all masses in $M$.\n$S_{total} = \\sum_{m \\in M} m = S_A + S_B$.\n\nWe are given the condition $|S_A - S_B| = D$. This implies two possibilities:\n1. $S_A - S_B = D$\n2. $S_B - S_A = D$\n\nLet's analyze the first case, $S_A - S_B = D$. We have a system of two linear equations:\n(i) $S_A + S_B = S_{total}$\n(ii) $S_A - S_B = D$\n\nAdding (i) and (ii) gives $2S_A = S_{total} + D$, which means $S_A = \\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$.\nSubtracting (ii) from (i) gives $2S_B = S_{total} - D$, which means $S_B = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\n\nIf we analyzed the second case ($S_B - S_A = D$), we would find the same two values for the sums, just assigned to the opposite groups: $S_B = \\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$ and $S_A = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\n\nIn any valid partition, the sums of the two groups must be $\\frac{S_{total} + D}{2}$ and $\\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$.\nThe group with the smaller total mass will have a sum of $S_{small} = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2}$, provided a valid partition exists.\n\nBefore proceeding, we must check if a solution is even possible. Since the masses are integers, the sums $S_A$ and $S_B$ must be integers. This imposes two conditions:\na) $S_{total} - D$ must be non-negative, which means $S_{total} \\ge D$.\nb) $S_{total} + D$ (and $S_{total} - D$) must be an even number. This is true if and only if $S_{total}$ and $D$ have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).\n\nLet's apply this to the given values:\n$M = \\{3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18\\}$\n$D = 4$\n\nFirst, calculate $S_{total}$:\n$S_{total} = 3 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 15 + 18 = 80$.\n\nNow, check the feasibility conditions:\na) Is $S_{total} \\geq D$? $80 \\geq 4$. Yes.\nb) Do $S_{total}$ and $D$ have the same parity? $S_{total} = 80$ is even, and $D = 4$ is even. Yes.\nSince the conditions are met, a solution might exist.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding if there exists a subset of $M$ whose elements sum to one of the target values. Let's calculate the smaller sum:\n$S_{small} = \\frac{S_{total} - D}{2} = \\frac{80 - 4}{2} = \\frac{76}{2} = 38$.\n\nSo, the original problem is equivalent to the following: Does there exist a subset of $M$ that sums to exactly 38? This is a classic instance of the Subset Sum Problem. If such a subset exists, the answer is 38. If not, the answer is -1.\n\nWe can solve the Subset Sum Problem using dynamic programming. Let's define a boolean array `dp` of size $S_{small} + 1$, where `dp[j]` is true if a sum of `j` can be formed using a subset of the masses from $M$, and false otherwise. The array is indexed from 0 to 38.\n\nWe initialize `dp[0] = true` (an empty set has a sum of 0) and all other `dp[j] = false`.\nThen, we iterate through each mass $m$ in the set $M$. For each mass, we update the `dp` array. To avoid using the same mass multiple times in a single subset, we iterate the sum `j` downwards from $S_{small}$ to $m$:\nFor each $m \\in M$:\n  For $j$ from $S_{small}$ down to $m$:\n    `dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - m]`\n\nLet's trace this for our set $M$ and target sum 38.\n`dp` has size 39. `dp[0]=true`.\nReachable sums start as `{0}`.\n\n- For $m=3$: New reachable sums are `{3}`. Total reachable: `{0, 3}`.\n- For $m=5$: New reachable sums `{0+5, 3+5}` = `{5, 8}`. Total: `{0, 3, 5, 8}`.\n- For $m=6$: New reachable sums `{0+6, 3+6, 5+6, 8+6}` = `{6, 9, 11, 14}`. Total: `{0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14}`.\n- For $m=8$: New sums from previous totals: `{8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22}`. Total reachable (unioned and sorted): `{0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22}`.\n- For $m=11$: New sums include `22+11=33`, `19+11=30`, `17+11=28`, `16+11=27`, `14+11=25`, `13+11=24`, `...`.\n- For $m=14$: We check if a sum $j-14$ was previously possible. For our target $j=38$, we check `dp[38-14] = dp[24]`. Was a sum of 24 possible with the masses processed so far: `{3, 5, 6, 8, 11}`? Let's check: $5+8+11 = 24$. Yes. Since `dp[24]` would be true, processing $m=14$ would make `dp[38]` true (`dp[38] = dp[38] or dp[24]`).\n\nSince we have found that a sum of 24 is possible with the subset `{5, 8, 11}`, by including the mass 14, we can form the sum $24 + 14 = 38$ with the subset `{5, 8, 11, 14}`.\nTherefore, `dp[38]` is true.\n\nA partition that satisfies the condition exists. The smaller of the two subset sums is 38.\nThe two subsets are:\n- $A = \\{5, 8, 11, 14\\}$ with sum $S_A = 38$.\n- $B = \\{3, 6, 15, 18\\}$ with sum $S_B = 42$.\nThe absolute difference is $|S_A - S_B| = |38 - 42| = 4$, which matches the required differential $D$.\nThe smaller sum is 38.",
