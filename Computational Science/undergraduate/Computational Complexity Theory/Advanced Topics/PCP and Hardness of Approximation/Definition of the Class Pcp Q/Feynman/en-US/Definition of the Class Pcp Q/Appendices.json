This first exercise bridges the gap between the well-known complexity class NP and the definition of a Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP). By thinking about a standard NP verifier as a \"naive\" PCP verifier that simply reads an entire certificate, you will see how NP naturally fits into the PCP framework and gain a concrete understanding of the randomness ($r(n)$) and query ($q(n)$) complexity parameters.

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, a Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP) system for a language $L$ provides a method for verifying a proof that a given string $x$ belongs to $L$. A verifier in such a system is a probabilistic algorithm that has access to the input string $x$ and a separate proof string $\\pi$. The complexity of the verifier is measured by its randomness complexity $r(n)$ and its query complexity $q(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input $x$. The function $r(n)$ represents the number of random bits the verifier uses, and $q(n)$ represents the number of bits it reads from the proof string $\\pi$. The class of all languages that have a PCP system with these parameters is denoted PCP($r(n), q(n)$).\n\nConsider a specific type of PCP verifier designed for a class of problems. For any given input of size $n$, this verifier operates as follows:\n1.  It uses exactly $\\log_2 n$ random bits. These bits are used to uniquely and uniformly select an index from a set of $n$ possible starting locations within the proof string.\n2.  After selecting a starting location, the verifier reads a sequence of $c$ bits from the proof string, where $c$ is a fixed positive integer constant that does not depend on $n$.\n3.  The verifier then makes its decision to accept or reject based solely on the $c$ bits it has read.\n\nAccording to the celebrated PCP theorem, which relates such proof systems to standard complexity classes, the class of all languages that can be decided by a verifier with the behavior described above is equivalent to one of the following well-known complexity classes.

The collection of languages decidable by such verifiers is, by definition, $\\mathrm{PCP}(\\log_{2} n, c)$.\n\nBy the PCP theorem, there exist absolute constants $c_{0},d_{0}>0$ such that\n$$\n\\mathrm{NP}=\\mathrm{PCP}(d_{0}\\log_{2} n, c_{0}).\n$$\nIn particular, $\\mathrm{NP}\\subseteq \\mathrm{PCP}(O(\\log n),O(1))$ and, conversely, $\\mathrm{PCP}(O(\\log n),O(1))\\subseteq \\mathrm{NP}$.

Because the verifier selects one of $n$ starting positions and reads $c$ bits from each, the total set of queried positions over all random strings has size at most $n\\cdot c$, so the portion of $\\pi$ relevant to verification has length $O(n)$ and can be guessed in polynomial time. The algorithm then deterministically simulates the verifier on all $R(n)=n$ random strings, counting the number of accepting outcomes. It accepts if and only if at least $a\\cdot R(n)$ of these simulations accept. Each simulation uses time polynomial in $n$, and there are $n$ simulations, so the total deterministic verification time is polynomial in $n$.

Adjusting constant factors and bases of the logarithm only changes $d_{0}$ and $c_{0}$ by constants, so the given form with exactly $\\log_{2} n$ random bits and a constant number of queries is covered.\n\nCombining both directions, the class of languages decidable by the described verifier is exactly $\\mathrm{NP}$.
