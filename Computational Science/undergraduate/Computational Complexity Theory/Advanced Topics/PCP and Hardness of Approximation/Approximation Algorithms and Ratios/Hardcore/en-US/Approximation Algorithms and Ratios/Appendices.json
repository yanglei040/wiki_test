            "problem": "In computational optimization, many problems are so difficult that finding the absolute best solution is thought to be computationally infeasible. For such problems, computer scientists develop approximation algorithms. For a minimization problem, an algorithm is said to be a $\\rho$-approximation algorithm if, for any input instance, the cost of the solution it produces, $C_{alg}$, is guaranteed to be no more than $\\rho$ times the cost of the true optimal solution, $C_{opt}$. That is, $C_{alg} \\leq \\rho \\cdot C_{opt}$. The value $\\rho \\geq 1$ is called the approximation ratio.\n\nA software company is working on a complex network routing minimization problem. They have developed two different heuristic algorithms:\n1.  Algorithm `Alpha`, which is a $2$-approximation algorithm.\n2.  Algorithm `Beta`, which is a $3$-approximation algorithm.\n\nAn engineer proposes a new hybrid strategy: for any given routing problem, run both `Alpha` and `Beta` independently and then select the solution that has the lower cost. Let's call this new algorithm `Hybrid`.\n\nWhat is the tightest (smallest) approximation ratio that can be guaranteed for the `Hybrid` algorithm across all possible problem instances?\n\nA. $1.5$\n\nB. $2$\n\nC. $2.5$\n\nD. $3$\n\nE. $5$",
            "solution": "Let $C_{\\text{opt}}$ denote the optimal cost for an instance. Let $C_{\\alpha}$ and $C_{\\beta}$ be the costs returned by algorithms Alpha and Beta, respectively. By their guarantees,\n$$\nC_{\\alpha} \\leq 2\\,C_{\\text{opt}}, \\qquad C_{\\beta} \\leq 3\\,C_{\\text{opt}}.\n$$\nThe Hybrid algorithm returns\n$$\nC_{\\text{H}}=\\min\\{C_{\\alpha},C_{\\beta}\\}.\n$$\nUsing the bounds,\n$$\nC_{\\text{H}} \\leq \\min\\{2\\,C_{\\text{opt}},3\\,C_{\\text{opt}}\\}=2\\,C_{\\text{opt}}.\n$$\nTherefore, Hybrid is a $2$-approximation algorithm, so its approximation ratio is at most $2$.\n\nTo see tightness, suppose there exists an instance on which Alpha attains its worst-case bound, i.e., $C_{\\alpha}=2\\,C_{\\text{opt}}$, and Beta is no better on that instance, i.e., $C_{\\beta} \\geq 2\\,C_{\\text{opt}}$. Then\n$$\nC_{\\text{H}}=\\min\\{C_{\\alpha},C_{\\beta}\\}=2\\,C_{\\text{opt}}.\n$$\nHence no guarantee strictly better than $2$ can hold across all instances.

Several technology companies have submitted proposals. Each proposal covers a specific subset of landmarks, and all proposals are considered to have an equal cost. The city wants to accept the minimum number of proposals to achieve full coverage. This is an instance of the Set Cover problem.\n\nThe universe of landmarks to be covered is $U = \\{L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5, L_6, L_7\\}$.\n\nThere are five proposals available, from companies Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon.

            "problem": "A large tech company is designing a deployment strategy for its new Content Delivery Network (CDN). The goal is to place caching servers in various cities to serve users with minimal total cost. The problem is modeled as an instance of the uncapacitated facility location problem.\n\nThere is a set of $n$ distinct cities, indexed from $1$ to $n$. The company can choose to build a server (a \"facility\") in any of these cities. The users of the CDN are also located within these same $n$ cities (the \"clients\").\n\nThe cost structure is as follows:\n- The cost to build and operate a server in any city $i$ is a fixed, uniform amount $S  0$.\n- The cost to connect users in city $j$ to a server in city $i$ is given by a connection cost $d_{ij} \\ge 0$. These connection costs represent network latency and are symmetric ($d_{ij} = d_{ji}$). They also satisfy the triangle inequality: for any three cities $i, j, k$, the inequality $d_{ik} \\le d_{ij} + d_{jk}$ holds. Note that the connection cost from a city to itself is $d_{ii} = 0$.\n\nThe total cost is the sum of all server opening costs plus the sum of connection costs for all $n$ cities. Each city must be served by exactly one server, and it is always assigned to the nearest open server to minimize its connection cost.\n\nA junior engineer proposes a very simple strategy called the \"Full Decentralization\" approach: build a server in every one of the $n$ cities.\n\nYour task is to determine the tightest possible worst-case approximation ratio for this \"Full Decentralization\" strategy. The approximation ratio is defined as the maximum possible value of the ratio $\\frac{\\text{Cost of Full Decentralization}}{\\text{Cost of Optimal Solution}}$ over all possible valid problem instances (i.e., all valid choices of connection costs $d_{ij}$ satisfying the problem constraints).\n\nExpress your answer as a function of $n$, the number of cities.",
