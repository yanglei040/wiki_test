The goal is to maximize the total \"importance\" of the packets without exceeding the transmission buffer's capacity. To do this efficiently, the engineer uses a specific instance of a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that works by scaling down the importance values.\n\nThe steps of the value scaling algorithm are defined as follows:\n1.  You are given a set of $n$ items, where each item $i$ has a weight $w_i$ and a value $v_i$. You are also given a total weight capacity $W$ and an error tolerance parameter $\\epsilon$.\n2.  First, identify the maximum value among all items, $V_{\\text{max}} = \\max_i(v_i)$.\n3.  Calculate a scaling factor $K = \\frac{\\epsilon V_{\\text{max}}}{n}$.\n4.  For each item $i$, create a new scaled value $v'_i = \\lfloor \\frac{v_i}{K} \\rfloor$, where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the floor function. The original weights $w_i$ are kept.\n5.  Using dynamic programming, determine for every possible total scaled value $V'$ the minimum total weight required to achieve it. Let's denote this as $W_{\\text{min}}(V')$.\n6.  From all achievable scaled values $V'$, find the largest one, let's call it $V'_{\\text{best}}$, for which the corresponding minimum weight is within the capacity, i.e., $W_{\\text{min}}(V'_{\\text{best}}) \\le W$.\n7.  Identify the combination of items that corresponds to achieving $V'_{\\text{best}}$ with weight $W_{\\text{min}}(V'_{\\text{best}})$ and calculate the sum of their **original** values. This sum is the result of the approximation.\n\nYou are given the following four data packets, with their size (weight) and importance score (value):\n-   Packet 1: size = 2, importance = 60\n-   Packet 2: size = 3, importance = 70\n-   Packet 3: size = 4, importance = 90\n-   Packet 4: size = 5, importance = 120\n\nThe transmission buffer's capacity is $W = 8$.
