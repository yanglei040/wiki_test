            "problem": "Consider a computational problem called `ASYMMETRIC-2-SCHEDULING`. You are given a set of $n$ indivisible tasks, $T = \\{T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_n\\}$. Each task $T_i$ has an associated positive integer workload $w_i$. These tasks need to be scheduled on a system with two processors, $P_1$ and $P_2$. The processors are heterogeneous: processor $P_1$ has a processing speed of $v$, while processor $P_2$ is twice as fast, with a speed of $2v$. The time required to execute a task with workload $w$ on a processor with speed $s$ is $w/s$.\n\nThe `ASYMMETRIC-2-SCHEDULING` problem is to determine if it is possible to partition the set of tasks $T$ into two disjoint subsets, $T_1$ and $T_2$ (where $T_1$ is assigned to $P_1$ and $T_2$ is assigned to $P_2$), such that both processors finish their work at the exact same moment. Let $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$ be the total workload.\n\nBased on the principles of computational complexity theory, which of the following statements most accurately describes the `ASYMMETRIC-2-SCHEDULING` problem?\n\nA. The problem is solvable in polynomial time because the tasks can be sorted by workload and assigned using a greedy algorithm to the processor that will finish earlier.\n\nB. The problem is strongly NP-complete because it is a variant of the 3-PARTITION problem.\n\nC. The problem is weakly NP-complete because it can be solved by an algorithm with a time complexity that is polynomial in $n$ and $S$, but not necessarily polynomial in the input size.\n\nD. The problem is undecidable because for arbitrary integer workloads, it may be impossible to determine if a perfect partition exists.\n\nE. The problem is solvable in polynomial time because it can be transformed into checking if the total workload $S$ is divisible by 3.",
            "solution": "Let $T=\\{T_{1},\\ldots,T_{n}\\}$ be tasks with integer workloads $w_{i}>0$, and two processors $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ with speeds $v$ and $2v$, respectively. If a subset $T_{1}$ is assigned to $P_{1}$ and its complement $T_{2}$ to $P_{2}$, the finishing times are\n$$\n\\text{time}(P_{1})=\\frac{\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{1}}w_{i}}{v},\\qquad \\text{time}(P_{2})=\\frac{\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{2}}w_{i}}{2v}.\n$$\nRequiring equal finishing time gives\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{1}}w_{i}}{v}=\\frac{\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{2}}w_{i}}{2v}.\n$$\nLet $X=\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{1}}w_{i}$ and $Y=\\sum_{T_{i}\\in T_{2}}w_{i}$ with $X+Y=S=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}$.

This is a special case of SUBSET-SUM with target $S/3$.\n\nMembership in NP: a certificate is the subset achieving sum $S/3$, verifiable in time polynomial in $n$ and the input length.\n\nPseudo-polynomial algorithm: standard dynamic programming for SUBSET-SUM computes reachability of all sums up to $S$ in time $O(nS)$. Since this is polynomial in $n$ and $S$ (but not in the bit-length of the input, which is $O(n\\log S)$), the problem is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time.\n\nNP-hardness (weak): we reduce PARTITION to the $S/3$-target SUBSET-SUM. Let $A=\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}$ be a PARTITION instance with total sum $S_{A}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}$. First, if necessary, replace each $a_{i}$ by $2a_{i}$ so that $S_{A}$ is even; this preserves equivalence and increases bit-length by at most a constant factor. Define two additional items\n$$\np=S_{A}+1,\\qquad q=2p+\\frac{S_{A}}{2}.\n$$\nForm $B=A\\cup\\{p,q\\}$ with total sum $S' = S_{A}+p+q$. Then\n$$\n\\frac{S'}{3}=\\frac{S_{A}+p+q}{3}=\\frac{S_{A}+(S_{A}+1)+\\left(2(S_{A}+1)+\\frac{S_{A}}{2}\\right)}{3}=\\frac{3S_{A}}{2}+1,\n$$\nwhich is an integer because $S_{A}$ is even. We establish two key properties:\n1) $q>\\frac{S'}{3}$, since\n$$\nq-\\frac{S'}{3}=\\left(\\frac{5S_{A}}{2}+2\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3S_{A}}{2}+1\\right)=S_{A}+1>0,\n$$\nso $q$ cannot be included in any subset summing to $\\frac{S'}{3}$.\n2) $\\frac{S'}{3}>S_{A}$, since\n$$\n\\frac{S'}{3}-S_{A}=\\frac{3S_{A}}{2}+1-S_{A}=\\frac{S_{A}}{2}+1>0,\n$$\nso no subset of $A$ alone can reach $\\frac{S'}{3}$; thus any valid subset must include $p$.\n\nTherefore any subset of $B$ summing to $\\frac{S'}{3}$ must include $p$ and exclude $q$, and its remaining sum from $A$ must be exactly\n$$\n\\frac{S'}{3}-p=\\left(\\frac{3S_{A}}{2}+1\\right)-(S_{A}+1)=\\frac{S_{A}}{2}.\n$$\nHence, $B$ has a subset summing to $\\frac{S'}{3}$ if and only if $A$ has a subset summing to $\\frac{S_{A}}{2}$, i.e., if and only if the PARTITION instance is a yes-instance. This is a polynomial-time many-one reduction, and the sizes of $p$ and $q$ are $O(S_{A})$, whose binary lengths are $O(\\log S_{A})$, polynomial in the input size.\n\nConsequently, deciding whether there exists a subset summing to $S/3$ (and therefore the given scheduling problem) is NP-complete, but only weakly, because of the pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithm. Therefore, among the choices, the correct classification is that the problem is weakly NP-complete.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is false: greedy list scheduling does not decide exact equality of finishing times.\n- B is false: strong NP-completeness would preclude a pseudo-polynomial algorithm, but one exists.\n- C is true: the problem is weakly NP-complete; it is solvable in time polynomial in $n$ and $S$.\n- D is false: the problem is decidable and in NP.\n- E is false: divisibility of $S$ by $3$ is necessary but far from sufficient.\n\nTherefore the correct choice is C.",

An instance of a problem is in the PBM case if the degree of every polynomial is bounded by a fixed constant, and all numerical values given in the input (i.e., all coefficients of all polynomials, as well as the integer $r$) are bounded in absolute value by some polynomial function of $N$, the total number of polynomials.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the computational complexity of the PBM versions of these two problems?

            "solution": "We analyze both PBM problems by first reducing the polynomial inputs to integer values and then using known complexity facts about subset-sum-type and 3-partition-type problems under polynomial bounds.\n\nFor each polynomial $p_i(x)$ of degree at most a fixed constant $d$, write $p_i(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d} a_{ik} x^{k}$ with all coefficients $a_{ik} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In the PBM case there exists a polynomial $q$ such that $|a_{ik}| \\leq q(N)$ for all $i,k$ and $|r| \\leq q(N)$, and $d$ is a constant independent of $N$. Define $v_i = p_i(r)$.

Hence there exists a polynomial $Q$ such that $|v_i| \\leq Q(N)$ for all $i$.\n\nProblem 1 (PZSS): After computing $v_i = p_i(r)$ in time polynomial in the input size by standard evaluation (e.g., Horner’s rule), the question becomes: does there exist a non-empty subset $I \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ such that $\\sum_{i \\in I} v_i = 0$? This is a special case of SUBSET SUM with target zero and integer inputs that may be positive or negative. Let $W = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |v_i|$. From $|v_i| \\leq Q(N)$ we have $W \\leq N Q(N)$, which is polynomial in $N$. A standard dynamic programming over all achievable sums in the integer interval $[-W, W]$ decides whether zero is achievable. To exclude the empty subset, one can initialize the DP without setting the empty sum as feasible or, equivalently, track whether at least one element is used. The DP has $O(N)$ stages and $O(W)$ states with $O(1)$ transition time per state, so it runs in $O(N W)$ time, which is polynomial in $N$ under PBM. Therefore, PZSS is solvable in polynomial time in the PBM case.\n\nProblem 2 (P3P): After computing $v_i = p_i(r)$ and $T = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{3n} v_i$ (assumed to be an integer), the question is whether the multiset $\\{v_1,\\dots,v_{3n}\\}$ can be partitioned into $n$ triples each summing to $T$. This is precisely the 3-PARTITION structure: partition into $n$ triples of equal sum. The classical 3-PARTITION problem is strongly NP-complete, which means it remains NP-complete even when all integers are bounded by a polynomial in the number of items. To reduce a strongly NP-complete instance of 3-PARTITION in the polynomially bounded regime to P3P under PBM, map each integer $a_i$ to a constant polynomial $p_i(x) = a_i$ and set $r = 0$. Then $v_i = p_i(0) = a_i$, and $T = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{3n} a_i$ equals the target sum per triple from the 3-PARTITION instance. All PBM conditions hold: degrees are zero, coefficients are the $a_i$ (polynomially bounded), and $r=0$. The P3P instance is a yes-instance if and only if the original 3-PARTITION instance is a yes-instance. Hence P3P remains NP-hard under PBM. P3P is in $NP$ because a partition certificate can be verified in polynomial time by summing each triple and checking equality to $T$. Therefore, P3P remains NP-complete in the PBM case.\n\nCombining both results, in the PBM case PZSS is in $P$, while P3P remains NP-complete. Hence the correct choice is B.",

The decision problem is therefore equivalent to: does there exist a non-empty proper subset with zero sum among the $a_{i}$.\n\nMembership in NP for Class 2 follows because, given a candidate subset $S_{1}$, we can compute $V_{1}$, $W_{1}$, $V$, $W$ in time polynomial in the input size and verify $V_{1} W = V W_{1}$ by integer arithmetic with polynomially many bits.\n\nClass 1 (polynomially bounded weights and values): Let $W = \\sum_{i} w_{i}$ and $V = \\sum_{i} v_{i}$.

Consider the following algebraic transformation. Given any multiset of positive integers $a_{1}, \\dots, a_{n}$, choose an integer $M$ strictly larger than $\\max_{i} a_{i}$ and define an instance of BALANCED_RATIO_PARTITION by setting, for each $i$,\n$$\nv_{i} := M - a_{i}, \\quad w_{i} := M + a_{i}.\n$$\nFor any subset $S_{1}$ of size $m$, let $A_{1} := \\sum_{i \\in S_{1}} a_{i}$ and let $A := \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$. Then\n$$\nV_{1} = m M - A_{1}, \\quad W_{1} = m M + A_{1}, \\quad V_{2} = (n - m) M - (A - A_{1}), \\quad W_{2} = (n - m) M + (A - A_{1}).\n$$\nThe ratio equality condition\n$$\n\\frac{V_{1}}{W_{1}} = \\frac{V_{2}}{W_{2}}\n$$\nis equivalent, by direct expansion and cancellation of the $M^{2}$ and lower-order mixed terms, to\n$$\nn A_{1} = m A \\quad \\iff \\quad \\frac{A_{1}}{m} = \\frac{A}{n}.\n$$\nThus BALANCED_RATIO_PARTITION on the constructed $(v_{i}, w_{i})$ is equivalent to the equal-average subset problem for the $a_{i}$, namely: does there exist a non-empty proper subset with average equal to the global average. The equal-average subset problem is NP-hard for general binary-encoded integers via standard reductions (for example, from PARTITION or from 3-PARTITION by a padding and base-amplification argument that fixes the subset size $m$ and forces $A_{1} = \\frac{m}{n} A$, which specializes to equal-sum when $m = \\frac{n}{2}$). Because the above mapping is computable in time polynomial in the input size and preserves solutions, BALANCED_RATIO_PARTITION is NP-hard for Class 2. Since verification is polynomial, the problem is NP-complete for Class 2.\n\nCombining these, the most accurate statement is that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for Class 1 instances but is NP-hard for Class 2 instances.\n\nTherefore the correct option is A.",
