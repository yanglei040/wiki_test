            "introduction": "The concept of a Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP) can seem abstract, but it begins with a very intuitive idea: performing a \"spot-check\" on a claimed solution. This exercise grounds the theory in the familiar context of the 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT) problem. By designing a simple verifier that only checks a single, randomly chosen clause of a formula, you will explore the fundamental trade-off of probabilistic verification and calculate the verifier's soundness error—the probability that it accepts an incorrect proof. This practice  provides a concrete first step into understanding how randomness and local checks can give powerful, albeit probabilistic, guarantees about global properties.",

            "problem": "A computer scientist is designing a simple probabilistic verifier to perform a \"spot check\" on claimed solutions to 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT) problems. A 3-SAT formula is a collection of $m$ clauses, where each clause is the logical OR of three literals (a variable or its negation). A claimed solution is an assignment of a boolean value (true/false) to each variable in the formula.\n\nThe verifier's protocol is as follows:\n1.  Select one of the $m$ clauses from the formula uniformly at random.\n2.  Read the assigned boolean values for the three variables appearing in the selected clause from the claimed solution.\n3.  If this assignment of values makes the clause true, the verifier outputs 'ACCEPT'. Otherwise, it outputs 'REJECT'.\n\nNow, consider a specific, large, and *unsatisfiable* 3-SAT formula. Since the formula is unsatisfiable, any claimed satisfying assignment must be false. An adversary provides a cleverly crafted assignment that, while not satisfying the whole formula, maximizes the number of satisfied clauses. For this particular formula, it is known that the maximum fraction of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by any single assignment is exactly $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nIf the verifier applies its spot-check protocol to this \"best possible\" but ultimately incorrect assignment, what is the probability that the verifier will be fooled and output 'ACCEPT'? Provide your answer as an exact fraction.",

For each clause $C_{i}$, define the indicator variable\n$$\nI_{i}(a)=\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if }C_{i}\\text{ is satisfied by }a,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe verifier outputs ACCEPT if and only if the randomly chosen clause is satisfied. Therefore, by the definition of expectation for a uniform choice over clauses,\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{ACCEPT}\\mid a)=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\frac{1}{m}\\,I_{i}(a)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}I_{i}(a).\n$$\nThe quantity $\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}I_{i}(a)$ is exactly the fraction of clauses satisfied by $a$. For the adversary’s optimal assignment $a^{\\ast}$ given in the problem, this fraction is $\\frac{7}{8}$.

            "introduction": "Many of the most powerful results in PCP theory stem from translating combinatorial problems into an algebraic framework. In this setting, proofs are often represented as functions over finite fields, and the verifier's job is to check if these functions have certain algebraic properties, like linearity. This exercise  introduces you to the foundational linearity test, a simple yet elegant protocol to check if a function $f$ satisfies the property $f(x) + f(y) = f(x+y)$ for random inputs. By analyzing a specific non-linear function, you will calculate both its distance from the class of linear functions and the probability that it passes the test, building crucial intuition for why these local algebraic checks are so effective.",
