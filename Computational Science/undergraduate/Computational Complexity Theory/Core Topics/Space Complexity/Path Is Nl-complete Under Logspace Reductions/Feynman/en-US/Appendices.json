A related problem is `AVOID-PATH`, which introduces an additional constraint.\n\nThe `AVOID-PATH` problem is defined as follows: Given a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, a start vertex $s \\in V$, a target vertex $t \\in V$, and a set of \"forbidden\" vertices $F \\subseteq V$, determine if there exists a path from $s$ to $t$ where every vertex on the path (including the start and end vertices, $s$ and $t$) is not in $F$.\n\n`AVOID-PATH` can be solved by transforming any instance of it into an equivalent instance of the standard `PATH` problem using a logspace reduction. Consider the following \"vertex-splitting\" reduction strategy:\n\nAn `AVOID-PATH` instance, described by the tuple $\\langle G=(V,E), s, t, F \\rangle$, is transformed into a `PATH` instance $\\langle G'=(V',E'), s', t' \\rangle$.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the `PATH` problem is a cornerstone for the complexity class NL. The `PATH` problem is formally defined as: Given a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, a start vertex $s \\in V$, and a target vertex $t \\in V$, determine if a path exists from $s$ to $t$.\n\nConsider a related problem, which we will call `ALTERNATING-BIPARTITE-PATH`. An instance of this problem is given by a tuple $(G, s, t, A, B)$, where $G=(V,E)$ is a directed graph, $s,t \\in V$ are start and target vertices, and $A,B \\subseteq V$ are two disjoint sets of vertices. A 'yes' instance is one for which there exists a path $P = (v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k)$ in $G$ that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n1. The path starts at $s$ and ends at $t$, i.e., $v_0 = s$ and $v_k = t$.\n2. All vertices along the path, including the endpoints, must belong to the union of the sets $A$ and $B$. That is, $\\{v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\subseteq A \\cup B$.\n3. The path must strictly alternate between vertices in set $A$ and set $B$. Formally, for each step $i \\in \\{0, \\ldots, k-1\\}$, if $v_i \\in A$ then $v_{i+1} \\in B$, and if $v_i \\in B$ then $v_{i+1} \\in A$.\n\nThe `ALTERNATING-BIPARTITE-PATH` problem can be solved by a log-space reduction to the `PATH` problem. The standard reduction involves constructing a new graph $G'=(V', E')$ where the vertices in $V'$ encode not only the position in the original graph $G$ but also whether that position conforms to being in set $A$ or set $B$.\n\nYou are given the following specific instance of `ALTERNATING-BIPARTITE-PATH`:\n- The vertex set is $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$.\n- The disjoint sets are $A = \\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$ and $B = \\{v_3, v_4\\}$.\n- The start vertex is $s = v_1$ and the target vertex is $t = v_2$.\n- The edge set is $E = \\{(v_1, v_3), (v_1, v_6), (v_2, v_4), (v_3, v_2), (v_3, v_5), (v_4, v_1), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_3), (v_6, v_2)\\}$.\n\nBy applying the standard log-space reduction described above, an instance of `PATH` on a new graph $G'=(V', E')$ is created. Calculate the number of vertices $(|V'|)$ and the number of edges $(|E'|)$ in this new graph $G'$. Present your answer as a pair $(|V'|, |E'|)$.",

The `ALTERNATING-BIPARTITE-PATH` problem has an additional constraint compared to `PATH`: the path must alternate between two sets of vertices, $A$ and $B$. To handle this constraint, we can build a new graph $G'$ whose vertices encode the state of being at a certain vertex in $G$ and belonging to a certain partition ($A$ or $B$).\n\nLet an instance of `ALTERNATING-BIPARTITE-PATH` be $(G=(V, E), s, t, A, B)$. The reduction constructs an instance of `PATH`, $(G'=(V', E'), s', t')$.\n\n**Construction of the new graph $G'$**\n\n1.  **Vertex Set $V'$**: The path in $G$ is constrained to vertices within $A \\cup B$. Therefore, we only need to consider these vertices. For each vertex $v \\in A \\cup B$, we create a \"stateful\" vertex in $G'$. We can represent a vertex in $V'$ as a pair $(v, S)$, where $v \\in A \\cup B$ and $S$ indicates which set ($A$ or $B$) the vertex $v$ belongs to.\n    This means the vertex set $V'$ is the union of two sets of nodes: one copy for vertices in $A$ and another for vertices in $B$.\n    $V' = \\{(v, \\text{'A'}) \\mid v \\in A\\} \\cup \\{(v, \\text{'B'}) \\mid v \\in B\\}$.\n    The total number of vertices in $V'$ is therefore $|V'| = |A| + |B|$.\n\n2.  **Edge Set $E'$**: An edge exists in $G'$ if it represents a valid step in an alternating path in $G$. A valid step from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ requires that $(u,v)$ is an edge in $E$ and that $u$ and $v$ are in different partitions ($A$ and $B$).\n    - If there is an edge $(u, v) \\in E$ where $u \\in A$ and $v \\in B$, we add a directed edge from $(u, \\text{'A'})$ to $(v, \\text{'B'})$ in $E'$.\n    - If there is an edge $(u, v) \\in E$ where $u \\in B$ and $v \\in A$, we add a directed edge from $(u, \\text{'B'})$ to $(v, \\text{'A'})$ in $E'$.\n    No other edges are created. This construction ensures that any path in $G'$ corresponds to a strictly alternating path in $G$.\n\n3.  **Start and Target Vertices $s'$ and $t'$**:\n    - The start vertex $s'$ is $(s, \\text{'A'})$ if $s \\in A$, or $(s, \\text{'B'})$ if $s \\in B$.\n    - The target vertex $t'$ is $(t, \\text{'A'})$ if $t \\in A$, or $(t, \\text{'B'})$ if $t \\in B$.\n    A path from $s'$ to $t'$ in $G'$ exists if and only if a valid alternating path from $s$ to $t$ exists in $G$.\n\n**Applying the construction to the given instance**\n\nThe given instance is:\n- $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$\n- $A = \\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$\n- $B = \\{v_3, v_4\\}$\n- $s = v_1$, $t = v_2$\n- $E = \\{(v_1, v_3), (v_1, v_6), (v_2, v_4), (v_3, v_2), (v_3, v_5), (v_4, v_1), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_3), (v_6, v_2)\\}$\n- The set of vertices allowed on the path is $A \\cup B = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$. Vertex $v_6$ is not in $A \\cup B$.\n\n**Calculating $|V'|$**\n\nThe number of vertices in $G'$ is the sum of the sizes of sets $A$ and $B$.\n$|A| = 3$\n$|B| = 2$\n$|V'| = |A| + |B| = 3 + 2 = 5$.\nThe vertices in $V'$ are $\\{(v_1, \\text{'A'}), (v_2, \\text{'A'}), (v_5, \\text{'A'}), (v_3, \\text{'B'}), (v_4, \\text{'B'}) \\}$.\n\n**Calculating $|E'|**\n\nWe iterate through each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ and check if it contributes an edge to $E'$. An edge contributes if $u, v \\in A \\cup B$ and they are in different sets.\n\n1.  $(v_1, v_3)$: $v_1 \\in A$, $v_3 \\in B$. This creates an edge $((v_1, \\text{'A'}), (v_3, \\text{'B'}))$. (1)\n2.  $(v_1, v_6)$: $v_6 \\notin A \\cup B$. This edge is ignored.\n3.  $(v_2, v_4)$: $v_2 \\in A$, $v_4 \\in B$. This creates an edge $((v_2, \\text{'A'}), (v_4, \\text{'B'}))$.

This edge is ignored.\n\nCounting the created edges, we find there are 7 edges in $E'$.\n$|E'| = 7$.\n\nThe resulting pair is $(|V'|, |E'|) = (5, 7)$.",

The PATH problem asks whether a directed graph $G$ contains a path between two specified vertices, $s$ and $t$. The complexity class NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space) consists of all decision problems that can be solved by a Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM) using a work tape of size logarithmic in the length of the input.\n\nTo prove that PATH is NL-hard, one must show that for any language $L \\in \\text{NL}$, there is a logspace reduction from $L$ to PATH. The standard proof proceeds as follows: Let $L$ be a language in NL, decided by a logspace NTM $M$. For any input string $w$, a logspace transducer constructs a \"configuration graph\" $G_M(w)$. The vertices of this graph represent all possible configurations of the machine $M$ on input $w$. A directed edge exists from configuration $C_1$ to $C_2$ if and only if $M$ can transition from $C_1$ to $C_2$ in a single computation step. The problem of determining if $w \\in L$ is then equivalent to determining if there is a path in $G_M(w)$ from the initial configuration $C_{start}$ to the unique accepting configuration $C_{accept}$.\n\nNow, consider a student, Alice, who implements a logspace transducer to perform this reduction. Her transducer has a subtle bug. For any given input $w$ to an NTM $M$:\n- It correctly generates the set of all possible configurations as vertices.\n- It correctly identifies the $C_{start}$ and $C_{accept}$ vertices.\n- However, when generating the edges, if the set of all valid single-step machine transitions is non-empty, her transducer consistently omits exactly one valid transition from the final graph representation. The specific edge that is omitted can differ depending on the input $w$.\n\nGiven this specific flaw in Alice's implementation, how does it affect the validity of her construction as a proof of NL-hardness for the PATH problem?\n\nA. The proof of NL-hardness for PATH remains completely valid. The omission of a single edge is an insignificant error that does not break the fundamental logical equivalence for all possible inputs.\n\nB. The proof is invalid. The flaw could cause a 'no' instance of the language $L$ (i.e., an input $w \\notin L$) to be mapped to a 'yes' instance of PATH, because the erroneous graph might contain a path that shouldn't exist.\n\nC.

Construct $M$ and $w \\in L$ so that $G_{M}(w)$ has exactly one $s \\leadsto t$ path and no other edges except those on that path. One way is to let $M$ be deterministic on $w$ with a unique accepting run and to define its transition function so that every configuration not on that run is halting (with no outgoing transitions). Then the only edges in $E$ are precisely the edges of the unique $s \\leadsto t$ path.\n- Since Alice’s bug removes exactly one edge $e^{*}$ from $E$ when $E$ is non-empty, it must remove an edge on that unique path.

This breaks the required bi-implication and invalidates the reduction. This is exactly the failure described in option C.\n\n5) Remaining options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the equivalence must hold for all inputs; removing a single edge can be fatal when that edge lies on all accepting paths.\n- Option D is incorrect because the space bound is unaffected in principle; the issue is semantic correctness, not space complexity.\n- Option E is irrelevant to NL-hardness; moreover, the flawed reduction does not establish $\\text{PATH} \\in \\text{NL}$ (which is known independently).\n\nConclusion: The flaw can map a \"yes\" instance of $L$ to a \"no\" instance of PATH by deleting an edge critical to all accepting paths, so the proof is invalid for the reason in option C.",
