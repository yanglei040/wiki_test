This foundational exercise focuses on calculating the total number of distinct configurations a Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM) can assume given a specific space bound, $f(s) = c \\log_2 s$. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding the scale of the reachability problem that Savitch's theorem elegantly solves .",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, understanding the resource usage of abstract machines is fundamental. Consider a single-tape Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM). A configuration of such a machine at any point in time is completely described by three components: its current internal state, the entire content written on its work tape, and the current position of its tape head.\n\nLet this NTM have a set of states $Q$ and a tape alphabet $\\Sigma$. The machine is designed to have a space complexity of $f(s) = c \\log_2 s$ for an input of size $s$, where $c$ is a positive real constant. This means that for any input of size $s$, the machine uses at most $f(s)$ cells on its work tape.\n\nDerive a simplified, explicit formula for the maximum number of distinct configurations this NTM can be in. Express your answer as a function of the number of states $|Q|$, the size of the tape alphabet $|\\Sigma|$, the constant $c$, and the input size $s$.",

Consider a version of this algorithm, `REACH`($C_1$, $C_2$, $k$), which returns `true` if configuration $C_2$ is reachable from $C_1$ in at most $2^k$ steps, and `false` otherwise. The algorithm is defined as follows:\n\n**Algorithm: `REACH`($C_1$, $C_2$, $k$)**\n1.  If $k=0$, check if $C_1 = C_2$ or if $C_2$ can be reached from $C_1$ in a single computation step.

If the loop finishes without finding such a $C_{mid}$, return `false`.\n\nSuppose we initiate a check for reachability between a start configuration $C_{start}$ and an accepting configuration $C_{accept}$ within at most 16 steps, using the call `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{accept}$, 4). This initial call is considered Level 0 of the recursion. The recursive calls made directly by a Level 0 call are Level 1 calls. The recursive calls made directly by any Level 1 call are Level 2 calls.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the complete set of generic forms for the recursive calls made at Level 2?

            "solution": "We start from the Level 0 call, which is the initial invocation `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{accept}$, 4). Since $k=4>0$, by the algorithm it loops over all intermediate configurations $C_{i}$ and, for each $C_{i}$, makes two recursive calls with parameter $k-1=3$. Therefore, the Level 1 calls generated by Level 0 are of the form `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{i}$, 3) and `REACH`($C_{i}$, $C_{accept}$, 3).\n\nEach Level 1 call itself has $k=3>0$, so it again loops over all intermediate configurations and makes two calls with parameter $k-1=2$. Thus, for a Level 1 call `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{i}$, 3), the Level 2 calls it makes are, for all intermediate $C_{j}$, `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{j}$, 2) and `REACH`($C_{j}$, $C_{i}$, 2). Similarly, for a Level 1 call `REACH`($C_{i}$, $C_{accept}$, 3), the Level 2 calls it makes are, for all intermediate $C_{k}$, `REACH`($C_{i}$, $C_{k}$, 2) and `REACH`($C_{k}$, $C_{accept}$, 2).\n\nCollecting all Level 2 calls produced by the two families of Level 1 calls, the complete set of generic forms at Level 2 is `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{j}$, 2), `REACH`($C_{j}$, $C_{i}$, 2), `REACH`($C_{i}$, $C_{k}$, 2), and `REACH`($C_{k}$, $C_{accept}$, 2), which matches option B.\n\nTo see why the other options are incorrect:\n- Option A lists `REACH`($C_{start}$, $C_{i}$, 2) and `REACH`($C_{i}$, $C_{accept}$, 2), but at Level 2 the calls use fresh intermediate configurations $C_{j}$ and $C_{k}$ within each Level 1 branch; the pair in A does not capture the cross-branch structure and is not the complete set.\n- Option C uses $k=3$, which corresponds to Level 1, not Level 2.\n- Option D uses $k=4$, which is the parameter of the Level 0 call, not Level 2.\n- Option E is a single special-case call that could occur only if an intermediate equals $C_{accept}$ or $C_{start}$, but it does not describe the complete set of generic forms.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.",

This thought experiment challenges the standard binary-splitting approach of the reachability algorithm by proposing a ternary split instead.

Specifically, it shows that $\\text{NSPACE}(S(n)) \\subseteq \\text{DSPACE}(S(n)^2)$ for any space-constructible function $S(n) \\ge \\log n$.\n\nThe proof relies on a recursive algorithm to determine if a configuration $c_2$ is reachable from a configuration $c_1$ in the NTM's computation graph. Let the maximum number of configurations of an NTM for an input of size $n$ be $N$. The standard algorithm, let's call it `CAN-REACH`($c_{start}$, $c_{end}$, $k$), checks for a path of length at most $2^k$ from $c_{start}$ to $c_{end}$. For $k>0$, it does this by iterating through every possible intermediate configuration $c_{mid}$ and recursively checking for paths from $c_{start}$ to $c_{mid}$ and from $c_{mid}$ to $c_{end}$, both of length at most $2^{k-1}$. This binary splitting of the path leads to the $O(S(n)^2)$ space complexity result, as the recursion depth is $O(\\log N)$ and storing a configuration requires $O(S(n))$ space, where $\\log N$ is proportional to $S(n)$.\n\nNow, consider a modified recursive algorithm, `TRI-REACH`($c_{start}$, $c_{end}$, $i$), designed to solve the same reachability problem. This new algorithm checks for a path of length at most $3^i$. For $i>0$, `TRI-REACH` works by iterating through all possible pairs of intermediate configurations, ($c_{mid1}$, $c_{mid2}$), and recursively verifying the following three sub-problems:\n1. A path exists from $c_{start}$ to $c_{mid1}$ of length at most $3^{i-1}$.\n2. A path exists from $c_{mid1}$ to $c_{mid2}$ of length at most $3^{i-1}$.\n3. A path exists from $c_{mid2}$ to $c_{end}$ of length at most $3^{i-1}$.\n\nIf for some pair ($c_{mid1}$, $c_{mid2}$) all three recursive checks succeed, the algorithm returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Assume a DTM uses this `TRI-REACH` algorithm to simulate an NTM that has a space complexity of $S(n)$. What is the space complexity of this simulation, expressed in big-O notation in terms of $S(n)$?",

Therefore the space per recursion level is\n$$\nO(S(n)).\n$$\n\nBecause the recursive subcalls are performed depth-first and sequentially, the total space is the product of per-level space and recursion depth:\n$$\n\\text{Space}(n) = O\\big(S(n) \\cdot \\log_{3} N\\big).\n$$\nUsing $\\log_{3} N = \\frac{\\log_{2} N}{\\log_{2} 3} = \\Theta(\\log_{2} N)$ and $\\log_{2} N = \\Theta(S(n))$, we obtain\n$$\n\\text{Space}(n) = O\\big(S(n) \\cdot S(n)\\big) = O\\big(S(n)^{2}\\big).\n$$\n\nThus, despite splitting paths into three segments and iterating over pairs of intermediate configurations, the asymptotic space complexity remains the same as in Savitch’s original algorithm up to constant factors.",
