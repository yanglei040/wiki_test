This exercise asks you to determine the truth value of a basic QBF, which requires you to understand how existential and universal quantifiers interact.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) is a formula in classical propositional logic extended with quantifiers over the Boolean variables. The truth of a QBF is determined by evaluating the quantifiers, which bind the variables to the values TRUE or FALSE. The universal quantifier $\\forall x$ indicates that the subsequent formula must be true for all possible values of $x$, while the existential quantifier $\\exists x$ indicates that the subsequent formula must be true for at least one possible value of $x$.\n\nLet the logical operators be denoted as $\\land$ (AND), $\\lor$ (OR), and $\\neg$ (NOT). For the purpose of providing a numerical answer, let the truth value TRUE be represented by the integer $1$, and the truth value FALSE be represented by the integer $0$.\n\nDetermine the integer value corresponding to the truth value of the following Quantified Boolean Formula:\n$$ \\forall a \\exists b ((a \\land b) \\lor (\\neg a \\land \\neg b)) $$",

The propositional equivalence\n$$\n(a \\land b) \\lor (\\neg a \\land \\neg b) \\equiv a \\leftrightarrow b\n$$\nholds by the definition of the biconditional. Therefore, the given QBF is equivalent to\n$$\n\\forall a \\ \\exists b \\ (a \\leftrightarrow b).\n$$\nTo evaluate this, fix an arbitrary value of $a$. We will exhibit a witness for the existential quantifier by choosing\n$$\nb := a.\n$$\nSubstituting $b=a$ into the inner formula gives\n$$\n(a \\land a) \\lor (\\neg a \\land \\neg a).\n$$\nUsing idempotence, $a \\land a = a$ and $\\neg a \\land \\neg a = \\neg a$, so the expression simplifies to\n$$\na \\lor \\neg a,\n$$\nwhich is a tautology by the law of excluded middle, hence evaluates to TRUE for any $a$. Therefore, for every $a$, there exists a $b$ (specifically $b=a$) making the inner formula true. Consequently, the universally quantified statement is true.\n\nBy the problem’s convention, TRUE corresponds to the integer $1$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks us to find a logically equivalent formula for $F = \\neg(\\exists x \\forall y (x \\lor \\neg y))$ by moving the negation operator $(\\neg)$ inward until it only applies to variables. This process involves using De Morgan's laws for quantifiers and propositions.\n\nThe original formula is:\n$$ F = \\neg(\\exists x \\forall y (x \\lor \\neg y)) $$\n\nFirst, we address the outermost negation and the existential quantifier $\\exists x$. De Morgan's law for quantifiers states that $\\neg (\\exists z \\phi) \\equiv \\forall z (\\neg \\phi)$. Applying this rule, we push the negation past the quantifier $\\exists x$, which flips it to a universal quantifier $\\forall x$:\n$$ F \\equiv \\forall x (\\neg(\\forall y (x \\lor \\neg y))) $$\n\nNext, we proceed with the negation that is now inside the scope of the universal quantifier $\\forall x$. We need to push this negation past the universal quantifier $\\forall y$. The corresponding De Morgan's law for quantifiers is $\\neg (\\forall z \\phi) \\equiv \\exists z (\\neg \\phi)$. Applying this rule, we push the negation past the quantifier $\\forall y$, which flips it to an existential quantifier $\\exists y$:\n$$ F \\equiv \\forall x \\exists y (\\neg(x \\lor \\neg y)) $$\n\nNow, the negation is applied to the propositional part of the formula, $(x \\lor \\neg y)$. To push the negation further inward, we use De Morgan's law for propositions, which states that $\\neg(P \\lor Q) \\equiv \\neg P \\land \\neg Q$. In our case, $P=x$ and $Q=\\neg y$. Applying this rule, we get:\n$$ F \\equiv \\forall x \\exists y (\\neg x \\land \\neg(\\neg y)) $$\n\nFinally, we simplify the double negation $\\neg(\\neg y)$ using the law of double negation, which states that $\\neg(\\neg P) \\equiv P$. Applying this rule to $\\neg(\\neg y)$ gives us $y$:\n$$ F \\equiv \\forall x \\exists y (\\neg x \\land y) $$\n\nThis is the final simplified formula where the negation operator only applies to the variable $x$.
