            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, we study decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine using a certain amount of computational resources. The complexity class PSPACE consists of all decision problems that can be decided by a deterministic Turing machine using an amount of space that is polynomial in the length of the input string.\n\nLet $L$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ be formal languages. We define the following standard operations on languages:\n- **Concatenation ($L_1 L_2$):** The set of strings formed by concatenating a string from $L_1$ with a string from $L_2$. Formally, $L_1 L_2 = \\{ w_1 w_2 \\mid w_1 \\in L_1, w_2 \\in L_2 \\}$.\n- **Kleene Star ($L^*$):** The set of all strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from $L$. Formally, $L^* = \\bigcup_{i \\ge 0} L^i$, where $L^0 = \\{\\epsilon\\}$ (the language containing only the empty string) and $L^i = L L^{i-1}$ for $i \\ge 1$.\n- **Positive Closure ($L^+$):** The set of all strings formed by concatenating one or more strings from $L$. Formally, $L^+ = \\bigcup_{i \\ge 1} L^i$.\n\nIt is a known theorem that the class PSPACE is closed under both the concatenation and Kleene star operations. This means that if languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ are in PSPACE, then the language $L_1 L_2$ is also in PSPACE. Similarly, if a language $L$ is in PSPACE, then its Kleene star, $L^*$, is also in PSPACE.\n\nAn important identity relating these operations is $L^+ = L L^*$. Given that $L$ is an arbitrary language in PSPACE, which of the following statements provides the most direct and correct justification for why PSPACE must also be closed under the positive closure operation?\n\nA. To decide if a string $w$ is in $L^+$, a non-deterministic Turing machine can guess a split point in $w$ to form two substrings, $u$ and $v$, such that $w = uv$. The machine then verifies if $u \\in L$ and $v \\in L^*$. Because non-determinism can be simulated in polynomial space and both sub-problems are in PSPACE, the entire process runs in polynomial space.\n\nB. The positive closure $L^+$ is a subset of the Kleene star $L^*$ (specifically, $L^* = L^+ \\cup \\{\\epsilon\\}$). Since we are given that $L^*$ is in PSPACE, and $L^+$ is a subset of $L^*$, it must also be in PSPACE.\n\nC. The positive closure can be written as an infinite union $L^+ = L \\cup L^2 \\cup L^3 \\cup \\dots$. While each term $L^i$ is in PSPACE (by repeated application of concatenation closure), PSPACE is not closed under infinite union. Therefore, this construction is invalid, and we cannot conclude that PSPACE is closed under positive closure.\n\nD. We are given two facts: (1) if a language $L$ is in PSPACE, then $L^*$ is also in PSPACE, and (2) if languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ are in PSPACE, then their concatenation $L_1 L_2$ is in PSPACE. By applying the first fact to our language $L$, we know $L^*$ is in PSPACE. Now we have two languages, $L$ and $L^*$, that are both in PSPACE. Using the second fact, their concatenation, $L L^*$, must also be in PSPACE. Since $L^+ = L L^*$, this shows $L^+$ is in PSPACE.",

While it can be made correct because $\\mathrm{PSPACE} = \\mathrm{NPSPACE}$, it is not the most direct use of the given closure properties and identity.\n- Option B is incorrect because being a subset of a PSPACE language does not imply membership testing for the subset is in PSPACE in general.\n- Option C is not a valid justification: although PSPACE is not closed under infinite unions, this does not prevent $L^+$ from being in PSPACE by other means; moreover, we already have a direct construction via $L L^*$.\n- Option D exactly applies the given closure properties and the identity $L^+ = L L^*$, providing the most direct and correct justification.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.",

PSPACE is the complexity class containing all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing Machine (TM) using an amount of memory space that is a polynomial function of the length of the input string. A language is a set of strings, and a TM that decides a language is one that halts on every input, either accepting it (if the string is in the language) or rejecting it (if it is not).\n\nA fundamental property of a complexity class is its closure under certain operations.
