This exercise provides direct, hands-on practice in translating logical clauses into a graph's directed edges.

            "problem": "A common problem in computer science is determining the satisfiability of a Boolean formula. For formulas in 2-Conjunctive Normal Form (2-CNF), which are formulas where each clause is a disjunction of at most two literals, there exists an efficient algorithm based on graph theory. This problem explores the behavior of the graph construction at the heart of such an algorithm.\n\nThe procedure is as follows: Given a 2-CNF formula $\\phi$ over a set of $n$ variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, we construct a directed graph. The vertex set of this graph consists of $2n$ vertices, with one distinct vertex for each literal (i.e., for each $x_i$ and its negation $\\neg x_i$). For every clause of the form $(a \\lor b)$ present in the formula $\\phi$, two directed edges are added to the graph: an edge from the vertex representing $\\neg a$ to the vertex representing $b$, and an edge from the vertex representing $\\neg b$ to the vertex representing $a$.\n\nConsider a specific 2-CNF formula $\\phi$ defined over the six variables $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\\}$. This formula is given by the conjunction (AND) of the following seven clauses:\n1.  $(x_1 \\lor \\neg x_1)$\n2.  $(\\neg x_2 \\lor x_1)$\n3.  $(x_3 \\lor \\neg x_2)$\n4.  $(x_4 \\lor \\neg x_3)$\n5.  $(x_5 \\lor \\neg x_4)$\n6.  $(x_6 \\lor \\neg x_5)$\n7.  $(x_2 \\lor \\neg x_6)$\n\nApplying the procedure described above to this formula $\\phi$, determine the total number of distinct vertices that are reachable via a directed path of any length (including a path of length zero) starting from the vertex that represents the literal $\\neg x_1$.",

Initialize the reachable set with the start: $\\{\\neg x_{1}\\}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{1}$, the outgoing edges are $\\neg x_{1} \\to \\neg x_{1}$ (self-loop) and $\\neg x_{1} \\to \\neg x_{2}$. Thus we add $\\neg x_{2}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{2}$, the only outgoing edge is $\\neg x_{2} \\to \\neg x_{6}$, so add $\\neg x_{6}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{6}$, the only outgoing edge is $\\neg x_{6} \\to \\neg x_{5}$, so add $\\neg x_{5}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{5}$, the only outgoing edge is $\\neg x_{5} \\to \\neg x_{4}$, so add $\\neg x_{4}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{4}$, the only outgoing edge is $\\neg x_{4} \\to \\neg x_{3}$, so add $\\neg x_{3}$.\n\nFrom $\\neg x_{3}$, the only outgoing edge is $\\neg x_{3} \\to \\neg x_{2}$, which is already in the reachable set. Hence the exploration closes a cycle among $\\neg x_{2}, \\neg x_{3}, \\neg x_{4}, \\neg x_{5}, \\neg x_{6}$.\n\nNo edge from any of these negative literals goes to any positive literal, as seen from the edge list above; all edges from negative sources lead to negative targets.

A 2-CNF formula is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of at most two literals. A literal is a variable or its negation.\n\nFor any 2-CNF formula $\\phi$, we can construct an implication graph $G_\\phi$.

            "solution": "We analyze each procedure and determine whether it is guaranteed to find a satisfying assignment for a satisfiable 2-CNF formula $\\phi$ using the given oracle.\n\nClaim for A: Guaranteed to find a satisfying assignment.\nProof by induction on the variables:\n- Invariant: After assigning values to $x_{1},\\dots,x_{i-1}$, let $\\phi_{i-1}$ denote $\\phi$ conjoined with these assignments. The invariant is that $\\phi_{i-1}$ is satisfiable.\n- Base case: $\\phi_{0}=\\phi$ is satisfiable by assumption.\n- Inductive step: At step $i$, the algorithm queries $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi_{i-1} \\land x_{i})$. If it returns true, then there exists an assignment extending $x_{i}=\\text{true}$ that satisfies $\\phi_{i-1}$, so setting $x_{i}=\\text{true}$ preserves satisfiability. Otherwise, since $\\phi_{i-1}$ is satisfiable, it must be that $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi_{i-1} \\land \\neg x_{i})$ is true (at least one of the two unit extensions is satisfiable), so setting $x_{i}=\\text{false}$ preserves satisfiability. Thus the invariant holds for $\\phi_{i}$.\n- After $n$ steps, $\\phi_{n}$ is satisfiable and fixes all variables, hence the chosen total assignment satisfies $\\phi$.\nTherefore, A is correct.\n\nCounterexample for B: Not guaranteed.\nLet\n$$\n\\phi \\;=\\; (x \\lor y)\\;\\land\\;(\\neg x \\lor z)\\;\\land\\;(\\neg y \\lor \\neg z).\n$$\nThis $\\phi$ is satisfiable (for example, $x=\\text{false},\\,y=\\text{true},\\,z=\\text{false}$ satisfies all clauses).\nIndependently querying the oracle on the original $\\phi$ yields:\n- $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi \\land x)=\\text{true}$ (e.g., $x=\\text{true},\\,y=\\text{false},\\,z=\\text{true}$ works),\n- $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi \\land y)=\\text{true}$ (e.g., $y=\\text{true},\\,x=\\text{false},\\,z=\\text{false}$ works),\n- $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi \\land z)=\\text{true}$ (e.g., $z=\\text{true},\\,y=\\text{false},\\,x=\\text{true}$ works).\nProcedure B would then set $x=y=z=\\text{true}$, but this assignment makes $(\\neg y \\lor \\neg z)$ false, so it does not satisfy $\\phi$. Hence B is not guaranteed.\n\nCounterexample and reduction for C: Not guaranteed.\nKey equivalence: For a 2-CNF $\\phi$ and variable $x_{i}$, there is a path from $x_{i}$ to $\\neg x_{i}$ in the implication graph $G_{\\phi}$ if and only if $\\phi \\land x_{i}$ is unsatisfiable.\n- If $x_{i}\\to\\neg x_{i}$ in $G_{\\phi}$, adding the unit clause $x_{i}$ adds the edge $\\neg x_{i}\\to x_{i}$, making $x_{i}$ and $\\neg x_{i}$ belong to the same SCC, which makes $\\phi \\land x_{i}$ unsatisfiable.\n- Conversely, if $\\phi \\land x_{i}$ is unsatisfiable, then in $G_{\\phi \\land x_{i}}$ the only new edge is $\\neg x_{i}\\to x_{i}$, and unsatisfiability implies $x_{i}$ and $\\neg x_{i}$ are in the same SCC; therefore there must already be a path $x_{i}\\to\\neg x_{i}$ in $G_{\\phi}$.\nThus C’s rule “assign $x_{i}=\\text{false}$ iff $x_{i}\\to\\neg x_{i}$ exists, else $x_{i}=\\text{true}$” is equivalent to “assign $x_{i}=\\text{true}$ iff $\\text{IS\\_SAT}(\\phi \\land x_{i})=\\text{true}$, else $x_{i}=\\text{false}$,” applied independently on the original $\\phi$. This is the same pitfall as B, so the same $\\phi$ above shows C can fail (it would set $x=y=z=\\text{true}$, which is not satisfying). Hence C is not guaranteed.\n\nCounterexample reasoning for D: Not guaranteed as stated.\nThe procedure only rejects an assignment when it immediately falsifies a clause and makes assignments “permanent” otherwise, with no provision to reconsider earlier choices if a later conflict arises. Consider\n$$\n\\phi \\;=\\; (\\neg x \\lor z)\\;\\land\\;(\\neg x \\lor \\neg z).\n$$\nThis $\\phi$ is satisfiable (e.g., $x=\\text{false}$ with any $z$). Procedure D might pick $x$ first and try $x=\\text{true}$, which causes no clause to be immediately false: the clauses become unit $z$ and unit $\\neg z$, which are not yet falsified under the partial assignment. The algorithm then makes $x=\\text{true}$ permanent and moves to $z$. Trying $z=\\text{true}$ immediately falsifies $(\\neg x \\lor \\neg z)$; backtracking to $z=\\text{false}$ immediately falsifies $(\\neg x \\lor z)$. Having tried both values for $z$ and with $x$ declared permanent earlier, the algorithm cannot proceed to find the satisfying assignment $x=\\text{false}$. Since the described procedure does not include revising earlier permanent assignments upon later conflicts, it is not guaranteed to succeed.\n\nConclusion: Only A is guaranteed to find a satisfying assignment for any satisfiable $\\phi$ using the oracle.",
