            "problem": "The directed st-connectivity problem, often denoted as PATH, is a fundamental problem in computational complexity. It asks whether a path exists from a specified start vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$ in a given directed graph $G=(V, E)$. The general version of this problem is known to be complete for the complexity class NL, Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space.\n\nLet us define the relevant complexity classes more formally:\n- **L (Logarithmic Space)**: The class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a read-only input tape and a read-write work tape of size $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input.\n- **NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space)**: The class of decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine under the same space constraints.\n\nNow, consider a restricted version of the problem, which we will call U-PATH. In U-PATH, the input consists of a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, a start vertex $s$, and a target vertex $t$. However, the graph $G$ comes with a specific structural promise: every vertex in $V$ has an out-degree of at most one.\n\nBased on an analysis of the computational resources required to solve U-PATH, which of the following statements most accurately characterizes its complexity?\n\nA. U-PATH is in L.\n\nB. U-PATH is NL-complete.\n\nC. U-PATH is P-complete (under log-space reductions).\n\nD. U-PATH is undecidable.\n\nE.

            "solution": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph in which every vertex has out-degree at most one. Equivalently, there exists a partial function $f:V\\to V$ such that for each $u\\in V$, either there is no outgoing edge from $u$, or there is exactly one edge $(u,f(u))\\in E$. Given $s,t\\in V$, there is a directed path from $s$ to $t$ if and only if there exists $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{k}(s)=t$, where $f^{0}(s)=s$ and $f^{k+1}(s)=f(f^{k}(s))$ whenever $f^{k}$ is defined.\n\nWrite $n=|V|$. Starting from $s$, the sequence $s, f(s), f^{2}(s), \\dots$ either terminates at a vertex with no outgoing edge (a sink) or eventually repeats a vertex, forming a directed cycle. In either case, the number of distinct vertices visited is at most $n$. Therefore, if $t$ is reachable from $s$, there exists $k$ with $0\\leq k\\leq n-1$ such that $f^{k}(s)=t$.\n\nDeterministic logarithmic-space algorithm (membership in L):\n- Maintain two variables on the work tape:\n  - a current vertex $v$, initialized to $s$;\n  - a counter $c$, initialized to $0$, that will range from $0$ to $n$.\n  Both $v$ and $c$ can be stored using $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits.\n- Repeat the following loop while $c\\leq n$:\n  1. If $v=t$, accept.\n  2. Find the unique outgoing neighbor of $v$, if it exists. This can be done by scanning the read-only input to locate an edge $(v,w)\\in E$. Because the input is read-only and vertices can be indexed, a single scan uses $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits to hold indices and pointers.\n  3. If no outgoing neighbor exists, reject (since the unique forward walk has ended without reaching $t$).\n  4. Otherwise set $v:=w$ and increment $c:=c+1$.\n- If the loop finishes without accepting, reject.\n\nCorrectness:\n- If a path from $s$ to $t$ exists, then some $k\\leq n-1$ satisfies $f^{k}(s)=t$, so the algorithm accepts at iteration $k$.\n- If no such path exists, then along the unique forward walk from $s$, either a sink is encountered before reaching $t$ (immediate rejection), or a cycle disjoint from $t$ is entered. In the latter case, since there are at most $n$ distinct vertices on the walk, after $n$ increments the algorithm necessarily has not seen $t$ and rejects.\n\nSpace bound:\n- The algorithm stores $v$ and $c$, each using $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits, and uses $O(\\log_{2} n)$ additional bits to scan the input for an outgoing edge of the current vertex. Thus the total workspace is $O(\\log_{2} n)$, i.e., deterministic logarithmic space.\n\nHence U-PATH is solvable in deterministic logarithmic space, so U-PATH is in L. Therefore, among the options, the most accurate characterization is option A.\n\nSince U-PATH is in L, it cannot be NL-complete unless $\\mathrm{L}=\\mathrm{NL}$, and it is not P-complete unless $\\mathrm{L}=\\mathrm{P}$. The problem is certainly decidable, so D is false, and E is false because we have an explicit L algorithm.",

            "problem": "A new data routing protocol, 'Path-Limited Transmission' (PLT), is being developed. In this protocol, a data packet traveling from a source node $s$ to a destination node $t$ in a computer network is discarded if it traverses more than a specified maximum number of links, $k$. This is a feature to prevent packets from looping or taking excessively long routes. The network is modeled as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of directed communication links. The length of a path is defined as the number of links (edges) it contains.\n\nYou are a complexity analyst tasked with classifying the fundamental decision problem associated with PLT: Given a network graph $G$, a source node $s$, a destination node $t$, and the maximum link count $k$, can a packet be successfully transmitted from $s$ to $t$?\n\nLet's call this decision problem `PLT_ROUTABLE`. Analyze the complexity of `PLT_ROUTABLE` and determine which of the following statements is the most accurate classification. Assume that the integer $k$ is provided as part of the input in standard binary representation.\n\nA. `PLT_ROUTABLE` is in P, but it is not known to be in NL.\n\nB. `PLT_ROUTABLE` is NL-complete.\n\nC. `PLT_ROUTABLE` is PSPACE-complete because the value of $k$ can be exponentially large relative to the size of its binary representation.\n\nD. `PLT_ROUTABLE` is NP-complete.\n\nE. `PLT_ROUTABLE` is solvable in time polynomial in $|V|$ and $|E|$, but the time complexity is exponential in the number of bits representing $k$.",
            "solution": "We formalize PLT_ROUTABLE as follows: given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, source $s\\in V$, target $t\\in V$, and an integer $k\\ge 0$ given in binary, decide whether there exists an $s$-$t$ walk of length at most $k$, where length is the number of edges used.\n\nKey structural observation. In any directed graph, if $t$ is reachable from $s$ by any walk (possibly with repeated vertices), then there exists a simple path from $s$ to $t$ of length at most $|V|-1$. More importantly, the shortest walk from $s$ to $t$ has a length of at most $|V|-1$. Therefore, the existence of an $s-t$ walk of length at most $k$ is equivalent to the existence of an $s-t$ walk of length at most $\\min\\{k, |V|-1\\}$. Formally,\n$$\n\\exists\\ \\text{$s$-$t$ walk of length} \\le k\n\\iff\n\\exists\\ \\text{$s$-$t$ walk of length} \\le \\min\\{k,|V|-1\\}.\n$$\nThis equivalence immediately implies that exceedingly large values of $k$ (even exponentially large in their binary input size) do not increase the essential difficulty: any $k\\ge |V|-1$ reduces PLT_ROUTABLE to ordinary reachability.\n\nMembership in NL. We show PLT_ROUTABLE $\\in \\text{NL}$ by giving a nondeterministic logspace algorithm. On input $(G,s,t,k)$:\n1. First, determine $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\min\\{k, |V|-1\\}$. This can be done in logspace by counting the vertices in $G$ to get $|V|$ and then comparing $|V|-1$ with $k$ from the input tape. The value $k_{\\text{eff}}$ requires $O(\\log|V|)$ bits.\n2. Nondeterministically guess a walk starting at $s$. Maintain the current vertex using $O(\\log |V|)$ bits.\n3. Maintain a step counter $\\ell$ that starts at $0$ and is incremented for each chosen edge.\n4. If the current vertex is $t$, accept.\n5. If the step counter $\\ell$ exceeds $k_{\\text{eff}}$, halt and reject on this computational branch.\nThe total work tape usage is for the current vertex, the step counter, and $k_{\\text{eff}}$, which is $O(\\log |V|)$. This is $O(\\log n)$ where $n$ is the input length. Thus PLT_ROUTABLE is in NL.\n\nNL-hardness. We reduce the standard s-t reachability problem (STCON), which is NL-complete, to PLT_ROUTABLE via a logspace many-one reduction. Given $(G,s,t)$, output $(G,s,t,k')$ where\n$$\nk' = |V|-1\n$$\nencoded in binary. This reduction is computable in logspace because we can count $|V|$ with an $O(\\log |V|)$-bit counter by scanning the vertex list, and then write $k'$ in binary using $O(\\log |V|)$ workspace. Correctness holds because\n$$\n(G,s,t)\\in \\text{STCON}\n\\iff\n\\exists\\ \\text{$s$-$t$ path}\n\\iff\n\\exists\\ \\text{$s$-$t$ walk of length} \\le |V|-1\n\\iff\n(G,s,t,k')\\in \\text{PLT\\_ROUTABLE}.\n$$\nTherefore PLT_ROUTABLE is NL-hard.\n\nCombining membership in NL with NL-hardness, PLT_ROUTABLE is NL-complete.\n\nConsequences for the options:\n- Option A is false because PLT_ROUTABLE is known to be in NL (indeed NL-complete).\n- Option B is true by the argument above.\n- Option C is false because $k$ being exponentially large is immaterial due to the reduction to $\\min\\{k,|V|-1\\}$.\n- Option D is false; NL-complete problems are in P and are not NP-complete unless $\\text{NL}=\\text{NP}$ with further unlikely collapses.\n- Option E is false; a breadth-first search limited to depth $\\min\\{k,|V|-1\\}$ runs in time polynomial in $|V|+|E|$, independent of exponential dependence on the bit-length of $k$ after capping at $|V|-1$.\n\nHence the most accurate classification is NL-complete.",
