The engineering team suspects a bug that could have originated in any service $u$ from which there is a path of service calls to $t$. To identify all potentially faulty services, they employ an analysis based on the principle of inductive counting, which is central to the proof of the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.\n\nLet $B_i(t)$ be the set of services from which service $t$ is reachable by a path of length at most $i$.

Let the alphabet be $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$. This problem, deciding the language $ALL_{NFA,k}$, is a classic example of a problem in the complexity class $\\text{co-NL}$. The Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem states that nondeterministic space-bounded complexity classes are closed under complementation, which implies that $ALL_{NFA,k}$ can also be decided by a nondeterministic Turing machine using only logarithmic space. The constructive proof of this theorem relies on a technique called \"inductive counting.\"\n\nYour task is to analyze a nondeterministic algorithm that uses this principle. The algorithm operates on the state space of the power-set construction (subset construction) of the NFA, without explicitly building the full power-set automaton. A state in this space, which we call a \"subset-state,\" is a subset of the NFA's state set $Q$. The initial subset-state is $S_0 = \\{q_0\\}$. A transition from a subset-state $S$ on an input symbol $\\sigma$ leads to the subset-state $S' = \\bigcup_{q \\in S} \\delta(q, \\sigma)$. A subset-state $S$ is defined as \"rejecting\" if it contains no final states of the original NFA, i.e., $S \\cap F = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to verifying that no rejecting subset-state is reachable from the initial subset-state $S_0$ in exactly $k$ steps.\n\nAn inductive counting algorithm first computes the number of reachable subset-states at each step. Let $R_i$ be the set of all subset-states reachable from $S_0$ in exactly $i$ steps, and let $c_i = |R_i|$. Assume the algorithm has already successfully computed the correct sequence of counts $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_k$.\n\nGiven these correct counts, which of the following procedures accurately describes the final verification step of a nondeterministic algorithm to confirm that $M$ indeed accepts all strings of length $k$?\n\nA. The algorithm deterministically constructs the set $R_k$ by starting from $S_0$ and exploring all paths of length $k$. It then iterates through each state $S \\in R_k$ and checks if $S \\cap F = \\emptyset$. If such a state is found, it rejects; otherwise, it accepts.\n\nB. The algorithm nondeterministically guesses a subset-state $S$. It then verifies that $S$ is reachable in $k$ steps. If reachable, it checks if $S \\cap F = \\emptyset$. If this condition is met, the algorithm accepts. If all possible nondeterministic paths of the algorithm fail to find such a rejecting state, the machine rejects.\n\nC. The algorithm uses the count $c_k$. It initializes a counter `verified_count = 0`. It then iterates through all possible subset-states $S \\subseteq Q$. For each subset-state $S$, it nondeterministically attempts to verify that $S \\in R_k$ by finding a valid predecessor in $R_{k-1}$ (using the count $c_{k-1}$ to ensure all predecessors are accounted for). If $S$ is verified to be in $R_k$, it increments `verified_count` and checks if $S \\cap F = \\emptyset$. If this condition is ever met, the algorithm immediately rejects. If the outer loop completes and `verified_count` equals $c_k$ without any rejecting state being found, the algorithm accepts.\n\nD. The algorithm uses the count $c_k$ to nondeterministically guess the entire set $R_k$ at once. It verifies that the guessed set has size $c_k$. Then, it checks each member of the guessed set to see if it is a rejecting state. If no member is rejecting, it accepts.",

A subset-state $S$ is rejecting if $S\\cap F=\\emptyset$. The property “$M$ accepts all strings of length $k$” is equivalent to “no rejecting subset-state is in $R_{k}$.”\n\nAssume we already have the correct counts $c_{0},c_{1},\\ldots,c_{k}$. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi method, the final verification must use inductive counting: it must confirm that exactly $c_{k}$ distinct subset-states constitute $R_{k}$ (completeness and non-duplication), and that none of these is rejecting. This can be done in nondeterministic logarithmic space by scanning candidates $S\\subseteq Q$, verifying membership $S\\in R_{k}$ via existence of a predecessor $T\\in R_{k-1}$ and symbol $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$ such that $\\Delta(T,\\sigma)=S$, and using the previously validated count $c_{k-1}$ to ensure that the verification of $R_{k}$ is consistent with the verified $R_{k-1}$ without omitting or duplicating members. Concretely, for each $S\\subseteq Q$, nondeterministically search for $T\\subseteq Q$ and $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$ such that $T\\in R_{k-1}$ and $\\Delta(T,\\sigma)=S$. If so, increment a counter of verified distinct members of $R_{k}$, and immediately reject if $S\\cap F=\\emptyset$. Accept only if the total number of verified distinct members equals $c_{k}$ and no rejecting $S$ was found. This is precisely the inductive counting style verification: it guarantees that all and only the $c_{k}$ members of $R_{k}$ have been certified and that none is rejecting.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA. Deterministically constructing $R_{k}$ by exploring all paths of length $k$ requires, in general, exponential time and space to enumerate and store subset-states, and does not adhere to the nondeterministic logarithmic space method central to inductive counting. It does not reflect the $\\text{co-NL}$ verification technique.\n\nB. Nondeterministically guessing an $S$ and accepting if it is rejecting and reachable in $k$ steps decides the existential property “there exists a rejecting subset-state in $R_{k}$,” i.e., the complement language. It accepts exactly when $M$ fails to accept all strings of length $k$, which is the wrong acceptance criterion for the target language.\n\nC. Iterating over all subset-states $S\\subseteq Q$, nondeterministically verifying $S\\in R_{k}$ via a predecessor in $R_{k-1}$ while maintaining a counter of verified distinct members equal to $c_{k}$, and rejecting immediately upon finding $S\\cap F=\\emptyset$, matches the inductive counting verification paradigm. It uses the counts $c_{k-1}$ and $c_{k}$ to ensure completeness and non-duplication and confirms that no member of $R_{k}$ is rejecting. This is the correct $\\text{co-NL}$-style verification step.\n\nD. Nondeterministically guessing the entire set $R_{k}$ at once and checking its size is $c_{k}$ requires representing an exponentially large set and verifying global correctness of the guess, which is not feasible in logarithmic space and is not how inductive counting proceeds.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure describing the final verification step consistent with the inductive counting proof technique is option C.",

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem establishes that the class $NL$ (Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space) is closed under complement, meaning $NL = \\text{co-NL}$. A cornerstone of this proof is a method called \"inductive counting\" used to show that the complement of the REACHABILITY problem is in NL.\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a directed graph, and let $s, t \\in V$ be two distinct vertices.\nThe **REACHABILITY** problem asks: Is there at least one path from $s$ to $t$?\nThe complement, **NON-REACHABILITY**, asks: Are there no paths from $s$ to $t$?\n\nThe inductive counting algorithm for NON-REACHABILITY works by computing $N$, the total number of vertices reachable from $s$. It does this by iteratively computing $N_i$, the number of vertices reachable from $s$ in at most $i$ steps, for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, |V|-1$. The crucial step is computing $N_{i+1}$ using the already computed value of $N_i$. This is possible because the set of reachable vertices is monotonic: any vertex reachable in $\\le i$ steps is also reachable in $\\le i+1$ steps. This monotonicity allows using the count $N_i$ to certify that a nondeterministic search has found all vertices reachable in $\\le i$ steps, which is then used to identify all vertices reachable in $\\le i+1$ steps.\n\nNow, consider a related problem called **UNIQUE-REACHABILITY**: Is there exactly one simple path from $s$ to $t$?\n\nSuppose one attempts to adapt the inductive counting methodology to solve **UNIQUE-REACHABILITY**. A natural approach would be to define $U_i$ as the set of vertices $v$ for which there is exactly one simple path from $s$ to $v$ of length at most $i$, and then try to inductively compute the size $|U_i|$.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains why the core logic of the inductive counting method, as used in the Immerman–Szelepcsényi proof, fails when applied to **UNIQUE-REACHABILITY**?\n\nA. The property of having a unique path is not monotonic. A vertex with a unique path of length at most $i$ might have multiple paths when considering paths of length up to $i+1$. This loss of monotonicity breaks the certification mechanism of the inductive count.\n\nB. The total number of paths between two vertices can be exponential in the number of vertices. A logarithmic-space counter is insufficient to store the number of paths required for the calculation.\n\nC. The inductive counting method is inherently nondeterministic, whereas determining the exact number of paths (to check if it is one) is a deterministic process that cannot be simulated in NL.\n\nD. The problem **UNIQUE-REACHABILITY** is known to be `US`-hard (Unique Satisfiability hard), a class believed to be strictly harder than NL, meaning no NL algorithm could solve it.\n\nE. The algorithm would need to enumerate and compare all paths of a certain length, which requires storing full path descriptions. This exceeds the logarithmic space bound.",
            "solution": "We recall the inductive counting framework used in the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem. For REACHABILITY, define $R_{i}=\\{v \\in V : \\text{$v$ is reachable from $s$ by a path of length at most $i$}\\}$. The key property is monotonicity:\n$$\nR_{0} \\subseteq R_{1} \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq R_{|V|-1}.\n$$\nThis monotonicity implies that once a vertex enters $R_{i}$, it stays in all $R_{j}$ for $j \\geq i$, and hence $\\lvert R_{i}\\rvert$ is nondecreasing in $i$. The inductive counting method uses this to certify completeness: a nondeterministic procedure can propose the set of vertices reachable within $i$ steps and verify its size against a running count $N_{i}=\\lvert R_{i}\\rvert$, which then allows updating to $N_{i+1}$ by only accounting for newly added vertices. No previously counted vertices ever need to be removed.\n\nFor UNIQUE-REACHABILITY, define\n$$\nU_{i}=\\{v \\in V : \\text{there is exactly one simple path from $s$ to $v$ of length at most $i$}\\}.\n$$\nThe analogous monotonicity fails. Concretely, there exist graphs and indices $i$ with a vertex $v$ such that $v \\in U_{i}$ but $v \\notin U_{i+1}$. For example, consider a graph with paths $s \\to a \\to v$ (length $2$) and $s \\to b \\to c \\to v$ (length $3$). Then for $i=2$, $v$ has exactly one simple path from $s$ of length at most $2$, so $v \\in U_{2}$. For $i=3$, $v$ has two simple paths of length at most $3$, hence $v \\notin U_{3}$. Therefore,\n$$\nU_{i} \\nsubseteq U_{i+1}\n$$\nin general, and the sequence $\\lvert U_{i}\\rvert$ is not guaranteed to be nondecreasing.\n\nBecause elements can leave $U_{i}$ as $i$ increases, the certification mechanism that underlies inductive counting breaks: one cannot maintain a correct inductive tally by only “adding” newly discovered vertices, since some previously counted vertices must be “removed” once longer alternative paths appear. The Immerman–Szelepcsényi method fundamentally relies on monotonic growth of the certified set to validate counts in logarithmic space via nondeterminism. Without monotonicity, the nondeterministic verification that a guessed set is complete (and that the count is correct) cannot be carried out in the same way.\n\nThus the core reason the method fails for UNIQUE-REACHABILITY is precisely the loss of monotonicity of the defining property when increasing the path-length bound. This matches statement A. The other options either cite unrelated resource issues, incorrect claims about determinism versus nondeterminism, unproven separations, or unnecessary enumeration requirements, none of which directly target the failure of the inductive counting logic.",
