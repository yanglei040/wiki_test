            "introduction": "Many complex strategic scenarios, when framed as games, reveal an elegant underlying structure. This practice problem  models a technological race as a game on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent milestones and a directed edge $(u, v)$ signifies that milestone $u$ is a prerequisite for $v$. The key to victory here is not complex tactical maneuvering, but rather understanding a global property of the game: the total number of prerequisite milestones that must be achieved. This exercise guides you to see how a simple parity argument can determine the winner from the very first move, demonstrating that sometimes the winner is decided before the game even begins.",

            "problem": "In the competitive research and development game \"Tech Race,\" two strategists, Alice and Bob, take turns claiming ownership of key technologies. The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where vertices represent technologies and directed edges represent dependencies.\n\nThe available technologies and their dependencies are as follows:\n- **Fusion Reactor (T):** requires Sustained Burn (E) and Tritium Breeding (F).\n- **Sustained Burn (E):** requires Plasma Confinement (C) and Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Tritium Breeding (F):** requires Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Plasma Confinement (C):** requires Toroidal Coils (A) and Poloidal Coils (B).\n- **Toroidal Coils (A), Poloidal Coils (B), and Superconducting Magnets (D)** are foundational technologies with no prerequisites.\n\nThe rules of the game are:\n1. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice making the first move.\n2. On any given turn, a player claims one unclaimed technology.\n3. A technology can only be claimed if all of its immediate prerequisites have already been claimed. The prerequisite technologies can be claimed by either player.\n4. The first player to claim the Fusion Reactor (T) wins the game.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Alice has a winning strategy.\n\nB. Bob has a winning strategy.\n\nC. The winner depends on whether Alice's first move is to claim A, B, or D.\n\nD. Neither player has a winning strategy as the game can continue indefinitely.",
            "solution": "We formalize the dependency structure as a directed acyclic graph with technologies $A$, $B$, $D$ foundational; $C$ requiring $A$ and $B$; $E$ requiring $C$ and $D$; $F$ requiring $D$; and $T$ requiring $E$ and $F$.\n\nBy the rules, exactly one technology can be claimed per turn, and a technology is claimable only after all its immediate prerequisites have been claimed (by either player). The game ends immediately when $T$ is claimed.\n\nWe first identify the necessary technologies that must be claimed before $T$ becomes available:\n- Since $T$ requires $E$ and $F$, both $E$ and $F$ must be claimed before $T$ can be claimed.\n- $F$ requires $D$, so $D$ must be claimed before $F$.\n- $E$ requires $C$ and $D$, so $C$ and $D$ must be claimed before $E$.\n- $C$ requires $A$ and $B$, so $A$ and $B$ must be claimed before $C$.\n\nThus, the set $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$ must all be claimed before $T$ is available. These are six distinct technologies, and only one may be claimed per move. Therefore, at least $6$ moves are required before $T$ can possibly be claimed. Moreover, there are no other technologies to claim besides these six before $T$ becomes available, so the game necessarily proceeds by claiming exactly these six in some order during the first $6$ moves.\n\nConsequently:\n- $T$ cannot be claimed before move $7$.\n- After $6$ moves, all of $A,B,C,D,E,F$ have been claimed, so both prerequisites $E$ and $F$ of $T$ are satisfied, making $T$ available on the next move.\n- On move $7$, the player to move can claim $T$ and immediately wins.\n\nSince Alice moves on moves $1,3,5,7$, she will be the player to move on the $7$-th move, at which point $T$ is first available. Hence Alice claims $T$ on move $7$ and wins, regardless of the order in which the prerequisites were claimed.\n\nTherefore, Alice has a winning strategy, and options B, C, and D are false: Bob cannot force a win; the winner does not depend on Alice’s first move; and the game cannot continue indefinitely because it must end by move $7$.",

            "introduction": "While some games have outcomes determined by their global structure, many others hinge on the clever strategic choices players make turn-by-turn. This problem  explores such a scenario, using the concept of an independent set from graph theory as the winning condition. Here, you must think several moves ahead, analyzing the immediate consequences of each choice to set up a future, unavoidable victory. This practice is designed to develop your skill in identifying and creating \"forks,\" or double threats—a fundamental tactic for forcing a win in many competitive games.",

            "problem": "In a new competitive game called the Independent Set Game, two players, Player A and Player B, take turns claiming vertices from a given graph $G=(V, E)$. Once a vertex is claimed by a player, it cannot be chosen again by either player. A player wins as soon as their personal collection of claimed vertices contains an independent set of size $k$. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge. If all vertices are claimed and no player has achieved the goal, the game is a draw.\n\nConsider an instance of this game played on a 7-cycle graph $G$, where the vertex set is $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ and the edge set is $E = \\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,5\\}, \\{5,6\\}, \\{6,7\\}, \\{7,1\\}\\}$. The target size for the independent set is $k=3$.\n\nThe game is already in progress. Player A has claimed vertex $\\{1\\}$, and Player B has claimed vertex $\\{4\\}$. It is now Player A's turn to choose an unclaimed vertex.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 2 on this turn.\n\nB. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 3 on this turn.\n\nC. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 5 on this turn.\n\nD. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 7 on this turn.\n\nE. Player B has a winning strategy, meaning Player A has no move that can guarantee a win.",
            "solution": "We work on the 7-cycle $C_{7}$ with $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$ and edges $\\{\\{i,i+1\\}:i=1,\\ldots,6\\}\\cup\\{\\{7,1\\}\\}$. An independent set of size $3$ on $C_{7}$ must be a maximum independent set, and all such sets are exactly the $7$ triples\n$$\nS_{j}=\\{j,\\ j+2,\\ j+4\\}\\quad\\text{(indices taken modulo $7$ in $\\{1,\\ldots,7\\}$)}.\n$$\nThey are pairwise nonadjacent by construction (differences are $2$ or $4$ modulo $7$), and every maximum independent set has this form.\n\nInitially, Player A has $\\{1\\}$ and Player B has $\\{4\\}$. It is A’s turn.\n\nConsider A choosing $3$ on this turn. Then A has $\\{1,3\\}$. Observe that $\\{1,3\\}\\subset S_{1}=\\{1,3,5\\}$ and $\\{1,3\\}\\subset S_{6}=\\{6,1,3\\}$. Hence A threatens to complete either $S_{1}$ by taking $5$ or $S_{6}$ by taking $6$. On B’s reply:\n- If B takes $5$, then A takes $6$ next and wins with $\\{1,3,6\\}$.\n- If B takes $6$, then A takes $5$ next and wins with $\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n- If B takes any other vertex, both $5$ and $6$ remain available, so A takes either $5$ or $6$ next and wins.\nB cannot win before A’s next move because B currently has only one vertex ($4$) and needs two more to reach an independent triple, whereas A will complete on the immediate next move. Therefore, choosing $3$ gives A a forced win.\n\nFor completeness, we verify that the other listed first moves do not guarantee a win for A under optimal B play:\n- If A chooses $2$, B can reply with $3$. Then A cannot use $1$ anymore to reach $3$ (both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ require $3$), and the only remaining triple available through $2$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$. B can always block this by taking whichever of $\\{5,7\\}$ A has not yet taken, so A has no forced win.\n- If A chooses $5$, then the immediate single threat is $S_{1}=\\{1,3,5\\}$; B blocks by taking $3$. After that, A’s only remaining triple through $5$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can always keep blocking as above; thus no forced win for A.\n- If A chooses $7$, B again replies with $3$, which eliminates both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ (the only triples containing $1$ that A could aim for without $4$). The only remaining triple through $7$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can block as before; hence no forced win for A.\n\nThus exactly choosing vertex $3$ gives Player A a winning strategy; the other listed moves do not guarantee a win, and Player B does not have a winning strategy overall in this position.",

            "introduction": "We now advance to a more powerful and general method for analyzing a special category of games known as impartial games, where the available moves depend only on the state of the game, not on which player is moving. This problem  introduces a zoning game that, at first glance, appears tangled and complex. The solution, however, lies in decomposing the game board into smaller, independent subgames and applying the principles of the Sprague-Grundy theorem.

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, many two-player games of perfect information can be used to model complex decision problems. Consider one such game, \"City Segregation,\" played by a Planner (Player 1) and a Disruptor (Player 2).\n\nThe game is played on a one-dimensional grid of 7 lots, arranged in a row and indexed 1 through 7. Some lots might already be zoned as either 'Residential' (R) or 'Industrial' (I), while others are empty. The players take turns, with the Planner moving first. A move consists of choosing one empty lot and zoning it as either 'R' or 'I'.\n\nHowever, a move is only legal if it does not create an adjacency between a 'Residential' and an 'Industrial' zone. For instance, if lot 4 is zoned 'R', a player cannot zone lot 3 or lot 5 as 'I'. If a player attempts to make a move that would create such an adjacency, the move is forbidden.\n\nThe game ends when a player cannot make any legal moves on their turn. That player loses the game, and the other player wins.\n\nSuppose the game starts with the following initial configuration of the 7 lots:\n\n`R _ _ I _ _ R`\n\n(Here, `_` denotes an empty lot. The lots are indexed from left to right, so lot 1 is 'R', lot 4 is 'I', lot 7 is 'R', and lots 2, 3, 5, 6 are empty).\n\nAssuming both players play optimally to win, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The Planner has a winning strategy, which begins by zoning lot 2 as 'Residential'.\n\nB. The Planner has a winning strategy, which begins by zoning lot 3 as 'Industrial'.\n\nC. The Planner has a winning strategy, but it requires an opening move different from those described in options A and B.\n\nD. The Disruptor has a winning strategy, regardless of the Planner's first move.",
            "solution": "Model the position as a disjunctive sum of two independent segments of empty lots, each bounded by fixed endpoints that are already zoned. The initial configuration $R\\,\\_\\,\\_\\,I\\,\\_\\,\\_\\,R$ consists of two segments of length $2$ with opposite endpoints: lots $2$–$3$ are between $R$ and $I$, and lots $5$–$6$ are between $I$ and $R$. The game is impartial (both players have the same legal moves from any position) and uses normal play; therefore Sprague–Grundy theory applies. The overall Grundy value is the nim-sum of the Grundy values of the independent segments.\n\nDefine $g_{E}(n)$ as the Grundy number of a segment of $n$ consecutive empty lots with equal endpoints, and $g_{O}(n)$ for opposite endpoints. Base cases: $g_{E}(0)=0$ and $g_{O}(0)=0$ (no moves).\n\nFor $n=1$:\n- Equal endpoints: the unique legal move is to place the same zone as the endpoints, splitting into two empty segments of length $0$, so the option value is $0 \\oplus 0=0$, hence $g_{E}(1)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{0\\}=1$.\n- Opposite endpoints: placing either zone would be adjacent to an opposite zone on one side, so no legal moves exist; hence $g_{O}(1)=0$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n- Equal endpoints: at $j=1$ only the matching endpoint zone is legal, yielding left $0$ with equal endpoints and right $1$ with equal endpoints, so the option value is $0 \\oplus g_{E}(1)=1$. At $j=2$ similarly the option value is $g_{E}(1)\\oplus 0=1$. Therefore $g_{E}(2)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{1\\}=0$.\n- Opposite endpoints: at $j=1$ only the left endpoint’s zone is legal, splitting into left $0$ with equal endpoints and right $1$ with opposite endpoints, giving $0 \\oplus g_{O}(1)=0$. At $j=2$ only the right endpoint’s zone is legal, splitting into left $1$ with opposite endpoints and right $0$ with equal endpoints, giving $g_{O}(1)\\oplus 0=0$. Therefore $g_{O}(2)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{0\\}=1$.\n\nThus each of the two segments in the initial position has Grundy value $g_{O}(2)=1$, and the overall Grundy value is $1 \\oplus 1=0$. A nim-sum of $0$ is a previous-player win (a $\\mathcal{P}$-position); hence the next player (the Planner) is in a losing position with optimal play by the Disruptor. Concretely, any legal opening move by the Planner is to fill one of lots $2,3,5,6$ with the only allowed zone at that lot; this immediately blocks the other cell in that segment and leaves the other segment unchanged with $n=2$ and opposite endpoints. The Disruptor then fills the corresponding cell in the other segment (the only legal move there), after which no legal moves remain, so the Planner has no move and loses. Therefore the correct statement is that the Disruptor has a winning strategy regardless of the Planner’s first move.",
