            "introduction": "Many computational problems involve searching for pairs of elements that satisfy a certain condition. While a brute-force approach of checking every possible pair is straightforward, it is often inefficient. This exercise  introduces the elegant two-pointer technique, a classic algorithm that demonstrates how exploiting the structure of the input—in this case, a sorted list—can lead to a drastically more efficient, linear-time solution. Mastering this pattern is a first step toward thinking algorithmically about tractability and the nature of the complexity class P.",

            "problem": "A monitoring service for a distributed database system is designed to check for data corruption. The service periodically receives a batch of checksums from various data nodes. For a particular integrity check, the service needs to determine if any two distinct checksums in a given batch sum up to a specific master key. The checksums are always distinct positive integers and are provided as a sorted list in ascending order.\n\nAn engineer has implemented an efficient algorithm to perform this check. The algorithm is described as follows:\n1. Initialize two pointers: a `start` pointer at the beginning of the list (index 0) and an `end` pointer at the end of the list.\n2. While the `start` pointer is positioned before the `end` pointer, compute the sum of the numbers at the `start` and `end` positions.\n3. If this sum equals the master key, a pair has been found, and the algorithm terminates.\n4. If the sum is less than the master key, move the `start` pointer one position to the right (increment its index).\n5. If the sum is greater than the master key, move the `end` pointer one position to the left (decrement its index).\n6. If the `start` pointer and `end` pointer cross or meet, the algorithm terminates, as no pair has been found.\n\nConsider the following specific scenario:\n- The sorted list of checksums is `L = [3, 8, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26, 30, 33, 39]`.\n- The master key is `K = 44`.\n\nHow many sum computations does the described algorithm perform before it terminates for this specific input?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 9\n\nE. 10\n\nF. 45",

The algorithm initializes two pointers at the ends of the list and in each iteration computes exactly one sum $s=L_{\\text{start}}+L_{\\text{end}}$, then moves one pointer based on whether $s$ is less than or greater than $K$, or terminates if $s=K$. Let $c$ denote the number of sum computations performed.\n\nInitialize $\\text{start}=0$, $\\text{end}=9$, and $c=0$.\n- Iteration 1: Compute $s=L_{0}+L_{9}=3+39=42$.

This algorithm uses dynamic programming to fill a table that tells us which non-terminals can generate which substrings of the given string.\n\nLet the input string be $w = w_1 w_2 \\dots w_n$ of length $n$. We construct an $n \\times n$ table, $P$, where the entry $P[i,j]$ contains the set of non-terminal symbols that can generate the substring $w_i \\dots w_j$.
