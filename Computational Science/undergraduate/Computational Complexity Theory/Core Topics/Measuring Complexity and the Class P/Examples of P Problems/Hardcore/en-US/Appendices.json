            "problem": "A data integrity program is designed to test for the presence of duplicate entries within a dataset. The dataset is provided as a list containing $N$ distinct elements. The program implements a brute-force comparison algorithm to determine if any duplicates exist.\n\nThe algorithm operates as follows:\n1. It selects the first element of the list and compares it with every subsequent element (i.e., the second, third, ..., up to the $N$-th element).\n2. It then selects the second element and compares it with every element that follows it (i.e., the third, fourth, ..., up to the $N$-th element).\n3. This process is repeated. For any given $i$-th element (where $i$ ranges from 1 to $N-1$), it is compared against all elements from the $(i+1)$-th position to the $N$-th position.\n4. The last operation is the comparison of the $(N-1)$-th element with the $N$-th element.\n\nWhat is the exact total number of comparisons the program will perform on a list of $N$ elements? Express your answer as a function of $N$.",
            "solution": "Let $C(N)$ denote the total number of comparisons performed on a list of $N$ elements by the described algorithm. For each index $i$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq N-1$, the $i$-th element is compared with each element from positions $i+1$ through $N$, yielding $N - i$ comparisons at step $i$. Therefore,\n$$\nC(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (N - i).\n$$\nThis sum can be simplified by separating terms:\n$$\nC(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} N - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i = N(N-1) - \\frac{(N-1)N}{2}.\n$$\nCombining like terms gives\n$$\nC(N) = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}.\n$$\nEquivalently, this is the number of unordered pairs of distinct indices from $\\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\}$, which is $\\binom{N}{2}$, and evaluates to the same expression $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$.",

            "introduction": "Many problems in computer science, from compiling code to parsing data, involve recognizing and processing structured patterns. This problem, framed within a hypothetical physical notation, explores the classic task of verifying properly nested symbols—a problem efficiently solvable in linear time, $O(N)$. This exercise  illustrates how a simple data structure like a stack can lead to highly efficient algorithms, placing such problems squarely within the class $P$.",

            "problem": "In theoretical particle physics, a simplified notation called the Chiral-Symmetry Description Language (CSDL) is used to represent the topology of certain quantum field interactions. An expression in CSDL is a string composed of three types of symbol pairs: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`.\n\nAn expression is considered \"well-formed\" if it meets the following criteria:\n1.  Every opening symbol (`(`, `[`, or `{`) has a corresponding closing symbol (`)`, `]`, or `}`) of the same type.\n2.  The pairs of symbols are properly nested. This means that for any two pairs of symbols, one must be completely inside the other, or they must be completely separate. For example, `[()]` is well-formed, but `[(])` is not.\n\nWhen a well-formed expression is evaluated, each correctly matched pair of symbols \"resolves\" and contributes to the expression's total \"Symmetry Integrity Score\". The score contribution depends on the symbol type:\n- A resolved `()` pair contributes 2 points.\n- A resolved `[]` pair contributes 3 points.\n- A resolved `{}` pair contributes 5 points.\n\nThe total Symmetry Integrity Score of an expression is the sum of the scores from all resolved pairs within it. If an expression is not well-formed, its structure is considered unstable, and its Symmetry Integrity Score is defined to be 0.\n\nCalculate the total Symmetry Integrity Score for the following CSDL expression:\n`S = \"{[()([{}])]({[]})}\"`",
            "solution": "A well-formed expression can be validated by matching each closing symbol with the most recent unmatched opening symbol of the same type (stack principle). Tracking matches in the string $S$ from left to right yields the following matched index pairs:\n- Parentheses: $\\{(3,4),(5,10),(12,17)\\}$, so $n_{p}=3$.\n- Square brackets: $\\{(6,9),(2,11),(14,15)\\}$, so $n_{s}=3$.\n- Curly braces: $\\{(7,8),(13,16),(1,18)\\}$, so $n_{c}=3$.\nSince every symbol is matched and properly nested, the expression is well-formed. The total Symmetry Integrity Score is the sum over all resolved pairs, with weights $2$ for $()$, $3$ for $[]$, and $5$ for $\\{\\}$:\n$$T=2n_{p}+3n_{s}+5n_{c}=2\\cdot 3+3\\cdot 3+5\\cdot 3=6+9+15=30.$$",

This problem on the game of Nim is a prime example, where a deep mathematical property transforms the task of finding a winning move into a simple calculation.

The agent who takes the very last stone from the last remaining pile wins the game.

An agent with an optimal strategy will always move to a losing position if possible.\n\nConsider a game state with four piles of stones. The sizes of the piles are 25, 20, 12, and 5. It is currently one agent's turn to move. To ensure a win, this agent must make a move that leaves the other agent in a losing position.
