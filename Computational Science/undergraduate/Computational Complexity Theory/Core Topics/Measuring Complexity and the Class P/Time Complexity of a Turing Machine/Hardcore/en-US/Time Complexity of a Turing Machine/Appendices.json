This exercise provides a foundational example of a Turing Machine that decides a language by making a single pass over the input tape. By analyzing this straightforward, left-to-right process, you'll grasp the essence of linear time complexity, $O(n)$, and establish a baseline for evaluating more intricate algorithms. ",

Examples of strings in $L$ include the empty string, \"0\", \"1\", \"010\", and \"10101\". An input string $w$ of length $n = |w|$ is placed on the otherwise blank tape. The TM starts with its read/write head on the leftmost symbol of $w$. If $w$ is the empty string, the head starts on a blank symbol, $\\sqcup$.\n\nThe TM is deterministic and operates according to the following high-level description:\n\n1.  The TM begins in a starting state, $q_{start}$.\n2.  If the symbol under the head is the blank symbol, $\\sqcup$, it transitions to the halt-accept state, $q_{accept}$. This handles the case of the empty string.\n3.  If the symbol is '0', it transitions to a state $q_{expect\\_1}$ and moves its head one cell to the right.\n4.  If the symbol is '1', it transitions to a state $q_{expect\\_0}$ and moves its head one cell to the right.\n5.  When in state $q_{expect\\_1}$:\n    a.

Once the TM enters $q_{accept}$ or $q_{reject}$, it halts.\n\nA single computational step for this TM consists of reading a symbol, changing the state, and moving the head (or halting).

            "solution": "Let $n$ denote the input length with $n>0$. Define $S(w)$ as the number of computational steps on input $w$, and define the worst-case time complexity as $T(n)=\\max_{|w|=n}S(w)$.\n\nEach computational step consists of reading the current symbol, changing state, and moving the head one cell to the right (or halting). The given transition rules ensure that the TM never moves left; it scans strictly left-to-right and halts either upon detecting a mismatch or upon seeing the blank symbol after the last input symbol.\n\nFor any nonempty input $w$ with $|w|=n$:\n- At position $1$, in state $q_{start}$, the machine reads $w_{1}$, transitions to either $q_{expect\\_1}$ or $q_{expect\\_0}$, and moves right. This is $1$ step.\n- For each subsequent position $i$ with $2 \\leq i \\leq n$, if the prefix up to $w_{i}$ is consistent with alternation, the machine reads $w_{i}$, transitions between $q_{expect\\_0}$ and $q_{expect\\_1}$, and moves right. Each such position contributes exactly $1$ step. If a violation occurs at position $i$, the machine transitions to $q_{reject}$ and halts, so $S(w)=i$ in that case.\n- If no violation occurs through position $n$, then after the $n$-th step the head is on the blank cell to the right of the input, and the machine performs exactly one final step on $\\sqcup$ to enter $q_{accept}$ and halt. Thus, for an alternating string, $S(w)=n+1$.\n\nHence, the worst-case arises when $w$ is perfectly alternating, yielding\n$$\nT(n)=\\max_{|w|=n}S(w)=n+1.\n$$\nTherefore, in Big-O notation,\n$$\nT(n)\\in O(n).\n$$\nAmong the given choices, this corresponds to option C.",

This next practice introduces a more sophisticated algorithm that involves multiple passes, where each pass systematically reduces the size of the problem.

The input is a string $w$ of length $n$, composed of symbols from the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{a, b\\}$. The tape alphabet is $\\Gamma = \\{a, b, \\dot{a}, \\dot{b}, \\sqcup\\}$, where $\\dot{a}$ and $\\dot{b}$ are \"marked\" versions of $a$ and $b$, and $\\sqcup$ is the blank symbol.\n\nInitially, the tape contains ...$\\sqcup w \\sqcup$... and the tape head is at the first symbol of $w$.

            "solution": "We count primitive tape-head actions: each read, each write, and each single-cell move counts as one step. Let the input length be $n$. During the $i$-th iteration of the main loop (with $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$), the tape before writing the copy has $n+(i-1)$ non-blank symbols; after writing the $i$-th copied symbol it has $n+i$ non-blank symbols.\n\nFor iteration $i$, decompose the cost $T_{i}$ into four parts corresponding to steps (a)–(d):\n\n- Step (a): From the left end (first symbol) to the first unmarked symbol (which is the $i$-th symbol), the head examines $i$ cells, moving right over the first $i-1$ marked cells and stopping on the $i$-th. This entails $i$ reads, $(i-1)$ right moves, and $1$ write to mark, for\n$$\nA_{i} = i + (i-1) + 1 = 2i.\n$$\n\n- Step (b): From position $i$ to the first blank to the right, the head must traverse exactly $n$ positions (the remaining $n-i$ original symbols and the previously appended $i-1$ symbols, plus one move into the blank). Each traversal step consists of one move and one read, so\n$$\nB_{i} = n + n = 2n.\n$$\n\n- Step (c): Writing the symbol $\\sigma$ in the blank is a single write:\n$$\nC_{i} = 1.\n$$\n\n- Step (d): Returning to the first (leftmost) symbol is achieved by moving left until the left blank is seen and then moving right once to the first symbol. After step (c), there are $n+i$ non-blank symbols. Hence moving from the rightmost non-blank to the left blank takes $(n+i)$ left moves with $(n+i)$ reads, then one right move and one read to land on and recognize the first symbol. Thus\n$$\nD_{i} = (n+i) + (n+i) + 1 + 1 = 2(n+i) + 2.\n$$\n\nSumming these four contributions for iteration $i$ gives\n$$\nT_{i} = A_{i} + B_{i} + C_{i} + D_{i} = 2i + 2n + 1 + 2(n+i) + 2 = 4n + 4i + 3.\n$$\n\nThe main loop total is therefore\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(4n + 4i + 3\\right) = 4n^{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 3n = 6n^{2} + 5n,\n$$\nwhich is $O(n^{2})$.\n\nCleanup phase: After the main loop, the tape holds $\\dot{w}w$ with $|\\dot{w}| = n$. The final scan replaces each marked symbol by its unmarked version in a single left-to-right pass across the first $n$ cells. This uses a constant number of steps per cell (one read, one write, and moves between adjacent cells), so the cleanup cost is $O(n)$.\n\nCombining both parts, the overall time complexity is\n$$\nO(n^{2}) + O(n) = O(n^{2}).\n$$\n\nFor completeness, there is also a matching lower bound: each iteration necessarily moves from somewhere near the left to the far right end and back across a tape segment of length $\\Theta(n+i)$, so the total number of moves is at least on the order of $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} n = \\Theta(n^{2})$. Thus the algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n^{2})$, and in Big-O notation the time complexity is $O(n^{2})$.",
