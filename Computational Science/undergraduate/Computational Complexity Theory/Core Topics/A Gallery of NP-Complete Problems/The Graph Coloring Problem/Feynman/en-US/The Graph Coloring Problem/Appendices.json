            "solution": "We use the defining property of bipartite graphs and the definition of chromatic number.\n\n1) Upper bound: Since $K_{m,n}$ is bipartite with partition $V_{1}$ of size $m$ and partition $V_{2}$ of size $n$, by definition there are no edges within $V_{1}$ or within $V_{2}$, and every edge goes between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$. Assign one color, say color $a$, to every vertex in $V_{1}$ and a second color, say color $b$, to every vertex in $V_{2}$. Because there are no edges within the same part, no adjacent vertices share a color. Hence a valid $2$-coloring exists, so $\\chi(K_{m,n}) \\leq 2$.\n\n2) Lower bound: Because $m \\geq 1$ and $n \\geq 1$, there exists at least one edge in $K_{m,n}$ (indeed, every vertex of $V_{1}$ is adjacent to every vertex of $V_{2}$). Any proper coloring that uses only one color would assign the same color to the endpoints of this edge, which would violate the condition that adjacent vertices receive distinct colors. Therefore no $1$-coloring exists, and $\\chi(K_{m,n}) \\geq 2$.\n\nCombining the bounds, $\\chi(K_{m,n}) = 2$.",

A cycle $C_{n}$ has no triangles unless $n=3$, so $C_{5}$ is triangle-free. To determine $\\chi(G_{A})$, note that a graph is $2$-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. A cycle is bipartite if and only if its length is even. Since $5$ is odd, $C_{5}$ is not bipartite, hence not $2$-colorable. It is $3$-colorable, for example by assigning colors $a,b,a,b,c$ to $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}$ respectively, which gives a proper coloring. Therefore $\\chi(G_{A})=3$, and $G_{A}$ is triangle-free.\n\nGraph $G_{B}$ is the $6$-cycle $C_{6}$. It is triangle-free because the only cycles present have length $6$.

A common heuristic to find a coloring for a graph is the greedy coloring algorithm.\n\nThe greedy coloring algorithm works as follows: Given a simple graph $G=(V, E)$ and a predetermined ordering of its vertices $\\sigma = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)$, the algorithm processes the vertices one by one according to this order. For each vertex $v_i$, it assigns the smallest positive integer (color) that has not already been assigned to any of its neighbors that appear before it in the ordering $\\sigma$. This smallest available color is formally known as the minimum excluded value or 'mex' of the set of its neighbors' colors.\n\nConsider a simple graph $G$ constructed with a set of 14 vertices, $V = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_7\\} \\cup \\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_7\\}$.
