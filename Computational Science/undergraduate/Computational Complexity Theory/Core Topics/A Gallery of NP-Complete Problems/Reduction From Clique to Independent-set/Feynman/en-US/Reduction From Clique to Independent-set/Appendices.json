This practice problem illuminates the core conceptual link of the reduction: a clique in a graph $G$ corresponds precisely to an independent set of the same size in its complement, $\\bar{G}$.

            "problem": "In graph theory, we can define several properties of a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.\n- A **clique** is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are adjacent (connected by an edge). The size of a clique is the number of vertices in it.\n- An **independent set** (or stable set) is a subset of vertices where no two vertices in the subset are adjacent. The size of an independent set is the number of vertices in it.\n- The **complement** of a graph $G$, denoted $\\bar{G}$, is a graph with the same vertex set $V$, but where an edge exists between two distinct vertices if and only if there is *no* edge between them in $G$.\n\nThe computational problems of finding the largest clique (CLIQUE) and the largest independent set (INDEPENDENT-SET) are fundamental in complexity theory. A standard method connects these two problems through the concept of the graph complement.\n\nConsider the cycle graph on 5 vertices, denoted $C_5$. This graph consists of 5 vertices, which can be labeled $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$, arranged in a cycle. The edges are $(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5),$ and $(v_5, v_1)$.\n\nLet $S_{max}$ be the size of the largest possible clique in the graph $C_5$.

            "solution": "We recall the definitions. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, the complement is $\\bar{G}=(V,\\bar{E})$ where for distinct $u,v \\in V$, $(u,v) \\in \\bar{E}$ if and only if $(u,v) \\notin E$. A clique in $G$ is a subset $K \\subseteq V$ such that for all distinct $u,v \\in K$, $(u,v) \\in E$. An independent set in a graph $H$ is a subset $I \\subseteq V(H)$ such that for all distinct $u,v \\in I$, $(u,v) \\notin E(H)$.\n\nConsider any clique $K \\subseteq V$ in $G$. By definition, for all distinct $u,v \\in K$, $(u,v) \\in E$. By the definition of complement, this is equivalent to $(u,v) \\notin \\bar{E}$. Therefore, in $\\bar{G}$, there are no edges among the vertices of $K$, so $K$ is an independent set in $\\bar{G}$. Hence, every clique in $G$ becomes an independent set in $\\bar{G}$, with the same cardinality.\n\nConversely, consider any independent set $I \\subseteq V$ in $\\bar{G}$. For all distinct $u,v \\in I$, $(u,v) \\notin \\bar{E}$, which by the complement definition is equivalent to $(u,v) \\in E$. Therefore, $I$ is a clique in $G$. Hence, every independent set in $\\bar{G}$ corresponds to a clique in $G$, again preserving cardinality.\n\nThese two constructions are inverses of each other on vertex subsets, establishing a size-preserving bijection between cliques in $G$ and independent sets in $\\bar{G}$. Therefore, if $\\omega(G)$ denotes the size of a largest clique in $G$ and $\\alpha(H)$ denotes the size of a largest independent set in a graph $H$, then\n$$\n\\omega(G) = \\alpha(\\bar{G}).\n$$\nSpecializing to $G=C_{5}$ gives $S_{\\max}=\\omega(C_{5})=\\alpha(\\overline{C_{5}})$.
