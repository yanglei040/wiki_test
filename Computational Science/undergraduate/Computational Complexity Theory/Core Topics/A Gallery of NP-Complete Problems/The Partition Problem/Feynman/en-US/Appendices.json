            "problem": "The PARTITION problem is a classic question in computer science that asks whether a given multiset of positive integers can be split into two disjoint subsets, say $S_1$ and $S_2$, such that the sum of the numbers in $S_1$ is equal to the sum of the numbers in $S_2$. While finding such a partition can be a computationally hard task, there is a very simple and quick preliminary check that can sometimes immediately prove that no such partition exists.\n\nConsider the following five multisets of integers:\nA. $S_A = \\{1, 5, 11, 5\\}$\n\nB. $S_B = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$\n\nC. $S_C = \\{7, 13, 2, 4, 9\\}$\n\nD. $S_D = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n\nE. $S_E = \\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\}$\n\nWhich one of these multisets can be identified as having no solution to the PARTITION problem by applying only this most basic, initial check?",
            "solution": "The basic preliminary check for the PARTITION problem is that if a multiset can be split into two subsets with equal sum, then the total sum must be even. Formally, if the total sum is $T$ and the two subset sums are equal, then $T = S_{1} + S_{2}$ with $S_{1} = S_{2}$ implies $T = 2S_{1}$, which is even. Therefore, if $T$ is odd, no such partition exists.\n\nCompute the total sums:\n$$\\sum S_{A} = 1 + 5 + 11 + 5 = 22 \\text{ (even)}$$\n$$\\sum S_{B} = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30 \\text{ (even)}$$\n$$\\sum S_{C} = 7 + 13 + 2 + 4 + 9 = 35 \\text{ (odd)}$$\n$$\\sum S_{D} = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 \\text{ (even)}$$\n$$\\sum S_{E} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \\text{ (even)}$$\n\nOnly $S_{C}$ has an odd total sum, so by this initial check it cannot have a partition into two subsets with equal sum.",

            "problem": "In a high-performance computing cluster, a set of tasks must be distributed between two identical, parallel processing pipelines. A distribution is considered 'perfectly balanced' if the sum of the computational weights of the tasks assigned to each pipeline is exactly equal. For a given set of tasks, this is only possible if the set can be partitioned into two subsets of equal total weight, a classic problem in computer science.\n\nYou are given a set of four tasks whose computational weights are defined in terms of a positive integer parameter $k$. The set of weights is $W = \\{k, 2k, 3k-5, k^2 - 10k + 40\\}$. The system is being tested for integer values of the parameter $k$ where $k \\ge 10$. All computational weights are guaranteed to be positive integers for this range of $k$.\n\nThere is a well-known condition involving the single largest weight in a set that can, in some cases, immediately prove that a perfect partition is impossible, without needing to attempt the full, computationally expensive partitioning algorithm.\n\nDetermine the smallest integer value of $k \\ge 10$ for which this condition is met, thereby providing a conclusive proof that the set of tasks $W$ cannot be perfectly balanced.",
            "solution": "Let the given set of computational weights be $S$. For this set to be partitionable into two subsets of equal weight, let's call them $S_1$ and $S_2$, the sum of weights in each subset must be equal. Let $T$ be the total sum of all weights in $S$. A necessary condition for a partition to exist is that $T$ must be an even number, and the sum of each subset must be exactly $T/2$.\n\nThe problem refers to another condition involving the largest element in the set. Let $m_{max}$ be the largest weight in the set $S$. If we try to form a partition, $m_{max}$ must belong to one of the subsets, say $S_1$. For the sum of weights in $S_1$ to be $T/2$, the other elements in $S_1$ must sum to $T/2 - m_{max}$. Since all weights are positive, this is only possible if $T/2 - m_{max} \\ge 0$, which implies $m_{max} \\le T/2$.\n\nTherefore, a necessary condition for a partition to exist is that the largest element must be less than or equal to half of the total sum. If $m_{max} > T/2$, it is conclusively proven that no such partition exists. We need to find the smallest integer $k \\ge 10$ for which this condition, $m_{max} > T/2$, is met.\n\nThe set of weights is $W = \\{k, 2k, 3k-5, k^2 - 10k + 40\\}$. We are given that $k \\ge 10$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the largest element, $m_{max}$, in the set for $k \\ge 10$. Let's compare the elements:\n- Comparing $k^2 - 10k + 40$ with $3k-5$: Consider the difference $f(k) = (k^2 - 10k + 40) - (3k-5) = k^2 - 13k + 45$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta = (-13)^2 - 4(1)(45) = 169 - 180 = -11$. Since the leading coefficient is positive and the discriminant is negative, $f(k)$ is always positive. Thus, $k^2 - 10k + 40 > 3k-5$ for all $k$.\n- Since $k \\ge 10$, we have $3k-5 > 2k$ (as $k>5$) and $2k > k$.\n- By transitivity, $k^2 - 10k + 40$ is the largest element for all $k$, and specifically for $k \\ge 10$.\nSo, $m_{max}(k) = k^2 - 10k + 40$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total sum of the weights, $T(k)$:\n$T(k) = k + 2k + (3k-5) + (k^2 - 10k + 40)$\n$T(k) = k^2 + (1+2+3-10)k + (-5+40)$\n$T(k) = k^2 - 4k + 35$\n\nNow we apply the impossibility condition: $m_{max}(k) > T(k)/2$.\n$k^2 - 10k + 40 > \\frac{k^2 - 4k + 35}{2}$\n\nTo solve this inequality, we multiply both sides by 2:\n$2(k^2 - 10k + 40) > k^2 - 4k + 35$\n$2k^2 - 20k + 80 > k^2 - 4k + 35$\n\nRearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:\n$2k^2 - k^2 - 20k + 4k + 80 - 35 > 0$\n$k^2 - 16k + 45 > 0$\n\nTo find when this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding equation $k^2 - 16k + 45 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $k = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$k = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{(-16)^2 - 4(1)(45)}}{2(1)}$\n$k = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{256 - 180}}{2}$\n$k = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{76}}{2}$\n$k = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\times 19}}{2} = \\frac{16 \\pm 2\\sqrt{19}}{2}$\n$k = 8 \\pm \\sqrt{19}$\n\nThe two roots are $k_1 = 8 - \\sqrt{19}$ and $k_2 = 8 + \\sqrt{19}$.\nWe know that $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, so $4 < \\sqrt{19} < 5$. Approximately, $\\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$.\n$k_1 \\approx 8 - 4.359 = 3.641$\n$k_2 \\approx 8 + 4.359 = 12.359$\n\nThe quadratic $k^2 - 16k + 45$ is an upward-opening parabola, so it is positive ($>0$) when $k$ is outside the roots, i.e., $k < k_1$ or $k > k_2$.\nSo, the impossibility condition is met for $k < 8 - \\sqrt{19}$ or $k > 8 + \\sqrt{19}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer value of $k \\ge 10$ that satisfies this condition.\nThe first part of the solution, $k < 8 - \\sqrt{19} \\approx 3.641$, is not in the domain $k \\ge 10$.\nWe must look for solutions in the second part, $k > 8 + \\sqrt{19} \\approx 12.359$.\nWe need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $k \\ge 10$ and $k > 12.359$.\nThe integers satisfying $k > 12.359$ are $13, 14, 15, \\ldots$.\nThe smallest integer in this list is 13. This value also satisfies $k \\ge 10$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer value of $k \\ge 10$ for which the condition is met is 13.",

Such a partition is called a \"perfect partition\". The PARTITION problem is NP-hard, meaning there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently for all inputs.\n\nA common approach to this problem is a greedy heuristic known as the \"largest-first\" method. This heuristic works as follows: first, sort the numbers in the set $S$ in descending order. Then, iterate through the sorted numbers, placing each one into whichever of the two subsets currently has the smaller sum. If the sums are equal, the number can be placed in either subset.\n\nWhile this heuristic is simple, it does not always find a perfect partition even when one exists.

The total sum is $7+6+5+4=22$, so each subset must sum to $11$. A perfect partition exists: $\\{7,4\\}$ and $\\{6,5\\}$ both sum to $11$. Simulating greedy on the sorted order $7,6,5,4$:\n- Start with $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ sums $0$ and $0$.
