A $k$-clique in such a graph is a subset of $k$ vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. In the context of a social network, a 3-clique represents a group of three individuals who all mutually know each other.\n\nYou are tasked with analyzing the computational cost of finding such a group.

The problem of finding the maximum clique (the largest possible clique in a graph) is known to be computationally difficult. However, heuristic algorithms can quickly find a clique that is large, though not necessarily of maximum size.\n\nConsider an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with the vertex set $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\}$ and the edge set $E$ containing the following 16 edges:\n$E = \\{\\{A,B\\}, \\{A,E\\}, \\{A,F\\}, \\{A,H\\}, \\{B,D\\}, \\{B,E\\}, \\{B,F\\}, \\{B,H\\}, \\{C,G\\}, \\{C,H\\}, \\{D,E\\}, \\{D,F\\}, \\{D,H\\}, \\{E,G\\}, \\{E,H\\}, \\{G,H\\}\\}$.\n\nYou are to find a clique in this graph by applying the following greedy algorithm:\n\n1.
