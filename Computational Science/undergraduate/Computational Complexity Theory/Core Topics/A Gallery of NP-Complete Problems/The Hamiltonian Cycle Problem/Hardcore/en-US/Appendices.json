            "introduction": "Understanding the scale of the Hamiltonian Cycle problem begins with a simple question: how many possible cycles exist? This exercise () asks you to calculate the number of unique Hamiltonian cycles in a complete graph, a fundamental scenario where every vertex is connected to every other. By solving this, you will grasp the combinatorial nature of the problem and the importance of accounting for symmetries when counting potential solutions.",

            "problem": "A travel company is designing luxury tour packages for a region with six major cities. The transportation network is so well-developed that there is a direct, dedicated high-speed rail line connecting every single pair of cities.\n\nThe company wants to offer a \"Grand Circular Tour,\" which is a non-stop itinerary that starts in one city, visits every other city exactly once, and then returns to the starting city. For the purpose of marketing, two itineraries are considered identical if they trace the same path of rail lines, regardless of the starting city or the direction of travel. For example, an itinerary that visits cities in the order A-B-C-D-E-F-A is considered the same as the itinerary C-D-E-F-A-B-C, and also the same as the reverse itinerary A-F-E-D-C-B-A.\n\nCalculate the total number of unique \"Grand Circular Tour\" itineraries the company can offer.",
            "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of cities. Because every pair of cities is directly connected, the network is the complete graph $K_{n}$, and a \"Grand Circular Tour\" corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nConsider labeling the cities and counting linear orderings of all $n$ cities; there are $n!$ such permutations. Each unique undirected cycle is represented multiple times among these permutations:\n- Any cycle can be started from any of its $n$ cities, giving a factor of $n$.\n- Each cycle can be traversed in two directions (clockwise or counterclockwise), giving a factor of $2$.\n\nTherefore, each distinct tour corresponds to $2n$ linear permutations. The number of unique tours is\n$$\n\\frac{n!}{2n}=\\frac{(n-1)!}{2}.\n$$\nFor $n=6$,\n$$\n\\frac{(6-1)!}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2}=\\frac{120}{2}=60.\n$$\nThus, the total number of unique \"Grand Circular Tour\" itineraries is $60$.",

            "problem": "In graph theory, a graph $G$ is defined by a pair of sets $(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices. A special type of graph is a **complete bipartite graph**, denoted $K_{m,n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. In such a graph, the vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets, $U$ and $W$, such that $|U|=m$ and $|W|=n$. An edge connects a vertex in $U$ to a vertex in $W$; in fact, for every vertex $u \\in U$ and every vertex $w \\in W$, the edge $(u,w)$ exists in $E$. No edges exist between vertices within the same partition.\n\nA **Hamiltonian cycle** is a closed loop in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nGiven a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, which of the following conditions on the integers $m$ and $n$ is both necessary and sufficient for the graph to possess a Hamiltonian cycle?\n\nA. $m = n$ and $m \\ge 2$\n\nB. $m$ and $n$ are both positive even integers.\n\nC. $m+n$ is an even integer and $m, n \\ge 2$.\n\nD. $m \\ge 2$ and $n \\ge 2$.\n\nE. $m=n$ and $m \\ge 1$.",
            "solution": "We analyze necessary conditions first. In any bipartite graph with partition sets $U$ and $W$, every cycle must alternate between vertices in $U$ and $W$, since no edge joins two vertices within the same partition. Therefore, any cycle has an even number of vertices, containing equally many vertices from $U$ and from $W$.\n\nIf the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, that cycle visits every vertex exactly once and hence includes all $m$ vertices of $U$ and all $n$ vertices of $W$. By the alternation property, the number of vertices from $U$ on the cycle must equal the number from $W$, which forces\n$$\nm = n.\n$$\nMoreover, a cycle in a simple bipartite graph must have length at least $4$, so we must have at least two vertices in each part. Thus a Hamiltonian cycle in $K_{m,n}$ necessitates\n$$\nm = n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m \\ge 2.\n$$\n\nWe now show sufficiency. Assume $m = n$ with $n \\ge 2$. Label the vertices as $U = \\{u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{n}\\}$ and $W = \\{w_{1}, w_{2}, \\ldots, w_{n}\\}$. In $K_{n,n}$ every pair $(u_{i}, w_{j})$ is an edge. Consider the closed walk\n$$\nu_{1} \\to w_{1} \\to u_{2} \\to w_{2} \\to \\cdots \\to u_{n} \\to w_{n} \\to u_{1}.\n$$\nEach step uses an edge between $U$ and $W$, which exists in $K_{n,n}$. This walk visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, hence it is a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nTherefore, the condition $m = n$ and $m \\ge 2$ is both necessary and sufficient for $K_{m,n}$ to have a Hamiltonian cycle, which corresponds to option A.",

This problem () challenges you to distinguish between Hamiltonian cycles (visiting every vertex) and Eulerian cycles (traversing every edge). By analyzing specific graphs to find one that possesses a Hamiltonian but not an Eulerian cycle, you will solidify your understanding of both definitions and gain insight into why one has a simple characterization while the other defines a famously difficult computational problem.",

A fundamental theorem states that a connected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex in $V$ has an even degree.\n\nA **Hamiltonian cycle** is a cycle that visits every vertex in $V$ exactly once (except for the start/end vertex, which is visited twice).

            "solution": "We use the following facts:\n1) A connected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.\n2) A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once (with the start vertex appearing again to close the cycle). A necessary condition for Hamiltonicity is that the graph is 2-connected; in particular, a graph with a cut-vertex cannot be Hamiltonian. For complete bipartite graphs, $K_{m,n}$ has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if $m=n\\geq 2$.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n\nOption A: The graph is the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ with bipartition $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{4,5,6\\}$. Each vertex has degree $3$, so there are vertices of odd degree; hence, by the Eulerian criterion, there is no Eulerian cycle. Since it is $K_{3,3}$ with equal part sizes at least $2$, it has a Hamiltonian cycle; for example, the 6-cycle $1-4-2-5-3-6-1$ alternates between the parts and visits every vertex exactly once before returning to the start. Therefore, A has a Hamiltonian cycle but not an Eulerian cycle.\n\nOption B: The graph is the 5-cycle $C_{5}$. Every vertex has degree $2$, so all degrees are even and the graph is connected; thus it has an Eulerian cycle. The cycle itself visits all vertices exactly once, so it also has a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, B has both Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycles and does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nOption C: The graph consists of two triangles $1-2-3-1$ and $1-4-5-1$ sharing the single vertex $1$. Degrees are $\\deg(1)=4$ and $\\deg(2)=\\deg(3)=\\deg(4)=\\deg(5)=2$, so all degrees are even and the connected graph has an Eulerian cycle. However, vertex $1$ is a cut-vertex that separates $\\{2,3\\}$ from $\\{4,5\\}$; a Hamiltonian graph must be 2-connected, so this graph cannot be Hamiltonian. Equivalently, any Hamiltonian cycle would need to include both sides, but can only pass through vertex $1$ once with exactly two incident edges, which is insufficient to connect both separated subgraphs in a single simple cycle. Therefore, C has an Eulerian cycle but no Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nOption D: The graph is the path $1-2-3-4$. Vertices $1$ and $4$ have degree $1$, so not all degrees are even; there is no Eulerian cycle. The graph has no cycle at all, so it cannot have a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, D has neither.\n\nThe only graph that has a Hamiltonian cycle but not an Eulerian cycle is A.",
