The server has an available capacity of 10 GB of RAM. There are three pending jobs, each with a specific RAM requirement and an associated priority value, which represents its importance. The goal is to choose a subset of these jobs to run simultaneously such that their total RAM requirement does not exceed the server's capacity and the sum of the priority values of the chosen jobs is maximized.\n\nThe three jobs are:\n- Job 1: Priority Value = 10, RAM Requirement = 10 GB\n- Job 2: Priority Value = 6, RAM Requirement = 5 GB\n- Job 3: Priority Value = 6, RAM Requirement = 5 GB\n\nConsider a simple greedy strategy for job selection: always select the available job with the highest priority value first, and continue this process until no more jobs can be added without exceeding the RAM capacity.\n\nLet $V_{greedy}$ be the total priority value obtained by applying this \"highest-priority-first\" greedy strategy.\nLet $V_{optimal}$ be the maximum possible total priority value that can be achieved with any valid combination of jobs.\n\nWhich of the following options represents the correct ordered pair $(V_{greedy}, V_{optimal})$?\n\nA.
