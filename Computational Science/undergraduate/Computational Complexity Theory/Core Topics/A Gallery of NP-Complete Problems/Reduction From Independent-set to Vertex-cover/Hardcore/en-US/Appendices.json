            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the relationship between different graph problems is a central theme. Two fundamental concepts are the independent set and the vertex cover. An **independent set** of a graph is a subset of its vertices where no two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. The size of a largest possible independent set in a graph $G$ is called the independence number, denoted by $\\alpha(G)$. A **vertex cover** of a graph is a subset of its vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to (i.e., touches) at least one vertex in the subset. The size of a smallest possible vertex cover in a graph $G$ is called the vertex cover number, denoted by $\\tau(G)$.\n\nConsider a graph $G = (V, E)$ that has a set of vertices $V$ with size $|V|=73$, and an empty set of edges $E = \\emptyset$. This type of graph is often called an \"empty graph\" or an \"edgeless graph\". Based on the definitions provided, determine the independence number $\\alpha(G)$ and the vertex cover number $\\tau(G)$ for this specific graph.\n\nSelect the correct pair of values from the options below.\n\nA. $\\alpha(G) = 0$, $\\tau(G) = 0$\n\nB. $\\alpha(G) = 73$, $\\tau(G) = 73$\n\nC. $\\alpha(G) = 0$, $\\tau(G) = 73$\n\nD. $\\alpha(G) = 1$, $\\tau(G) = 72$\n\nE. $\\alpha(G) = 73$, $\\tau(G) = 0$",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the independence number, $\\alpha(G)$, and the vertex cover number, $\\tau(G)$, for an empty graph $G=(V, E)$ with $n = |V| = 73$ vertices and no edges, i.e., $E = \\emptyset$. We will determine each value by applying its definition.\n\nFirst, let's find the independence number, $\\alpha(G)$.\nAn independent set is a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ such that for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in S$, the edge $(u, v)$ is not in $E$. The independence number, $\\alpha(G)$, is the size of the largest such set.\nIn our graph $G$, the set of edges $E$ is empty. This means that for any pair of vertices $u, v \\in V$, the edge $(u,v)$ does not exist. Consequently, the condition for being an independent set is satisfied by *any* subset of vertices. To find the independence number $\\alpha(G)$, we need to find the size of the largest possible independent set. Since every subset of vertices is an independent set, the largest one is the set of all vertices, $V$, itself.\nThe size of this set is $|V| = 73$.\nTherefore, the independence number is $\\alpha(G) = 73$.\n\nNext, let's find the vertex cover number, $\\tau(G)$.\nA vertex cover is a subset of vertices $S' \\subseteq V$ such that every edge $e \\in E$ is incident to at least one vertex in $S'$. The vertex cover number, $\\tau(G)$, is the size of the smallest such set.\nIn our graph $G$, the set of edges $E$ is empty. The condition for a vertex cover states that \"every edge in $E$ must be covered\". Since there are no edges in $E$, this condition is vacuously true for any subset $S' \\subseteq V$. This is a logical principle: a statement \"for all $x$ in set $A$, property $P(x)$ is true\" is always true if the set $A$ is empty.\nWe are looking for the *smallest* vertex cover. Since any subset of vertices is a valid vertex cover, we must find the one with the minimum possible size. The smallest subset of $V$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. Let's check if $S' = \\emptyset$ is a vertex cover. Yes, it is, because the condition that it must cover all edges in $E$ is vacuously satisfied as $E$ is empty.\nThe size of the empty set is $|\\emptyset| = 0$.\nSince the size of a set cannot be negative, this is the minimum possible size for a vertex cover.\nTherefore, the vertex cover number is $\\tau(G) = 0$.\n\nCombining our results, we have $\\alpha(G) = 73$ and $\\tau(G) = 0$. Comparing this with the given options:\nA. $\\alpha(G) = 0$, $\\tau(G) = 0$ - Incorrect.\nB. $\\alpha(G) = 73$, $\\tau(G) = 73$ - Incorrect.\nC. $\\alpha(G) = 0$, $\\tau(G) = 73$ - Incorrect.\nD. $\\alpha(G) = 1$, $\\tau(G) = 72$ - Incorrect.\nE. $\\alpha(G) = 73$, $\\tau(G) = 0$ - Correct.\n\nThis result is consistent with Gallai's identity, a theorem in graph theory which states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $\\alpha(G) + \\tau(G) = n$. In our case, $73 + 0 = 73$, which matches the number of vertices in the graph.",

Choosing any single vertex gives an independent set of size $1$, hence\n$$\\alpha(K_{17})=1.$$\n\nSmallest Dominating Group as defined in the problem: The stated condition “every edge has at least one endpoint in the subset” is the definition of a vertex cover. A vertex cover $C \\subseteq V$ satisfies: for every edge $uv \\in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ lies in $C$.\n\nIn $K_{n}$, taking $C=V \\setminus \\{v\\}$ for any single vertex $v$ yields a vertex cover of size $n-1$, since any edge either has at least one endpoint different from $v$ (hence in $C$) or both endpoints lie in $C$.

Explicitly, each edge is incident to one of $v_{2},v_{4},v_{6}$.\n- Option B: $I = \\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ is not independent because $(v_{1},v_{2})$ and $(v_{2},v_{3})$ are edges. $C = \\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$ is not a vertex cover because the edge $(v_{1},v_{2})$ is uncovered.\n- Option C: $I = \\{v_{1},v_{3},v_{5}\\}$ is maximum, but $C = \\{v_{2},v_{5}\\}$ has size $2$ and cannot cover all $6$ edges; for instance, $(v_{6},v_{1})$ is uncovered.\n- Option D: $I = \\{v_{1},v_{4}\\}$ is independent but not maximum (size $2 < 3$). $C = \\{v_{2},v_{3},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$ is a vertex cover but not minimum (size $4 > 3$).\n\nTherefore, only option A gives a maximum independent set paired with a minimum vertex cover.",
