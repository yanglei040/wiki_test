            "introduction": "To build a strong foundation, we begin by exploring the concepts of independent set and vertex cover in an extreme but enlightening scenario: a fully connected network. By analyzing this special case, a complete graph, you can sharpen your understanding of these definitions and begin to see the inherent tension between them. This exercise challenges you to determine the maximum number of non-interfering nodes versus the minimum number of nodes required to monitor all connections. ",

            "problem": "In the study of network structures, graph theory provides essential models. Consider a fully connected network of 17 servers, which can be modeled as a complete graph $K_{17}$. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. We are interested in identifying two particular types of server subsets:\n\n1.  **An Independent Group**: A subset of servers where no two servers in the subset have a direct connection between them.\n2.  **A Dominating Group**: A subset of servers where every direct connection in the entire network has at least one of its endpoint servers included in this subset.\n\nWhat are the size of the largest possible Independent Group and the size of the smallest possible Dominating Group in this network of 17 servers? The answer should be given as a pair of integers (Size of largest Independent Group, Size of smallest Dominating Group).\n\nA. (1, 16)\n\nB. (1, 17)\n\nC. (2, 15)\n\nD. (16, 1)\n\nE. (8, 9)",
            "solution": "Let the network be the complete graph $K_{17}$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$.\n\nLargest Independent Group: An independent set is a subset of vertices with no edges among them. In a complete graph $K_{n}$, every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, so no two vertices can both belong to an independent set. Therefore any independent set has size at most $1$. Choosing any single vertex gives an independent set of size $1$, hence\n$$\\alpha(K_{17})=1.$$\n\nSmallest Dominating Group as defined in the problem: The stated condition “every edge has at least one endpoint in the subset” is the definition of a vertex cover. A vertex cover $C \\subseteq V$ satisfies: for every edge $(u,v) \\in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ lies in $C$.\n\nIn $K_{n}$, taking $C=V \\setminus \\{v\\}$ for any single vertex $v$ yields a vertex cover of size $n-1$, since any edge either has at least one endpoint different from $v$ (hence in $C$) or both endpoints lie in $C$. Thus there exists a vertex cover of size $n-1$, so $\\tau(K_{n}) \\leq n-1$.\n\nTo prove minimality, suppose $|C| \\leq n-2$. Then there are at least two vertices $u,v \\in V \\setminus C$. In $K_{n}$, the edge $(u,v)$ exists, but neither endpoint lies in $C$, contradicting that $C$ is a vertex cover. Hence every vertex cover has size at least $n-1$, so\n$$\\tau(K_{17})=16.$$\n\nTherefore, the pair is $(1,16)$, which corresponds to option A.",

Unlike a complete graph, cycle graphs represent many real-world networks with more moderate connectivity. Here, you will not only calculate the size of the optimal sets but also identify the specific vertices that form a maximum independent set and a minimum vertex cover, allowing you to concretely verify the complementary relationship between these two crucial concepts.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, understanding the relationship between different problems is key. Two fundamental graph problems are the Independent Set problem and the Vertex Cover problem.\n\nConsider a simple, undirected graph $G$ with a vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$ and an edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_1)\\}$.\n\nAn **independent set** is a subset of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge connecting any two vertices in the subset). A **maximum independent set** is an independent set of the largest possible size for the given graph.\n\nA **vertex cover** is a subset of vertices in a graph such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the subset. A **minimum vertex cover** is a vertex cover of the smallest possible size for the given graph.\n\nLet $I$ be a maximum independent set of $G$ and let $C$ be a minimum vertex cover of $G$. Which of the following pairs $(I, C)$ represents a valid maximum independent set and a valid minimum vertex cover for the graph $G$?\n\nA. $I = \\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$, $C = \\{v_2, v_4, v_6\\}$\n\nB. $I = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, $C = \\{v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$\n\nC. $I = \\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$, $C = \\{v_2, v_5\\}$\n\nD. $I = \\{v_1, v_4\\}$, $C = \\{v_2, v_3, v_5, v_6\\}$",

It is impossible to have $|I| \\ge 4$, because then $|V \\setminus I| \\le 2$ would be a vertex cover, but any vertex in $C_{6}$ is incident to exactly $2$ edges, so two vertices can cover at most $4$ edges, which is strictly less than $6$. Therefore $\\alpha(G) = 3$ and, by the equality above, $\\tau(G) = 3$.\n\nNow check each option:\n- Option A: $I = \\{v_1,v_3,v_5\\}$ is independent and has size $3$, hence maximum. $C = \\{v_2,v_4,v_6\\}$ has size $3$ and is the complement of $I$, so it is a vertex cover and is minimum. Explicitly, each edge is incident to one of $v_2,v_4,v_6$.\n- Option B: $I = \\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ is not independent because $(v_1,v_2)$ and $(v_2,v_3)$ are edges. $C = \\{v_4,v_5,v_6\\}$ is not a vertex cover because the edge $(v_1,v_2)$ is uncovered.\n- Option C: $I = \\{v_1,v_3,v_5\\}$ is maximum, but $C = \\{v_2,v_5\\}$ has size $2$ and cannot cover all $6$ edges; for instance, $(v_6,v_1)$ is uncovered.\n- Option D: $I = \\{v_1,v_4\\}$ is independent but not maximum (size $2  3$). $C = \\{v_2,v_3,v_5,v_6\\}$ is a vertex cover but not minimum (size $4 > 3$).\n\nTherefore, only option A gives a maximum independent set paired with a minimum vertex cover.",
