To truly grasp its mechanics, we must get our hands dirty with the numbers themselves. This first exercise zooms in on a single, crucial component of the construction: the \"slack\" variables, which ensure that every edge is accounted for in the final sum . By working through a concrete example, you will trace how these variables guarantee that the numerical sum correctly reflects the graph's edge-covering constraint.",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, the VERTEX-COVER problem is often reduced to the SUBSET-SUM problem to prove the latter's NP-completeness. This problem explores a specific step in one such standard reduction.\n\nConsider a graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$. We construct an instance of SUBSET-SUM as follows:\nLet the set of vertices be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and the set of edges be $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$, where $e_1 = (v_1, v_2)$, $e_2 = (v_2, v_3)$, and $e_3 = (v_3, v_4)$. The number of edges is $m=3$. The numbers are constructed using a base-4 representation with $m+1=4$ places or \"digits\". The most significant digit (at position $m=3$) corresponds to a vertex count, while the digits at positions $j=0, 1, \\dots, m-1$ correspond to edges $e_{j+1}$.\n\nFor each vertex $v_i \\in V$, a number $w_i$ is created. Its base-4 representation has a '1' in the most significant position (position 3). For each edge $e_j$ incident to $v_i$, the number $w_i$ also has a '1' in the position $j-1$. All other digits are '0'.\n\nFor each edge $e_j \\in E$, a \"slack\" number $s_j$ is created. Its base-4 representation has a '1' in position $j-1$ and '0's elsewhere.\n\nThe full set of numbers for the SUBSET-SUM instance is the union of all $w_i$ and $s_j$. The target sum $T$ is constructed such that its base-4 representation has the integer $k$ in the most significant position (position 3) and a '2' in all other positions (positions 0, 1, and 2).\n\nNow, consider the specific VERTEX-COVER instance for the graph $G$ defined above with a target size of $k=2$. It is known that $C = \\{v_2, v_3\\}$ is a valid vertex cover of size 2 for this graph. For the SUBSET-SUM instance to have a solution, a specific subset of the generated numbers must sum to the target $T$. This subset will correspond to the vertex cover $C$.\n\nFocusing on the edge $e_1 = (v_1, v_2)$, which of the following edge-specific slack numbers must be part of this subset that sums to $T$?\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 16\n\nD. 64\n\nE. The slack number for edge $e_1$ is not needed.",
            "solution": "We work in base 4 with positions indexed as follows: positions $j=0,1,2$ correspond to edges $e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}$ respectively, and position $3$ (most significant) counts the number of chosen vertices. The place values are $4^{0},4^{1},4^{2},4^{3}$.\n\nFor each vertex $v_{i}$, the number $w_{i}$ has digit $1$ at position $3$, and for each incident edge $e_{j}$ it has digit $1$ at position $j-1$. For each edge $e_{j}$, the slack $s_{j}$ has digit $1$ only at position $j-1$. The target $T$ has base-4 digits equal to $2$ in positions $0,1,2$ and equal to $k=2$ in position $3$.\n\nWith $C=\\{v_{2},v_{3}\\}$, the subset must include $w_{2}$ and $w_{3}$. Their contributions by position are:\n- Position $3$ (vertex count): $1+1=2$, matching $T$.\n- Position $0$ (edge $e_{1}$): $w_{2}$ contributes $1$ (since $v_{2}$ is incident to $e_{1}$), and $w_{3}$ contributes $0$ (not incident), so the sum is $1$. Since $T$ has digit $2$ here, we must add slack $s_{1}$, which contributes an additional $1$ at position $0$.\n- Positions $1$ and $2$ behave analogously for $e_{2}$ and $e_{3}$; this confirms the mechanism, but the question asks specifically about $e_{1}$.\n\nTherefore, for edge $e_{1}$, the required slack is $s_{1}$, whose value is $4^{0}=1$.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the reduction from the VERTEX-COVER problem to the SUBSET-SUM problem is a classic example of mapping a graph problem to a numerical problem.\n\nLet's review the standard construction. Given an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ with a set of vertices $V=\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and a set of edges $E=\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m\\}$, and an integer $k$, the VERTEX-COVER problem asks if there is a subset of vertices $V' \\subseteq V$ such that $|V'| \\leq k$ and for every edge $(u,v) \\in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ is in $V'$.\n\nThe reduction constructs an instance of the SUBSET-SUM problem from the instance $(G, k)$ of VERTEX-COVER. It creates a set of integers $S$ and a target integer $T$. A subset of $S$ sums to $T$ if and only if a vertex cover of size $k$ exists in $G$. The integers are constructed using a base-4 representation with $m+1$ digits.\n\nThe construction is as follows:\n1.  For each vertex $v_i \\in V$, create an integer $x_i$. In base 4, this number has a '1' in the most significant digit (the $(m+1)$-th digit) and, for each edge $e_j \\in E$ that is incident to $v_i$, it has a '1' in the $j$-th digit. All other digits are '0'.\n    -   Symbolically: $x_i = 4^m + \\sum_{e_j \\text{ incident to } v_i} 4^{j-1}$.\n2.  For each edge $e_j \\in E$, create an integer $y_j$. In base 4, this number has a '1' in the $j$-th digit and '0's everywhere else.\n    -   Symbolically: $y_j = 4^{j-1}$.\n3.  The set of integers for the SUBSET-SUM instance is $S = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\} \\cup \\{y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$.\n4.  The target sum $T$ is constructed. In base 4, it has the number $k$ in the most significant digit and '2's in all other $m$ digits.\n    -   Symbolically: $T = k \\cdot 4^m + \\sum_{j=1}^m 2 \\cdot 4^{j-1}$.\n\nNow, consider a flawed version of this reduction where the most significant digit is completely removed from all constructed numbers. The new numbers and target are defined in base 4 with only $m$ digits (one for each edge).\n-   New vertex numbers: $x'_i = \\sum_{e_j \\text{ incident to } v_i} 4^{j-1}$.\n-   New edge numbers: $y'_j = 4^{j-1}$. (These are identical to the original $y_j$).\n-   New target sum: $T' = \\sum_{j=1}^m 2 \\cdot 4^{j-1}$.\n\nWhich of the following properties of the original VERTEX-COVER problem $(G, k)$ is no longer correctly enforced by finding a subset of $\\{x'_1, \\dots, x'_n\\} \\cup \\{y'_1, \\dots, y'_m\\}$ that sums to $T'$?\n\nA. The constraint that the selected set of vertices must form a vertex cover (i.e., that every edge is covered).\n\nB. The constraint that the size of the vertex cover must be equal to $k$.\n\nC. The constraint that the graph $G$ must be connected for the reduction to be valid.\n\nD. The reduction fails entirely, as it becomes impossible to find any subset that sums to the target $T'$ for any graph.\n\nE. The constraint that the selected vertices must form an independent set.",
            "solution": "We analyze the base-4 digit structure of the flawed reduction. Each number has exactly $m$ base-4 digits, one per edge $e_{j}$, and no most significant $(m+1)$-th digit. For each edge $e_{j}=\\{u,v\\}$:\n- The $j$-th digit of $x'_{i}$ equals $1$ if and only if $v_{i}$ is an endpoint of $e_{j}$, and equals $0$ otherwise.\n- The $j$-th digit of $y'_{j}$ equals $1$, and all other digits of $y'_{j}$ equal $0$.\n- The $j$-th digit of the target $T'$ equals $2$.\n\nLet $U \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ be the indices of selected vertex numbers $\\{x'_{i}\\}$ and $J \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$ be the indices of selected edge numbers $\\{y'_{j}\\}$. Because addition of base-4 digits up to a total of $3$ does not produce a carry (since $3  4$), each digit constraint is independent and must sum exactly to the target digit $2$ with no carries.\n\nFix an edge $e_{j}=\\{a,b\\}$. The $j$-th digit of the sum equals\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}[a \\in U]+\\mathbf{1}[b \\in U]+\\mathbf{1}[j \\in J]=2,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$ denotes the indicator. Since each term is in $\\{0,1\\}$, the only solutions are:\n- $\\mathbf{1}[a \\in U]=1$ and $\\mathbf{1}[b \\in U]=1$ with $\\mathbf{1}[j \\in J]=0$, or\n- exactly one of $a,b$ is in $U$ with $\\mathbf{1}[j \\in J]=1$.\n\nIn either case, at least one endpoint of $e_{j}$ is in $U$. Therefore, any subset summing to $T'$ necessarily selects a set of vertices $U$ that covers every edge. Hence the vertex-cover property is still enforced, so option A remains correct in the flawed reduction.\n\nNow consider the size constraint. In the correct reduction, the most significant digit enforces $\\sum_{i \\in U}1=k$ because each $x_{i}$ contributes $1$ to that digit, each $y_{j}$ contributes $0$, and the target has $k$ there. In the flawed reduction, this digit is removed entirely. The target $T'$ no longer contains $k$, and the subset-sum constraints involve only the per-edge digits. Consequently, the number of selected vertices is unrestricted by the sum-to-$T'$ condition. For example, selecting all vertices (i.e., $U=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$) and no edges (i.e., $J=\\varnothing$) yields digit sum $2$ for every edge, so it always satisfies $T'$ regardless of $k$. Hence the constraint that the vertex cover has size equal to $k$ is not enforced.\n\nOption C is irrelevant because the reduction does not require $G$ to be connected in the first place. Option D is false because feasible subsets exist (e.g., selecting all vertices) that sum to $T'$ for arbitrary graphs. Option E is unrelated and not enforced by either the original or the flawed construction.\n\nTherefore, the missing most significant digit causes the loss of the size constraint tied to $k$, i.e., option B.",

To analyze the graph's structure, they employ a complex transformation mapping the graph to a set of numerical weights. This transformation consists of two main stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Graph to Primary Weights**\n\nGiven a graph $G$ with $n=|V|$ vertices and $m=|E|$ edges, and an integer parameter $k$, a set of 'primary weights' $S_{\\text{primary}}$ and a target sum $T$ are constructed. The vertices are labeled $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ and edges $e_1, \\dots, e_m$ in a fixed order.\n1.  A base integer $B$ is set to $n+1$.\n2.

First, the total sum of all primary weights is calculated: $\\Sigma = \\sum_{w \\in S_{\\text{primary}}} w$.\n7.  A special weight $X$ is computed as $X = \\Sigma - 2T$.\n8.

Let the vertices be labeled $v_1, \\dots, v_5$ sequentially along the path, so the edges are $e_1=(v_1,v_2)$, $e_2=(v_2,v_3)$, $e_3=(v_3,v_4)$, and $e_4=(v_4,v_5)$. The parameter $k$ is set to 2.\n\nThe analysis of $S_{\\text{final}}$ results in a partition into two subsets, $P_1$ and $P_2$. It is found that the weight $a_1$ (the vertex-weight corresponding to vertex $v_1$) is in subset $P_1$.\n\nCalculate the sum of all 'vertex-weights' that are in the other subset, $P_2$.

Therefore, in any valid equal-sum partition, the subset containing $X$ must contain exactly the vertex-weights $a_{2}$ and $a_{4}$ (and, in this specific graph, all four edge-weights $b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},b_{4}$, since each edge is covered by exactly one of $v_{2}$ or $v_{4}$). Since it is given that $a_{1}$ lies in $P_{1}$, $P_{1}$ cannot be the side containing $X$ (the $X$-side contains exactly $a_{2}$ and $a_{4}$ among vertex-weights). Hence $X\\in P_{2}$ and the vertex-weights in $P_{2}$ are precisely $a_{2}$ and $a_{4}$.\n\nThus the requested sum is\n$$\na_{2}+a_{4}=(1296+1+6)+(1296+36+216)=1303+1548=2851.\n$$\n\nAs a consistency check, compute the totals:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5}a_{i}=5B^{4}+2\\sum_{j=1}^{4}B^{j-1}=5\\cdot1296+2\\cdot259=6998,\\quad \\sum_{j=1}^{4}b_{j}=259,\n$$\nso $\\Sigma=6998+259=7257$, $T=2\\cdot1296+2\\cdot259=3110$, $X=\\Sigma-2T=1037$, and each part sums to $(\\Sigma+X)/2=4147$.
