            "introduction": "While CNF formulas represent a famously difficult class of problems, their structural counterpart, Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), tells a very different story. A DNF formula is an OR of several AND-clauses, and to satisfy it, one only needs to make *at least one* clause true. This practice  reveals why the satisfiability problem for DNF formulas is computationally simple, offering a powerful lesson in how a formula's structure can drastically alter its computational complexity.",

            "problem": "In the field of automated theorem proving and digital circuit verification, systems often need to determine the satisfiability of logical formulas. A common and fundamental structure for these formulas is the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). A Boolean formula is in DNF if it is a disjunction (logical OR) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a conjunction (logical AND) of literals. A literal is either a Boolean variable or its negation. A satisfying assignment for a formula is a set of true/false values for its variables that makes the entire formula evaluate to true.\n\nConsider the following Boolean formula $\\Phi$ over five variables, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$:\n$$ \\Phi = (x_1 \\land \\neg x_2 \\land x_5) \\lor (\\neg x_1 \\land x_3 \\land \\neg x_4) \\lor (x_2 \\land x_4 \\land \\neg x_5) $$\nYour task is to find a satisfying assignment for $\\Phi$.

A clause, being a conjunction of literals, is true only if all the literals within it are true.
