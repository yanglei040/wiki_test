This practice explores a fundamental technique known as Boolean Constraint Propagation, where fixing one variable's value can force the values of others to maintain satisfiability. This exercise provides a hands-on feel for this deductive process, revealing the hidden logical chains within a formula and illustrating a core principle used in efficient SAT-solving algorithms. ",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, the 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT) problem is a canonical example of an NP-complete problem. An instance of 3-SAT consists of a Boolean formula in 3-Conjunctive Normal Form (3-CNF), which is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of exactly three literals. A literal is a variable or its negation. The problem is to determine if there exists an assignment of `true` or `false` values to the variables that makes the entire formula evaluate to `true`.\n\nConsider the following 3-SAT formula $\\phi$ defined over the set of Boolean variables $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, z_1, z_2, z_3\\}$:\n$$ \\phi = C_1 \\land C_2 \\land C_3 \\land C_4 \\land C_5 \\land C_6 $$\nwhere the clauses are:\n$C_1 = (\\neg x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor z_1)$\n$C_2 = (\\neg x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor \\neg z_1)$\n$C_3 = (\\neg x_2 \\lor x_3 \\lor z_2)$\n$C_4 = (\\neg x_2 \\lor x_3 \\lor \\neg z_2)$\n$C_5 = (\\neg x_3 \\lor \\neg x_4 \\lor z_3)$\n$C_6 = (\\neg x_3 \\lor \\neg x_4 \\lor \\neg z_3)$\n\nA common strategy in algorithms that solve SAT problems is to tentatively assign a value to a variable and then deduce any logical consequences. This process is often called Boolean Constraint Propagation. Suppose we begin the search for a satisfying assignment for $\\phi$ by making the initial assignment $x_1 = \\text{true}$. This assignment can force the truth values of other variables in the formula if we are to maintain the possibility of satisfying $\\phi$.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly and completely describes the set of all other variable assignments that are logically forced by the initial assumption $x_1 = \\text{true}$?\n\nA. $x_2 = \\text{true}$\n\nB. $x_2 = \\text{true}, x_3 = \\text{true}$\n\nC. $x_2 = \\text{true}, x_3 = \\text{true}, x_4 = \\text{true}$\n\nD. $x_2 = \\text{true}, x_3 = \\text{true}, x_4 = \\text{false}$\n\nE. $x_2 = \\text{true}, x_3 = \\text{true}, x_4 = \\text{false}, z_1=\\text{true}, z_2=\\text{true}, z_3=\\text{true}$\n\nF.
