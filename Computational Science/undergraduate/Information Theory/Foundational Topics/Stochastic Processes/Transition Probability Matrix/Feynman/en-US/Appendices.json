This first practice provides a foundational exercise in applying a transition matrix to a given initial state distribution. By working through a familiar, intuitive scenario of weather prediction , you will calculate how the probabilities of different states evolve over a single time step, a core skill for analyzing any Markov chain.",

            "problem": "A simplified weather model for the city of Aeridor considers three possible states for any given day: State 1 (Sunny), State 2 (Cloudy), and State 3 (Rainy). The day-to-day weather transitions are probabilistic and can be described by a one-step transition matrix $P$, where the entry $P_{ij}$ represents the probability that the weather will be in state $j$ tomorrow, given that it is in state $i$ today. The transition matrix is given by:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.20 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.30 & 0.50 & 0.20 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.60 & 0.20 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBased on satellite data and atmospheric readings, meteorologists determine that for a particular Tuesday, the probabilities of the weather being Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy are not known with certainty. Instead, they are described by the initial probability distribution vector $v_0 = [0.15, 0.65, 0.20]$, where the first, second, and third components correspond to the probabilities of the weather being Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy, respectively.\n\nGiven this information, calculate the probability that the weather in Aeridor will be Cloudy on Wednesday.

The components of $v_1$ are the probabilities we want to find.\n$$\nv_1 = [P(\\text{Sunny on Wed}), P(\\text{Cloudy on Wed}), P(\\text{Rainy on Wed})]\n$$\nThe relationship between the probability distribution at one time step and the next is given by the matrix multiplication of the current state distribution vector and the transition matrix $P$.\n$$\nv_1 = v_0 P\n$$\nWe are given the transition matrix $P$:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.20 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.30 & 0.50 & 0.20 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.60 & 0.20 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$\nv_1 = [0.15, 0.65, 0.20] \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.20 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.30 & 0.50 & 0.20 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.60 & 0.20 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first component of $v_1$, $P(\\text{Sunny on Wed})$, is calculated as:\n$$\nv_{1,1} = (0.15)(0.70) + (0.65)(0.30) + (0.20)(0.20) = 0.105 + 0.195 + 0.040 = 0.340\n$$\nThe second component of $v_1$, $P(\\text{Cloudy on Wed})$, is calculated as:\n$$\nv_{1,2} = (0.15)(0.20) + (0.65)(0.50) + (0.20)(0.60) = 0.030 + 0.325 + 0.120 = 0.475\n$$\nThe third component of $v_1$, $P(\\text{Rainy on Wed})$, is calculated as:\n$$\nv_{1,3} = (0.15)(0.10) + (0.65)(0.20) + (0.20)(0.20) = 0.015 + 0.130 + 0.040 = 0.185\n$$\nSo, the probability distribution for Wednesday is:\n$$\nv_1 = [0.340, 0.475, 0.185]\n$$\nAs a check, the components of $v_1$ should sum to 1: $0.340 + 0.475 + 0.185 = 1.000$. This confirms our calculation is a valid probability distribution.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the probability that the weather will be Cloudy on Wednesday. This corresponds to the second component of the vector $v_1$.\n$$\nP(\\text{Cloudy on Wed}) = v_{1,2} = 0.475\n$$\nThe value $0.475$ already has three significant figures ($4$, $7$, and $5$), so no further rounding is needed.",

This exercise extends the single-step calculation to a two-step transition, demonstrating how the influence of the initial state propagates over time.
