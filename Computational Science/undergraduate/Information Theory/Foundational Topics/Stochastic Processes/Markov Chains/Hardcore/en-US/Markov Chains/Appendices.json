            "introduction": "To begin, we focus on the fundamental mechanics of a Markov chain's evolution over a short time scale. This exercise asks you to calculate the probability of a specific two-step sequence of states, which is a core skill for understanding how the system moves from one moment to the next. By applying the chain rule of probability and the law of total probability, you will directly use the initial conditions and transition matrix to trace the system's path, reinforcing the 'memoryless' property that defines these chains .",

            "problem": "A simplified biophysical model describes the transcriptional activity of a particular gene. The gene's promoter can exist in one of two states: 'ON' (actively transcribing messenger RNA) or 'OFF' (inactive). The state of the gene at a discrete time step $n$ is represented by the random variable $X_n$. This process is modeled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain.\n\nAt the beginning of the observation, at time $n=0$, the probability that the gene is in the 'ON' state is given as $P(X_0 = \\text{'ON'}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe state transitions over a single time step are governed by the following probabilities:\n- The probability that a gene in the 'ON' state at time $n$ remains in the 'ON' state at time $n+1$ is $0.8$.\n- The probability that a gene in the 'OFF' state at time $n$ transitions to the 'ON' state at time $n+1$ is $0.4$.\n\nCalculate the joint probability that the gene is in the 'ON' state at time step $n=1$ and in the 'OFF' state at time step $n=2$. In other words, find the value of $P(X_1 = \\text{'ON'}, X_2 = \\text{'OFF'})$. Express your final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the joint probability $P(X_1 = \\text{'ON'}, X_2 = \\text{'OFF'})$. We can solve this by first defining the states and the transition probabilities, then using the properties of Markov chains and the chain rule of probability.\n\nLet's denote the two states as $S_{on} = \\text{'ON'}$ and $S_{off} = \\text{'OFF'}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the complete set of initial probabilities and transition probabilities from the information given.\n\nThe initial probabilities at time $n=0$ are:\n$P(X_0 = S_{on}) = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSince there are only two states, the probability of being in the 'OFF' state initially is:\n$P(X_0 = S_{off}) = 1 - P(X_0 = S_{on}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nThe transition probabilities are given as:\n$P(X_{n+1} = S_{on} | X_n = S_{on}) = 0.8$\n$P(X_{n+1} = S_{on} | X_n = S_{off}) = 0.4$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce the other two transition probabilities, as the probabilities of transitioning from a given state must sum to 1:\n$P(X_{n+1} = S_{off} | X_n = S_{on}) = 1 - P(X_{n+1} = S_{on} | X_n = S_{on}) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$\n$P(X_{n+1} = S_{off} | X_n = S_{off}) = 1 - P(X_{n+1} = S_{on} | X_n = S_{off}) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$\n\nNow, we can calculate the target joint probability $P(X_1 = S_{on}, X_2 = S_{off})$. Using the chain rule for probability, we can write:\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}, X_2 = S_{off}) = P(X_2 = S_{off} | X_1 = S_{on}) \\times P(X_1 = S_{on})$$\n\nThe first term, $P(X_2 = S_{off} | X_1 = S_{on})$, is the probability of transitioning from 'ON' to 'OFF'. Due to the time-homogeneous property of the Markov chain, this is simply the one-step transition probability we found earlier:\n$$P(X_2 = S_{off} | X_1 = S_{on}) = 0.2$$\n\nThe second term, $P(X_1 = S_{on})$, is the total probability of the gene being in the 'ON' state at time $n=1$. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the possible states at $n=0$:\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}) = P(X_1 = S_{on} | X_0 = S_{on})P(X_0 = S_{on}) + P(X_1 = S_{on} | X_0 = S_{off})P(X_0 = S_{off})$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}) = (0.8) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (0.4) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}) = \\frac{0.8}{3} + \\frac{0.8}{3} = \\frac{1.6}{3}$$\n\nNow we can substitute both calculated components back into our original equation for the joint probability:\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}, X_2 = S_{off}) = (0.2) \\times \\left(\\frac{1.6}{3}\\right)$$\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}, X_2 = S_{off}) = \\frac{0.32}{3}$$\n$$P(X_1 = S_{on}, X_2 = S_{off}) = 0.10666...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first significant figure is 1, the second is 0, and the third is 6. The next digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we round the third significant figure up.\n$$0.10666... \\approx 0.107$$",
