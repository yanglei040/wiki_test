He introduced the concept of entropy, a powerful measure of the uncertainty or unpredictability associated with a random variable. This first exercise  provides a direct application of this fundamental idea, asking you to calculate the entropy of a simplified weather model. By working through this problem, you will gain hands-on experience in applying the Shannon entropy formula, which is the theoretical foundation for all modern data compression algorithms.",

            "problem": "Consider a simplified model for a volatile computational memory system, structured as a one-dimensional tape of cells. Each cell can store a single bit, either a 0 or a 1. The memory is subject to noise. At each discrete time step of a computational clock, the bit stored in any given cell has a constant probability $p$ of spontaneously flipping to its opposite state (i.e., 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0), where $0 \\le p \\le 1$. This flipping event is independent for each cell and for each time step.\n\nWe can analyze this memory system from an information-theoretic perspective by modeling a single cell as a communication channel through time. The input to this channel is the state of the cell at a time $t$, and the output is the state of that same cell at the next time step, $t+1$.\n\nDetermine the Shannon capacity of this single-cell memory channel.

This advanced problem  challenges you to determine the capacity of an AWGN channel with a realistic complication: the noise power is not constant but increases with the signal power $P$. This scenario forces you to move beyond simply applying the Shannon-Hartley formula and instead use calculus to find the optimal transmission power that maximizes the data rate.
