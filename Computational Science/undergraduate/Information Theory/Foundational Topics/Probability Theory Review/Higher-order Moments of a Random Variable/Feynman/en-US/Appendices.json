Skewness, the third standardized moment, provides a crucial measure of asymmetry. This first exercise allows you to apply the definition of skewness to the most fundamental building block of digital information: a single bit whose transmission is modeled by a Bernoulli random variable. By calculating it for a specific scenario , you will gain a concrete understanding of what this higher-order moment represents.",
