            "solution": "The problem asks for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable $Y$, which is a transformation of another random variable $X$. Let's solve this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Define the underlying random variable $X$.**\nThe random variable $X$ represents the outcome of a fair six-sided die roll. The sample space is $S_X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. Since the die is fair, the probability of each outcome is equal:\n$P(X=k) = \\frac{1}{6}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible values of the transformed random variable $Y$.**\nThe new random variable $Y$ is defined as $Y = |X - 3.5|$. We can find the possible values of $Y$ (its support, $S_Y$) by applying this transformation to each possible value of $X$:\n- If $X=1$, $Y = |1 - 3.5| = |-2.5| = 2.5$.\n- If $X=2$, $Y = |2 - 3.5| = |-1.5| = 1.5$.\n- If $X=3$, $Y = |3 - 3.5| = |-0.5| = 0.5$.\n- If $X=4$, $Y = |4 - 3.5| = |0.5| = 0.5$.\n- If $X=5$, $Y = |5 - 3.5| = |1.5| = 1.5$.\n- If $X=6$, $Y = |6 - 3.5| = |2.5| = 2.5$.\nThe set of possible values for $Y$ is $S_Y = \\{0.5, 1.5, 2.5\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability mass function (PMF) of $Y$.**\nThe PMF of $Y$, denoted $p_Y(y)$, gives the probability $P(Y=y)$ for each value $y$ in the support $S_Y$. We find these probabilities by summing the probabilities of the $X$ outcomes that map to each $Y$ value.\n- For $Y=0.5$: This occurs when $X=3$ or $X=4$.\n$P(Y=0.5) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- For $Y=1.5$: This occurs when $X=2$ or $X=5$.\n$P(Y=1.5) = P(X=2) + P(X=5) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- For $Y=2.5$: This occurs when $X=1$ or $X=6$.\n$P(Y=2.5) = P(X=1) + P(X=6) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nAs a check, the sum of probabilities is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$. The PMF is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $Y$.**\nThe CDF, $F_Y(y)$, is defined as $F_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y)$. We build this function piecewise by considering different ranges for $y$.\n- For $y < 0.5$:\nThere are no values in the support of $Y$ that are less than 0.5. So, $P(Y \\le y) = 0$.\n- For $0.5 \\le y < 1.5$:\nThe only value in the support of $Y$ that is less than or equal to $y$ is 0.5.\n$F_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y) = P(Y = 0.5) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- For $1.5 \\le y < 2.5$:\nThe values in the support of $Y$ that are less than or equal to $y$ are 0.5 and 1.5.\n$F_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y) = P(Y=0.5) + P(Y=1.5) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- For $y \\ge 2.5$:\nAll values in the support of $Y$ (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5) are less than or equal to $y$.\n$F_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y) = P(Y=0.5) + P(Y=1.5) + P(Y=2.5) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the pieces into a single function and compare with the options.**\nCombining these results gives the complete piecewise definition of the CDF:\n$$ F_Y(y) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } y < 0.5 \\\\ 1/3 & \\text{for } 0.5 \\le y < 1.5 \\\\ 2/3 & \\text{for } 1.5 \\le y < 2.5 \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } y \\ge 2.5 \\end{cases} $$\nThis mathematical expression matches option C exactly.\n\n- Option A incorrectly uses probabilities of $1/6$, effectively not combining the outcomes for $X$.\n- Option B describes the PMF, not the CDF.\n- Option D uses incorrect inequalities (`<` vs `\\le`). A CDF for a discrete variable is right-continuous, meaning $F_Y(y_0) = \\lim_{y \\to y_0^+} F_Y(y)$, and the \"jumps\" occur at the points in the support. Our derived function correctly places the equality on the lower bound of each interval.\n- Option E seems to be based on a different transformation, possibly $Y=(X-3.5)^2$, which would give values $0.25, 2.25, 6.25$.",

This hands-on practice explores this concept within an intuitive geometric context: finding the CDF of the $x$-coordinate of a point chosen uniformly at random on a unit circle .

The coordinates of the point are given by $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$. The statement that the point is chosen \"uniformly at random\" from the circumference means that the angle $\\theta$ is a random variable that is uniformly distributed over an interval of length $2\\pi$. For convenience, we can choose this interval to be $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. The probability density function (PDF) of $\\theta$ is constant over this interval:\n$$ f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi - (-\\pi)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\quad \\text{for } \\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi] $$\nand $f_{\\Theta}(\\theta) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe random variable of interest is $X$, the $x$-coordinate of the point, so $X = \\cos(\\theta)$. We want to find the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of $X$, which is defined as $F_X(x) = P(X \\le x)$. Substituting the expression for $X$, we get:\n$$ F_X(x) = P(\\cos(\\theta) \\le x) $$\nTo find this probability, we must determine the range of angles $\\theta$ in $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ that satisfy the inequality $\\cos(\\theta) \\le x$.
