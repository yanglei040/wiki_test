This practice explores how we can use Chebyshev's inequality to translate this convergence into a practical tool for experimental design. By working through a quality control scenario , you will learn how to calculate the minimum sample size required to ensure that an estimate is within a certain tolerance with a specified probability.",

            "problem": "An automated precision-cutting machine operates in cycles. In each cycle, the machine's cutting head makes a small positional adjustment. Let the adjustment in the $i$-th cycle be represented by a random variable $X_i$. These adjustments are independent and identically distributed. The machine is calibrated so that each adjustment is either a positive displacement of $a$ or a negative displacement of $-a$ with equal probability.\n\nThe long-term stability of the machine depends on the average adjustment over many cycles being close to zero. A quality control standard requires that after $n$ cycles, the probability that the magnitude of the average adjustment, $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$, is greater than or equal to a certain tolerance $\\epsilon$ must be no more than a given value $\\delta$.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Adjustment step size: $a = 0.5$ units.\n- Tolerance for the average adjustment: $\\epsilon = 0.02$ units.\n- Maximum allowable probability of exceeding tolerance: $\\delta = 0.01$.\n\nUsing a common probability inequality to establish a sufficient condition, determine the minimum number of cycles, $n$, required to meet this quality control standard.

            "introduction": "The power of the WLLN extends beyond the average of simple random variables; it also applies to the average of functions of those variables, a principle of immense utility in statistics. This exercise  demonstrates this concept by examining the convergence of the sample second moment, a quantity crucial for estimating variance. This practice reinforces the fundamental relationship between a variable's mean, its variance, and its second moment, showing how the WLLN underpins the estimation of more complex statistical properties.",

Each random variable $X_i$ in this sequence has a known finite mean $E[X_i] = \\mu$ and a known finite, positive variance $\\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma^2$.\n\nWe define the sample second moment about the origin for this sequence as:\n$$M_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^2$$\nThis quantity is of interest in various fields, for instance, in physics where it might relate to the average energy of a system of particles.\n\nDetermine the value to which $M_n$ converges in probability as the sample size $n$ approaches infinity. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the value to which the sample second moment, $M_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^2$, converges in probability. This is a direct application of the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN).\n\nThe WLLN states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots$ with a finite expected value $E[Y_i] = \\mu_Y$, their sample mean $\\bar{Y}_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$ converges in probability to $\\mu_Y$. We can write this as $\\bar{Y}_n \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu_Y$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nTo apply the WLLN to our problem, let's define a new sequence of random variables $Y_i = X_i^2$. The quantity $M_n$ can then be rewritten as the sample mean of this new sequence:\n$$M_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \\bar{Y}_n$$\n\nNow, we must check if the conditions for the WLLN are met for the sequence $Y_i$.\n1.  **I.I.D. Condition:** The problem states that the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ are i.i.d. Since each $Y_i$ is a function of the corresponding $X_i$ (specifically $Y_i = X_i^2$), and the function is the same for all $i$, the sequence of random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots$ is also independent and identically distributed.\n\n2.  **Finite Mean Condition:** The WLLN requires that the expected value of $Y_i$, denoted $E[Y_i]$, is finite. Let's calculate this expectation.\n$$E[Y_i] = E[X_i^2]$$\nWe can relate $E[X_i^2]$ to the given mean and variance of $X_i$. The definition of variance is:\n$$\\text{Var}(X_i) = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$$\nWe are given that $\\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma^2$ and $E[X_i] = \\mu$. Substituting these values into the variance formula gives:\n$$\\sigma^2 = E[X_i^2] - \\mu^2$$\nSolving for $E[X_i^2]$, we get:\n$$E[X_i^2] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$$\nSince $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are given as finite, the expectation $E[Y_i] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$ is also finite. Let's denote this common mean of the $Y_i$ sequence as $\\mu_Y = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$.\n\nSince both conditions for the WLLN are satisfied for the sequence $Y_i = X_i^2$, we can conclude that their sample mean, $M_n$, converges in probability to their true mean, $\\mu_Y$.\n$$M_n \\xrightarrow{p} E[Y_i] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$$\n\nThus, the value to which $M_n$ converges in probability is $\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$.",

            "introduction": "The assumption that random variables are independent is critical for the sample average to converge to a constant mean. This advanced problem  challenges you to analyze a scenario with systemic correlation, where a common random factor influences all measurements.
