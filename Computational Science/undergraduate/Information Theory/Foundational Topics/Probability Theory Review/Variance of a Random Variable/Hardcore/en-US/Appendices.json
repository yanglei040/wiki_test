            "introduction": "Understanding the variance of a dataset is a foundational skill, but data rarely stays in its raw form. This first exercise  explores how variance behaves when we apply a linear transformation—a common operation for normalizing or scaling data. You will practice the two key steps: first, calculating the variance from the raw moments of a variable using the formula $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$, and second, determining the variance of the newly transformed variable.",

            "problem": "A data scientist is analyzing the output of a machine learning model designed to predict customer engagement. The model generates a raw, uncalibrated numerical score for each customer profile, represented by a random variable $X$. After analyzing a large sample of scores, the data scientist determines that the expected value (mean) of these scores is $E[X] = 2$, and the expected value of the square of the scores is $E[X^2] = 13$.\n\nTo make these scores more interpretable and align them with a business-defined scale, a linear transformation is applied to create a new score, $Y$. The transformation is given by the equation $Y = \\frac{1}{2}X + 8$.\n\nCalculate the variance of the transformed scores, $\\text{Var}(Y)$. Your answer should be a numerical value.",
            "solution": "The goal is to compute the variance of the transformed random variable $Y$, which is defined as $Y = \\frac{1}{2}X + 8$. We are given the first two moments of the original random variable $X$: $E[X] = 2$ and $E[X^2] = 13$.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the variance of the original random variable, $X$. The variance of a random variable is defined by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 $$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = 13 - (2)^2 = 13 - 4 = 9 $$\n\nNext, we use the properties of variance for a linear transformation. For a random variable $X$ and constants $a$ and $b$, the variance of the transformed variable $Y = aX + b$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y) = \\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) $$\nNote that the additive constant $b$ does not affect the variance, as variance is a measure of spread, and adding a constant shifts the distribution without changing its spread.\n\nIn our problem, the transformation is $Y = \\frac{1}{2}X + 8$. By comparing this to the general form $Y = aX + b$, we can identify the constants as $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = 8$.\n\nNow, we can apply the variance property using our value for $a$ and the previously calculated $\\text{Var}(X)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(X) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 9 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y) = \\frac{9}{4} $$\n\nFinally, we express the result as a numerical value in decimal form:\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y) = 2.25 $$",

            "introduction": "How does variability accumulate? This practice  presents a thought-provoking scenario comparing two ways of processing a signal: amplifying a single source versus adding two independent sources. This problem will challenge your intuition and solidify your understanding of how variance scales, $\\text{Var}(aX) = a^2\\text{Var}(X)$, versus how it sums for independent random variables, $\\text{Var}(X_A + X_B) = \\text{Var}(X_A) + \\text{Var}(X_B)$.

This noise has an expected value $E[X]=0$ and a known, non-zero variance $\\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$. Two different techniques are proposed to process the signal, which in turn affect the resulting noise.\n\n- **Technique 1:** A single measurement is performed, and the resulting value is digitally multiplied by 2.

The noises from these measurements are random variables $X_A$ and $X_B$, which are independent and identically distributed, both following the same distribution as $X$. The results are then added together. The new noise variable is $Y_2 = X_A + X_B$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly compares the variance of the resulting noise from the two techniques?\n\nA. The variance of $Y_1$ is greater than the variance of $Y_2$.\n\nB. The variance of $Y_2$ is greater than the variance of $Y_1$.\n\nC. The variances of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are equal.\n\nD.

Two techniques create new noise variables $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$, and we compare their variances.\n\nFirst, use the scaling property of variance: for any constant $a$ and any random variable with finite variance,\n$$\n\\text{Var}(aX)=E\\big[(aX-E[aX])^{2}\\big]=E\\big[(a(X-E[X]))^{2}\\big]=a^{2}E\\big[(X-E[X])^{2}\\big]=a^{2}\\text{Var}(X).\n$$\nApplying this to Technique 1 with $Y_{1}=2X$,\n$$\n\\text{Var}(Y_{1})=\\text{Var}(2X)=4\\text{Var}(X)=4\\sigma^{2}.\n$$\n\nNext, consider Technique 2 with $Y_{2}=X_{A}+X_{B}$, where $X_{A}$ and $X_{B}$ are independent and identically distributed as $X$.

Therefore, the variance of $Y_{1}$ is greater than the variance of $Y_{2}$, which corresponds to option A. This comparison does not depend on the specific distribution of $X$, only on the variance and independence, and does not require the numerical value of $\\sigma^{2}$.",

This exercise  models such a scenario using the geometric distribution, which describes the 'waiting time' for the first success in a series of independent trials.
