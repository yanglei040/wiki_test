            "problem": "A team of materials scientists is developing a new composite material in the form of a thin, square plate. Due to the manufacturing process, there is a possibility of microscopic flaws occurring within the material. The plate is modeled as a two-dimensional region in the xy-plane defined by the vertices (0,0), (L,0), (L,L), and (0,L).\n\nThe research team models the spatial distribution of these flaws using a joint probability density function (PDF). Based on their theoretical models, they propose that the likelihood of a flaw occurring at coordinates $(x,y)$ is proportional to the sum of the coordinates. Specifically, the PDF is given by:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\begin{cases} C(x+y) & \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le L \\text{ and } 0 \\le y \\le L \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant and $L$ is the side length of the plate.\n\nTo validate their model, the team must first determine the value of the constant $C$. Find the expression for $C$ in terms of $L$.",
