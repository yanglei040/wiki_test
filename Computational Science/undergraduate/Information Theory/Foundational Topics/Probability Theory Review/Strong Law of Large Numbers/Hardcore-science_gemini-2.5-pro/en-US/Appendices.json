This first exercise demonstrates the law in its most direct form, calculating the long-term average for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables . By working through this example, you will solidify your understanding of how the sample mean almost surely converges to the expected value of the underlying distribution.",

            "problem": "A research team is studying the output of a novel signal processor. Each time the processor runs, it generates a normalized value, which can be modeled as a random variable. A sequence of these values, $X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots$, is recorded. These values are considered to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The theoretical model for the probability distribution of any single value $X_i$ is described by the probability density function (PDF):\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x^2  \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe long-term average of these measurements after $n$ trials is given by the sample mean $S_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.

            "problem": "A research team is studying the energy emissions from a newly discovered type of microscopic organism. The energy emitted by a single organism during a short observation period is a random variable. The team conducts a series of independent experiments, with each experiment measuring the energy emission, $X_i$, from a new, randomly selected organism. These measurements, $X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots$, can be modeled as a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) positive random variables. It is known from theoretical models that the expected energy emission is finite, i.e., $E[X_i] = \\mu$ for some finite constant $\\mu > 0$.\n\nFor a data processing task, an analyst is not interested in the energy itself, but in a related quantity, $Y_i = \\sqrt{X_i}$. The analyst computes the sample average of these transformed quantities over $n$ experiments:\n$$S_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sqrt{X_i}$$\nAs the number of experiments $n$ grows infinitely large, what value does the sample average $S_n$ converge to almost surely? Express your answer in terms of the random variable $X_1$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the almost sure limit of the sample average $S_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sqrt{X_i}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet's define a new sequence of random variables $Y_i = \\sqrt{X_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Since the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the random variables $Y_1 = \\sqrt{X_1}, Y_2 = \\sqrt{X_2}, \\dots$ are also independent and identically distributed. This is because any function of i.i.d. random variables results in a new sequence of i.i.d. random variables.\n\nThe sample average can be rewritten in terms of the $Y_i$ variables:\n$$S_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$$\nThis is the sample mean of the i.i.d. sequence $Y_i$.\n\nWe can apply the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) to the sequence $\\{Y_i\\}$. The SLLN states that if $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with a finite expected value, i.e., $E[|Y_1|]  \\infty$, then the sample mean converges almost surely to the true mean:\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\xrightarrow{\\text{a.s.}} E[Y_1] \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty$$\n\nTo use the SLLN, we must verify that $E[|Y_1|]$ is finite.\nWe have $Y_1 = \\sqrt{X_1}$. The problem states that the $X_i$ are positive random variables, so $X_1 > 0$. This implies that $\\sqrt{X_1}$ is a real and positive value, so $|Y_1| = |\\sqrt{X_1}| = \\sqrt{X_1}$. We need to check if $E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$ is finite.\n\nWe can use Jensen's inequality to relate $E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$ to the known finite mean $E[X_1] = \\mu$. Jensen's inequality for a concave function $g(x)$ and a random variable $X$ states that $E[g(X)] \\le g(E[X])$.\n\nThe function $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is a concave function for $x > 0$. This can be shown by checking its second derivative:\n$g'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}$\n$g''(x) = -\\frac{1}{4}x^{-3/2}$\nSince $x > 0$, we have $g''(x)  0$, which confirms that $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is strictly concave.\n\nApplying Jensen's inequality with $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ and the random variable $X_1$, we get:\n$$E[\\sqrt{X_1}] \\le \\sqrt{E[X_1]}$$\nThe problem states that $E[X_1] = \\mu$, and $\\mu$ is a finite positive constant. Therefore,\n$$E[\\sqrt{X_1}] \\le \\sqrt{\\mu}$$\nSince $\\mu$ is finite, $\\sqrt{\\mu}$ is also finite. This shows that $E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$ is finite.\nBecause $Y_1 = \\sqrt{X_1}$ is a positive random variable, we have $E[|Y_1|] = E[Y_1] = E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$, which is finite.\n\nThe condition for the SLLN is satisfied for the sequence $\\{Y_i\\}$. Therefore, we can conclude that the sample average $S_n$ converges almost surely to the expectation of $Y_1$:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\xrightarrow{\\text{a.s.}} E[Y_1]$$\nSubstituting back $Y_1 = \\sqrt{X_1}$, we find the limit:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n \\xrightarrow{\\text{a.s.}} E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$$\nThe question asks for the value to which $S_n$ converges almost surely. This value is $E[\\sqrt{X_1}]$.",
