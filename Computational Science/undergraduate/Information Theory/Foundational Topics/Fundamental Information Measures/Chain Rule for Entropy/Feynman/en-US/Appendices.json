This practice  provides a concrete, step-by-step application of the rule, $H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)$, to a simple scenario involving two dependent events. By calculating the entropy of a student's quiz answers, you will gain hands-on experience in how the uncertainty of an initial event and the conditional uncertainty of a subsequent event combine to give the total joint entropy.",

This exercise  uses the chain rule to formally demonstrate that no new information is gained by measuring a quantity that is already known.

            "problem": "Consider a system composed of two distinguishable subunits, A and B. Each subunit can exist in one of $N$ possible discrete energy levels, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. Initially, the subunits are prepared independently. They are then brought into contact and allowed to interact through a special process that perfectly correlates their states. After this interaction, the two subunits are always found to be in the same energy level; that is, if a measurement of subunit A's energy level yields index $i$, a simultaneous measurement of subunit B's energy level is guaranteed to also yield index $i$.\n\nThe interaction may redistribute the probabilities of occupying the energy levels. After the interaction, the probability of finding subunit A in the $i$-th energy level is given by $p_i$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i = 1$. Let $X_A$ and $X_B$ be the random variables representing the energy level indices of subunits A and B, respectively, after the interaction.\n\nUsing the statistical mechanics definition of entropy which involves the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and the natural logarithm, what is the joint Shannon entropy $S(X_A, X_B)$ of the combined system after the interaction?

            "problem": "A cryptographic system relies on generating random permutations for its key schedule. A permutation $\\pi = (\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_n)$ of the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is generated through a sequential selection process. First, an element $\\pi_1$ is chosen uniformly at random from the entire set of $n$ integers. Next, an element $\\pi_2$ is chosen uniformly at random from the $n-1$ remaining integers. This process continues, such that at step $k$, the element $\\pi_k$ is chosen uniformly at random from the $n-k+1$ integers not yet selected. This concludes when $\\pi_n$ is chosen, which is the last remaining integer.\n\nLet the sequence of random variables representing this process be $(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_n)$. Calculate the total joint entropy $H(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_n)$ of this sequence.\n\nExpress your answer as a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the joint entropy of a sequence of random variables $(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_n)$ that are generated sequentially. The joint entropy can be calculated using the chain rule for entropy, which states:\n$$H(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} H(X_k | X_1, \\dots, X_{k-1})$$\nBy convention, $H(X_1 | X_0)$ is simply $H(X_1)$.\n\nApplying this rule to our problem, the joint entropy is:\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_n) = H(\\pi_1) + H(\\pi_2 | \\pi_1) + H(\\pi_3 | \\pi_1, \\pi_2) + \\dots + H(\\pi_n | \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{n-1})$$\n\nWe need to calculate each conditional entropy term in this sum.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $H(\\pi_1)$.\nThe first element, $\\pi_1$, is chosen uniformly at random from a set of $n$ elements. The entropy of a discrete random variable that is uniform over a set of size $M$ is $\\log_2(M)$. In this case, $M=n$.\n$$H(\\pi_1) = \\log_2(n)$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate $H(\\pi_2 | \\pi_1)$.\nGiven that $\\pi_1$ has been chosen, the second element, $\\pi_2$, is chosen uniformly at random from the remaining $n-1$ elements. The conditional probability distribution of $\\pi_2$ given any specific value of $\\pi_1$ is uniform over a set of size $n-1$. Therefore, the conditional entropy is:\n$$H(\\pi_2 | \\pi_1) = \\log_2(n-1)$$\n\nStep 3: Generalize for the $k$-th term, $H(\\pi_k | \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{k-1})$.\nAt the $k$-th step, the first $k-1$ elements $(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{k-1})$ have already been chosen. The next element, $\\pi_k$, is chosen uniformly from the set of elements that have not yet been selected. The size of this set is $n - (k-1) = n - k + 1$.\nThe conditional distribution of $\\pi_k$ is uniform over a set of size $n-k+1$. The conditional entropy is therefore:\n$$H(\\pi_k | \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{k-1}) = \\log_2(n-k+1)$$\n\nStep 4: Sum all the conditional entropy terms.\nWe can now write the total joint entropy as the sum of these terms from $k=1$ to $n$:\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} H(\\pi_k | \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{k-1}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\log_2(n-k+1)$$\nLet's expand this sum to see the pattern:\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_n) = \\log_2(n-1+1) + \\log_2(n-2+1) + \\dots + \\log_2(n-n+1)$$\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_n) = \\log_2(n) + \\log_2(n-1) + \\dots + \\log_2(1)$$\nThe last term, for $k=n$, is $H(\\pi_n | \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{n-1}) = \\log_2(n-n+1) = \\log_2(1) = 0$. This makes sense, as the last element is determined once the first $n-1$ are known.\n\nStep 5: Combine the logarithmic terms.\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log(a) + \\log(b) = \\log(ab)$, we can combine the sum of logarithms into the logarithm of a product:\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_n) = \\log_2(n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1)$$\nThe product $n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 1$ is the definition of the factorial of $n$, denoted as $n!$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the joint entropy is:\n$$H(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_n) = \\log_2(n!)$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the sequential generation process produces each of the $n!$ possible permutations with equal probability of $\\frac{1}{n!}$, and the entropy of a uniform distribution over $n!$ outcomes is $\\log_2(n!)$.",
