            "introduction": "This first exercise demonstrates the most direct and powerful application of the Kraft inequality: as a simple, decisive test for the existence of a prefix code. Before investing time in constructing a code, we can use this fundamental principle to quickly determine if a proposed set of codeword lengths is even possible. This practice challenges you to apply the inequality to a hypothetical binary code design to verify its theoretical feasibility .",

            "problem": "A team of engineers is developing a custom binary encoding scheme for a small set of six specialized instructions, $\\{I_1, I_2, I_3, I_4, I_5, I_6\\}$, used to control a new type of microprocessor. To allow for rapid and unambiguous decoding, the chosen scheme must be a \"prefix code,\" which means that no codeword can be the prefix (the initial part) of any other codeword. A new team member excited to contribute proposes a specific structure for the code: she suggests assigning codewords of length 2 to three of the instructions and codewords of length 3 to the remaining three instructions.\n\nAs the project lead, you must verify the theoretical feasibility of this proposal before any implementation work begins. Can such a binary prefix code be constructed?\n\nA. Yes, a prefix code with this set of lengths is possible.\n\nB. No, a prefix code with this set of lengths is impossible to construct.\n\nC. It is only possible if the instructions are used with specific, non-uniform probabilities.\n\nD. There is not enough information to determine if such a code is possible.",
            "solution": "A binary prefix code exists for a multiset of codeword lengths $\\{l_{i}\\}$ if and only if the Kraft-McMillan inequality holds:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{-l_{i}} \\leq 1.\n$$\nFor the proposed lengths, take $l_{1}=l_{2}=l_{3}=2$ and $l_{4}=l_{5}=l_{6}=3$. Compute the Kraft sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} 2^{-l_{i}} = 3 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 3 \\cdot 2^{-3} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$\nSince\n$$\n\\frac{9}{8} > 1,\n$$\nthe Kraft-McMillan inequality is violated. Therefore, no binary prefix code can have three codewords of length $2$ and three codewords of length $3$. This impossibility is independent of any probability assignment to the instructions; it depends solely on the lengths.",

            "introduction": "While binary codes are common, many systems use larger alphabets. This practice extends the Kraft inequality beyond the binary case, illustrating its versatility for any alphabet of size $D$. You will determine the minimum alphabet size required to support a given set of codeword lengths, revealing the crucial trade-off between alphabet complexity and codeword length efficiency .",

            "problem": "A new communication protocol is being designed for a swarm of aerial drones. The protocol uses a set of command words built from an alphabet of $D$ distinct symbols. To ensure unambiguous and instantaneous decoding, the command set is designed such that no command word is a prefix of any other command word. The design specifies three tiers of commands:\n- Tier 1: 2 distinct commands, each of length 2.\n- Tier 2: 4 distinct commands, each of length 3.\n- Tier 3: 8 distinct commands, each of length 4.\n\nGiven these constraints on the command structure, what is the minimum possible integer value for the alphabet size $D$?",
            "solution": "We need a prefix-free set of codewords over a $D$-ary alphabet with lengths: two of length $2$, four of length $3$, and eight of length $4$. For a $D$-ary prefix-free code with codeword lengths $\\{l_{i}\\}$, the Kraft inequality provides a necessary and sufficient condition for existence:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} D^{-l_{i}} \\leq 1.\n$$\nApplying this to the given multiset of lengths, we require\n$$\n2 D^{-2} + 4 D^{-3} + 8 D^{-4} \\leq 1.\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $D^{4}$ (valid for $D \\geq 1$) yields the equivalent inequality\n$$\n2 D^{2} + 4 D + 8 \\leq D^{4}.\n$$\nWe seek the smallest integer $D$ satisfying this inequality.

By the Kraft–McMillan theorem, $\\sum D^{-l_{i}} \\leq 1$ is also sufficient for the existence of a prefix-free code with the specified lengths. Therefore, the minimal feasible alphabet size is $D=3$.",
