This exercise provides a practical scenario to test your understanding of this core principle.

            "problem": "A computer scientist is designing a custom binary encoding scheme for the four primary commands of a mobile robot: {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}. To ensure that the stream of commands can be decoded unambiguously and in real-time, the set of codewords must form an instantaneous code. An instantaneous code is defined as a code in which no codeword is a prefix of any other codeword.\n\nAfter some preliminary design, the scientist has assigned the following binary codewords to three of the commands:\n- The codeword for LEFT is `01`.\n- The codeword for DOWN is `110`.\n- The codeword for RIGHT is `111`.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible length of the binary codeword that can be assigned to the command UP, such that the complete set of four codewords forms a valid instantaneous code?",
            "solution": "An instantaneous code is prefix-free: no assigned codeword may be a prefix of any other. The given codewords are $01$, $110$, and $111$. We seek the minimum possible length $L$ for the remaining codeword (for UP) such that prefix-freeness is preserved.\n\nFirst, consider whether $L=1$ is possible. The only binary strings of length $1$ are $0$ and $1$:\n- If the codeword were $0$, then $0$ would be a prefix of the existing codeword $01$, violating prefix-freeness.\n- If the codeword were $1$, then $1$ would be a prefix of the existing codewords $110$ and $111$, violating prefix-freeness.\nTherefore, no length-$1$ codeword can be added, so $L \\ge 2$.\n\nNext, verify that a length-$2$ codeword can be added without violating prefix-freeness. The length-$2$ binary strings are $00$, $01$, $10$, and $11$. Among these:\n- $01$ is already assigned.\n- $11$ cannot be assigned because it is a prefix of $110$ and $111$, which would violate prefix-freeness.\n- Consider $00$: it is neither a prefix of $01$, $110$, or $111$, nor is any of these a prefix of $00$, since they differ within the first two bits. Hence $00$ is valid.\n- Similarly, $10$ is neither a prefix of $01$, $110$, or $111$, nor is any of these a prefix of $10$. Hence $10$ is valid.\n\nThus, there exists a valid assignment with $L=2$, so the minimum possible length is $2$.\n\nFor completeness, the Kraft inequality for binary instantaneous codes states that for codeword lengths $l_{i}$,\n$$\n\\sum_{i} 2^{-l_{i}} \\le 1.\n$$\nWith the existing lengths $2,3,3$, the sum is $2^{-2} + 2^{-3} + 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2}$. For the remaining codeword of length $L$, we need $2^{-L} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $L \\ge 1$. The prefix constraints exclude $L=1$, and we have exhibited feasible choices at $L=2$, confirming that the minimum possible length is $2$.",

            "problem": "A data compression system is being designed for a specialized communication channel that transmits messages constructed from an alphabet of four distinct symbols: $\\Sigma = \\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$. To optimize transmission, the engineering team has determined that the ideal lengths for the binary codewords assigned to these symbols should be $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 2$, $l_3 = 3$, and $l_4 = 3$, corresponding to symbols $S_1, S_2, S_3,$ and $S_4$, respectively.\n\nThe encoding scheme must be an instantaneous code, meaning that no codeword can be a prefix of any other codeword. A code is defined by the specific assignment of a binary string (codeword) to each symbol in the alphabet. Two codes are considered distinct if at least one symbol is assigned a different codeword.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct, binary, instantaneous codes that can be constructed satisfying these length requirements.",
            "solution": "We require a binary instantaneous (prefix-free) code with prescribed codeword lengths $l_{1}=1$, $l_{2}=2$, $l_{3}=3$, $l_{4}=3$. For a binary instantaneous code, the Kraft equality must hold:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4}2^{-l_{i}}=2^{-1}+2^{-2}+2^{-3}+2^{-3}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=1.\n$$\nSince the sum equals $1$, a full binary prefix tree can be constructed that exactly uses all capacity, and the structure of the code is uniquely constrained at each stage.\n\nRepresent the code by a binary tree with the root at depth $0$ and leaves at depths equal to the codeword lengths. The length-$1$ codeword must be one of the two children of the root: there are $2$ choices, namely $0$ or $1$. Once a length-$1$ leaf is chosen (say it is $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$), no other codeword can start with $b$, so all remaining codewords must lie in the subtree under the other root child, denoted $\\bar{b}$.\n\nWithin the subtree under $\\bar{b}$, we must place one length-$2$ codeword and two length-$3$ codewords. The only possible length-$2$ codewords from the root that start with $\\bar{b}$ are the two nodes at depth $2$ in that subtree, namely $\\bar{b}0$ and $\\bar{b}1$. We must choose exactly one of these as the length-$2$ codeword: there are $2$ choices. Once this choice is made, the subtree beneath the chosen depth-$2$ node is blocked by the prefix-free constraint, so the two length-$3$ codewords must be exactly the two leaves at depth $3$ under the other depth-$2$ node. Therefore, for each choice of the length-$1$ codeword and the length-$2$ codeword, the length-$3$ codewords are forced.\n\nHence, the number of distinct sets of codewords with the multiset of lengths $\\{1,2,3,3\\}$ is $2 \\times 2=4$.\n\nFinally, the symbols are labeled with fixed lengths: $S_{1}$ must take the unique length-$1$ codeword, $S_{2}$ must take the unique length-$2$ codeword in the chosen set, and $S_{3},S_{4}$ must take the two distinct length-$3$ codewords. Since $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ can be assigned to these two distinct length-$3$ codewords in $2! = 2$ ways, each codeword set yields $2$ distinct codes under symbol assignment.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct binary instantaneous codes satisfying the given length requirements is\n$$\n4 \\times 2 = 8.\n$$",

These symbols are to be encoded into a sequence of binary digits $\\{0, 1\\}$ using an instantaneous code. The transmission of these binary digits incurs a cost: sending a '0' costs 1 unit, while sending a '1' costs 2 units. The cost of encoding a source symbol is the sum of the costs of the binary digits in its corresponding codeword. Your task is to design an optimal instantaneous binary code that minimizes the expected cost per source symbol. What is this minimum possible expected cost per source symbol?",

Therefore, the only possible tree shapes are:\n- The root’s $1$-edge leads to a leaf (cost $2$), and the root’s $0$-edge leads to an internal node whose two children are leaves labeled $00$ and $01$, with costs $1+1=2$ and $1+2=3$.
