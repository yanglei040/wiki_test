This exercise provides a clear, practical scenario involving a fixed-length code for a source with a non-uniform probability distribution. By calculating the difference between the average codeword length, $\\bar{L}$, and the source entropy, $H$, you will directly quantify the inefficiency inherent in using a simple code for a source with predictable patterns .",

At any given moment, the light can be in one of three states: Red, Yellow, or Green. Based on extensive historical traffic data, the probability of the light being Red is $p_R = 0.5$, the probability of it being Yellow is $p_Y = 0.1$, and the probability of it being Green is $p_G = 0.4$.
