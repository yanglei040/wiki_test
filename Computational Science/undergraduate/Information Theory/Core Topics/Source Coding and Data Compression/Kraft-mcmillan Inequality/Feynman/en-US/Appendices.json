            "problem": "An information theorist is designing a binary prefix code for a set of symbols. Due to specific constraints related to the symbol semantics, a list of desired codeword lengths has been proposed. However, it is not guaranteed that a prefix code with this exact set of lengths can be constructed.\n\nFor any binary prefix code with $N$ codewords of lengths $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_N$, the Kraft-McMillan inequality must be satisfied:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2^{-l_i} \\le 1 $$\nConversely, if a set of integer lengths satisfies this inequality, a binary prefix code with these lengths is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe proposed multiset of codeword lengths is given by the following counts:\n- One codeword of length 2\n- Two codewords of length 3\n- Six codewords of length 4\n- Six codewords of length 5\n\nYour task is to determine the size of the largest possible subset of these proposed codewords that can form a valid binary prefix code. In other words, what is the maximum number of codewords that can be selected from the given multiset such that their lengths satisfy the Kraft-McMillan inequality?",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum number of codewords we can select from a given multiset of lengths, such that the selected lengths $\\{l_i\\}$ satisfy the Kraft-McMillan inequality for a binary alphabet, $\\sum_i 2^{-l_i} \\le 1$.\n\nLet the given multiset of lengths be $L$. We need to find a subset $S \\subseteq L$ that maximizes the size $|S|$ while satisfying $\\sum_{l \\in S} 2^{-l} \\le 1$.\n\nThis is an optimization problem. We want to maximize the number of items in our set $S$, where each item $l \\in L$ has a \"cost\" of $2^{-l}$ and contributes 1 to the total count. The total \"cost\" cannot exceed a budget of 1. To maximize the number of items we can fit within this budget, we should prioritize including the items with the lowest cost.\n\nThe cost of including a codeword of length $l$ is $2^{-l}$. This cost is a decreasing function of $l$. Therefore, longer codewords are \"cheaper\" to include in our sum than shorter ones. This suggests a greedy algorithm: we should iterate through the available codeword lengths, from longest to shortest, and add as many as possible at each step without exceeding the Kraft sum limit of 1.\n\nThe available codeword lengths are given by counts:\n- Length 5: 6 codewords\n- Length 4: 6 codewords\n- Length 3: 2 codewords\n- Length 2: 1 codeword\n\nLet's apply the greedy strategy. We initialize the Kraft sum, $K=0$, and the number of selected codewords, $N=0$.\n\nStep 1: Consider the longest available length, $l=5$.\nThere are 6 codewords of length 5. The cost to include all of them is $6 \\times 2^{-5} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{6}{32} = \\frac{3}{16}$.\nOur current sum is $K = \\frac{3}{16}$. Since $\\frac{3}{16} \\le 1$, we can include all 6 of these codewords.\nOur current count is $N=6$.\n\nStep 2: Consider the next longest length, $l=4$.\nThere are 6 codewords of length 4. The cost to include all of them is $6 \\times 2^{-4} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nIf we add these, the new Kraft sum would be $K = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}$.\nSince $\\frac{9}{16} \\le 1$, we can include all 6 of these codewords.\nOur current count becomes $N = 6 + 6 = 12$. Our current sum is $K = \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nStep 3: Consider the next longest length, $l=3$.\nThere are 2 codewords of length 3. The cost to include both is $2 \\times 2^{-3} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nIf we add these, the new Kraft sum would be $K = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\nSince $\\frac{13}{16} \\le 1$, we can include both of these codewords.\nOur current count becomes $N = 12 + 2 = 14$. Our current sum is $K = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nStep 4: Consider the shortest length, $l=2$.\nThere is 1 codeword of length 2. The cost to include it is $1 \\times 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nIf we add this, the new Kraft sum would be $K = \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{17}{16}$.\nSince $\\frac{17}{16} > 1$, we cannot include this codeword. The budget of 1 would be exceeded.\n\nThe greedy process concludes here. We have selected all 6 codewords of length 5, all 6 codewords of length 4, and both codewords of length 3. The codeword of length 2 was rejected.\n\nThe total number of selected codewords is $N = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14$. This is the maximum number of codewords that can be chosen from the proposed set to form a valid binary prefix code. The selected lengths $\\{5,5,5,5,5,5, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3,3\\}$ satisfy the Kraft-McMillan inequality as their sum is $\\frac{13}{16} \\le 1$.",

The design requires the creation of a binary prefix code, where no codeword is a prefix of any other. Furthermore, the code must be \"complete,\" which means that it is not possible to add another codeword of any length to the codebook without violating the prefix condition.
