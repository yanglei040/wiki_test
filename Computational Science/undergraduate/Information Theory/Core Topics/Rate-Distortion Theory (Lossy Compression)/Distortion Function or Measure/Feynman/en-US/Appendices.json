This first exercise provides a concrete foundation for quantifying this error by examining the common task of a digital thermometer rounding a temperature to the nearest integer. By calculating and comparing the average squared-error and average absolute-error, you will explore how different mathematical definitions of distortion lead to distinct performance metrics for the same physical process.",

            "problem": "A digital thermometer is designed to measure environmental temperature. The true temperature, denoted by the continuous random variable $X$, is accurately modeled by a uniform distribution over the range $[-5.5, 5.5]$ degrees Celsius. The thermometer's internal analog-to-digital converter processes the true temperature $X$ and outputs a quantized value $\\hat{X}$, which is the integer closest to $X$.\n\nThe performance of this quantization process can be evaluated using different distortion measures. We consider two common ones:\n1.  The squared-error distortion, defined for a true value $x$ and its quantized version $\\hat{x}$ as $d_2(x, \\hat{x}) = (x - \\hat{x})^2$.\n2.  The absolute-error distortion, defined as $d_1(x, \\hat{x}) = |x - \\hat{x}|$.\n\nThe average distortion is the expected value of the distortion measure over the distribution of the true temperature $X$. Let $D_2$ be the average squared-error distortion and $D_1$ be the average absolute-error distortion.\n\nCalculate the ratio $\\frac{D_2}{D_1}$. Express your answer as an exact fraction.",

Ties at half-integers are a measure-zero set and do not affect expectations. The true temperature $X$ is uniform on $[-5.5, 5.5]$, so its density is $f_{X}(x) = \\frac{1}{11}$ on this interval.\n\nDefine the quantization error $U = X - \\hat{X}$. On each cell $[k - \\frac{1}{2}, k + \\frac{1}{2}]$, write $x = k + u$ with $u \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$, and then $\\hat{X} = k$, so $U = u$.

This practice explores this idea by modeling a traffic light communication system where misinterpreting a 'Red' light as 'Green' is far more dangerous than other mistakes.

This problem extends the concept of distortion into two dimensions by comparing the efficiency of quantizing data onto a square grid versus a regular hexagonal grid.

The probability distribution of this source is uniform over a large area of the plane. To digitize this source, we use a quantizer that maps the source vector $\\mathbf{X}$ to the nearest point in a predefined set of representative points, called a codebook. These codebook points form a regular lattice structure that tessellates the plane.\n\nWe will compare two different lattice quantization schemes: one based on a square grid and another on a regular hexagonal grid. In the first scheme, the representative points are the centers of a square tiling of the plane. In the second, they are the centers of a regular hexagonal tiling.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, both schemes must use the same density of representative points. This is equivalent to requiring that the area of a single quantization cell (the Voronoi region around a representative point) is the same for both lattices. Let this common cell area be denoted by $A$.\n\nThe quality of the quantization is measured by the average distortion. The distortion function used is the squared Euclidean distance between the source vector $\\mathbf{x}$ and its quantized representation $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, i.e., $d(\\mathbf{x}, \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = ||\\mathbf{x} - \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}||^2$.\n\nCalculate the numerical value of the ratio $\\frac{D_{sq}}{D_{hex}}$, where $D_{sq}$ is the average distortion for the square lattice quantizer and $D_{hex}$ is the average distortion for the hexagonal lattice quantizer.
