The probability of occurrence for each symbol is given by $P(A) = 0.6$, $P(B) = 0.3$, and $P(C) = 0.1$. You are tasked with encoding the sequence of symbols \"BCA\" using the arithmetic coding algorithm. The initial encoding interval is $[0, 1)$. Determine the final interval $[L_{\\text{final}}, H_{\\text{final}})$ that represents the entire sequence. Express the final lower bound $L_{\\text{final}}$ and the final upper bound $H_{\\text{final}}$ as fractions.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the final interval after applying arithmetic coding to the sequence \"BCA\" given a source with specific probabilities. We start with the initial interval $[L_0, H_0) = [0, 1)$.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the cumulative probability distribution for the symbols in the alphabet $\\mathcal{S} = \\{A, B, C\\}$. We will order the alphabet as (A, B, C). The probability of each symbol is $P(A) = 0.6$, $P(B) = 0.3$, and $P(C) = 0.1$.\n\nThe cumulative probability function, which we denote as $F(s)$, gives the sum of probabilities of all symbols that come before $s$ in the defined order. The range for each symbol will be a subinterval of $[0, 1)$ of width equal to its probability.\n-   Symbol A: Range corresponds to $[F(A), F(A)+P(A)) = [0, 0.6)$. So, $F(A)=0$.\n-   Symbol B: Range corresponds to $[F(B), F(B)+P(B)) = [0.6, 0.6+0.3) = [0.6, 0.9)$. So, $F(B)=0.6$.\n-   Symbol C: Range corresponds to $[F(C), F(C)+P(C)) = [0.9, 0.9+0.1) = [0.9, 1.0)$. So, $F(C)=0.9$.\n\nLet's express these probabilities and cumulative probabilities as fractions:\n$P(A) = \\frac{6}{10}$, $P(B) = \\frac{3}{10}$, $P(C) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n$F(A) = 0$, $F(B) = \\frac{6}{10}$, $F(C) = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe arithmetic coding algorithm iteratively updates the interval $[L, H)$ for each symbol in the sequence.

            "problem": "In arithmetic coding, a sequence of symbols is mapped to a sub-interval of the interval $[0, 1)$. This problem explores how the order of symbols in a sequence affects the resulting interval's position.\n\nConsider an alphabet $\\mathcal{A} = \\{X, Y, Z\\}$ with respective probabilities of occurrence $P(X)$, $P(Y)$, and $P(Z)$, which are all positive. We are given the relation $P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z)$, and it holds that $P(X) + P(Y) + P(Z) = 1$.\n\nThe encoding process is defined as follows:\n1.  The initial interval is $[0, 1)$.\n2.  The interval is partitioned into sub-intervals for each symbol based on a fixed alphabetical order: X, then Y, then Z.\n    - The sub-interval for X is $[0, P(X))$.\n    - The sub-interval for Y is $[P(X), P(X)+P(Y))$.\n    - The sub-interval for Z is $[P(X)+P(Y), 1)$.\n3.  For each symbol in an input sequence, the current interval is updated to become the corresponding sub-interval, scaled and shifted appropriately. Specifically, if the current interval is $[L, U)$ with width $W = U-L$, processing a symbol $s$ updates the interval to $[L', U')$ where:\n    - $L' = L + W \\cdot C(s)$\n    - $U' = L + W \\cdot (C(s) + P(s))$\n    and $C(s)$ is the cumulative probability of all symbols that appear before $s$ in the fixed alphabetical order (i.e., $C(X)=0$, $C(Y)=P(X)$, $C(Z)=P(X)+P(Y)$).\n\nConsider the two three-symbol sequences: 'XYZ' and 'ZYX'.

The sequence 'XYZ'\n\nB. The sequence 'ZYX'\n\nC. The lower bounds are equal.\n\nD. The relationship depends on the specific numerical values of the probabilities $P(X)$, $P(Y)$, and $P(Z)$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks which sequence, 'XYZ' or 'ZYX', results in a final interval with a larger lower bound. The key insight lies in the first symbol of each sequence and how the initial interval $[0, 1)$ is partitioned. This property, where the numerical order of intervals on the number line corresponds to the lexicographical order of the sequences, is a fundamental feature of arithmetic coding.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the interval is partitioned based on a fixed alphabetical order of the symbols: X, then Y, then Z.\n- The sub-interval for sequences starting with 'X' is $[0, P(X))$.\n- The sub-interval for sequences starting with 'Y' is $[P(X), P(X)+P(Y))$.\n- The sub-interval for sequences starting with 'Z' is $[P(X)+P(Y), 1)$.\n\nThe sequence 'XYZ' starts with the symbol 'X'. Therefore, its final encoded interval, regardless of the subsequent symbols, must be a sub-interval of the initial interval for 'X', which is $[0, P(X))$. This means the lower bound of the final interval for 'XYZ', $L_{\\text{XYZ}}$, must be within this range, so $0 \\le L_{\\text{XYZ}}  P(X)$.\n\nThe sequence 'ZYX' starts with the symbol 'Z'. Its final encoded interval must be a sub-interval of the initial interval for 'Z', which is $[P(X)+P(Y), 1)$. This means the lower bound of the final interval for 'ZYX', $L_{\\text{ZYX}}$, must be greater than or equal to $P(X)+P(Y)$.\n\nSince all probabilities are positive, we have $P(X)+P(Y) > P(X)$. Therefore, we can definitively conclude:\n$$L_{\\text{ZYX}} \\ge P(X)+P(Y) > P(X) > L_{\\text{XYZ}}$$\nThe lower bound for 'ZYX' is strictly larger than the lower bound for 'XYZ'.

            "introduction": "The theoretical result of arithmetic coding is a mathematical interval, but a practical compressor must output a finite sequence of bits. This problem  bridges that gap by tasking you with finding the shortest binary fraction that uniquely identifies the final encoded interval.

            "problem": "A simple weather model for a remote planet generates one of two states each day: 'Clear' (C) or 'Storm' (S). Based on long-term data, the probability of a 'Clear' day is $P(C) = 2/3$, and the probability of a 'Storm' day is $P(S) = 1/3$. To save bandwidth, a sequence of weather states is compressed into a single binary number using an encoding scheme.\n\nThe scheme works as follows:\n1.  Start with the real interval $[0, 1)$.\n2.  For the first observation in the sequence, partition the current interval into sub-intervals corresponding to the possible states, ordered alphabetically ('Clear', 'Storm'). The size of each sub-interval is proportional to the probability of that state.\n3.  Select the sub-interval that corresponds to the observed state. This becomes the new current interval.\n4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subsequent observation in the sequence.\n\nThe final encoded message must be a binary fraction that serves as a prefix code. This means the dyadic interval corresponding to the binary fraction (e.g., the fraction $0.101$ corresponds to the interval $[0.101_2, 0.110_2) = [5/8, 6/8)$) must be entirely contained within the final interval calculated from the encoding scheme.\n\nFor an observed two-day sequence of 'Clear' then 'Storm', determine the shortest possible binary fraction (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, 0.110) that can be used as the encoded message.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the shortest binary fraction that can uniquely encode the sequence 'Clear'-'Storm' (CS). We first need to determine the final interval corresponding to this sequence using the described arithmetic encoding procedure.\n\nLet the alphabet be ordered alphabetically: (C, S).

The width of this interval is $W_0 = H_0 - L_0 = 1$.\nWe partition this interval based on the probabilities of C and S.\nThe sub-interval for 'C' is $[L_0, L_0 + P(C) \\times W_0)$, which is $[0, 0 + (2/3) \\times 1) = [0, 2/3)$.\nThe sub-interval for 'S' is $[L_0 + P(C) \\times W_0, H_0)$, which is $[2/3, 1)$.\nSince the first symbol is 'C', the new interval is $[L_1, H_1) = [0, 2/3)$.\n\n**Step 2: Process the second symbol 'S'.**\nThe current interval is $[L_1, H_1) = [0, 2/3)$.

In decimal, this is approximately $[0.444..., 0.666...)$.\nWe need to find the shortest binary fraction, let's call it $T = (0.b_1b_2...b_k)_2$, such that the dyadic interval it represents, $[T, T + 2^{-k})$, is completely contained within $[4/9, 2/3)$.\n\nLet's test for increasing lengths $k$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\nThe possible dyadic intervals are $[0, 1/2)$ and $[1/2, 1)$.\nNeither is fully contained in $[4/9, 2/3) \\approx [0.444, 0.667)$. For example, $[1/2, 1)$ has an upper bound of 1, which is greater than $2/3$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\nThe dyadic intervals are of width $2^{-2} = 1/4$. They are $[0, 1/4)$, $[1/4, 1/2)$, $[1/2, 3/4)$, and $[3/4, 1)$.\nLet's check the interval $[1/2, 3/4) = [0.5, 0.75)$.\nThe lower bound $1/2 = 0.5$ is greater than $4/9 \\approx 0.444$. So $1/2$ is in the final interval.\nThe upper bound $3/4 = 0.75$ is greater than $2/3 \\approx 0.667$. So this dyadic interval is not fully contained in the final interval. No other 2-bit dyadic interval is a candidate.\n\nFor $k=3$:\nThe dyadic intervals are of width $2^{-3} = 1/8 = 0.125$.\nLet's check the dyadic intervals around our target range $[0.444..., 0.667...)$.\nThe interval starting at $0.5$ is a good candidate. This corresponds to the binary prefix '100', so the fraction is $T = (0.100)_2 = 1/2 = 4/8$.\nThe dyadic interval is $[(0.100)_2, (0.100)_2 + 2^{-3}) = [1/2, 1/2 + 1/8) = [4/8, 5/8) = [0.5, 0.625)$.\nLet's check if this interval is contained in $[4/9, 2/3)$:\n- Check lower bound: Is $4/9 \\le 1/2$? Yes, since $8 \\le 9$.\n- Check upper bound: Is $5/8  2/3$? Yes, since $15  16$.\nBoth conditions are met. The dyadic interval $[1/2, 5/8)$ is entirely contained within $[4/9, 2/3)$.\n\nSince we found a valid prefix code of length 3, and we showed that no code of length 1 or 2 exists, the shortest possible prefix code must have length 3. The specific prefix is '100'.\nThe binary fraction corresponding to this shortest prefix is $(0.100)_2$.\n\nThus, the shortest binary fraction that satisfies the prefix code condition is $0.100$. Note that while the value is $0.5$, the representation must be given with three bits to signify that it is a 3-bit prefix code, distinguishing it from the insufficient 1-bit prefix '1' (representing $0.1_2$) or 2-bit prefix '10' (representing $0.10_2$).",
