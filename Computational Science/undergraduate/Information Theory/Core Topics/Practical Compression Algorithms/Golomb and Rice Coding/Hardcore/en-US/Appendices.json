The encoding for a non-negative integer $x$ depends on a tunable positive integer parameter $M$.\n\nThe encoding process is as follows:\n1.

The quotient $q$ is encoded in unary representation, defined as a sequence of $q$ ones followed by a single zero. For example, $q=3$ is encoded as `1110`.\n3.  The remainder $r$ is encoded in binary. When the parameter $M$ is a power of two, such that $M = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$, the remainder $r$ is encoded as a standard $k$-bit unsigned binary number. For example, if $k=3$ and the remainder is $r=5$, its binary code is `101`.\n4.
