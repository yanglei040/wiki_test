            "introduction": "The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides the fundamental rule for converting continuous signals into discrete samples without losing information. The key is to sample at a rate at least twice the signal's maximum frequency, or bandwidth. This practice explores how a signal's bandwidth is affected by common signal processing operations, specifically convolution, by challenging you to find the Nyquist rate for a signal constructed from two convolved sinc pulses .",

            "problem": "Consider a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ which is created by the convolution of a sinc pulse with itself. The signal is given by the expression:\n$$x(t) = s(t) \\ast s(t)$$\nwhere $s(t) = \\text{sinc}(200t)$, and the asterisk `*` denotes the convolution operation. The normalized sinc function is defined as $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}$.\n\nTo perfectly reconstruct the signal $x(t)$ from its discrete-time samples without loss of information, it must be sampled at a rate no less than its Nyquist rate.\n\nCalculate the exact Nyquist sampling rate for the signal $x(t)$. Express your answer in units of samples per second.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the Nyquist sampling rate of the signal $x(t) = s(t) \\ast s(t)$. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that the minimum sampling rate, known as the Nyquist rate $f_N$, required to perfectly reconstruct a bandlimited signal is twice its highest frequency component, $f_{max}$.\n$$f_N = 2 f_{max}$$\nTo find $f_{max}$ for the signal $x(t)$, we must analyze its frequency spectrum, which is given by its Fourier transform, $X(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\}$.\n\nThe signal $x(t)$ is a convolution of $s(t)$ with itself. A fundamental property of the Fourier transform, the convolution theorem, states that the Fourier transform of a convolution of two signals in the time domain is the product of their individual Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.\n$$X(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t) \\ast s(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\} = (S(f))^2$$\nwhere $S(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\}$.\n\nOur next step is to find the Fourier transform $S(f)$ of the signal $s(t) = \\text{sinc}(200t)$. The problem defines the sinc function as $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}$.\nA standard Fourier transform pair is given for a sinc function of the form $\\text{sinc}(2Wt)$:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\text{sinc}(2Wt)\\} = \\frac{1}{2W} \\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{f}{2W}\\right)$$\nThe rectangular function, $\\text{rect}(y)$, is defined as 1 for $|y|  1/2$ and 0 otherwise. This means the spectrum $\\frac{1}{2W} \\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{f}{2W}\\right)$ is non-zero only when $|\\frac{f}{2W}|  \\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $|f|  W$. Thus, a signal of the form $\\text{sinc}(2Wt)$ is bandlimited to the frequency range $(-W, W)$, and its maximum frequency is $f_{max} = W$.\n\nWe can now apply this to our specific signal $s(t) = \\text{sinc}(200t)$. By comparing this to the standard form $\\text{sinc}(2Wt)$, we can equate the arguments:\n$$2Wt = 200t \\implies 2W = 200 \\implies W = 100 \\text{ Hz}$$\nSo, the maximum frequency component in the signal $s(t)$ is $f_{max,s} = W = 100$ Hz. Its Fourier transform, $S(f)$, is a rectangular pulse that is non-zero only for frequencies $f$ in the interval $(-100 \\text{ Hz}, 100 \\text{ Hz})$.\n\nNow we can determine the spectrum of the convolved signal $x(t)$, which is $X(f) = (S(f))^2$.\nSince $S(f)$ is zero for all frequencies $|f| \\geq 100$ Hz, its square, $(S(f))^2$, must also be zero for all frequencies $|f| \\geq 100$ Hz. The frequency content of $X(f)$ is confined to the exact same frequency range as $S(f)$. Therefore, the maximum frequency component in the signal $x(t)$ is also 100 Hz.\n$$f_{max,x} = 100 \\text{ Hz}$$\nFinally, we calculate the Nyquist rate for $x(t)$ using the formula $f_N = 2 f_{max,x}$:\n$$f_N = 2 \\times 100 \\text{ Hz} = 200 \\text{ Hz}$$\nThe unit Hertz (Hz) is equivalent to cycles per second, or in the context of sampling, samples per second.\n\nThus, the minimum sampling rate required to avoid aliasing is 200 samples per second.",

            "introduction": "While the Nyquist rate is often stated as twice the maximum frequency, this rule has an important nuance that depends on the nature of the signal itself. This exercise highlights the critical distinction between sampling real-valued signals, like a cosine wave, and complex-valued signals, like a complex exponential. By calculating the minimum sampling frequency for both , you will see why this difference is essential for designing efficient digital communication and data acquisition systems.",

To ensure that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples without any loss of information due to aliasing, a specific minimum sampling frequency is required for each system.\n\nDetermine the minimum required sampling frequency for System 1, which we will call $f_{s,1}$, and the minimum required sampling frequency for System 2, which we will call $f_{s,2}$.\n\nProvide the values for $f_{s,1}$ and $f_{s,2}$ in order.
