This concept is visualized through sphere packing, where each signal is the center of a non-overlapping sphere representing its 'personal space'.

This structure forms a simple square lattice.\n\nTo analyze the efficiency of this code, we can compute its sphere packing density. This density is the fraction of the signal space occupied by non-overlapping \"spheres\" (which are disks in 2D) centered on each codeword. The radius of these spheres is the largest possible value that prevents any two from overlapping. The density, $\\Delta$, is formally defined as the ratio of the volume of a single sphere to the volume of the fundamental region associated with a single codeword.\n\nThe fundamental region for a given codeword is the set of all points in the space that are closer to that codeword than to any other. In this 2D case, \"volume\" refers to area.\n\nCalculate the sphere packing density $\\Delta$ for this infinite square lattice code.

            "problem": "In digital communication systems, information is often encoded into signals represented as points in a multi-dimensional space. An arrangement of such points is called a signal constellation. The average energy of a constellation with $M$ points, where the $i$-th point is at coordinate vector $\\mathbf{s}_i$, is defined as $E_{avg} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\|\\mathbf{s}_i\\|^2$. The minimum distance, $d_{min}$, is the smallest Euclidean distance between any two distinct points in the constellation.

We will determine the coordinates of the points for each constellation in terms of $d_{min}$, calculate their respective average energies, and then find the ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Constellation A (PAM-style)**\n\nConstellation A consists of four points lying on the x-axis, equally spaced and symmetric about the origin. Let the distance from the origin to the innermost points be $\\alpha$. Due to the equal spacing and symmetry, the points must be located at coordinates $( -3\\alpha, 0)$, $(-\\alpha, 0)$, $(\\alpha, 0)$, and $(3\\alpha, 0)$.\n\nThe distance between any two adjacent points is $(3\\alpha - \\alpha) = 2\\alpha$ or $(\\alpha - (-\\alpha)) = 2\\alpha$.

This is the length of a side of the square. The diagonal distance, e.g., between $(\\beta, \\beta)$ and $(-\\beta, -\\beta)$, is $\\sqrt{(\\beta - (-\\beta))^2 + (\\beta - (-\\beta))^2} = \\sqrt{(2\\beta)^2 + (2\\beta)^2} = \\sqrt{8\\beta^2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\beta$.\n\nThe minimum distance between any two points is the side length of the square. So, $d_{min} = 2\\beta$, which implies $\\beta = \\frac{d_{min}}{2}$.\n\nThe coordinates of the four points in Constellation B are:\n$s_{B,1} = (-\\frac{d_{min}}{2}, -\\frac{d_{min}}{2})$\n$s_{B,2} = (-\\frac{d_{min}}{2}, \\frac{d_{min}}{2})$\n$s_{B,3} = (\\frac{d_{min}}{2}, -\\frac{d_{min}}{2})$\n$s_{B,4} = (\\frac{d_{min}}{2}, \\frac{d_{min}}{2})$\n\nBy symmetry, all four points are at the same distance from the origin, so they have the same energy. Let's calculate the energy for one point, say $s_{B,4}$:\n$\\|\\mathbf{s}_{B,4}\\|^2 = (\\frac{d_{min}}{2})^2 + (\\frac{d_{min}}{2})^2 = \\frac{d_{min}^2}{4} + \\frac{d_{min}^2}{4} = \\frac{2d_{min}^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}d_{min}^2$\n\nSince all points have the same energy, the average energy is simply the energy of any one point:\n$E_{avg, B} = \\|\\mathbf{s}_{B,4}\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}d_{min}^2$\n\n**Calculating the Ratio**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the average energies:\n$\\frac{E_{avg, A}}{E_{avg, B}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}d_{min}^2}{\\frac{1}{2}d_{min}^2}$\n\nThe $d_{min}^2$ term cancels out:\n$\\frac{E_{avg, A}}{E_{avg, B}} = \\frac{5/4}{1/2} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}$",

            "problem": "A communication system encodes messages as points (codewords) in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^n$. When a codeword $\\vec{x}_i$ is transmitted, the received vector $\\vec{y}$ is corrupted by noise, such that the error vector $\\vec{e} = \\vec{y} - \\vec{x}_i$ has a magnitude satisfying $\\|\\vec{e}\\|  r$. To ensure perfect decoding, the set of all possible codewords, $\\{\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_M\\}$, must be chosen such that the open balls of radius $r$ centered at each codeword are mutually disjoint.\n\nConsider the task of constructing such a code by selecting codewords from a large hyper-region of total volume $V_{total}$. A greedy algorithm is proposed for this task:\n\n1.  Initialize the codebook $C$ as an empty set.\n2.  Select an arbitrary point $\\vec{p}_1$ from the hyper-region and add it to $C$.\n3.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a lower bound on the number of codewords, $M$, that can be generated by a specific greedy algorithm. The key is to analyze the condition under which the algorithm terminates.\n\nFirst, let's understand the coding constraint. For any two distinct codewords $\\vec{x}_i$ and $\\vec{x}_j$ in the codebook $C$, the open balls of radius $r$ around them must be disjoint. The condition for two balls $B(\\vec{x}_i, r)$ and $B(\\vec{x}_j, r)$ to be disjoint is that the distance between their centers must be at least the sum of their radii. Therefore, for any $\\vec{x}_i, \\vec{x}_j \\in C$ with $i \\neq j$, we must have $\\|\\vec{x}_i - \\vec{x}_j\\| \\ge r + r = 2r$. This is precisely the condition used in step 4 of the greedy algorithm to accept a new codeword.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when it is no longer possible to add a new point to the codebook $C$. Let the final codebook contain $M$ codewords, $C = \\{\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_M\\}$. The termination condition means that for any point $\\vec{p}$ in the hyper-region of volume $V_{total}$ (that is not already one of the chosen codewords), the condition for adding it to the codebook is violated.\n\nThe condition to add a point $\\vec{p}$ is $\\|\\vec{p} - \\vec{x}_i\\| \\ge 2r$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, M\\}$. The violation of this condition means that for any such point $\\vec{p}$, there must exist at least one codeword $\\vec{x}_k \\in C$ for which $\\|\\vec{p} - \\vec{x}_k\\|  2r$.\n\nThis implies that at the end of the algorithm, every point in the hyper-region is within a distance of $2r$ from at least one of the $M$ codewords. In other words, the entire hyper-region of volume $V_{total}$ is \"covered by\" the union of $M$ open balls of radius $2r$ centered at the $M$ codewords.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{V}$ be the hyper-region of volume $V_{total}$.
