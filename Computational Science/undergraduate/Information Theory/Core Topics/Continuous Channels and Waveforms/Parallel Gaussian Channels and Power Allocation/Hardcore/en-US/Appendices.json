All channels are modeled as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. Due to varying background radiation and interference, these channels are not all of a uniform quality. Specifically, one half of the channels ($N/2$ of them) are classified as \"good\" channels, each experiencing a low noise power variance of $\\sigma_g^2$. The other half ($N/2$ channels) are \"bad\" channels, each suffering from a significantly higher noise power variance of $\\sigma_b^2$, with $\\sigma_b^2 > \\sigma_g^2$.\n\nA central power controller on the probe must allocate a total available power, $P_{total}$, among these $N$ channels.

Each sub-channel can be modeled as an independent Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. The total capacity of such a system is the sum of the capacities of its sub-channels.\n\nConsider a simplified system with $N=3$ parallel sub-channels, each having an identical bandwidth of $B = 1000$ Hz. The capacity of the $i$-th sub-channel, $C_i$, when a power $P_i$ is allocated to it, is given by the Shannon-Hartley theorem:\n$$C_i = B \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{|h_i|^2 P_i}{N_0 B}\\right)$$\nwhere $|h_i|^2$ is the power gain of the $i$-th channel and $N_0$ is the constant one-sided power spectral density of the noise.\n\nThe system has a total power budget that has been discretized into $M=3$ indivisible integer units of power. An integer number of these units, $m_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, can be allocated to each channel $i$, such that the total number of units used does not exceed $M$. The power allocated to channel $i$ is thus $P_i = m_i \\Delta P$, where $\\Delta P$ is the power of a single unit. The capacity of channel $i$ with $m_i$ units of power is therefore:\n$$C_i(m_i) = B \\log_2(1 + \\gamma_i m_i)$$\nwhere $\\gamma_i = \\frac{|h_i|^2 \\Delta P}{N_0 B}$ is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized gain-to-noise ratio per power unit for the $i$-th channel.\n\nThe values for the three channels are:\n$\\gamma_1 = 1.0$\n$\\gamma_2 = 0.5$\n$\\gamma_3 = 3.0$\n\nYour task is to find the maximum possible total capacity, $C_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_i(m_i)$, for this system by determining the optimal allocation of the $M=3$ power units.

The goal is to maximize $C_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_i(m_i)$ subject to the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} m_i \\le 3$, where each $m_i$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nThis is a classic resource allocation problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. Let $V(k, m)$ be the maximum capacity achievable by allocating $m$ units of power across the first $k$ channels (from channel 1 to channel $k$).\n\nThe dynamic programming recursion can be formulated as follows: To calculate $V(k, m)$, we decide how many power units, $j$, to allocate to channel $k$. This leaves $m-j$ units for the first $k-1$ channels. The capacity from this decision is the sum of the capacity of channel $k$ with $j$ units, $C_k(j)$, and the maximum capacity achievable with the remaining resources, $V(k-1, m-j)$. We must maximize over all possible choices for $j$, where $0 \\le j \\le m$.\n\nThe recursion is:\n$$V(k, m) = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le m} \\{ C_k(j) + V(k-1, m-j) \\}$$\n\nThe base case is for $k=0$ (no channels), where the capacity is always zero regardless of the power available:\n$$V(0, m) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$$\n\nFirst, we pre-calculate the individual channel capacities $C_i(j)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.

The maximum for $V(3,3)$ occurred at $j=2$, so $m_3=2$. This leaves 1 unit of power for channels 1 and 2, so we look at the decision for $V(2,1)$. For $V(2,1)$, the maximum was for $j=0$, so $m_2=0$. This leaves 1 unit for channel 1, so $m_1=1$. The optimal allocation is $(m_1, m_2, m_3) = (1, 0, 2)$.\nChecking this allocation:\n$C_{\\text{total}} = C_1(1) + C_2(0) + C_3(2) = 1000 + 0 + 2807.35 = 3807.35$ bits/sec.
