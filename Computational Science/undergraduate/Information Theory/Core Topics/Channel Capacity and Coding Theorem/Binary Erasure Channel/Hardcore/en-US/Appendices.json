This practice explores channel capacity through a compelling thought experiment. By considering a catastrophically damaged channel that erases every single bit ($p=1$), we can intuitively grasp and formally verify the relationship between erasure probability and the ultimate rate of reliable communication, which is defined by the capacity formula $C = 1 - p$.

            "problem": "A deep-space probe uses a binary communication system to transmit scientific data back to Earth. The communication channel can be modeled as a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). In a BEC, a transmitted bit $X$, which can be either 0 or 1, is received as an output $Y$. With a certain probability $p$, called the erasure probability, the transmitted bit is lost and the receiver gets an erasure symbol, denoted by 'e'. With probability $1-p$, the bit is transmitted correctly. Thus, the output alphabet is $Y \\in \\{0, 1, e\\}$.\n\nFollowing a severe solar flare, the probe's transmitter is catastrophically damaged. Ground control observes that every single bit transmitted from the probe is now received on Earth as an erasure symbol 'e'. This situation corresponds to a specific value for the erasure probability $p$.\n\nCalculate the channel capacity of this damaged communication link. The channel capacity should be expressed in bits per channel use.",

The channel capacity is defined as\n$$\nC=\\max_{P(X)} I(X;Y).\n$$\nFor any input distribution $P(X)$, the mutual information is\n$$\nI(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X|Y).\n$$\nWe compute $H(X|Y)$ by conditioning on the values of $Y$:\n- If $Y\\in\\{0,1\\}$ (which occurs with probability $1-p$), then $X$ is known exactly, so $H(X|Y\\in\\{0,1\\})=0$.\n- If $Y=e$ (which occurs with probability $p$), the erasure provides no information, so $H(X|Y=e)=H(X)$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\nH(X|Y)=p\\,H(X)+(1-p)\\cdot 0=p\\,H(X),\n$$\nand hence\n$$\nI(X;Y)=H(X)-p\\,H(X)=(1-p)\\,H(X).\n$$\nMaximizing over $P(X)$, the binary entropy $H(X)$ is maximized at $1$ bit, so the capacity is\n$$\nC=1-p \\text{ bits per channel use}.\n$$\nIn the damaged scenario, every received symbol is an erasure, which implies $p=1$.
