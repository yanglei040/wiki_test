This exercise explores a simple binary memory system modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel ($BSC$) with a uniform input distribution. By calculating and comparing the actual minimum probability of error against the theoretical bound given by the inequality , you will see a case where the bound is perfectly tight, providing an intuitive starting point for more complex scenarios.",

            "problem": "A simple digital memory system stores a single bit, $X$, which is written as a 0 or a 1 with equal probability. Due to thermal noise, the bit can flip over time. This process is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). After a certain period, the bit is read as a value $Y$. The probability of a bit flip (i.e., reading a 0 when a 1 was stored, or reading a 1 when a 0 was stored) is the crossover probability, $\\epsilon = 0.1$.\n\nAn engineer wants to understand the limits of reliability for this memory system. You are asked to perform two calculations:\n\n1.  First, determine the minimum probability of error, $P_e$, that can be achieved. This is accomplished by using an optimal decision rule to determine an estimate, $\\hat{X}$, of the original bit based on the observed bit, $Y$.\n2.  Second, calculate the theoretical lower bound on this probability of error, denoted as $P_{\\text{bound}}$. This fundamental limit is derived from Fano's inequality. For a binary source like this one, the inequality establishes a relationship between the conditional entropy of the input given the output, $H(X|Y)$, and the binary entropy of the error probability, $H_b(P_e)$. The binary entropy function is given by $H_b(p) = -p \\log_2(p) - (1-p) \\log_2(1-p)$.\n\nCalculate the numerical values for both $P_e$ and $P_{\\text{bound}}$. Present your final answer as a pair of numbers $(P_e, P_{\\text{bound}})$ in a single row matrix, with each value rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities: the actual minimum probability of error $P_e$ for an optimal decoder, and the theoretical lower bound $P_{\\text{bound}}$ from Fano's inequality. The system is a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with input $X \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, output $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, uniform input distribution $P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5$, and crossover probability $\\epsilon = 0.1$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the minimum probability of error, $P_e$.**\n\nThe optimal decision rule that minimizes the probability of error $P(\\hat{X} \\neq X)$ is the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder. The MAP rule chooses the input $\\hat{x}$ that maximizes the posterior probability $P(X=x|Y=y)$ for a given observation $y$.\n$$ \\hat{x} = \\arg\\max_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x|Y=y) $$\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the posterior is $P(X=x|Y=y) = \\frac{P(Y=y|X=x) P(X=x)}{P(Y=y)}$.\nSince the input distribution $P(X=x)$ is uniform ($0.5$ for all $x$), and $P(Y=y)$ is a constant for a given $y$, maximizing the posterior probability is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood $P(Y=y|X=x)$. This decision rule is called the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder.\n\nThe channel transition probabilities are:\n$P(Y=0|X=0) = 1-\\epsilon = 0.9$\n$P(Y=1|X=0) = \\epsilon = 0.1$\n$P(Y=0|X=1) = \\epsilon = 0.1$\n$P(Y=1|X=1) = 1-\\epsilon = 0.9$\n\nLet's determine the decision rule:\n- If we observe $Y=0$: We compare $P(Y=0|X=0) = 0.9$ and $P(Y=0|X=1) = 0.1$. Since $0.9 > 0.1$, the optimal decision is $\\hat{X}=0$.\n- If we observe $Y=1$: We compare $P(Y=1|X=0) = 0.1$ and $P(Y=1|X=1) = 0.9$. Since $0.9 > 0.1$, the optimal decision is $\\hat{X}=1$.\n\nThe optimal decision rule is simply $\\hat{X} = Y$. An error occurs if $\\hat{X} \\neq X$, which for this rule means an error occurs if $Y \\neq X$. This happens when the bit flips.\n\nThe probability of error, $P_e$, is the total probability of a bit flip:\n$$ P_e = P(Y \\neq X) = P(Y \\neq X | X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y \\neq X | X=1)P(X=1) $$\n$$ P_e = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=0|X=1)P(X=1) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P_e = (\\epsilon)(0.5) + (\\epsilon)(0.5) = \\epsilon $$\n$$ P_e = 0.1 $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Fano lower bound, $P_{\\text{bound}}$.**\n\nFano's inequality for a binary source provides a lower bound on the probability of error, $P_e$, via the relation:\n$$ H(X|Y) \\le H_b(P_e) $$\nThis can be rearranged to give $H_b(P_e) \\ge H(X|Y)$. We need to calculate the conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$. A convenient formula is $H(X|Y) = H(X) - I(X;Y)$, where $I(X;Y)$ is the mutual information.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the entropy of the source, $H(X)$. Since the input is uniform:\n$$ H(X) = -\\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x) \\log_2(P(X=x)) = - (0.5 \\log_2(0.5) + 0.5 \\log_2(0.5)) = - \\log_2(0.5) = 1 \\text{ bit} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the mutual information $I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$.\nLet's find the conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$:\n$$ H(Y|X) = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x) H(Y|X=x) $$\nFor a BSC, the entropy of the output conditioned on a specific input is the binary entropy of the crossover probability:\n$H(Y|X=0) = H(Y|X=1) = H_b(\\epsilon)$.\nTherefore, $H(Y|X) = (0.5) H_b(\\epsilon) + (0.5) H_b(\\epsilon) = H_b(\\epsilon)$.\n\nNow we find the output probabilty distribution $P(Y)$ to calculate $H(Y)$.\n$P(Y=0) = P(Y=0|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=0|X=1)P(X=1) = (1-\\epsilon)(0.5) + (\\epsilon)(0.5) = 0.5$.\n$P(Y=1) = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1) = (\\epsilon)(0.5) + (1-\\epsilon)(0.5) = 0.5$.\nThe output distribution is also uniform, so its entropy is $H(Y)=1$ bit.\n\nThe mutual information is $I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = 1 - H_b(\\epsilon)$.\nNow we find the conditional entropy required for Fano's inequality:\n$$ H(X|Y) = H(X) - I(X;Y) = 1 - (1 - H_b(\\epsilon)) = H_b(\\epsilon) $$\n\nSubstituting this into the Fano inequality relation $H_b(P_e) \\ge H(X|Y)$:\n$$ H_b(P_e) \\ge H_b(\\epsilon) $$\nThe binary entropy function $H_b(p)$ is symmetric around $p=0.5$ and is strictly increasing for $p \\in [0, 0.5]$. Since the error probability $\\epsilon=0.1$ is in this range, and we expect any reasonable decoder's error probability $P_e$ to also be in this range, we can conclude from the inequality that:\n$$ P_e \\ge \\epsilon $$\nThis means the minimum possible value for $P_e$ is $\\epsilon$. Thus, the lower bound $P_{\\text{bound}}$ is $\\epsilon$.\n$$ P_{\\text{bound}} = \\epsilon = 0.1 $$\n\n**Conclusion and Formatting**\n\nWe have calculated both the actual minimum error probability for this channel and the Fano lower bound.\n$P_e = 0.1$\n$P_{\\text{bound}} = 0.1$\n\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.100$ for both values. The final answer is the pair $(0.100, 0.100)$.",

            "introduction": "Real-world systems often involve more than just two states, and channels can sometimes lose information by design.

To protect against errors, a $(3,1)$ repetition code is used, where the message $X=0$ is encoded into the codeword $C=000$ and $X=1$ is encoded into $C=111$.\n\nThe encoded codeword is transmitted over a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a crossover probability $p=0.1$.
