            "problem": "An engineer is characterizing a newly developed digital communication channel. The channel is known to be a memoryless binary channel, meaning its input alphabet is $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}$ and its output alphabet is $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The behavior of the channel is described by a transition probability matrix $C$, where the element in row $i$ and column $j$ (0-indexed) is $C_{ij} = P(Y=i|X=j)$. Thus, the first column corresponds to input $X=0$ and the second to input $X=1$, while the first row corresponds to output $Y=0$ and the second to output $Y=1$.\n\nThe engineer performs two experiments to determine this matrix.\n\nIn the first experiment, a uniformly random input signal is used.

Let the output probability distribution be the row vector $\\mathbf{r} = [r_1, r_2, r_3]$, where $r_j = P(Y=y_j)$. The channel is described by the transition matrix $Q$, where $Q_{ij} = P(y_j|x_i)$.\n\nThe given values for the channel matrix $Q$ are:\n$$\nQ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7  0.2  0.1 \\\\\n0.1  0.6  0.3 \\\\\n0.22  0.52  0.26\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe target output distribution is $\\mathbf{r} = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2]$.\n\nThe relationship between the input distribution, output distribution, and the channel matrix is given by the law of total probability: $P(y_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(y_j|x_i) P(x_i)$. In matrix form, this is $\\mathbf{p} Q = \\mathbf{r}$.\n\nWriting this out component-wise gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  $p_1 P(y_1|x_1) + p_2 P(y_1|x_2) + p_3 P(y_1|x_3) = r_1 \\implies 0.7 p_1 + 0.1 p_2 + 0.22 p_3 = 0.4$\n2.  $p_1 P(y_2|x_1) + p_2 P(y_2|x_2) + p_3 P(y_2|x_3) = r_2 \\implies 0.2 p_1 + 0.6 p_2 + 0.52 p_3 = 0.4$\n3.  $p_1 P(y_3|x_1) + p_2 P(y_3|x_2) + p_3 P(y_3|x_3) = r_3 \\implies 0.1 p_1 + 0.3 p_2 + 0.26 p_3 = 0.2$\n\nAdditionally, since $\\mathbf{p}$ is a probability distribution, its components must sum to 1:\n4.  $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nAnd each component must be non-negative:\n5.  $p_1 \\ge 0$, $p_2 \\ge 0$, $p_3 \\ge 0$\n\nWe have a system of equations for $p_1, p_2, p_3$. Notice that the rows of the channel matrix $Q$ are linearly dependent. Specifically, row 3 is a linear combination of rows 1 and 2: $0.2 \\times \\text{row}_1 + 0.8 \\times \\text{row}_2 = [0.14, 0.04, 0.02] + [0.08, 0.48, 0.24] = [0.22, 0.52, 0.26] = \\text{row}_3$. This implies that the system of equations (1), (2), (3) is redundant. We only need to use two of the first three equations along with equation (4).\n\nLet's use equations (1), (2), and (4). From (4), we can express $p_3$ as $p_3 = 1 - p_1 - p_2$. Substitute this into equation (1):\n$0.7 p_1 + 0.1 p_2 + 0.22 (1 - p_1 - p_2) = 0.4$\n$0.7 p_1 + 0.1 p_2 + 0.22 - 0.22 p_1 - 0.22 p_2 = 0.4$\n$0.48 p_1 - 0.12 p_2 = 0.18$\nDividing by $0.12$, we get:\n$4 p_1 - p_2 = 1.5 \\implies p_2 = 4 p_1 - 1.5$\n\nNow, substitute $p_3 = 1 - p_1 - p_2$ into equation (2):\n$0.2 p_1 + 0.6 p_2 + 0.52 (1 - p_1 - p_2) = 0.4$\n$0.2 p_1 + 0.6 p_2 + 0.52 - 0.52 p_1 - 0.52 p_2 = 0.4$\n$-0.32 p_1 + 0.08 p_2 = -0.12$\nDividing by $0.08$, we get:\n$-4 p_1 + p_2 = -1.5 \\implies p_2 = 4 p_1 - 1.5$\n\nBoth equations yield the same relationship between $p_1$ and $p_2$, confirming the redundancy. We now have a family of solutions where the probabilities are parameterized by $p_1$:\n$p_2 = 4 p_1 - 1.5$\nTo find $p_3$, we substitute this back into the expression for $p_3$:\n$p_3 = 1 - p_1 - p_2 = 1 - p_1 - (4 p_1 - 1.5) = 1 - 5p_1 + 1.5 = 2.5 - 5p_1$\n\nNow we must apply the non-negativity constraints from (5):\na) $p_1 \\ge 0$\nb) $p_2 = 4 p_1 - 1.5 \\ge 0 \\implies 4 p_1 \\ge 1.5 \\implies p_1 \\ge \\frac{1.5}{4} = 0.375$\nc) $p_3 = 2.5 - 5 p_1 \\ge 0 \\implies 2.5 \\ge 5 p_1 \\implies p_1 \\le \\frac{2.5}{5} = 0.5$\n\nCombining these constraints, the set of all possible values for $p_1$ is the interval $[0.375, 0.5]$.\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible value of $p_1 = P(X=x_1)$. Looking at the valid range for $p_1$, the maximum value is $0.5$.\n\nAs a check, if $p_1 = 0.5$:\n$p_2 = 4(0.5) - 1.5 = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5$\n$p_3 = 2.5 - 5(0.5) = 2.5 - 2.5 = 0$\nThe input distribution would be $\\mathbf{p} = [0.5, 0.5, 0]$. This is a valid probability distribution as all components are non-negative and they sum to 1.\nThe resulting output is $\\mathbf{p}Q = [0.5, 0.5, 0] \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7  0.2  0.1 \\\\ 0.1  0.6  0.3 \\\\ 0.22  0.52  0.26 \\end{pmatrix} = [0.5(0.7)+0.5(0.1), 0.5(0.2)+0.5(0.6), 0.5(0.1)+0.5(0.3)] = [0.35+0.05, 0.1+0.3, 0.05+0.15] = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2]$, which matches the target output distribution $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nThe maximum value for $P(X=x_1)$ is $0.5$.",
