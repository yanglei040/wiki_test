This practice introduces the concept of a \"confusability graph,\" an elegant tool where vertices represent communication symbols and edges connect any pair that might be mistaken for one another. This exercise  provides a direct, hands-on link between a practical communication problem and a fundamental graph-theoretic concept, transforming the task of finding an error-free code into the classic problem of finding a graph's maximum independent set, $\\alpha(G)$.",

Due to noise in the channel, some pairs of symbols may be confused for one another at the receiver. This relationship is captured by a \"confusability graph,\" where the vertices represent the input symbols and an edge connects two vertices if and only if the corresponding symbols can be mistaken for each other.\n\nA zero-error code for a single use of the channel is a subset of input symbols chosen such that no two symbols in the subset can be confused with each other. The structure of the confusability graph for this specific channel is defined by the following adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between symbol $s_i$ and symbol $s_j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise.\n\n$$\nA = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhat is the size of the largest possible zero-error code for a single transmission?",

The graph model is powerful because it allows us to precisely quantify the impact of such alterations on our ability to communicate without error.

            "problem": "Consider a discrete memoryless communication channel with an input alphabet of five symbols, $\\mathcal{X} = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$. The channel noise causes the output to be a set of possible received signals for each input. Two input symbols are said to be \"confusable\" if their sets of possible output signals are not disjoint. To ensure communication with zero error, a \"codebook\" is constructed using a subset of input symbols where no two symbols in the subset are confusable.\n\nInitially, the channel's behavior is described by the following input-output relationships:\n- Input A can result in received signals from the set $\\{y_1, y_2\\}$.\n- Input B can result in received signals from the set $\\{y_2, y_3\\}$.\n- Input C can result in received signals from the set $\\{y_3, y_4\\}$.\n- Input D can result in received signals from the set $\\{y_4, y_5\\}$.\n- Input E can result in received signals from the set $\\{y_5, y_6\\}$.\n\nLater, a persistent environmental disturbance alters the channel. The new behavior is identical to the initial one, with a single modification:\n- Input E can now result in received signals from the set $\\{y_1, y_5, y_6\\}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the maximum possible size of a zero-error codebook for the altered channel to the maximum possible size of a zero-error codebook for the initial channel.",

A zero-error codebook is a subset of $\\mathcal{X}$ with no pair of confusable inputs; therefore, its maximum possible size equals the independence number $\\alpha(G)$ of the confusability graph $G$ whose vertices are $\\mathcal{X}$ and edges connect confusable inputs.\n\nInitial channel:\n- $Y(A)=\\{y_{1},y_{2}\\}$, $Y(B)=\\{y_{2},y_{3}\\}$, $Y(C)=\\{y_{3},y_{4}\\}$, $Y(D)=\\{y_{4},y_{5}\\}$, $Y(E)=\\{y_{5},y_{6}\\}$.\n- Intersections:\n  - $Y(A)\\cap Y(B)=\\{y_{2}\\}\\neq\\emptyset$ (edge $A\\!-\\!B$).\n  - $Y(B)\\cap Y(C)=\\{y_{3}\\}\\neq\\emptyset$ (edge $B\\!-\\!C$).\n  - $Y(C)\\cap Y(D)=\\{y_{4}\\}\\neq\\emptyset$ (edge $C\\!-\\!D$).\n  - $Y(D)\\cap Y(E)=\\{y_{5}\\}\\neq\\emptyset$ (edge $D\\!-\\!E$).\n  - All other pairs have empty intersections (no other edges).\nThus $G$ is the path $A\\!-\\!B\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!D\\!-\\!E$ (a path on $5$ vertices).

            "introduction": "The true potential for error-free communication is often unlocked not by single symbols, but by sending sequences of symbols called \"codewords.\" This practice explores the core idea behind zero-error capacity by moving from a single channel use to multiple uses. This more complex scenario is modeled by the \"strong graph product,\" and it can lead to surprising results where clever coding achieves a higher rate than what a single channel use would suggest. By constructing a multi-symbol code for the classic pentagon graph ($C_5$) , you will replicate the logic behind a famous result showing that coding over multiple uses can fundamentally overcome the limitations of a channel.",

Due to the nature of the transmission channel, there is a specific pattern of signal confusion. A signal $i$ can be confused by the receiver only with the signals $(i-1) \\pmod 5$ and $(i+1) \\pmod 5$. For example, signal 1 can be confused with signal 0 and signal 2, but not with signal 3 or 4.\n\nTo ensure error-free communication, information is encoded into codewords of length two. A codeword is an ordered pair of signals $(i, j)$, where $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.

The first signal $i_1$ is either identical to or confusable with the first signal $i_2$.\n2. The second signal $j_1$ is either identical to or confusable with the second signal $j_2$.\n\nIt is known that a zero-error code containing exactly five distinct codewords exists for this system. Your task is to construct one such code. From the set of five codewords you have constructed, identify the codeword that begins with the signal 2, which will have the form $(2, j)$. Determine the value of the second signal, $j$.",
