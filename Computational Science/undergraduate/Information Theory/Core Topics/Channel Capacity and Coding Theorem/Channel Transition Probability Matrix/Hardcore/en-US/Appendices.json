Due to thermal fluctuations, the process of writing data is not perfect. The system is programmed to prepare these states according to the non-uniform probability distribution $P(X)$, where $P(X=x_0) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $P(X=x_1) = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $P(X=x_2) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nWhen a state is read, noise in the measurement apparatus can cause it to be misidentified. The measurement outcomes form the output alphabet $Y = \\{y_0, y_1, y_2\\}$. The behavior of this noisy channel is characterized by a transition probability matrix $M$, where the element $M_{ij} = P(Y=y_j | X=x_i)$ is the probability of measuring outcome $y_j$ given that the system was prepared in state $x_i$. The matrix is given by:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.7 & 0.2 \\\\\n0.15 & 0.15 & 0.7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn this matrix, the first, second, and third rows correspond to the prepared states $x_0$, $x_1$, and $x_2$ respectively.

            "problem": "An engineer is characterizing a newly developed digital communication channel. The channel is known to be a memoryless binary channel, meaning its input alphabet is $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}$ and its output alphabet is $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The behavior of the channel is described by a transition probability matrix $P$, where the element in row $i$ and column $j$ (0-indexed) is $P_{ij} = P(Y=j|X=i)$. Thus, the first row corresponds to input $X=0$ and the second to input $X=1$, while the first column corresponds to output $Y=0$ and the second to output $Y=1$.\n\nThe engineer performs two experiments to determine this matrix.\n\nIn the first experiment, a uniformly random input signal is used. The input probability distribution is given by the vector $[P(X=0), P(X=1)] = [0.5, 0.5]$. The resulting output probability distribution is measured to be $[P(Y=0), P(Y=1)] = [0.5, 0.5]$.\n\nIn the second experiment, a deterministic input signal is used, where the input is always '0'. This corresponds to an input probability distribution of $[P(X=0), P(X=1)] = [1, 0]$. The measured output distribution for this case is $[P(Y=0), P(Y=1)] = [0.8, 0.2]$.\n\nBased on the results of these two experiments, determine the $2 \\times 2$ channel transition probability matrix $P$.",

We can calculate:\n$$\n[0.8, 0.2] = [1, 0] \\begin{pmatrix}P_{00} & P_{01} \\\\ P_{10} & P_{11}\\end{pmatrix} = [P_{00}, P_{01}]\n$$\nThis directly gives us the first row of the transition matrix: $P_{00} = 0.8$ and $P_{01} = 0.2$. We can verify that this row sums to 1 ($0.8 + 0.2 = 1$).\n\nNow, we use the results from the first experiment. The input is $P_X = [0.5, 0.5]$ and the output is $P_Y = [0.5, 0.5]$. The calculation is:\n$$\n[0.5, 0.5] = [0.5, 0.5] \\begin{pmatrix}0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ P_{10} & P_{11}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can solve for the unknown second row by focusing on the first component of the output vector:\n$$\nP(Y=0) = P(X=0)P(Y=0|X=0) + P(X=1)P(Y=0|X=1)\n$$\n$$\n0.5 = (0.5)(P_{00}) + (0.5)(P_{10})\n$$\nSubstituting the known value $P_{00} = 0.8$:\n$$\n0.5 = (0.5)(0.8) + (0.5)(P_{10}) \\implies 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.5 P_{10}\n$$\n$$\n0.1 = 0.5 P_{10} \\implies P_{10} = 0.2\n$$\nUsing the row-sum normalization for the second row, we find $P_{11}$:\n$$\nP_{11} = 1 - P_{10} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n$$\nTherefore, the complete channel transition matrix is:\n$$\nP=\\begin{pmatrix}0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.8\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can check this result with the second component of the output from the first experiment: $P(Y=1) = (0.5)(0.2) + (0.5)(0.8) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5$, which is consistent with the measurement.",
