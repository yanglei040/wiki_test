This exercise  provides a perfect entry point by using the simple $(3,1)$ repetition code, where a single bit is repeated three times for protection.

            "problem": "In a simplified deep-space communication system, a sensor transmits a single binary status bit (0 for 'nominal', 1 for 'alert'). To protect against transmission errors in the noisy channel between the probe and Earth, a basic $(3,1)$ linear block code is employed. This code encodes the single message bit by repeating it three times. For example, the message bit '0' is encoded into the codeword $[0,0,0]$ and '1' is encoded into $[1,1,1]$. All arithmetic is performed in the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nFor any valid codeword $c = [c_1, c_2, c_3]$, two parity-check conditions must be satisfied: $c_1 + c_2 = 0$ and $c_2 + c_3 = 0$. These two conditions define the rows of the $2 \\times 3$ parity-check matrix $H$.\n\nA ground station receives the vector $y = [0, 1, 0]$. To check for errors, the station computes the error syndrome vector using the formula $s = H y^T$.\n\nBased on the information provided, determine the syndrome vector's transpose, $s^T$.

Consider a simplified model for a deep space probe's communication link. The probe uses a linear block code defined by the following parity-check matrix $H$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA message is encoded into a 7-bit codeword. By design, the all-zero vector $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ is a valid codeword. Suppose this codeword $c$ is transmitted from the probe. During its journey to Earth, a single cosmic ray strike corrupts the transmission, flipping exactly one bit. The vector received on Earth, denoted by $y$, is found to have an error in the 3rd position.\n\nYour task is to calculate the corresponding syndrome vector, $s$, for this received vector $y$. All arithmetic should be performed modulo 2. Express your answer as a 3-element row vector.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the syndrome vector $s$ of a received vector $y$. The syndrome is defined by the equation $s = H y^T$, where $H$ is the parity-check matrix and all calculations are performed modulo 2 (i.e., in the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the received vector $y$. The transmitted codeword was the all-zero vector, $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$. A single-bit error occurred at the 3rd position. This can be represented by an error vector $e$ which has a '1' at the position of the error and '0's elsewhere. For an error in the 3rd position, the error vector is $e = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n\nThe received vector $y$ is the sum (modulo 2) of the transmitted codeword $c$ and the error vector $e$:\n$$ y = c + e = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] $$\nTo calculate the syndrome, we first need the transpose of $y$, which is a column vector:\n$$ y^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the product $s = H y^T$:\n$$ s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe perform the matrix-vector multiplication, remembering that all additions and multiplications are modulo 2.\nThe first component of the syndrome, $s_1$, is the dot product of the first row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_1 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nThe second component, $s_2$, is the dot product of the second row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_2 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nThe third component, $s_3$, is the dot product of the third row of $H$ with $y^T$:\n$$ s_3 = (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nSo, the syndrome column vector is $s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The problem asks for the answer as a row vector, which is $[1, 0, 1]$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a fundamental property of linear codes. The syndrome is $s = H y^T = H(c+e)^T$. By linearity, this is $s = Hc^T + He^T$. For any valid codeword $c$, by definition, $Hc^T = 0$. Therefore, the syndrome depends only on the error vector: $s = He^T$. When the error vector $e$ has a single '1' in the $i$-th position, the product $He^T$ is simply the $i$-th column of the matrix $H$. In this problem, the error is in the 3rd position, so the syndrome is the 3rd column of $H$.\nLooking at the given matrix $H$:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\mathbf{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & \\mathbf{0} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & \\mathbf{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe 3rd column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives the syndrome vector directly, confirming our previous calculation. The corresponding row vector is $(1, 0, 1)$.",
