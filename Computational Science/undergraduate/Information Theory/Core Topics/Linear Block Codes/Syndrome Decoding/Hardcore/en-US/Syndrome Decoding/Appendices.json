This exercise demonstrates how simple parity-check rules, which define a linear block code, can be encapsulated in a single matrix called the parity-check matrix, $H$.

            "problem": "In a simplified deep-space communication system, a sensor transmits a single binary status bit (0 for 'nominal', 1 for 'alert'). To protect against transmission errors in the noisy channel between the probe and Earth, a basic $(3,1)$ linear block code is employed. This code encodes the single message bit by repeating it three times. For example, the message bit '0' is encoded into the codeword $[0,0,0]$ and '1' is encoded into $[1,1,1]$. All arithmetic is performed in the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nFor any valid codeword $c = [c_1, c_2, c_3]$, two parity-check conditions must be satisfied: $c_1 + c_2 = 0$ and $c_2 + c_3 = 0$. These two conditions define the rows of the $2 \\times 3$ parity-check matrix $H$.\n\nA ground station receives the vector $r = [0, 1, 0]$. To check for errors, the station computes the error syndrome vector using the formula $s = rH^T$.\n\nBased on the information provided, determine the syndrome vector $s$.

            "introduction": "Once we can calculate a syndrome, the next question is what it means. For many common codes, the syndrome provides more than just an error alert; it directly reveals the error's location. This practice illustrates the core power of syndrome decoding by showing how a non-zero syndrome can be mapped directly to a specific column of the parity-check matrix, pinpointing the exact bit that was flipped during transmission .",

Consider a simplified model for a deep space probe's communication link. The probe uses a linear block code defined by the following parity-check matrix $H$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  0  1  0  0 \\\\ 1  1  0  1  0  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1  1  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA message is encoded into a 7-bit codeword. By design, the all-zero vector $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ is a valid codeword. Suppose this codeword $c$ is transmitted from the probe. During its journey to Earth, a single cosmic ray strike corrupts the transmission, flipping exactly one bit. The vector received on Earth, denoted by $r$, is found to have an error in the 3rd position.\n\nYour task is to calculate the corresponding syndrome vector, $s$, for this received vector $r$. All arithmetic should be performed modulo 2. Express your answer as a 3-element row vector.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the syndrome vector $s$ of a received vector $r$. The syndrome is defined by the equation $s = r H^T$, where $H$ is the parity-check matrix and all calculations are performed in the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the received vector $r$. The transmitted codeword was the all-zero vector, $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$. A single-bit error occurred at the 3rd position. This can be represented by an error vector $e$ which has a '1' at the position of the error and '0's elsewhere. For an error in the 3rd position, the error vector is $e = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n\nThe received vector $r$ is the sum (modulo 2) of the transmitted codeword $c$ and the error vector $e$:\n$$ r = c + e = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] $$\nThe syndrome depends only on the error vector: $s = rH^T = (c+e)H^T = cH^T + eH^T = \\mathbf{0} + eH^T = eH^T$.\nFor a single-bit error vector $e_i$ with a 1 in the $i$-th position, the product $e_i H^T$ simply selects the $i$-th row of the matrix $H^T$. The rows of $H^T$ are the transposes of the columns of $H$.\n\nIn this problem, the error is in the 3rd position ($i=3$), so the syndrome is the 3rd row of $H^T$. The matrix $H$ is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  \\mathbf{1}  0  1  0  0 \\\\ 1  1  \\mathbf{0}  1  0  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  \\mathbf{1}  1  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe 3rd column of $H$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe syndrome $s$ is the transpose of this column vector.\n$$ s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives the syndrome row vector directly.\n\nTo confirm with direct calculation:\n$$ H^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ s = r H^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} H^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe result is the same.

Starting with a received vector, you will calculate its syndrome, use it to infer the most probable error pattern under the principle of minimum distance decoding, and then reconstruct the original message.

            "problem": "A communications system employs a systematic $[7, 4]$ linear block code for error correction. This code transforms a 4-bit message vector, $m$, into a 7-bit codeword, $c$, using a generator matrix $G$ over the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The encoding operation is defined as $c = mG$, where all additions and multiplications are performed modulo 2.

The standard decoding procedure for this system is Bounded Distance Decoding, which operates on the assumption that the error pattern with the minimum possible number of flipped bits (i.e., the error vector with the minimum Hamming weight) is the one that occurred.\n\nBased on this decoding strategy, determine the original 4-bit message vector $m$. Present your answer as a 4-element row vector.",

The syndrome row vector is the transpose of the column of $H$ at the error position. We look for a column in $H$ that transposes to $(1,1,1)$. Observing the columns of $H$, the fourth column is $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. Its transpose is $(1,1,1)$, which matches our syndrome $s$. Hence, the most likely error is a single-bit flip in position $4$. The estimated error vector is $e=(0,0,0,1,0,0,0)$, so the corrected codeword is\n$$\nc=r+e=(1,0,0,1,1,1,0)+(0,0,0,1,0,0,0)=(1,0,0,0,1,1,0).\n$$\nSince the code is systematic, the original message vector is the first four components of $c$, namely\n$$\nm=(1,0,0,0).\n$$",
