This exercise guides you through the fundamental process of creating a systematic $(7,4)$ Hamming codeword from a 4-bit message. By calculating the parity bits $p_i$ and placing them in their designated positions, you will gain first-hand experience in constructing the redundant information that gives Hamming codes their error-correcting power.

            "problem": "In a prototype digital communication system, a custom implementation of the systematic $(7,4)$ Hamming code is used for forward error correction. An information message, consisting of 4 data bits $u = (d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)$, is encoded into a 7-bit codeword $c = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7)$.\n\nThe positions of the bits in the codeword are indexed from 1 to 7. The system design specifies that the data bits $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$ from the information message are placed at positions 3, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The remaining positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by parity-check bits $p_1, p_2, p_3$. The codeword structure is therefore $c = (p_1, p_2, d_1, p_3, d_2, d_3, d_4)$.\n\nThe values of the three parity bits are determined by the following set of parity-check equations, where all additions are performed modulo 2 (i.e., the exclusive-OR operation):\n1.  $p_1 \\oplus d_1 \\oplus d_2 \\oplus d_4 = 0$\n2.  $p_2 \\oplus d_1 \\oplus d_3 \\oplus d_4 = 0$\n3.  $p_3 \\oplus d_2 \\oplus d_3 \\oplus d_4 = 0$\n\nYour task is to determine the complete 7-bit systematic codeword $c$ for the information message $u = (1, 1, 0, 1)$.
