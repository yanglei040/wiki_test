We will start by determining the minimum number of bits required to uniquely represent a given set of commands, which constitutes our essential information. By then calculating the fraction of redundant bits added for error protection, this practice reinforces the core definitions of information bits versus parity bits and the trade-off between data and reliability .",

            "problem": "A deep-space probe's command and control system is designed to be robust against transmission errors. The system can process a set of 75 distinct operational commands. To send a command, it is first converted into a binary message block, using the minimum number of bits required to uniquely identify each command. This message block is then processed by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoder. The encoder takes the message block and appends a fixed number of 10 parity-check bits to form a single, longer codeword that is transmitted through the communication channel. Calculate the fraction of bits in each transmitted codeword that are redundant. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "To uniquely identify one of 75 distinct commands using binary, the message block must have enough bits $m$ to satisfy $2^{m} \\geq 75$. This minimum $m$ is given by:\n$$\nm = \\lceil \\log_{2}(75) \\rceil\n$$\nSince $2^{6} = 64  75$ and $2^{7} = 128 \\geq 75$, it follows that:\n$$\nm = 7\n$$\nThe encoder appends $p = 10$ parity-check bits, so the total codeword length is:\n$$\nn = m + p = 7 + 10 = 17\n$$\nThe fraction of bits in each transmitted codeword that are redundant is the ratio of parity bits to total bits:\n$$\nr = \\frac{p}{n} = \\frac{10}{17}\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\nr \\approx 0.588\n$$",

            "introduction": "Communication systems often stack multiple encoding schemes to achieve desired levels of reliability, a technique known as code concatenation. This practice explores such a scenario, where a message undergoes a two-stage encoding process involving a parity check followed by repetition . By tracking the data from its original form to the final transmitted signal, you will calculate the overall code rate and understand how layered codes affect transmission efficiency.",

            "problem": "A two-stage encoding process is designed for a deep-space probe to ensure data integrity upon transmission back to Earth. In the first stage, an internal error-detection module takes an original 4-bit block of scientific data and appends a single, carefully calculated parity bit to it, forming an intermediate 5-bit block. In the second stage, to protect against burst errors from solar flares, a signal repetition module takes this entire 5-bit block and transmits it three times in immediate succession.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of such a scheme is quantified by its code rate, which is the ratio of the number of original data bits to the total number of bits ultimately transmitted.\n\nCalculate the code rate for this complete two-stage encoding system. Express your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The code rate is defined as the ratio of original information bits to the total number of transmitted bits per encoded block. Let $R$ denote the code rate, $k$ the number of original data bits, and $n$ the total number of transmitted bits:\n$$\nR=\\frac{k}{n}.\n$$\nGiven $k=4$ original data bits, the first stage appends one parity bit, producing an intermediate block length\n$$\nn_{\\text{int}}=k+1=4+1=5.\n$$\nThe second stage repeats this entire $5$-bit block three times, so the total transmitted bits are\n$$\nn=3\\cdot n_{\\text{int}}=3\\cdot 5=15.\n$$\nTherefore, the code rate is\n$$\nR=\\frac{4}{15}.\n$$\nAs a decimal, \n$$\n\\frac{4}{15}\\approx 0.266666\\ldots,\n$$\nwhich rounded to three significant figures is\n$$\n0.267.\n$$",

This problem challenges you to derive a general formula for the code rate based on the dimensions of a data block .

            "problem": "A data integrity protocol is being designed for a specialized processor handling large datasets. The protocol applies a two-dimensional parity check code to the data. First, the data is organized into a rectangular block of $M \\times N$ message bits. Then, a single parity bit is computed and appended to each of the $M$ rows, and a single parity bit is computed and appended to each of the $N$ columns. Finally, a single overall parity bit is calculated based on the set of column parity bits; this final bit is also appended to form the complete encoded block.\n\nThe processor has two operational modes. In 'standard' mode, it processes data in square blocks of size $L \\times L$ message bits. In 'accelerated' mode, it processes data in rectangular blocks of size $(2L) \\times (4L)$ message bits, where $L$ is a positive integer.\n\nIt is determined that the code rate of the 'accelerated' mode is exactly $\\frac{96}{77}$ times the code rate of the 'standard' mode.
