            "problem": "In the development of communication protocols for a deep-space exploration mission, a team is evaluating different designs for binary error-correcting codes. A binary code is defined by a set of parameters $(n, M, d)$, where $n$ is the length of the binary codewords, $M$ is the total number of distinct codewords, and $d$ is the minimum Hamming distance between any two distinct codewords.\n\nA fundamental limit on the efficiency of such codes is given by the Plotkin bound. One form of this bound states that for any binary code with parameters $(n, M, d)$ that satisfies the condition $2d > n$, the number of codewords $M$ must be less than or equal to a specific maximum value. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$ M \\le 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{d}{2d-n} \\right\\rfloor $$\nwhere $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n\nA junior engineer on the team proposes a novel code with the following parameters: length $n=9$, minimum distance $d=6$, and a total of $M=7$ codewords.\n\nBased on the provided form of the Plotkin bound, which of the following statements correctly evaluates the engineer's claim?\n\nA. The claim is valid, because the number of codewords $M=7$ is below the upper limit calculated from the Plotkin bound.\n\nB. The claim is invalid for a reason not related to the Plotkin bound itself: any code with an even minimum distance $d$ must have a number of codewords $M$ that is also an even number.\n\nC. The claim is invalid, because the condition $2d > n$ is not met, which means the proposed code is in a parameter regime where this form of the bound is inapplicable.\n\nD. The claim is invalid, because the proposed number of codewords $M=7$ exceeds the maximum number allowed by the Plotkin bound.\n\nE. The claim is valid, as the Plotkin bound only applies to linear codes, and the engineer's code could be non-linear.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the feasibility of a binary code with parameters $n=9$, $d=6$, and $M=7$ using the given Plotkin bound.\n\nThe Plotkin bound states that if $2d > n$, then the number of codewords $M$ must satisfy the inequality:\n$$ M \\le 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{d}{2d-n} \\right\\rfloor $$\n\nFirst, we must check if the condition $2d > n$ holds for the proposed code parameters. We are given $n=9$ and $d=6$.\n$$ 2d = 2 \\times 6 = 12 $$\nWe compare this with $n=9$. Since $12 > 9$, the condition $2d > n$ is satisfied. This means we can proceed to apply the bound to find the maximum possible number of codewords. This also immediately shows that option C is incorrect.\n\nNext, we substitute the values of $n$ and $d$ into the inequality for the bound on $M$:\n$$ M \\le 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{2(6)-9} \\right\\rfloor $$\n\nWe calculate the denominator of the fraction first:\n$$ 2(6) - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3 $$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the inequality:\n$$ M \\le 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{3} \\right\\rfloor $$\n\nThe fraction simplifies to an integer:\n$$ M \\le 2 \\lfloor 2 \\rfloor $$\n\nThe floor of an integer is the integer itself, so $\\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n$$ M \\le 2 \\times 2 $$\n$$ M \\le 4 $$\n\nThe Plotkin bound therefore proves that for any binary code with length $n=9$ and minimum distance $d=6$, the number of codewords $M$ cannot be greater than 4.\n\nThe engineer's claim is for a code with $M=7$ codewords. We compare this claim with the derived bound:\n$$ 7 > 4 $$\nThe proposed number of codewords, $M=7$, exceeds the maximum value of 4 allowed by the Plotkin bound. Therefore, such a code cannot exist, and the engineer's claim is invalid.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. The claim is valid, because the number of codewords $M=7$ is below the upper limit calculated from the Plotkin bound. This is false. Our calculation shows the upper limit is 4, and $7$ is not below 4.\nB. The claim is invalid for a reason not related to the Plotkin bound itself: any code with an even minimum distance $d$ must have a number of codewords $M$ that is also an even number. This is a distractor and not a general theorem in coding theory.\nC. The claim is invalid, because the condition $2d > n$ is not met. This is false. We verified that $12 > 9$, so the condition is met.\nD. The claim is invalid, because the proposed number of codewords $M=7$ exceeds the maximum number allowed by the Plotkin bound. This is true, as our calculation showed that $M$ must be less than or equal to 4.\nE. The claim is valid, as the Plotkin bound only applies to linear codes. This is false. The Plotkin bound applies to all binary codes, both linear and non-linear.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is D.",

            "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a high-reliability deep-space communication system. The system encodes data into codewords using a 5-ary alphabet, meaning each symbol in a codeword can be one of five distinct voltage levels, which we can represent abstractly as the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Each codeword has a fixed length of $n=9$ symbols. To ensure robustness against noise and data corruption during transmission over vast distances, the encoding scheme is chosen such that the minimum Hamming distance between any two distinct codewords in the codebook is $d=8$.\n\nGiven these design parameters, what is the maximum possible number of distinct codewords, $M$, that this code can contain?",
            "solution": "We consider a $q$-ary code of length $n$ and size $M$ with minimum Hamming distance $d$. Here $q=5$, $n=9$, and $d=8$.\n\nFirst, we derive the Plotkin bound. Let the $M$ codewords be $x^{(1)},\\dots,x^{(M)} \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,q-1\\}^{n}$. Define\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\sum_{1 \\le u < v \\le M} d\\big(x^{(u)},x^{(v)}\\big).\n$$\nSince every pairwise distance is at least $d$, we have\n$$\n\\Sigma \\ge \\binom{M}{2} d.\n$$\nOn the other hand, sum distances columnwise. In column $j$, let $n_{ja}$ be the number of codewords having symbol $a$ in that column, so $\\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} n_{ja} = M$. The number of pairs that agree in column $j$ is $\\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} \\binom{n_{ja}}{2}$, hence the number of differing pairs in that column is $\\binom{M}{2} - \\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} \\binom{n_{ja}}{2}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left[ \\binom{M}{2} - \\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} \\binom{n_{ja}}{2} \\right].\n$$\nUse the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to bound $\\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} n_{ja}^{2} \\ge \\frac{M^{2}}{q}$, hence\n$$\n\\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} \\binom{n_{ja}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} n_{ja}^{2} - M \\right) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{M^{2}}{q} - M \\right).\n$$\nThus, for each $j$,\n$$\n\\binom{M}{2} - \\sum_{a=0}^{q-1} \\binom{n_{ja}}{2} \\le \\binom{M}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{M^{2}}{q} - M \\right) = \\frac{M^{2}}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nSumming over $j=1,\\dots,n$ gives\n$$\n\\Sigma \\le n \\cdot \\frac{M^{2}}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nCombining the lower and upper bounds on $\\Sigma$ yields\n$$\n\\binom{M}{2} d \\le n \\cdot \\frac{M^{2}}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nAfter canceling the common factor $\\frac{M(M-1)}{2}$ from the left against $\\frac{M^{2}}{2}$ on the right, we obtain\n$$\nd \\le \\frac{n M}{M-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{q}\\right).\n$$\nRearranging gives the Plotkin bound\n$$\nM \\le \\frac{q d}{q d - (q-1) n}.\n$$\nThis applies when $d > \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{q}\\right) n$, which we verify here:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{n} = \\frac{8}{9} > \\frac{4}{5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5}.\n$$\nSubstituting $q=5$, $n=9$, and $d=8$ gives\n$$\nM \\le \\frac{5 \\cdot 8}{5 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{40}{40 - 36} = \\frac{40}{4} = 10.\n$$\n\nNext, we show that $M=10$ is achievable. We require a set of $M$ codewords of length $n=9$ over $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ such that any two distinct codewords agree in exactly one coordinate (equivalently, have Hamming distance $8$). Consider the complete graph on $10$ vertices, $K_{10}$. It has a $1$-factorization, that is, its $45$ edges can be partitioned into $9$ disjoint perfect matchings. Label the vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{10}$ and the $9$ perfect matchings as $P_{1},\\dots,P_{9}$. For each matching $P_{j}$, assign a bijection from its $5$ edges to the $5$ alphabet symbols $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. Define the codeword $c^{(i)} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}^{9}$ for vertex $v_{i}$ by letting its $j$-th coordinate $c^{(i)}_{j}$ be the symbol assigned to the unique edge of $P_{j}$ that contains $v_{i}$. For any distinct $i,k$, the pair $\\{v_{i},v_{k}\\}$ forms exactly one edge of $K_{10}$ and hence lies together in exactly one matching $P_{j^{*}}$. Therefore $c^{(i)}_{j} = c^{(k)}_{j}$ if and only if $j=j^{*}$, so the two codewords agree in exactly one coordinate and their Hamming distance is $9-1=8$. This constructs a $5$-ary code of length $9$ with $M=10$ and minimum distance $8$.\n\nThe Plotkin bound shows $M \\le 10$ and the construction attains $M=10$, hence the maximum possible number of codewords is $M=10$.",
