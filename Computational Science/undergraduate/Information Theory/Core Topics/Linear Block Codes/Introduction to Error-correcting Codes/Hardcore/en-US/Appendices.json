Taking $u=[1,0,0]$ gives the $G_{A}$ codeword $[1,0,0,1,1,0]$, which does not satisfy the equalities $c_{6}=c_{1}$ required by the $G_{B}$ codewords. Hence $G_{A}$’s code contains a vector not in $G_{B}$’s code, confirming the codes are different.\n\nBoth matrices are valid generator matrices for a $[6,3]$ code because they are $3 \\times 6$ with rank $3$ (for $G_{A}$ this is immediate from the leading $I_{3}$ block; for $G_{B}$ the RREF explicitly shows three pivots).

            "problem": "In a digital communication system, information is encoded using a binary linear block code to protect against errors during transmission. A code is defined as a set of valid codewords, which are vectors of binary digits (bits). This particular code is an $[n, k]$ linear code defined by its parity-check matrix, $H$. Any transmitted codeword $c$ must satisfy the condition $Hc^T = \\boldsymbol{0}$, where the matrix multiplication is performed over the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (i.e., addition is XOR, and multiplication is AND).\n\nWhen a codeword $c$ is transmitted over a noisy channel, it may be received as a different vector $y = c + e$, where $e$ is a non-zero error vector. The vector $e$ has a '1' in each position where a bit-flip occurred and a '0' elsewhere. The receiver checks the validity of the received vector $y$ by computing a syndrome vector $s = Hy^T$. If $s = \\boldsymbol{0}$, the receiver assumes no error occurred. Consequently, if an error pattern $e$ is such that $He^T = \\boldsymbol{0}$, the error will go undetected.\n\nConsider a binary linear code defined by the following $3 \\times 6$ parity-check matrix $H$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWhat is the minimum number of bit-flips in a transmission that could result in an error pattern that the receiver cannot detect?",
            "solution": "An undetected error occurs when the received word $y=c+e$ has syndrome $s=Hy^{T}=\\boldsymbol{0}$. Since codewords satisfy $Hc^{T}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, we have\n$$\ns=H(c+e)^{T}=Hc^{T}+He^{T}=\\boldsymbol{0}+He^{T}=He^{T}.\n$$\nThus an error $e$ is undetected if and only if $He^{T}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ with $e\\neq \\boldsymbol{0}$. The minimum number of bit-flips that can go undetected is the minimum Hamming weight among all nonzero $e$ in the null space of $H$, which equals the code’s minimum distance.\n\nLet the columns of $H$ be $h_{1},\\dots,h_{6}$. Over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, the condition $He^{T}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ means that the sum (XOR) of the columns indexed by the support of $e$ is the zero vector.

Hence weight $1$ is impossible.\n- Weight-2: An undetected two-bit error would require $h_{i}+h_{j}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, i.e., $h_{i}=h_{j}$. All columns are distinct, so weight $2$ is impossible.\n- Weight-3: Check for a triple summing to zero. We have\n$$\nh_{1}+h_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}=h_{4}\\;\\Rightarrow\\;h_{1}+h_{2}+h_{4}=\\boldsymbol{0}.\n$$\nTherefore a weight-$3$ error on positions $\\{1,2,4\\}$ is undetected, so the minimum undetectable weight is at most $3$. Combined with the impossibility of weights $1$ and $2$, the minimum is exactly $3$.\n\nHence, the minimum number of bit-flips that can go undetected is $3$.",

            "problem": "In a new type of high-density magnetic storage, data is encoded using a systematic linear block code before being written. A message, represented by a 3-bit binary vector $m = (m_1, m_2, m_3)$, is encoded into a 6-bit codeword $c = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6)$ using the generator matrix $G$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe encoding rule is $c = mG$.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to perform decoding for a linear code on a channel with a specific error model. The standard procedure for this is syndrome decoding.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the parity-check matrix $H$ for the given linear code. The generator matrix $G$ is given in systematic form $G = [I_k | P]$, where $k=3$ is the number of message bits, and $I_k$ is the $k \\times k$ identity matrix. The matrix $P$ is the $k \\times (n-k)$ matrix forming the rest of $G$. Here, $n=6$, so $n-k=3$.\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe parity-check matrix $H$ is then given by $H = [P^T | I_{n-k}]$, where $P^T$ is the transpose of $P$.\n$$ P^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, the parity-check matrix $H$ is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nA vector $c$ is a valid codeword if and only if $cH^T = 0$. For a received vector $r = c + e$, where $c$ is the transmitted codeword and $e$ is the error vector, the syndrome $s$ is calculated as $s = rH^T$. Since $cH^T=0$, we have $s = (c+e)H^T = cH^T + eH^T = eH^T$. The syndrome depends only on the error.\n\nThe received vector is $r = (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)$. Let's compute its syndrome. All operations are in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$$ s = rH^T = (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet's compute each component of the 3-bit syndrome vector $s=(s_1, s_2, s_3)$:\n$s_1 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 1$\n$s_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 1+1+1 = 1$\n$s_3 = 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1+1 = 0$\nSo, the syndrome of the received vector is $s = (1, 1, 0)$. Since $s \\neq (0,0,0)$, the received vector is not a valid codeword, and an error must have occurred.\n\nNext, we must find which error(s) from our error model correspond to this syndrome. The possible single CAPF errors are represented by error vectors with weight 2, where the 1s are in adjacent positions (cyclically). Let's calculate the syndrome for each possible single error vector $e$:\nLet $h_i$ be the $i$-th column of $H$. Then the syndrome for an error flipping bits $i$ and $j$ is $h_i^T + h_j^T$.\n\n- No error: $e_0 = (0,0,0,0,0,0)$, syndrome $s_0 = (0,0,0)$.\n- Error flipping bits 1, 2: $e_1 = (1,1,0,0,0,0)$, syndrome $s_1 = h_1^T + h_2^T = (1,1,0) + (0,1,1) = (1,0,1)$.\n- Error flipping bits 2, 3: $e_2 = (0,1,1,0,0,0)$, syndrome $s_2 = h_2^T + h_3^T = (0,1,1) + (1,0,1) = (1,1,0)$.\n- Error flipping bits 3, 4: $e_3 = (0,0,1,1,0,0)$, syndrome $s_3 = h_3^T + h_4^T = (1,0,1) + (1,0,0) = (0,0,1)$.\n- Error flipping bits 4, 5: $e_4 = (0,0,0,1,1,0)$, syndrome $s_4 = h_4^T + h_5^T = (1,0,0) + (0,1,0) = (1,1,0)$.\n- Error flipping bits 5, 6: $e_5 = (0,0,0,0,1,1)$, syndrome $s_5 = h_5^T + h_6^T = (0,1,0) + (0,0,1) = (0,1,1)$.\n- Error flipping bits 6, 1: $e_6 = (1,0,0,0,0,1)$, syndrome $s_6 = h_6^T + h_1^T = (0,0,1) + (1,1,0) = (1,1,1)$.\n\nThe syndrome of our received vector is $s=(1,1,0)$. From our table of syndromes, this matches two possible error vectors: $e_2 = (0,1,1,0,0,0)$ and $e_4 = (0,0,0,1,1,0)$. This means the decoding is ambiguous. We must find both possible transmitted codewords. The corrected codeword $\\hat{c}$ is found by $\\hat{c} = r + e$.\n\nPossibility 1: The error was $e_2 = (0,1,1,0,0,0)$.\nThe transmitted codeword would be $\\hat{c}_1 = r + e_2 = (1,1,0,0,1,1) + (0,1,1,0,0,0) = (1,0,1,0,1,1)$.\n\nPossibility 2: The error was $e_4 = (0,0,0,1,1,0)$.\nThe transmitted codeword would be $\\hat{c}_2 = r + e_4 = (1,1,0,0,1,1) + (0,0,0,1,1,0) = (1,1,0,1,0,1)$.\n\nWe must now decode these two possible codewords to find the original messages. Since the code is systematic with $G=[I_3 | P]$, the original message $m = (m_1, m_2, m_3)$ corresponds to the first three bits of the codeword $c$.\n\nFor $\\hat{c}_1 = (1,0,1,0,1,1)$, the original message is $m_1 = (1,0,1)$.\nFor $\\hat{c}_2 = (1,1,0,1,0,1)$, the original message is $m_2 = (1,1,0)$.\n\nBoth of these are valid interpretations under the assumption of a single CAPF error. Therefore, there are two possible original messages: $(1,0,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$.\n\nComparing our findings with the given options:\nA. The only possible message is $(1, 0, 1)$. (Incorrect, incomplete)\nB. The only possible message is $(1, 1, 0)$. (Incorrect, incomplete)\nC. The only possible message is $(0, 1, 1)$. (Incorrect)\nD. There are exactly two possible messages: $(1, 0, 1)$ and $(1, 1, 0)$. (Correct)\nE. The received vector must have resulted from more than one CAPF error...
