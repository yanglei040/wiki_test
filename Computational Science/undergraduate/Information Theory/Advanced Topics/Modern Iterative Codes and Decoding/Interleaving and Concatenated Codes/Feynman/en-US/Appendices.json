            "problem": "To ensure reliable data transmission from a satellite, a concatenated coding scheme is used. This scheme works in two stages: an outer code followed by an inner code.\n\nThe process begins with an original information message, which is grouped into $K=24$ blocks of data. Each of these blocks has a size of $k=5$ bits. The outer encoder, a block code denoted by $C_{out}$, takes these $K$ blocks and adds redundancy, producing an output of $N=32$ blocks.\n\nEach of the $N=32$ blocks (still of size $k=5$ bits) is then processed by the inner encoder, a block code denoted by $C_{in}$. The inner code takes each $5$-bit block and encodes it into an $n=8$ bit codeword for transmission.\n\nCalculate the overall code rate $R$ for this entire process. The code rate is defined as the ratio of the total number of original information bits to the total number of bits that are ultimately transmitted. Express your answer as a decimal.",
            "solution": "The total number of original information bits is the number of information blocks times the bits per block:\n$$\nB_{\\text{info}} = K \\cdot k.\n$$\nAfter the outer code, there are $N$ blocks (each still $k$ bits) that are fed to the inner code. The inner code maps each $k$-bit block to an $n$-bit codeword, so the total number of transmitted bits is:\n$$\nB_{\\text{tx}} = N \\cdot n.\n$$\nTherefore, the overall code rate is the ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{B_{\\text{info}}}{B_{\\text{tx}}} = \\frac{K \\cdot k}{N \\cdot n}.\n$$\nEquivalently, this is the product of the outer and inner code rates:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{K}{N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $K=24$, $N=32$, $k=5$, and $n=8$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{24}{32} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{15}{32} = 0.46875.\n$$",

            "introduction": "While error-correcting codes are designed to fix errors, their effectiveness can be severely compromised by \"burst errors\" — long strings of consecutive errors common in wireless channels. Interleaving is a powerful technique used to combat this issue by scrambling the data before transmission and unscrambling it upon reception. This practice will guide you through the mechanics of a block interleaver, allowing you to visualize how a contiguous burst of channel errors is dispersed into isolated, more manageable errors for the decoder to handle .",

            "problem": "A digital communication system is designed to be resilient against burst errors, which are errors that occur in consecutive symbols during transmission. To achieve this, the system employs a data reshuffling technique before transmission and a corresponding unscrambling technique after reception.\n\nConsider a block of 12 symbols, indexed from 1 to 12. Before transmission, these symbols are rearranged. The process is as follows: the original sequence of symbols is written into a $3 \\times 4$ matrix (3 rows, 4 columns) column by column, from left to right and top to bottom. Then, the symbols are read out from this matrix row by row, from top to bottom and left to right, to form the transmitted sequence.\n\nThe reverse process happens at the receiver. The incoming sequence of 12 symbols is written into a new $3 \\times 4$ matrix row by row. The final, reconstructed sequence is then obtained by reading the symbols out from this second matrix column by column.\n\nSuppose that during transmission over a noisy channel, a burst error of length 4 corrupts the symbols at positions 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the 12-symbol *transmitted* sequence.

If the syndrome indicates a single-bit error, flip the corresponding bit in that row. If the syndrome is zero, the row is left unchanged. A multi-bit error might be misidentified as a single-bit error, and the decoder will proceed with the corresponding bit-flip.\n2.  **Column Decoding:** After all rows have been processed, perform the same decoding procedure for each of the 7 columns of the modified matrix.\n3.  **Iteration:** Repeat the full cycle of row decoding followed by column decoding until a full cycle (one row pass and one column pass) results in no bit flips.\n\nThe received matrix $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  1  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  1  0 \\\\\n1  1  0  1  1  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  0  0 \\\\\n1  1  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n1  0  0  0  1  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nAfter the iterative decoding process converges, determine the final corrected second row of the matrix.
