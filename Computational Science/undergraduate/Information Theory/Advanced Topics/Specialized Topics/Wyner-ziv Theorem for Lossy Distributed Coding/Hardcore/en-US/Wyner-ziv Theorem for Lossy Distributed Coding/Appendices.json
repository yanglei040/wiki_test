This source is to be encoded for transmission, but the decoder will have access to correlated side information, $Y$. The side information is generated by a noisy version of the source, specifically by passing $X$ through a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a crossover probability of $\\epsilon$. The decoder receives no information from the encoder (a zero-rate coding scenario) and must produce an estimate $\\hat{X}$ of the source symbol $X$ based solely on the observed side information $Y$.\n\nThe performance of the estimator is measured by the average probability of error, which corresponds to the average Hamming distortion $E[d(X, \\hat{X})]$, where $d(x, \\hat{x})=1$ if $x \\ne \\hat{x}$ and $d(x, \\hat{x})=0$ if $x = \\hat{x}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum average error probability, $D_{\\min}$, when estimating a binary source $X$ using only the correlated side information $Y$. This scenario corresponds to Bayesian estimation, where the goal is to find an estimator $\\hat{x}(y)$ that minimizes the average distortion. For Hamming distortion, the average distortion is the probability of error, $D = P(X \\ne \\hat{X})$.\n\nAn optimal estimator, which minimizes the probability of error, is the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator. This estimator chooses the symbol $x$ that has the highest posterior probability given the observation $y$:\n$$ \\hat{x}(y) = \\arg\\max_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x|Y=y) $$\nThe total minimum error probability, $D_{\\min}$, is the sum of the error probabilities for each possible observation $y$, weighted by the probability of that observation occurring:\n$$ D_{\\min} = P(Y=0)P(\\text{error}|Y=0) + P(Y=1)P(\\text{error}|Y=1) $$\nThe probability of making an error, given an observation $y$, is the posterior probability of the symbol that was *not* chosen by the MAP rule. This is the smaller of the two posterior probabilities.\n$$ P(\\text{error}|Y=y) = \\min_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x|Y=y) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_{\\min}$:\n$$ D_{\\min} = P(Y=0) \\left( \\min_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x|Y=0) \\right) + P(Y=1) \\left( \\min_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x|Y=1) \\right) $$\nUsing the identity $P(A,B) = P(A)P(B|A)$, we can simplify the expression by bringing the marginal probability $P(Y=y)$ inside the minimum operator:\n$$ D_{\\min} = \\min_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x, Y=0) + \\min_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=x, Y=1) $$\nThis elegant formula allows us to compute $D_{\\min}$ by calculating the four joint probabilities $P(X=x, Y=y)$.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- Source probability: $P(X=1) = p_X = 0.800$. This implies $P(X=0) = 1 - p_X = 0.200$.\n- Channel crossover probability: $\\epsilon = 0.300$. This is the probability that a bit is flipped, i.e., $P(Y \\neq X|X)$. The probability of correct transmission is $1-\\epsilon = 0.700$.\n\nNow, we compute the four joint probabilities using the formula $P(X=x, Y=y) = P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)$:\n1.  $P(X=0, Y=0) = P(Y=0|X=0)P(X=0) = (1-\\epsilon)(1-p_X) = (0.700)(0.200) = 0.140$.\n2.  $P(X=1, Y=0) = P(Y=0|X=1)P(X=1) = \\epsilon \\cdot p_X = (0.300)(0.800) = 0.240$.\n3.  $P(X=0, Y=1) = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) = \\epsilon(1-p_X) = (0.300)(0.200) = 0.060$.\n4.  $P(X=1, Y=1) = P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1) = (1-\\epsilon)p_X = (0.700)(0.800) = 0.560$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into our expression for $D_{\\min}$:\n$$ D_{\\min} = \\min(P(X=0, Y=0), P(X=1, Y=0)) + \\min(P(X=0, Y=1), P(X=1, Y=1)) $$\n$$ D_{\\min} = \\min(0.140, 0.240) + \\min(0.060, 0.560) $$\nTaking the minimum from each pair:\n$$ D_{\\min} = 0.140 + 0.060 = 0.200 $$\n\nTo gain more insight, let's examine the explicit MAP decision rule:\n- If $Y=0$ is observed: The decoder compares $P(X=0, Y=0)=0.140$ with $P(X=1, Y=0)=0.240$. Since $0.240 > 0.140$, the decoder concludes that it is more probable that $X=1$ was sent. Thus, $\\hat{x}(0) = 1$.\n- If $Y=1$ is observed: The decoder compares $P(X=0, Y=1)=0.060$ with $P(X=1, Y=1)=0.560$. Since $0.560 > 0.060$, the decoder concludes $\\hat{x}(1) = 1$.\n\nIn both cases, the optimal decision is to guess $\\hat{X}=1$, regardless of the observed side information $Y$. This happens because the source is highly biased towards $X=1$ (a strong prior), and the channel is sufficiently noisy that the evidence from observing $Y=0$ is not strong enough to overcome this prior belief. The optimal strategy is thus to always guess the most likely source symbol.\nThe error probability of this strategy is the probability that the guess is wrong, which is $P(X \\ne 1) = P(X=0) = 1 - p_X = 1 - 0.800 = 0.200$. This confirms the result from our calculation.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to three significant figures, is 0.200.",
