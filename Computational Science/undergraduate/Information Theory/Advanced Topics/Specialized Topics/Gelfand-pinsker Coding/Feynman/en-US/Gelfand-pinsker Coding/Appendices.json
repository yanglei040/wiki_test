We will explore a hypothetical channel where an additive interference, known to the transmitter, corrupts the signal. This practice  will guide you through designing an encoding strategy that effectively 'pre-subtracts' the known interference, allowing for surprisingly perfect communication.",

            "problem": "Consider a communication channel designed for a specialized digital system that operates using ternary logic. The channel input, denoted by $X$, must be selected from the alphabet $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The channel is affected by an additive state variable $S$, which also takes values from the alphabet $\\mathcal{S} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The state $S$ is a random variable, uniformly distributed over its alphabet, and it is known to the transmitter before it chooses the input $X$. The channel output, $Y$, is determined by the relationship $Y = (X + S) \\pmod 3$, where the operation is addition modulo 3. The output alphabet is thus $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nDetermine the capacity of this channel. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in units of bits per channel use.",
            "solution": "We are given a discrete memoryless channel with input alphabet $\\mathcal{X}=\\{0,1,2\\}$, state alphabet $\\mathcal{S}=\\{0,1,2\\}$, and output alphabet $\\mathcal{Y}=\\{0,1,2\\}$. The channel law is $Y=(X+S)\\pmod 3$, where $S$ is uniformly distributed on $\\mathcal{S}$ and is known to the transmitter before choosing $X$ for each channel use.\n\nFor a channel with state known non-causally at the transmitter, The Gelfand-Pinsker theorem states that the capacity is\n$$\nC=\\max_{p(u),\\,x(u,s)} I(U;Y),\n$$\nwhere $U$ is an auxiliary random variable independent of $S$ and $X=x(U,S)$ is a deterministic function.\n\nFirst, an upper bound follows from the finite output alphabet:\n$$\nI(U;Y)\\leq H(Y)\\leq \\log_{2}|\\mathcal{Y}|=\\log_{2} 3,\n$$\nso $C\\leq \\log_{2} 3$.\n\nTo achieve this bound, choose $U$ taking values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$, independent of $S$, with distribution $p(u)$ to be optimized, and define the encoding function\n$$\nx(u,s)=(u-s)\\pmod 3.\n$$\nThen the channel output satisfies\n$$\nY=(X+S)\\pmod 3=\\big((u-s)\\pmod 3+s\\big)\\pmod 3=u,\n$$\nsince addition and subtraction are over the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Hence $Y$ is a deterministic function of $U$ with $Y=U$, which implies\n$$\nI(U;Y)=H(Y)-H(Y|U)=H(U)-0=H(U).\n$$\nMaximizing $H(U)$ over distributions on a ternary alphabet yields $H(U)\\leq \\log_{2} 3$, with equality for the uniform distribution on $\\{0,1,2\\}$.

            "introduction": "Building on the idea of pre-coding, this problem explores a channel with multiplicative interference—think of it as a random sign flip. The key task here  is not just to find the capacity with state information, but to quantify the exact benefit by comparing it to a scenario where the transmitter is uninformed. This exercise highlights how knowing the channel state at the transmitter can turn a noisy channel into a perfect one, and it allows us to measure this improvement in bits per channel use.",

The channel is subject to a multiplicative state $S$, also taking values from the set $\\{-1, 1\\}$. The state $S$ is a random variable that remains constant for each use of the channel and is drawn from a distribution given by $P(S=1)=p$ and $P(S=-1)=1-p$, with $0 < p < 1$.\n\nWe are interested in the capacity of this channel under two different conditions of state knowledge.\n1.  **Uninformed Case:** The realization of the state $S$ is unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver. Let the capacity in this scenario be $C_0$.\n2.  **Transmitter-Informed Case:** The realization of the state $S$ is known non-causally to the transmitter before it chooses the input $X$, but it remains unknown to the receiver.

Use $\\log_2$ for any logarithms, as capacity is measured in bits per channel use.",
            "solution": "We analyze the two scenarios by computing the mutual information optimized over the encoder strategy.\n\nUninformed case. The channel is $Y = S X$ with $X \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ and $S \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ independent of $X$, with $P(S=1)=p$ and $P(S=-1)=1-p$. For any input distribution $P_{X}$, the mutual information is\n$$\nI(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X).\n$$\nGiven $X=x$, $Y=Sx$ is a one-to-one function of $S$, hence $H(Y|X=x)=H(S)$ for all $x$, and thus\n$$\nH(Y|X)=H(S) = -p \\log_{2} p - (1-p)\\log_{2}(1-p).\n$$\nSince $Y \\in \\{-1,1\\}$, we have $H(Y) \\leq 1$, with equality when $Y$ is equiprobable. Choosing $P(X=1)=P(X=-1)=\\frac{1}{2}$ yields $P(Y=1)=p \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-p)\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and hence $H(Y)=1$.

This final practice  presents a more nuanced scenario where a 'bad' channel state renders communication impossible, effectively 'jamming' the output. Instead of inverting the state's effect, the optimal strategy involves adapting the transmission to the state by communicating only when the channel is 'good'.

The state $S$ is a binary random variable, taking values in $\\{0, 1\\}$. The state is 'good' ($S=0$) with probability $1-q$ and 'bad' ($S=1$) with probability $q$, where $0 < q < 1$.

The transmitter knows the state non-causally; the receiver does not.\n\nBy the Gelfand–Pinsker theorem for channels with state known non-causally at the encoder, the capacity is\n$$\nC=\\max_{p(u|s),\\,x(u,s)}\\bigl[I(U;Y)-I(U;S)\\bigr].\n$$\nWe construct an achievable scheme by choosing an auxiliary $U \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and an encoding function $x=f(u,s)$ so that $Y=U$ deterministically under the channel law. This is feasible if and only if $U$ satisfies $\\Pr[U=1|S=1]=0$ (because when $s=1$ the channel output is forced to $y=0$), and when $s=0$ we set $x=u$ so that $y=x=u$. Under this choice, $Y=U$ deterministically, hence\n$$\nI(U;Y)=H(Y), \\quad I(U;S)=I(Y;S)=H(Y)-H(Y|S),\n$$\nwhich gives the achievable value\n$$\nI(U;Y)-I(U;S)=H(Y|S).\n$$\nThe conditional distribution $p(y|s)$ is constrained by the channel and encoder choice: when $s=1$, $y=0$ almost surely, so $H(Y|S=1)=0$; when $s=0$, we may choose any $p=\\Pr[Y=1|S=0] \\in [0,1]$, giving $H(Y|S=0)=H_{2}(p)$, where $H_{2}(p)=-p\\log_{2}p-(1-p)\\log_{2}(1-p)$.
