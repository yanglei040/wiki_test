The probability of the system being in state $k$ is given by $p_k$. A key performance metric for certain algorithms is the state's \"purity\", which is related to the collision entropy.

Let $S = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} p_k^2$. The problem is thus to maximize $S$ subject to the following constraints:\n1. Normalization: $\\sum_{k=0}^{10} p_k = 1$\n2. Mean value: $\\sum_{k=0}^{10} k \\, p_k = \\mu = 3.8$\n3. Non-negativity: $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the nature of the solution.\nThe set of all valid probability distributions satisfying these constraints forms a convex set (specifically, a convex polytope) in the 11-dimensional space of probabilities $(p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{10})$. The objective function $S(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} p_k^2$ is a strictly convex function. The Hessian matrix of $S$ is $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial p_i \\partial p_j} = 2\\delta_{ij}$, which is a diagonal matrix with all positive entries (2), making it positive definite.\n\nA fundamental theorem of convex optimization states that the maximum of a convex function over a compact convex set must be achieved at one of the extreme points (vertices) of the set. We must therefore characterize the vertices of the feasible set.\n\nA distribution $\\mathbf{p}$ is a vertex if it cannot be written as a convex combination of two other distinct distributions in the set. Let's assume a distribution has three or more non-zero probabilities, say at indices $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$. We can construct a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ with non-zero components only at these indices such that $\\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to the constraint vectors. That is, $\\sum v_k = 0$ and $\\sum k v_k = 0$. For instance, let $v_{k_1} = k_2 - k_3$, $v_{k_2} = k_3 - k_1$, and $v_{k_3} = k_1 - k_2$. The sum of components is zero. The sum $\\sum k v_k = k_1(k_2-k_3) + k_2(k_3-k_1) + k_3(k_1-k_2) = 0$.\nFor a small enough $\\epsilon > 0$, the distributions $\\mathbf{p}' = \\mathbf{p} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{p}'' = \\mathbf{p} - \\epsilon \\mathbf{v}$ are also in the feasible set. Then $\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{p}' + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{p}''$, which contradicts the assumption that $\\mathbf{p}$ is a vertex. Therefore, any vertex of the feasible set can have at most two non-zero probabilities.\n\nStep 3: Solve for the two-point distribution.\nLet the two states with non-zero probability be $i$ and $j$, where $i < j$. The constraints become:\n1. $p_i + p_j = 1$\n2. $i \\cdot p_i + j \\cdot p_j = \\mu$\n\nFrom (1), we have $p_j = 1 - p_i$. Substituting into (2):\n$i \\cdot p_i + j(1 - p_i) = \\mu$\n$p_i(i - j) = \\mu - j$\n$p_i = \\frac{\\mu - j}{i - j} = \\frac{j - \\mu}{j - i}$\n\nAnd for $p_j$:\n$p_j = 1 - p_i = 1 - \\frac{j - \\mu}{j - i} = \\frac{j - i - (j - \\mu)}{j - i} = \\frac{\\mu - i}{j - i}$\n\nFor these to be valid probabilities, we need $p_i \\ge 0$ and $p_j \\ge 0$. This implies $j - \\mu \\ge 0$ and $\\mu - i \\ge 0$, so we must have $i \\le \\mu \\le j$.\n\nStep 4: Find the optimal pair $(i, j)$.\nThe sum of squares is $S(i,j) = p_i^2 + p_j^2 = \\left(\\frac{j - \\mu}{j - i}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\mu - i}{j - i}\\right)^2$. We need to find the pair of integers $(i, j)$ with $0 \\le i < j \\le 10$ and $i \\le 3.8 \\le j$ that maximizes this quantity.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $S(i, j)$ by taking a partial derivative with respect to $j$ (treating it as continuous for a moment) for a fixed $i$:\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial j} = \\frac{2(\\mu - i)}{(j - i)^3} (j + i - 2\\mu)$.\nSince $j > i$ and $\\mu > i$, the sign is determined by the term $(j + i - 2\\mu)$. The function increases with $j$ if $j > 2\\mu - i$ and decreases if $j < 2\\mu - i$. This implies that for a fixed $i$, the maximum value of $S$ must occur at the boundaries of the allowed range for $j$, i.e., $j = \\lceil \\mu \\rceil$ or $j = 10$.\nSimilarly, by analyzing $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial i}$, one can show that for a fixed $j$, the maximum must occur at $i = \\lfloor \\mu \\rfloor$ or $i = 0$.\nThus, the optimal pair $(i, j)$ must be one of the four candidate pairs formed by combining these boundary values:\n$(\\lfloor \\mu \\rfloor, \\lceil \\mu \\rceil)$, $(\\lfloor \\mu \\rfloor, 10)$, $(0, \\lceil \\mu \\rceil)$, $(0, 10)$.\n\nStep 5: Test the candidate pairs for $\\mu = 3.8$.\nWe have $\\lfloor \\mu \\rfloor = 3$ and $\\lceil \\mu \\rceil = 4$. The candidate pairs are $(3,4)$, $(3,10)$, $(0,4)$, and $(0,10)$.

The probabilities are:\n$p_0 = 0.05$\n$p_4 = 0.95$\nAll other probabilities $p_k$ for $k \\notin \\{0, 4\\}$ are zero.\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $p_0 = 0.0500$ and $p_4 = 0.950$.\nThe indices in increasing order are $k_1=0$ and $k_2=4$. The sequence of values is $k_1, p_{k_1}, k_2, p_{k_2}$.\nThis gives $(0, 0.0500)$ and $(4, 0.950)$.",
