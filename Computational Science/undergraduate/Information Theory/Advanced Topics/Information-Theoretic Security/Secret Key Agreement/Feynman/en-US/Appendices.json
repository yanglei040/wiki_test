This initial practice explores a scenario where information is structurally hidden from Eve, analogous to the perfect secrecy afforded by a one-time pad. By working through this exercise , you will see how mutual information quantifies secrecy and discover a situation where an eavesdropper's partial knowledge gives her zero information about the final secret bit.",

            "problem": "In a communication scenario designed for secret key generation, Alice produces a random bit $X$ for transmission to Bob. Alice's source bit is generated by taking the exclusive-or (XOR, denoted by $\\oplus$) of two independent and secret bits, $S_1$ and $S_2$. Each of $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the result of a fair coin flip, independently taking a value from the set $\\{0, 1\\}$ with a probability of $1/2$. Therefore, Alice's source bit is $X = S_1 \\oplus S_2$.\n\nBob receives a version of $X$, denoted by $Y$, over a noisy communication link. This link is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), which is a channel where each transmitted bit is flipped (i.e., $0 \\to 1$ or $1 \\to 0$) with a fixed crossover probability $\\epsilon$, where $0 < \\epsilon < 1/2$.\n\nMeanwhile, an eavesdropper, Eve, is able to perfectly intercept one of Alice's secret bits. Eve's observation is denoted by $Z$, where $Z = S_1$.\n\nThe maximum rate at which Alice and Bob can generate a shared secret key that is information-theoretically secure from Eve is given by $K = I(X; Y) - I(X; Z)$, where $I(\\cdot; \\cdot)$ denotes the mutual information and all logarithms are base 2.\n\nCalculate the secret key rate $K$ in bits per channel use.

This next problem  models such a case, directly illustrating the core principle of secret key capacity: the achievable secret rate is precisely the information advantage that Alice and Bob hold over Eve.

            "problem": "In a communication scenario designed for secret key generation, Alice transmits information to Bob, while an eavesdropper, Eve, listens in. The protocol proceeds as follows for each \"channel use\":\n\n1.  Alice generates a pair of independent and uniformly random bits, $X_1$ and $X_2$. This means for each bit, the probability of it being 0 is equal to the probability of it being 1, which is $1/2$. The pair $(X_1, X_2)$ constitutes the total information Alice sends in one channel use.\n\n2.  Bob receives a corresponding pair of bits, $(Y_1, Y_2)$. Bob's channel is partially noisy. The first bit is received perfectly, such that $Y_1 = X_1$. The second bit is subject to noise, modeled by a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a crossover probability $p$, where $0 < p < 1/2$.

Since $Y_{1}=X_{1}$ (noiseless) and $Y_{2}=X_{2}\\oplus N$ with $N \\sim \\mathrm{Bern}(p)$ independent of $(X_{1},X_{2})$, we have\n$$\nH(Y\\mid X)=H(Y_{1},Y_{2}\\mid X_{1},X_{2})=H(Y_{1}\\mid X_{1},X_{2})+H(Y_{2}\\mid X_{1},X_{2})=0+H(N)=H_{b}(p).\n$$\nBecause $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are independent and uniform, $Y_{1}$ is uniform, and $Y_{2}$ is also uniform (a BSC output with uniform input).

            "introduction": "Finally, we scale our analysis to long sequences of data, which reflects how real-world communication systems operate. This practice introduces a crucial asymptotic concept: the *rate* of information leakage . You will analyze a hypothetical scenario where, for any finite sequence, Eve gains some information; however, her knowledge grows much more slowly than the information shared between Alice and Bob.

            "problem": "In a communication scenario involving three parties—Alice, Bob, and an eavesdropper Eve—a scheme for generating a shared secret key is being analyzed. Alice generates a sequence of $n$ bits, denoted by $X^n = (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$. Each bit $X_i$ is an independent and identically distributed random variable, chosen uniformly at random, such that $P(X_i=1) = P(X_i=0) = 1/2$.\n\nAlice transmits this sequence to Bob over a noisy channel. This channel is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), which means each bit is flipped independently with a constant probability $p$. The sequence received by Bob is denoted by $Y^n$.\n\nMeanwhile, Eve attempts to gain information about Alice's sequence. However, due to her limited access, she cannot observe the sequence $X^n$ directly. Instead, Eve is only able to determine the total number of ones in Alice's original sequence. Let this value be $W = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n\nThe maximum rate (in bits per channel use) at which Alice and Bob can generate a secret key that remains perfectly secure from Eve is given by the secret key capacity. For this scenario, you are asked to determine this rate in the asymptotic limit of very long sequences (i.e., as $n \\to \\infty$).\n\nProvide a closed-form analytic expression for this secret key rate as a function of the crossover probability $p$.

Eve observes only $W=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$.\n\nIn the source model with unlimited public discussion overheard by Eve, an upper bound on the secret key capacity per symbol is\n$$\n\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}I(X^{n};Y^{n}\\mid E_{n}),\n$$\nwhere $E_{n}$ denotes Eve’s total observation for blocklength $n$.
