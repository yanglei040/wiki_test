This practice challenges you to apply the fundamental tool for this task: mutual information. By calculating the mutual information $I(M; C)$ between a message and its corresponding ciphertext, you will determine exactly how much security is compromised in a hypothetical encryption scheme, moving from the abstract ideal of perfect secrecy to a concrete numerical measure of information leakage .",

            "problem": "In a simplified cryptographic scenario, a binary message $M$ is encrypted using a ternary key $K$. The message space is $\\mathcal{M} = \\{0, 1\\}$, and messages are chosen with uniform probability, i.e., $P(M=0) = P(M=1) = 1/2$. The key space is $\\mathcal{K} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The key $K$ is drawn from this space according to the non-uniform probability distribution: $P(K=0) = 1/2$, and $P(K=1) = P(K=2) = 1/4$.\n\nThe message $M$ and key $K$ are statistically independent. The ciphertext $C$ is generated by the rule $C = (M + K) \\pmod 3$.\n\nCalculate the mutual information $I(M; C)$ between the message and the ciphertext. The calculation should be performed using logarithms in base 2, such that the result is in bits. Your final answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression.",

            "introduction": "While perfect secrecy is ideal, many practical scenarios involve transmitting information over inherently noisy channels. The wiretap channel model provides a framework for achieving security by exploiting the fact that an eavesdropper's channel may be noisier than the intended recipient's.

            "problem": "A space agency is managing a communication link with a robotic explorer on a distant planetary moon. The explorer (Alice) sends binary data to the mission control center on Earth (Bob). Due to various forms of interference, the link behaves as a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), where each transmitted bit is either received correctly or is erased (i.e., replaced by an erasure symbol 'e', indicating the bit's value is unknown). The probability of a bit being erased on this primary channel is $\\epsilon_B = 0.12$.\n\nAn adversarial agency (Eve) is attempting to eavesdrop on the transmission. Eve does not have a direct line-of-sight to the explorer. Instead, her listening post intercepts the signal after it has been unintentionally relayed through two separate, non-ideal relay points in sequence. The link from Alice to the first relay point is a BEC with erasure probability $\\epsilon_{E1} = 0.25$. The subsequent link from the first relay to Eve's final receiver (passing through the second relay) can be modeled as a single equivalent BEC with erasure probability $\\epsilon_{E2} = 0.35$. The erasure events in all channels are independent.\n\nCalculate the secrecy capacity of this communication system. The secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum achievable data rate (in bits per channel use) at which Alice can send information to Bob such that the communication is reliable for Bob, while Eve obtains absolutely no information about the message content.

            "problem": "Alice wishes to send a single secret bit $S$ to Bob. They have arranged ahead of time to share two secret key bits, $K_1$ and $K_2$. The secret bit $S$ and the two key bits $K_1$ and $K_2$ are all independent and uniformly random (i.e., they take values 0 or 1 with a probability of 1/2 each).\n\nAlice's transmission protocol is as follows. She sends a pair of bits, $(C_1, C_2)$, one after the other. The values of these bits depend on the shared key $K_2$:\n- If $K_2 = 0$, Alice transmits $(C_1, C_2) = (S, S \\oplus K_1)$.\n- If $K_2 = 1$, Alice transmits $(C_1, C_2) = (S \\oplus K_1, S)$.\nHere, $\\oplus$ denotes the exclusive OR (XOR) operation.\n\nAn eavesdropper, Eve, is aware of this protocol but does not know the secret keys $K_1$ and $K_2$. Eve has the power to perform exactly one of the following two actions on the pair of transmissions:\n\n1.  **INTERCEPT**: Eve chooses to listen to exactly one of the two transmissions (either $C_1$ or $C_2$) and learns its value perfectly. The bit she does not choose to listen to is unobserved by her. In this case, both bits reach Bob's receiver without error.\n2.  **JAM**: Eve chooses to block exactly one of the two transmissions. Bob receives an 'ERASURE' symbol for that bit and knows which transmission was blocked. Eve learns nothing about the value of either transmitted bit when she chooses this action.\n\nAssume that Bob's part of the protocol is perfectly reliable, meaning he can always determine the value of $S$ regardless of Eve's action. Eve is a rational adversary whose sole objective is to maximize the information she obtains about the secret bit $S$.\n\nCalculate the mutual information $I(S; Z)$ between the secret bit $S$ and Eve's observation $Z$, assuming Eve executes her optimal strategy.
