Min-entropy, denoted as $H_{\\infty}(X)$, serves as our most conservative measure, quantifying the uncertainty from the perspective of an attacker making a single best guess. This practice problem  provides a hands-on opportunity to calculate the min-entropy for a source with a clear structural weakness, helping to solidify your understanding of how correlations in data reduce its effective unpredictability.",

            "problem": "A cryptographic protocol relies on a source that generates $n$-bit keys, where $n$ is an even positive integer. A flaw in the implementation causes the key generation process to behave as follows: a string of $n/2$ bits is chosen uniformly at random, and this string constitutes the first half of the key. The second half of the key is then set to be an exact copy of the first half. The resulting $n$-bit key is represented by the random variable $X$.\n\nThe min-entropy of a discrete random variable $Y$ is defined as $H_{\\infty}(Y) = -\\log_{2}(\\max_{y} P(Y=y))$, where the maximization is over all possible outcomes $y$ of the variable $Y$. This metric is a crucial measure of an attacker's single-guess success probability.\n\nCalculate the min-entropy of the random variable $X$. Express your answer in bits as a function of $n$.",

Therefore, the support of $X$ is the set\n$$\nS = \\{ ww : w \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n/2} \\},\n$$\nwhich has cardinality\n$$\n|S| = 2^{n/2}.\n$$\nSince $w$ is chosen uniformly and deterministically mapped to $ww$, $X$ is uniform over $S$. Hence, for any $x \\in S$,\n$$\nP(X = x) = \\frac{1}{2^{n/2}},\n$$\nand for any $x \\notin S$, $P(X = x) = 0$.
