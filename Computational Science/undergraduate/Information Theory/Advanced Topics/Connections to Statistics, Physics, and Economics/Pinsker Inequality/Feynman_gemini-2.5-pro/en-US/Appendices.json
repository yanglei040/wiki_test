This exercise provides a concrete opportunity to apply the definitions of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Total Variation (TV) distance. By calculating both sides of the inequality for a specific numerical example, you will build a foundational intuition for how these two important measures of statistical distance relate to one another .",

            "problem": "In a digital manufacturing process, a component is designed to be in one of two states, labeled 0 and 1. The ideal manufacturing specification dictates that the probability of a component being in state 1 is exactly $p$. This can be modeled by a Bernoulli distribution, let's call it $P$, with a probability mass function $P(1) = p$ and $P(0) = 1-p$.\n\nAfter a period of operation, a quality control check reveals that the process has drifted. The components now follow a different Bernoulli distribution, $Q$, with a probability mass function $Q(1) = q$ and $Q(0) = 1-q$.\n\nTo quantify the statistical difference between the ideal distribution $P$ and the actual distribution $Q$, two important metrics from information theory are used:\n\n1.  The Total Variation Distance, defined as $TV(P, Q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{x \\in \\{0, 1\\}} |P(x) - Q(x)|$.\n2.  The Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence, defined as $D_{KL}(P || Q) = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0, 1\\}} P(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\\right)$.\n\nThese two measures are related by Pinsker's inequality, which states that $D_{KL}(P || Q) \\ge 2[TV(P, Q)]^2$. The term $2[TV(P, Q)]^2$ acts as a theoretical lower bound for the KL divergence.\n\nSuppose the ideal specification is $p=0.5$, but the actual observed process has drifted to $q=0.8$. Calculate the ratio of the actual KL divergence to the theoretical lower bound given by Pinsker's inequality. That is, compute the value of the ratio $R = \\frac{D_{KL}(P || Q)}{2[TV(P, Q)]^2}$.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.",
