            "problem": "Consider a simple communication system designed to transmit a constant DC voltage level. The input signal to the channel is a fixed, non-random value $X = c$, where $c$ is a real constant. The channel is an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, so the received signal $Y$ is given by $Y = X + N$. The noise $N$ is a Gaussian random variable with a mean of zero and a variance of $\\sigma^2$, and it is statistically independent of the input $X$.\n\nTwo key performance metrics for such a system are:\n1.  The Minimum Mean Square Error, $\\text{mmse}(X|Y)$, which represents the lowest possible expected squared error in estimating the input signal $X$ after observing the output $Y$. It is formally defined as $\\text{mmse}(X|Y) = E[(X - E[X|Y])^2]$.\n2.  The rate of change of the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ with respect to the noise variance. The mutual information measures the statistical dependency between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nYour task is to determine the value of the MMSE, $\\text{mmse}(X|Y)$, and the value of the derivative $\\frac{d}{d(\\sigma^2)}I(X;Y)$.\n\nWhich of the following pairs correctly identifies these two quantities?\n\nA.

            "solution": "This problem asks for two quantities related to a constant signal $X=c$ transmitted over an AWGN channel: the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and the derivative of the mutual information with respect to the noise variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)**\n\nThe MMSE of estimating $X$ given $Y$ is defined as $\\text{mmse}(X|Y) = E[(X - \\hat{X}_{\\text{MMSE}}(Y))^2]$, where the MMSE estimator is the conditional expectation $\\hat{X}_{\\text{MMSE}}(Y) = E[X|Y]$.\n\nIn this specific problem, the input signal $X$ is a constant value, $X=c$. We need to find the conditional expectation of this constant value given the observation $Y$.\nThe expectation of a constant is just the constant itself, regardless of any conditioning. Therefore,\n$$\n\\hat{X}_{\\text{MMSE}}(Y) = E[X|Y] = E[c|Y] = c\n$$\nThis result is intuitive: if we know for a fact that the transmitted signal was $c$, the best possible estimate for it is $c$, no matter what noisy value $Y$ we receive.\n\nNow we substitute this estimator back into the definition of the MMSE:\n$$\n\\text{mmse}(X|Y) = E[(X - \\hat{X}_{\\text{MMSE}}(Y))^2] = E[(c - c)^2] = E[0^2] = 0\n$$\nSo, the Minimum Mean Square Error is 0.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the derivative of the mutual information**\n\nThe mutual information $I(X; Y)$ for continuous random variables can be expressed in terms of differential entropies as:\n$$\nI(X; Y) = h(Y) - h(Y|X)\n$$\nLet's calculate each term.\n\nFirst, we find the conditional differential entropy $h(Y|X)$.\nGiven a specific value of the input $X=x$, the output is $Y = x + N$. Since $N$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$, $Y$ conditioned on $X=x$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $x$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\nThe differential entropy of a Gaussian random variable with variance $V$ is given by the formula $h = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e V)$.\nSo, for a given $X=x$, the conditional entropy of $Y$ is:\n$$\nh(Y|X=x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e \\sigma^2)\n$$\nSince this expression does not depend on the specific value $x$, the overall conditional entropy $h(Y|X)$, which is the expectation of $h(Y|X=x)$ over all possible values of $X$, is simply:\n$$\nh(Y|X) = E_X[h(Y|X=x)] = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\nNext, we find the differential entropy of the output, $h(Y)$.\nThe input signal is always $X=c$. Therefore, the output signal is always $Y = c + N$.\nSince $N$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$, $Y$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $c$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\nUsing the same formula for the entropy of a Gaussian, the entropy of $Y$ is:\n$$\nh(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the mutual information:\n$$\nI(X; Y) = h(Y) - h(Y|X) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e \\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi e \\sigma^2) = 0\n$$\nThis result is also intuitive. Since the input $X$ is a known constant, there is no uncertainty about it to begin with. Observing the noisy output $Y$ cannot provide any \"information\" about $X$ that we do not already possess. Hence, the mutual information is zero.\n\nFinally, we need to find the derivative of the mutual information with respect to the noise variance $\\sigma^2$. Since $I(X; Y) = 0$ (a constant), its derivative with respect to any variable is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d(\\sigma^2)}I(X;Y) = \\frac{d}{d(\\sigma^2)}(0) = 0\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $\\text{mmse}(X|Y) = 0$ and $\\frac{d}{d(\\sigma^2)}I(X;Y) = 0$. Comparing this result with the given options, we find that option A matches our calculations.\nThis specific case is a simple illustration of de Bruijn's identity, which states $\\frac{d}{d\\alpha} I(X; X+\\sqrt{\\alpha}Z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{mmse}(X|X+\\sqrt{\\alpha}Z)$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $\\alpha = \\sigma^2$. Our results show that $0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0$, satisfying the identity.",

For an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, the slope of the mutual information curve with respect to SNR near zero is determined by a fundamental quantity: the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) evaluated at zero SNR.\n\nConsider a communication system that transmits a signal $X$. The signal is a random variable that takes values from the set $\\{-A, 0, A\\}$, where $A=5.0$. The probability distribution for $X$ is given by $P(X = A) = 0.25$, $P(X = -A) = 0.25$, and $P(X=0)=0.5$.\n\nThe signal is transmitted over an AWGN channel, and the received signal is $Y = X + Z$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to compute the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) in the limit of zero Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The MMSE in estimating a random variable $X$ from an observation $Y$ is given by the expression $\\text{mmse} = E[(X - \\hat{X})^2]$, where the optimal estimator is the conditional mean, $\\hat{X} = E[X|Y]$.\n\nThe SNR is defined as $\\text{SNR} = \\frac{E[X^2]}{\\sigma^2}$, where $E[X^2]$ is the average power of the signal $X$ and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance (power) of the noise $Z$.\n\nFirst, we compute the average power of the signal $X$. The signal $X$ can take values from $\\{-5.0, 0, 5.0\\}$ with probabilities $P(X=-5.0) = 0.25$, $P(X=0) = 0.5$, and $P(X=5.0) = 0.25$.\nThe average signal power, $E[X^2]$, is calculated as:\n$$ E[X^2] = \\sum_{x} x^2 P(X=x) $$\n$$ E[X^2] = (-5.0)^2 P(X=-5.0) + (0)^2 P(X=0) + (5.0)^2 P(X=5.0) $$\n$$ E[X^2] = (25.0)(0.25) + (0)(0.5) + (25.0)(0.25) = 6.25 + 0 + 6.25 = 12.5 $$\nThe average signal power $E[X^2]$ is a finite, positive constant.\n\nThe problem asks for the MMSE in the limit as $\\text{SNR} \\to 0$. We examine the implication of this limit on the noise power $\\sigma^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} \\frac{E[X^2]}{\\sigma^2} = \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} \\frac{12.5}{\\sigma^2} = 0 $$\nFor this limit to hold, the denominator must approach infinity, so $\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty$. A zero-SNR condition corresponds to infinite noise power.\n\nThe received signal is $Y = X + Z$. In the limit of infinite noise power ($\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty$), the noise term $Z$ completely overwhelms the finite signal term $X$. Consequently, the observed signal $Y$ contains no information about the transmitted signal $X$. In this limit, $X$ and $Y$ become statistically independent.\n\nThe MMSE estimator is the conditional expectation $\\hat{X} = E[X|Y]$. When the observation $Y$ is independent of the signal $X$, the conditional expectation provides no more information than the unconditional expectation. Therefore, the estimator becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty} E[X|Y] = E[X] $$\n\nWe now calculate the unconditional mean of the signal, $E[X]$:\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{x} x P(X=x) $$\n$$ E[X] = (-5.0) P(X=-5.0) + (0) P(X=0) + (5.0) P(X=5.0) $$\n$$ E[X] = (-5.0)(0.25) + (0)(0.5) + (5.0)(0.25) = -1.25 + 0 + 1.25 = 0 $$\nThus, in the zero-SNR limit, the best estimate of $X$ is its mean value, which is $0$, irrespective of the value of $Y$.\n\nNow, we can find the MMSE in this limit by substituting the limiting estimator into the definition of MMSE:\n$$ \\text{mmse}(\\text{SNR}=0) = \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} E[(X - E[X|Y])^2] $$\nBy moving the limit inside the expectation (which is permissible here), we get:\n$$ \\text{mmse}(\\text{SNR}=0) = E\\left[\\left(X - \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} E[X|Y]\\right)^2\\right] = E[(X - E[X])^2] $$\nThis final expression is the definition of the variance of $X$, denoted as $\\text{Var}(X)$.\n\nThe variance is calculated using the formula $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. Using the values we have already computed:\n$$ E[X^2] = 12.5 $$\n$$ E[X] = 0 $$\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = 12.5 - (0)^2 = 12.5 $$\n\nTherefore, the MMSE in the limit as the SNR approaches zero is equal to the variance of the signal $X$, which is 12.5.",
