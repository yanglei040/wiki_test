This first exercise provides a classic scenario involving a speculative asset with a clear probability of success and a specific payoff.

            "problem": "An investor is analyzing a speculative digital asset whose value is tied to a single, upcoming binary event. Based on her model, the probability of a favorable outcome (a \"surge\") is $1/3$. If the surge occurs, the investment provides a net payoff of 3-to-1. This means that for every dollar invested, the investor receives her original dollar back plus an additional 3 dollars in profit. If the outcome is unfavorable (a \"collapse\"), the entire amount invested is lost.\n\nAssuming the investor's goal is to maximize the long-term expected growth rate of her capital, and she can reinvest her capital after each such opportunity, what is the optimal fraction of her current capital to invest in this asset?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified, exact fraction.",

            "problem": "A quantitative analyst is developing an automated trading strategy for a highly volatile digital asset. The strategy consists of a sequence of independent trades. For each trade, there are two possible outcomes: a \"win\" or a \"loss\". A winning trade results in a net profit equal to a fixed multiple of the amount invested, while a losing trade results in the complete loss of the invested amount.\n\nThe firm's model for capital management aims to maximize the long-term expected logarithmic growth of the portfolio. This model prescribes investing a specific, constant fraction, $f^*$, of the total available capital in each trade.\n\nBased on historical data and market analysis, the following parameters have been established:\n- The payout ratio for a winning trade, denoted by $b$, is $2$. This means a winning investment returns a net profit of twice the amount staked.\n- The optimal fraction of capital to invest per trade, calculated to maximize the logarithmic growth, is $f^* = 0.1$.\n\nAssuming the probability of a win, $p$, is constant for each trade, determine the value of $p$.

            "solution": "Let $W$ be the current capital. The trading strategy involves investing a fraction $f$ of this capital. The amount invested is $fW$.\n\nThere are two outcomes for each trade:\n1.  **Win**: This occurs with probability $p$. The capital changes from $W$ to $W' = W - fW + (1+b)fW = W(1+bf)$. The net profit is $bfW$.\n2.  **Loss**: This occurs with probability $q = 1-p$. The invested amount $fW$ is lost. The capital changes from $W$ to $W' = W - fW = W(1-f)$.\n\nThe goal of the strategy is to maximize the expected logarithmic growth of the capital. The growth factor in a single trade is $W'/W$. We want to maximize the expected value of the natural logarithm of this growth factor, which is called the growth rate, $g(f)$.\n\nThe expected growth rate is given by:\n$$g(f) = E[\\ln(W'/W)] = p \\ln(1+bf) + (1-p) \\ln(1-f)$$\n\nTo find the optimal fraction $f^*$ that maximizes this function, we take the derivative of $g(f)$ with respect to $f$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = \\frac{d}{df} [p \\ln(1+bf) + (1-p) \\ln(1-f)]$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+bf} \\cdot b + (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-f} \\cdot (-1)$$\n$$\\frac{dg}{df} = \\frac{pb}{1+bf} - \\frac{1-p}{1-f}$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for the optimal fraction $f = f^*$:\n$$\\frac{pb}{1+bf^*} - \\frac{1-p}{1-f^*} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{pb}{1+bf^*} = \\frac{1-p}{1-f^*}$$\n\nThis equation defines the optimal fraction $f^*$, often known as the Kelly criterion.

We can cross-multiply:\n$$0.9 \\cdot (2p) = 1.2 \\cdot (1-p)$$\n$$1.8p = 1.2 - 1.2p$$\n\nNow, we gather all terms involving $p$ on one side of the equation:\n$$1.8p + 1.2p = 1.2$$\n$$3.0p = 1.2$$\n\nFinally, we solve for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1.2}{3.0}$$\n$$p = 0.4$$\n\nThus, the underlying probability of a single trade being successful is 0.4.",
