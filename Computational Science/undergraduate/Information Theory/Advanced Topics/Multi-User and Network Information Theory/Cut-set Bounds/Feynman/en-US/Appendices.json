            "introduction": "The most fundamental application of the cut-set bound is to consider the \"source cut,\" which separates the source node from the rest of the network. This exercise explores this concept in a parallel relay network . By calculating the capacity of the source cut, you will establish a baseline upper bound on the data rate, representing the maximum amount of information the source can inject into the system. This practice is crucial for understanding that while factors like processing delays affect latency, they do not alter the fundamental throughput limit imposed by the outgoing link capacities.",

            "problem": "A communication network is designed to transmit a message from a source node $S$ to a destination node $D$. The network consists of three intermediate repeater nodes, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. The communication topology is established by the following six directed, noiseless digital links, each with a specified capacity measured in bits per symbol time:\n- A link from $S$ to $R_1$ with capacity $C_1$.\n- A link from $S$ to $R_2$ with capacity $C_2$.\n- A link from $S$ to $R_3$ with capacity $C_3$.\n- A link from $R_1$ to $D$ with capacity $C_4$.\n- A link from $R_2$ to $D$ with capacity $C_5$.\n- A link from $R_3$ to $D$ with capacity $C_6$.\n\nA key characteristic of this network is that each repeater node ($R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$) has a processing delay. Specifically, when a symbol arrives at a repeater node, there is a mandatory waiting period of one full symbol time before it can be processed and forwarded on its outgoing link. The source node $S$ and the destination node $D$ have zero processing delay.\n\nConsider a partition of the network nodes into two sets: one set containing only the source node $S$, and the other set containing all remaining nodes ($R_1, R_2, R_3, D$). Determine the maximum theoretical information rate, $R_{max}$, that can be transmitted from $S$ to $D$, as constrained by this specific partition. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the given capacities.",
            "solution": "We consider the cut that partitions the nodes into the set $\\{S\\}$ and the set $\\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},D\\}$. By the cut-set bound for directed networks with noiseless links, any achievable information rate $R$ from $S$ to $D$ must satisfy\n$$\nR \\leq \\sum_{(i,j):\\, i \\in \\{S\\},\\, j \\in \\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},D\\}} C_{ij},\n$$\nwhere $C_{ij}$ denotes the capacity of the link from node $i$ to node $j$.\n\nIn the given topology, the only links crossing this cut from $\\{S\\}$ to $\\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},D\\}$ are:\n- $S \\to R_{1}$ with capacity $C_{1}$,\n- $S \\to R_{2}$ with capacity $C_{2}$,\n- $S \\to R_{3}$ with capacity $C_{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the capacity of this cut is\n$$\nC_{\\text{cut}} = C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{3}.\n$$\n\nThe repeater processing delays impose a one-symbol-time latency at $R_{1},R_{2},R_{3}$, but they do not reduce the steady-state throughput across the cut; they only affect end-to-end latency. Hence, the maximum theoretical information rate across this partition is constrained by\n$$\nR_{\\max} \\leq C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{3}.\n$$\nSince the cut-set bound is tight as a constraint for this partition and the links are noiseless and parallel from $S$ to $\\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3}\\}$, the maximum rate allowed by this cut is\n$$\nR_{\\max} = C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{3}.\n$$",

            "introduction": "While the source cut provides an intuitive upper limit, the power of the cut-set bound lies in its applicability to *any* partition that separates the source from the destination. This exercise challenges you to apply the bound to a less obvious cut within a \"diamond\" relay network . Calculating the bound for this specified partition reinforces the methodical process of identifying and summing the capacities of only those links that cross from the source-side set to the destination-side set, honing your analytical precision.",

The network consists of four nodes: a source node (S), a destination node (D), and two intermediate relay nodes (R1 and R2). The source S intends to transmit a message to the destination D. Communication is only possible along specific directed paths, each modeled as an independent channel with a fixed capacity.\n\nThe network topology and channel capacities are as follows:\n- A link from S to R1 with capacity $C_{SR1}$.\n- A link from S to R2 with capacity $C_{SR2}$.\n- A link from R1 to D with capacity $C_{R1D}$.\n- A link from R2 to D with capacity $C_{R2D}$.\n\nThere are no other communication links between the nodes.\n\nAn essential technique for analyzing the limits of such networks involves partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets.
