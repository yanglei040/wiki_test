This exercise demonstrates the fundamental process of tracking a packet's transformation from source to sink. By tracing the linear combinations applied at each intermediate node, you will construct the global encoding vector, which is the essential algebraic key that describes the final received packet in terms of the original source data .",

            "problem": "In the field of information theory, linear network coding is a technique used to improve a network's throughput, efficiency, and scalability. Consider a simplified communication network consisting of four nodes: a source node S, two intermediate relay nodes R1 and R2, and a single sink node T.\n\nThe source node S generates two distinct data packets, $X_1$ and $X_2$. These packets are elements of a vector space, and all operations are linear. The data flows through the network according to the following protocol:\n\n1.  The source S transmits packet $X_1$ to the relay node R1.\n2.  The source S transmits packet $X_2$ to the relay node R2.\n3.  The relay node R1, upon receiving its packet, forwards it unaltered to the relay node R2.\n4.  The relay node R2 creates an output packet for the sink node T by performing a linear combination of the two packets it has received. The packet originating from the source S (which is $X_2$) is scaled by a factor $\\alpha$, and the packet originating from the relay R1 (which is $X_1$) is scaled by a factor $\\beta$. The resulting two scaled packets are then summed together to form the single packet that is transmitted from R2 to T.\n5.  The sink node T receives only this single packet from R2.\n\nThe final packet received at the sink T, denoted $Y_T$, can be written as a unique linear combination of the original source packets, in the form $Y_T = g_1 X_1 + g_2 X_2$. The vector $\\mathbf{g} = [g_1, g_2]$ is defined as the global encoding vector for the packet $Y_T$.\n\nDetermine the global encoding vector $\\mathbf{g}$ in terms of the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.",
            "solution": "We model each transmitted packet as a linear combination of the source packets $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ with corresponding global encoding vector. Let the standard basis vectors associated with $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ be\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nBy the protocol:\n- S to R1 carries $X_{1}$ unaltered, so its global encoding vector is $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$.\n- S to R2 carries $X_{2}$ unaltered, so its global encoding vector is $\\mathbf{e}_{2}$.\n- R1 forwards its packet unaltered to R2, so the packet from R1 to R2 still has global encoding vector $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$.\n\nAt R2, the outgoing packet to T is a linear combination with local coefficients $\\beta$ for the packet from R1 (which corresponds to $X_{1}$) and $\\alpha$ for the packet from S (which corresponds to $X_{2}$). Therefore, the outgoing packet’s global encoding vector is the linear combination of the incoming global vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g} \\;=\\; \\beta\\,\\mathbf{e}_{1} \\;+\\; \\alpha\\,\\mathbf{e}_{2}\n\\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\\beta  \\alpha\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nEquivalently, the received symbol at T is\n$$\nY_{T} \\;=\\; \\beta X_{1} \\;+\\; \\alpha X_{2},\n$$\nso $g_{1} = \\beta$ and $g_{2} = \\alpha$, as required by the definition $Y_{T} = g_{1}X_{1} + g_{2}X_{2}$.",

            "introduction": "Once a set of encoded packets reaches its destination, the receiver must reverse the process to recover the original information. This practice puts you in the role of the decoder, tasked with solving for the source data given a set of received packets and their corresponding global encoding vectors .

            "problem": "In a distributed environmental monitoring system, two remote sensors provide readings, represented as data packets $X_1$ and $X_2$. These readings are elements of the finite mathematical system known as the Galois Field $GF(3)$, which consists of the integers $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ with all arithmetic operations performed modulo 3.\n\nThe sensor data is transmitted through a network that uses linear network coding. A central data aggregation hub receives two coded packets, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, which are linear combinations of the original sensor packets. The hub has received the packets with values $Y_1 = 0$ and $Y_2 = 1$.\n\nThrough the communication protocol, the hub knows that the received packet $Y_1$ was generated using the global encoding vector $g_1 = [1, 1]$, and the packet $Y_2$ was generated using the global encoding vector $g_2 = [1, 2]$. This means that the received packets are related to the source packets by the equations:\n$Y_1 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 1 \\cdot X_2$\n$Y_2 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 2 \\cdot X_2$\n\nYour task is to act as the decoder at the hub. Determine the original sensor readings $X_1$ and $X_2$. Present your answer as a row vector $[X_1, X_2]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to recover the original data packets $X_1$ and $X_2$ from the received encoded packets $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. We are given the linear relationships between them and that all calculations are performed in the Galois Field $GF(3)$.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nY_1 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 1 \\cdot X_2 \\\\\nY_2 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 2 \\cdot X_2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAll arithmetic is performed modulo 3. We are given the values of the received packets: $Y_1 = 0$ and $Y_2 = 1$. Substituting these into our system gives:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n0 = X_1 + X_2 \\pmod 3 \\\\\n1 = X_1 + 2X_2 \\pmod 3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis system of equations can be represented in matrix form as $Y = GX$, where $Y$ is the vector of received packets, $G$ is the matrix of encoding vectors, and $X$ is the vector of source packets.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $Y_1$ and $Y_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo solve for the source vector $X = \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, we need to find the inverse of the encoding matrix $G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$ in $GF(3)$. If an inverse $G^{-1}$ exists, we can compute $X$ as $X = G^{-1}Y$.\n\nThe inverse of a 2x2 matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of G, $\\det(G) = ad - bc$:\n$$\n\\det(G) = (1)(2) - (1)(1) = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nSince all operations are in $GF(3)$, the determinant is $1 \\pmod 3$. A non-zero determinant means the matrix is invertible.\n\nNext, we find the inverse of the determinant. In $GF(3)$, the multiplicative inverse of 1 is 1, since $1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. So, $(\\det(G))^{-1} = 1$.\n\nNow, we find the adjugate of G, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\text{adj}(G) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to express the negative values in terms of elements of $GF(3)=\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. In modulo 3 arithmetic, $-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. So, the adjugate matrix becomes:\n$$\n\\text{adj}(G) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2 \\\\ 2  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow we can find the inverse matrix $G^{-1} = (\\det(G))^{-1} \\cdot \\text{adj}(G)$:\n$$\nG^{-1} = 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2 \\\\ 2  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2 \\\\ 2  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFinally, we can find the original packets $X_1$ and $X_2$ by multiplying $G^{-1}$ with the received packet vector $Y$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix} = G^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2 \\\\ 2  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nPerforming the matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$\nX_1 = (2 \\cdot 0) + (2 \\cdot 1) = 0 + 2 = 2\n$$\n$$\nX_2 = (2 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\n$$\nAll calculations are implicitly modulo 3. The results $X_1=2$ and $X_2=1$ are already in $GF(3)$.\n\nSo, the original sensor readings were $X_1 = 2$ and $X_2 = 1$.\nWe can check our answer:\n$Y_1 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 1 \\cdot X_2 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Correct.\n$Y_2 = 1 \\cdot X_1 + 2 \\cdot X_2 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Correct.\n\nThe result is the row vector $[X_1, X_2] = [2, 1]$.",
