            "problem": "In the field of multi-user information theory, Marton's coding scheme provides an achievable rate region for sending private messages to two different users over a Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channel (DM-BC). A DM-BC is defined by a channel input alphabet $\\mathcal{X}$, two output alphabets $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $\\mathcal{Y}_2$, and a conditional probability distribution $p(y_1, y_2|x)$.\n\nThe standard Marton inner bound states that any rate pair $(R_1, R_2)$ for private messages is achievable if it satisfies the following inequalities for some choice of auxiliary random variables $U_1, U_2$ and a joint distribution $p(u_1)p(u_2)p(x|u_1, u_2)$:\n$$R_1 \\le I(U_1; Y_1)$$\n$$R_2 \\le I(U_2; Y_2)$$\n$$R_1 + R_2 \\le I(U_1; Y_1) + I(U_2; Y_2) - I(U_1; U_2)$$\nThe full Marton region is the convex hull of the union of all such rate pairs over all valid choices of distributions.\n\nNow, consider a simplified coding strategy where the channel input $X$ is made statistically independent of the auxiliary variables $(U_1, U_2)$. In this scheme, the auxiliary variables $U_1$ and $U_2$ are still independent of each other. This means the overall joint distribution for the codebook generation has the form $p(u_1, u_2, x) = p(u_1)p(u_2)p(x)$.\n\nYour task is to determine the complete achievable rate region, denoted $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{simp}}$, under this specific simplification. Which of the following statements correctly describes this region?\n\nA. The region is only the origin, i.e., $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{simp}} = \\{(0, 0)\\}$.\n\nB. The region is a rectangle defined by the set of rate pairs $(R_1, R_2)$ such that $R_1 \\le \\max_{p(x)} I(X; Y_1)$ and $R_2 \\le \\max_{p(x)} I(X; Y_2)$.\n\nC. The region is the time-sharing region, defined as the convex hull of the points $(C_1, 0)$ and $(0, C_2)$, where $C_1 = \\max_{p(x)} I(X; Y_1)$ and $C_2 = \\max_{p(x)} I(X; Y_2)$.\n\nD. The region remains unchanged from the full Marton inner bound; the simplification does not restrict the achievable rates.\n\nE. The region is defined by the sum-rate constraint $R_1 + R_2 \\le \\max_{p(x)} I(X; Y_1, Y_2)$.",
            "solution": "We start from the standard Marton inner bound stated in the problem: for some auxiliary random variables $U_{1},U_{2}$ and a joint distribution $p(u_{1})p(u_{2})p(x\\mid u_{1},u_{2})$, any achievable rate pair $(R_{1},R_{2})$ must satisfy\n$$\nR_{1} \\le I(U_{1};Y_{1}),\\quad R_{2} \\le I(U_{2};Y_{2}),\\quad R_{1}+R_{2} \\le I(U_{1};Y_{1})+I(U_{2};Y_{2})-I(U_{1};U_{2}).\n$$\nUnder the simplification specified in the problem, the codebook generation has the product form\n$$\np(u_{1},u_{2},x)=p(u_{1})p(u_{2})p(x),\n$$\nwhich enforces $(U_{1},U_{2})$ independent of $X$, and $U_{1}$ independent of $U_{2}$. The channel law is $p(y_{1},y_{2}\\mid x)$, and the joint distribution factors as\n$$\np(u_{1},u_{2},x,y_{1},y_{2})=p(u_{1})p(u_{2})p(x)p(y_{1},y_{2}\\mid x).\n$$\nWe now compute the key mutual informations appearing in the Marton inequalities.\n\nFirst, since $U_{1}$ is independent of $X$ and $(Y_{1},Y_{2})$ are generated from $X$ alone through the memoryless broadcast channel, $U_{1}$ is independent of $(Y_{1},Y_{2})$. Formally,\n$$\np(u_{1},y_{1})=\\sum_{u_{2}}\\sum_{x}\\sum_{y_{2}} p(u_{1})p(u_{2})p(x)p(y_{1},y_{2}\\mid x)\n= p(u_{1})\\sum_{x}\\left[p(x)\\sum_{y_{2}}p(y_{1},y_{2}\\mid x)\\right]=p(u_{1})p(y_{1}),\n$$\nwhich implies $I(U_{1};Y_{1})=0$. By the same argument,\n$$\nI(U_{2};Y_{2})=0.\n$$\nMoreover, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ are independent by assumption, so\n$$\nI(U_{1};U_{2})=0.\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the Marton inequalities yields\n$$\nR_{1} \\le 0,\\quad R_{2} \\le 0,\\quad R_{1}+R_{2} \\le 0.\n$$\nSince rates are nonnegative by definition, we conclude\n$$\nR_{1}=0,\\quad R_{2}=0.\n$$\nTherefore, the achievable region under this simplification is the singleton $\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nThis rules out the other options:\n- A rectangle with positive sides (option B) would require conveying information through $X$ correlated with the messages, which is impossible here because $X$ is independent of $(U_{1},U_{2})$ and hence of the messages under this scheme.\n- The time-sharing region (option C) also requires selecting $X$ distributions contingent on which user is being served; under $p(u_{1})p(u_{2})p(x)$ the input $X$ does not carry message-dependent information, so positive rates are not induced in the Marton bound used here.\n- Equality with the full Marton region (option D) is false because the full region relies on $X$ being a function of $(U_{1},U_{2})$; removing that dependence strictly reduces the region.\n- A sum-rate bound of the form $R_{1}+R_{2} \\le \\max_{p(x)} I(X;Y_{1},Y_{2})$ (option E) is a cut-set type outer bound, not the achievable region for this scheme; moreover, within this inner-bound formulation with independent $X$, the mutual informations controlling $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are zero.\n\nHence the correct description is that the region collapses to the origin.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-user Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channel (DM-BC) where a transmitter sends independent information to two separate receivers. The transmitter uses two independent binary inputs, $X_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $X_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, to encode the message for receiver 1 and receiver 2, respectively. The inputs are drawn from independent and uniform distributions, such that $P(X_1=i) = 0.5$ and $P(X_2=j) = 0.5$ for all $i, j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe channel is characterized by its outputs $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ which belong to the alphabet $\\{0, 1, e\\}$, where 'e' denotes an erasure. The channel's behavior is governed by a random state variable $S$ which is independent of the inputs. The state $S$ can take one of three values $\\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ with the following probabilities: $P(S=s_1) = 0.3$, $P(S=s_2) = 0.5$, and $P(S=s_3) = 0.2$. The channel outputs are determined by the inputs and the state as follows:\n- If $S=s_1$, then $Y_1 = X_1$ and $Y_2 = e$.\n- If $S=s_2$, then $Y_1 = e$ and $Y_2 = X_2$.\n- If $S=s_3$, then $Y_1 = X_1$ and $Y_2 = X_2$.\n\nAn achievable rate region for this channel can be found using a simplified version of Marton's coding framework, where the auxiliary random variables are set to be the channel inputs themselves, i.e., $U_1 = X_1$ and $U_2 = X_2$. Given that the inputs $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, this leads to an achievable rate region defined by the inequalities:\n$R_1 \\le I(X_1; Y_1)$\n$R_2 \\le I(X_2; Y_2)$\n\nDetermine the maximum achievable symmetric rate $R = R_1 = R_2$ for this channel. Express your answer in bits per channel use, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum achievable symmetric rate $R = R_1 = R_2$ for a given broadcast channel. The problem states that the achievable rates must satisfy the conditions $R_1 \\le I(X_1; Y_1)$ and $R_2 \\le I(X_2; Y_2)$. For a symmetric rate $R$, both conditions must hold, so we must have:\n$R \\le I(X_1; Y_1)$\n$R \\le I(X_2; Y_2)$\n\nThe maximum such $R$ is therefore the minimum of these two mutual information values:\n$$R = \\min(I(X_1; Y_1), I(X_2; Y_2))$$\nOur task is to compute these two mutual information terms. The inputs $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent and uniformly distributed Bernoulli random variables ($P(X_k=0)=P(X_k=1)=0.5$).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $I(X_1; Y_1)$**\n\nThe mutual information is defined as $I(X_1; Y_1) = H(Y_1) - H(Y_1|X_1)$. Let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, we find the conditional entropy $H(Y_1|X_1)$. This is the entropy of the output $Y_1$ when the input $X_1$ is known. Let's find the conditional probability distribution $p(y_1|x_1)$.\n- The event $Y_1 = X_1$ occurs if the channel state is $S=s_1$ or $S=s_3$. The probability of this is $P(S=s_1) + P(S=s_3) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5$.\n- The event $Y_1 = e$ (erasure) occurs if the channel state is $S=s_2$. The probability of this is $P(S=s_2) = 0.5$.\n- The event $Y_1 = 1-X_1$ (an error) never occurs.\nSo, for a given $x_1$, the output $Y_1$ is either $x_1$ with probability $0.5$ or 'e' with probability $0.5$.\nThe conditional entropy $H(Y_1|X_1=x_1)$ is the entropy of this distribution:\n$$H(Y_1|X_1=x_1) = -(0.5 \\log_2(0.5) + 0.5 \\log_2(0.5)) = - \\log_2(0.5) = 1 \\text{ bit}$$\nSince this value is the same for $X_1=0$ and $X_1=1$, the average conditional entropy is $H(Y_1|X_1) = 1$ bit.\n\nAlternatively, this channel from $X_1$ to $Y_1$ is a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) with erasure probability $p_e = P(S=s_2) = 0.5$. The information $I(X_1; Y_1)$ for a uniform input into a BEC is $1-p_e$. Let's verify this using the full formula.\n\nNext, we find the entropy of the output $H(Y_1)$. We need the marginal probability distribution $p(y_1)$.\n- $P(Y_1=e) = P(S=s_2) = 0.5$.\n- $P(Y_1=0) = P(Y_1=0|X_1=0)P(X_1=0) + P(Y_1=0|X_1=1)P(X_1=1)$. Since $P(Y_1=0|X_1=1)=0$, this is $P(Y_1=0) = P(Y_1=X_1|X_1=0)P(X_1=0) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25$.\n- $P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1|X_1=1)P(X_1=1) + P(Y_1=1|X_1=0)P(X_1=0)$. Since $P(Y_1=1|X_1=0)=0$, this is $P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=X_1|X_1=1)P(X_1=1) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25$.\nThe distribution of $Y_1$ is $(P(Y_1=0), P(Y_1=1), P(Y_1=e)) = (0.25, 0.25, 0.5)$.\nThe entropy is:\n$$H(Y_1) = -(0.25 \\log_2(0.25) + 0.25 \\log_2(0.25) + 0.5 \\log_2(0.5))$$\n$$H(Y_1) = -(2 \\times 0.25 \\times (-2) + 0.5 \\times (-1)) = -( -1 + (-0.5) ) = 1.5 \\text{ bits}$$\nNow, we can compute the mutual information:\n$$I(X_1; Y_1) = H(Y_1) - H(Y_1|X_1) = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 \\text{ bits}$$\nAs noted before, for a BEC with erasure probability $p_e=0.5$ and uniform input, the capacity is $1-p_e = 1-0.5=0.5$ bits.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $I(X_2; Y_2)$**\n\nThe calculation is symmetric. The channel from $X_2$ to $Y_2$ is also a BEC.\n- The event $Y_2 = X_2$ occurs if the channel state is $S=s_2$ or $S=s_3$. The probability is $P(S=s_2) + P(S=s_3) = 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7$.\n- The event $Y_2 = e$ (erasure) occurs if the channel state is $S=s_1$. The probability is $P(S=s_1) = 0.3$.\nThis corresponds to a BEC with erasure probability $p'_e = 0.3$.\nWith a uniform input $X_2$, the mutual information is:\n$$I(X_2; Y_2) = 1 - p'_e = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \\text{ bits}$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the maximum symmetric rate**\n\nThe maximum achievable symmetric rate is the minimum of the two individual rates:\n$$R = \\min(I(X_1; Y_1), I(X_2; Y_2)) = \\min(0.5, 0.7) = 0.5 \\text{ bits per channel use}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R = 0.5000 \\text{ bits per channel use}$$",
