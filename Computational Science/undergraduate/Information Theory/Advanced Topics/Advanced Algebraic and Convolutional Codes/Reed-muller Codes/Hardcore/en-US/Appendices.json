            "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a simple, robust communication protocol for a network of sensors. They decide to use a specific type of linear block code known as a first-order Reed-Muller (RM) code over two variables, denoted as $RM(1,2)$.\n\nIn this scheme, messages are represented by binary polynomials in $m=2$ variables, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, with a total degree of at most $r=1$. The coefficients of these polynomials form the binary message bits. A codeword is constructed by evaluating a given message polynomial at all possible binary input vectors $(x_1, x_2)$ in a fixed lexicographical order: $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,1)$. All arithmetic is performed in the finite field with two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$, where addition and multiplication are performed modulo 2 (i.e., $1+1=0$).\n\nThe performance of a block code is characterized by three fundamental parameters: $n$, the length of the resulting codewords; $k$, the number of independent bits in a message (also known as the dimension of the code); and $d$, the minimum Hamming distance of the code. The Hamming distance between two codewords is the number of positions at which their corresponding bits differ, and the minimum distance $d$ is the smallest Hamming distance found between any two distinct codewords in the code.\n\nDetermine the parameters $[n, k, d]$ for the $RM(1,2)$ code. Present your answer as a set of three integers in the order $[n, k, d]$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the parameters $[n, k, d]$ for the Reed-Muller code $RM(1,2)$. Let's determine each parameter step-by-step based on the provided definition.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the codeword length, $n$.**\n\nThe codeword is generated by evaluating a polynomial in $m=2$ variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$, over all possible binary input vectors. Since each variable can take a value from $\\{0, 1\\}$, the number of distinct input vectors $(x_1, x_2)$ is $2^m = 2^2 = 4$. The problem specifies these evaluation points are ordered as $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$.\n\nSince the polynomial is evaluated at each of these 4 points to produce a single bit of the codeword, the total length of any codeword is the number of evaluation points.\n$$n = 2^m = 2^2 = 4$$\nSo, the codeword length is $n=4$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the message length (dimension), $k$.**\n\nThe message is defined by the coefficients of the polynomials. The code is $RM(1,2)$, which means the polynomials have a maximum total degree of $r=1$ and are in $m=2$ variables. A general polynomial $P(x_1, x_2)$ with total degree at most 1 can be written as a linear combination of all monomials in $x_1, x_2$ with degree less than or equal to 1.\n\nThe monomials of degree 0 in two variables is the constant term: $1$.\nThe monomials of degree 1 in two variables are: $x_1, x_2$.\nThe monomial $x_1x_2$ has degree 2, and terms like $x_1^2$ have degree 2, so they are not included. (Note that in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $x^2=x$, but the degree is defined for the polynomial form).\n\nThus, the general form of the polynomial is:\n$$P(x_1, x_2) = a_0 \\cdot 1 + a_1 \\cdot x_1 + a_2 \\cdot x_2$$\nwhere the coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are binary values from $\\{0, 1\\}$. These coefficients represent the message bits. The number of such coefficients defines the dimension of the code, $k$. In this case, there are 3 coefficients.\nSo, the message length is $k=3$.\n\nIn general, for an $RM(r,m)$ code, the dimension $k$ is the number of monomials in $m$ variables of degree up to $r$, which is given by the formula:\n$$k = \\sum_{i=0}^{r} \\binom{m}{i}$$\nFor our case, $r=1$ and $m=2$:\n$$k = \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\binom{2}{i} = \\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} = 1 + 2 = 3$$\nThis confirms our result. A message is a vector $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$, and there are $2^k=2^3=8$ possible messages, which generate the 8 codewords of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum distance, $d$.**\n\nThe minimum distance $d$ of a linear code is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of any non-zero codeword. The Hamming weight of a codeword is the number of '1's it contains. A non-zero codeword is any codeword other than the all-zero codeword, which is generated by the zero message $(a_0, a_1, a_2) = (0,0,0)$.\n\nLet's find the weights of the codewords generated by the basis messages:\n- Message $(1,0,0) \\implies P(x_1, x_2) = 1$. The codeword is $(P(0,0), P(0,1), P(1,0), P(1,1)) = (1,1,1,1)$. The weight is 4.\n- Message $(0,1,0) \\implies P(x_1, x_2) = x_1$. The codeword is $(0,0,1,1)$. The weight is 2.\n- Message $(0,0,1) \\implies P(x_1, x_2) = x_2$. The codeword is $(0,1,0,1)$. The weight is 2.\n\nNow we check the weights of codewords generated by linear combinations of these basis messages (addition is XOR):\n- Message $(1,1,0) \\implies P=1+x_1$. Codeword is $(1,1,1,1)+(0,0,1,1) = (1,1,0,0)$. Weight is 2.\n- Message $(1,0,1) \\implies P=1+x_2$. Codeword is $(1,1,1,1)+(0,1,0,1) = (1,0,1,0)$. Weight is 2.\n- Message $(0,1,1) \\implies P=x_1+x_2$. Codeword is $(0,0,1,1)+(0,1,0,1) = (0,1,1,0)$. Weight is 2.\n- Message $(1,1,1) \\implies P=1+x_1+x_2$. Codeword is $(1,1,0,0)+(0,1,0,1) = (1,0,0,1)$. Weight is 2.\n\nThe non-zero codewords have weights of either 2 or 4. The minimum weight among all non-zero codewords is 2.\nTherefore, the minimum distance is $d=2$.\n\nThis is also consistent with the general formula for the minimum distance of an $RM(r,m)$ code, $d = 2^{m-r}$. For our case, $r=1$ and $m=2$:\n$$d = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2$$\n\nCombining our results, the parameters for the $RM(1,2)$ code are $n=4$, $k=3$, and $d=2$.",
