This exercise  considers a quantum system whose state is a simple statistical mixture of orthogonal basis states, which results in a diagonal density matrix. In this special case, the calculation directly mirrors the classical Shannon entropy, providing a clear bridge between classical and quantum information theory and building a solid computational foundation.",

            "problem": "A quantum system, known as a qutrit, can exist in one of three orthogonal basis states, denoted by $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$, and $|2\\rangle$. An experiment is designed to prepare a large ensemble of these qutrits. Due to imperfections in the preparation apparatus, the resulting state is not a pure state but a statistical mixture. The state of a randomly selected qutrit from the ensemble is described by a density matrix $\\rho$. Relative to the basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$, this density matrix is diagonal. Measurements reveal that there is a 50% probability of finding the qutrit in the state $|0\\rangle$, a 25% probability of finding it in the state $|1\\rangle$, and a 25% probability of finding it in the state $|2\\rangle$.\n\nThe uncertainty associated with this quantum state is quantified by the von Neumann entropy, $S(\\rho)$. For a system with density matrix $\\rho$, the von Neumann entropy is defined as $S(\\rho) = -\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho)$, where $\\operatorname{Tr}$ denotes the trace of the matrix and $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm function applied to the matrix.\n\nCalculate the von Neumann entropy of this qutrit system. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the natural logarithm.",

Here, the probabilities are $p_{0}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $p_{1}=\\frac{1}{4}$, and $p_{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, using the spectral decomposition, the entropy is\n$$\nS(\\rho)=-\\sum_{i=0}^{2}p_{i}\\ln p_{i}=-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\frac{1}{4}\\right).\n$$\nUsing $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\ln 2$ and $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)=-\\ln 4=-2\\ln 2$, we have\n$$\nS(\\rho)=-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(-\\ln 2)+\\frac{1}{4}(-2\\ln 2)+\\frac{1}{4}(-2\\ln 2)\\right)\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\ln 2+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln 2+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln 2\n=\\frac{3}{2}\\ln 2.\n$$\nThus, the von Neumann entropy is $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln 2$.",
