This exercise serves as a crucial benchmark, demonstrating that when the chosen quantum states are orthogonal, the Holevo bound simplifies to the classical Shannon entropy of the source. By working through this problem, you will see how the quantum limit aligns perfectly with the classical limit under these ideal conditions. ",
