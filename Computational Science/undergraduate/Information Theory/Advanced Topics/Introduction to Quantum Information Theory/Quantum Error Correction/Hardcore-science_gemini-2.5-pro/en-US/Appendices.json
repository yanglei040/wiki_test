            "problem": "In a prototype quantum computer, a logical qubit is encoded using the 3-qubit phase-flip code to protect it from environmental noise. A phase-flip error on a specific qubit $i$ is described by the application of the Pauli-Z operator, denoted as $Z_i$. The Pauli operators for a single qubit are fundamental, and their anti-commutation relation is key to error detection. Specifically, for any given qubit $i$, the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators for that qubit anti-commute: $X_i Z_i = -Z_i X_i$. In contrast, Pauli operators acting on different qubits commute. For example, $X_i Z_j = Z_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$, and $X_i X_j = X_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe 3-qubit phase-flip code is defined by two stabilizer operators: $S_1 = X_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes I_3$ and $S_2 = I_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes X_3$. Here, $X_k$ is the Pauli-X operator acting on qubit $k$, and $I_k$ is the identity operator on qubit $k$. Any valid encoded state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a simultaneous eigenvector of both stabilizers with an eigenvalue of $+1$, i.e., $S_j |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for $j=1,2$.\n\nIf an error, represented by an operator $E$, occurs, the state becomes $|\\psi_{err}\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle$. To detect the error, the eigenvalues of the stabilizers are measured. The result of this measurement is a syndrome, which is an ordered pair of classical bits $(m_1, m_2)$. The outcome $m_j$ is 0 if the measured eigenvalue of $S_j$ is $+1$, and $m_j$ is 1 if the eigenvalue is $-1$.\n\nSuppose an encoded state is subjected to noise, and it is determined that exactly one qubit has undergone a phase-flip error. A subsequent syndrome measurement yields the result $(m_1, m_2) = (1, 0)$.\n\nDetermine the index $k$ (where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$) of the qubit on which the phase-flip error occurred.",
            "solution": "We use the stabilizer formalism. The code space is stabilized by $S_{1}=X_{1}\\otimes X_{2}\\otimes I_{3}$ and $S_{2}=I_{1}\\otimes X_{2}\\otimes X_{3}$, so any encoded state satisfies $S_{j}\\,|\\psi\\rangle=|\\psi\\rangle$ for $j=1,2$.\n\nSuppose a single-qubit phase-flip error $E=Z_{k}$ occurs, so the errored state is $|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle=Z_{k}|\\psi\\rangle$. The measured eigenvalue of $S_{j}$ on $|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle$ is determined by whether $S_{j}$ commutes or anticommutes with $Z_{k}$.

Hence $(m_{1},m_{2})=(1,0)$.\n- For $k=2$: $S_{1}$ anticommutes with $Z_{2}$ (due to $X_{2}$), and $S_{2}$ also anticommutes with $Z_{2}$ (due to $X_{2}$). Hence $(m_{1},m_{2})=(1,1)$.\n- For $k=3$: $S_{1}$ commutes with $Z_{3}$ (acts as $I_{3}$ on qubit $3$), and $S_{2}$ anticommutes with $Z_{3}$ (due to $X_{3}$).

            "introduction": "A quantum error correction code is only useful if it reduces the probability of error, and to assess a code's effectiveness, we must analyze its performance under a realistic noise model. This advanced exercise challenges you to move beyond the mechanics of correction to the quantitative evaluation of a code's performance by calculating the logical error rate. This metric represents the probability that an error occurs and the correction procedure fails, which is a crucial step in designing fault-tolerant quantum computers .",

            "problem": "A simple quantum error correcting code, the 3-qubit bit-flip code, is designed to protect a single logical qubit from errors. The logical basis states are defined as $|\\bar{0}\\rangle = |000\\rangle$ and $|\\bar{1}\\rangle = |111\\rangle$.\n\nSuppose a quantum state, initially prepared in the logical state $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$, is transmitted through a noisy environment. The environment is modeled as a symmetric depolarizing channel that acts independently on each of the three physical qubits. The action of this channel on a single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ is described by the map:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = (1-p)\\rho + \\frac{p}{3}(X\\rho X + Y\\rho Y + Z\\rho Z)\n$$\nHere, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are the standard Pauli matrices, and $p$ is the total probability that an error occurs on a single qubit.\n\nAfter passing through the channel, a correction procedure is applied. The correction mechanism for this code is based on a majority vote logic. It effectively determines if a single qubit's state has been flipped relative to the other two and, if so, applies a bit-flip operation to that single qubit to restore the original state.\n\nA logical error occurs if the final state of the 3-qubit system, after the error and subsequent correction attempt, is the orthogonal logical state $|\\bar{1}\\rangle$.\n\nAssuming the error probability $p$ is much smaller than 1 (i.e., $p \\ll 1$), determine the leading-order expression for the logical error probability, $P_L$, in terms of $p$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the leading-order logical error probability $P_L$ for the 3-qubit bit-flip code under a symmetric depolarizing channel. The initial state is $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = |\\bar{0}\\rangle = |000\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, let's interpret the action of the symmetric depolarizing channel. The evolution $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = (1-p)\\rho + \\frac{p}{3}(X\\rho X + Y\\rho Y + Z\\rho Z)$ can be understood as a stochastic process where, for each qubit independently:\n- With probability $1-p$, no error occurs (the identity operator $I$ is applied).\n- With probability $p/3$, a bit-flip error $X$ occurs.\n- With probability $p/3$, a $Y$ error occurs. Since $Y=iXZ$, this error includes both a bit-flip and a phase-flip.\n- With probability $p/3$, a phase-flip error $Z$ occurs.\n\nThe correction procedure for the 3-qubit bit-flip code is designed to correct single bit-flip errors. It functions based on a majority vote. If we start in the state $|000\\rangle$, the basis states of the three qubits are inspected.\n- If zero or one qubit is in the state $|1\\rangle$, the correction procedure will result in the state $|000\\rangle$ (either by doing nothing or flipping the single $|1\\rangle$ back to $|0\\rangle$). This is a successful correction or no error.\n- If two or three qubits are in the state $|1\\rangle$, the correction procedure will result in the state $|111\\rangle$. If the initial state was $|000\\rangle$, this constitutes a logical error.\n\nThe key is to identify which error operators cause a state to have two or three qubits flipped. An error operator $P \\in \\{I, X, Y, Z\\}$ applied to a qubit in state $|0\\rangle$ will result in a state proportional to $|1\\rangle$ if and only if $P$ is $X$ or $Y$. The operators $I$ and $Z$ leave the $|0\\rangle$ state as $|0\\rangle$ (up to a phase for $Z$, which doesn't affect the bit value). We can thus say that the \"bit-flip weight\" of an error is the number of $X$ or $Y$ Paulis in the 3-qubit error operator string. A logical error occurs if the bit-flip weight of the total applied error is 2 or 3.\n\nWe are looking for the leading-order expression for the logical error probability $P_L$ for $p \\ll 1$. This means we need to find the error events that cause a logical failure and have the lowest power of $p$ in their probability.\n\nLet's analyze the errors by the number of qubits affected:\n\n**Case 1: Single-qubit errors (Order $p$)**\nAn error occurs on one qubit, and no error occurs on the other two. The probability of such an event is proportional to $p(1-p)^2 \\approx p$.\n- Error $X \\otimes I \\otimes I$ (and its 2 permutations): The state becomes $|100\\rangle$. The bit-flip weight is 1. The correction procedure flips the first qubit back to $|0\\rangle$, resulting in $|000\\rangle$. No logical error.\n- Error $Y \\otimes I \\otimes I$ (and its 2 permutations): The state becomes $i|100\\rangle$. The bit-flip weight is 1. The correction procedure flips the first qubit, resulting in $i|000\\rangle$. No logical error.\n- Error $Z \\otimes I \\otimes I$ (and its 2 permutations): The state becomes $|000\\rangle$. The bit-flip weight is 0. No correction is applied. No logical error.\nThus, no single-qubit error can cause a logical failure.\n\n**Case 2: Two-qubit errors (Order $p^2$)**\nErrors occur on two qubits, and no error on the third. The probability of such an event is proportional to $p^2(1-p) \\approx p^2$. These are the most likely candidates for the leading-order contribution to $P_L$. A logical error occurs if the combined bit-flip weight of the two Pauli errors is 2. Let the two error operators be $P_1$ and $P_2$. Both must be from $\\{X, Y\\}$.\n\nThe possible 2-qubit errors leading to a logical failure are:\n- **Two $X$ errors**: An error of the form $X_i X_j I_k$. For example, $X \\otimes X \\otimes I$ applied to $|000\\rangle$ gives $|110\\rangle$. This has bit-flip weight 2. The correction procedure sees two '1's and flips the '0', resulting in $|111\\rangle$. This is a logical error. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose the two qubits that get an $X$ error.\nThe probability for this type of error is:\n$P_{XX} = \\binom{3}{2} \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^2 (1-p) = 3 \\frac{p^2}{9} (1-p) = \\frac{p^2}{3}(1-p)$.\n\n- **Two $Y$ errors**: An error of the form $Y_i Y_j I_k$. For example, $Y \\otimes Y \\otimes I$ applied to $|000\\rangle$ gives $(iXZ)(iXZ)|00\\rangle|0\\rangle = -X_1 X_2 |000\\rangle = -|110\\rangle$. This also has bit-flip weight 2 and results in a logical error. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways for this to happen.\nThe probability for this type of error is:\n$P_{YY} = \\binom{3}{2} \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^2 (1-p) = 3 \\frac{p^2}{9} (1-p) = \\frac{p^2}{3}(1-p)$.\n\n- **One $X$ and one $Y$ error**: An error of the form $X_i Y_j I_k$. For example, $X \\otimes Y \\otimes I$ applied to $|000\\rangle$ gives $X_1 (iX_2 Z_2)|000\\rangle = i|110\\rangle$. This has bit-flip weight 2 and results in a logical error. The number of ways to choose this error is: select 2 qubits out of 3 ($\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways), and then assign $X$ to one and $Y$ to the other (2 ways). So there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ such error configurations.\nThe probability for this type of error is:\n$P_{XY} = \\binom{3}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^2 (1-p) = 6 \\frac{p^2}{9} (1-p) = \\frac{2p^2}{3}(1-p)$.\n\nOther 2-qubit errors like $XZ$, $YZ$, or $ZZ$ have a total bit-flip weight of 1 or 0, so they are either corrected or do not trigger a correction, and do not cause a logical failure.\n\nThe total probability of logical error due to 2-qubit events is the sum of these probabilities:\n$P_{L,2} = P_{XX} + P_{YY} + P_{XY} = \\frac{p^2}{3}(1-p) + \\frac{p^2}{3}(1-p) + \\frac{2p^2}{3}(1-p) = \\frac{4p^2}{3}(1-p) = \\frac{4}{3}p^2 - \\frac{4}{3}p^3$.\n\n**Case 3: Three-qubit errors (Order $p^3$)**\nErrors occur on all three qubits. The probability of such an event is proportional to $p^3$. Any combination of three Pauli operators with a total bit-flip weight of 2 or 3 will cause a logical failure. For instance, $X \\otimes X \\otimes Z$ has bit-flip weight 2, and $X \\otimes Y \\otimes Z$ also has weight 2. The error $X \\otimes X \\otimes X$ has weight 3. The probability of any of these events will be of order $p^3$.\n\nSince we are interested in the leading-order expression for $p \\ll 1$, we only need to keep the term with the lowest power of $p$. The logical error probability is given by:\n$P_L = P_{L,2} + P_{L,3} + \\dots = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}p^2 - \\frac{4}{3}p^3\\right) + O(p^3)$\nThe lowest power of $p$ is $p^2$. Thus, the leading-order term comes from the two-qubit error analysis.\nFor $p \\ll 1$, we can approximate $1-p \\approx 1$. The leading-order term of $P_{L,2}$ is $\\frac{4}{3}p^2$.\n\nThe leading-order expression for the logical error probability is therefore:\n$P_L \\approx \\frac{4}{3}p^2$.",
