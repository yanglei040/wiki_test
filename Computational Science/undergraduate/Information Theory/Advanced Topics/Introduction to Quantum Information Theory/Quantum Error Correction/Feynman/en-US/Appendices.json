            "introduction": "A key challenge in quantum computing is that errors do not always produce states that are perfectly distinguishable (orthogonal) from the original, uncorrupted state. This makes simple measurement an ineffective way to detect errors, as the act of measuring can collapse the state. This first exercise  provides a quantitative look at this fundamental issue by having you calculate the \"overlap\" between an initial state and its errored counterparts, building a foundational understanding of why sophisticated quantum error correction schemes are necessary.",

Consider a single qubit in a general pure state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are real, positive coefficients satisfying the normalization condition $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = 1$. The computational basis states are $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. This qubit is subjected to two distinct types of errors: a bit-flip error, described by the Pauli-X operator $X$, and a phase-flip error, described by the Pauli-Z operator $Z$. The non-orthogonality between the original state and an error state complicates error detection. A measure of this non-orthogonality for a given error operation $U$ is the squared magnitude of the inner product, $|\\langle\\psi|U|\\psi\\rangle|^2$.\n\nDetermine an expression for the product of these non-orthogonality measures for the bit-flip and phase-flip errors.

A central principle of these codes is the relationship between the number of physical qubits ($n$), the number of independent stabilizer constraints ($r$), and the number of logical qubits ($k$) that can be encoded. This practice  focuses on this core trade-off, allowing you to calculate the information-carrying capacity of a given code, a crucial first step in designing and understanding any quantum error correction system.",

This code uses a block of 7 physical qubits. The logical information is encoded in a special subspace, called the codespace, which is defined by a set of measurement operators. The system is designed such that the codespace consists of all quantum states that are simultaneously eigenvectors with eigenvalue +1 for a set of 4 independent and mutually commuting stabilizer generators. Each generator is an operator acting on the 7-qubit Hilbert space. Determine the number of logical qubits that can be encoded using this scheme.",

            "introduction": "Once a quantum state is encoded, how do we actively detect and identify errors? This is achieved through syndrome measurement, a process that extracts information about the error without disturbing the encoded logical state. In this practice , you will act as a quantum detective, using the commutation properties of Pauli operators to interpret a measured syndrome and pinpoint the exact location of a phase-flip error within a 3-qubit code, illustrating the central mechanism of active error correction.",

            "problem": "In a prototype quantum computer, a logical qubit is encoded using the 3-qubit phase-flip code to protect it from environmental noise. A phase-flip error on a specific qubit $i$ is described by the application of the Pauli-Z operator, denoted as $Z_i$. The Pauli operators for a single qubit are fundamental, and their anti-commutation relation is key to error detection. Specifically, for any given qubit $i$, the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators for that qubit anti-commute: $X_i Z_i = -Z_i X_i$. In contrast, Pauli operators acting on different qubits commute. For example, $X_i Z_j = Z_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$, and $X_i X_j = X_j X_i$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe 3-qubit phase-flip code is defined by two stabilizer operators: $S_1 = X_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes I_3$ and $S_2 = I_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes X_3$. Here, $X_k$ is the Pauli-X operator acting on qubit $k$, and $I_k$ is the identity operator on qubit $k$. Any valid encoded state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a simultaneous eigenvector of both stabilizers with an eigenvalue of $+1$, i.e., $S_j |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for $j=1,2$.\n\nIf an error, represented by an operator $E$, occurs, the state becomes $|\\psi_{err}\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle$. To detect the error, the eigenvalues of the stabilizers are measured. The result of this measurement is a syndrome, which is an ordered pair of classical bits $(m_1, m_2)$. The outcome $m_j$ is 0 if the measured eigenvalue of $S_j$ is $+1$, and $m_j$ is 1 if the eigenvalue is $-1$.\n\nSuppose an encoded state is subjected to noise, and it is determined that exactly one qubit has undergone a phase-flip error. A subsequent syndrome measurement yields the result $(m_1, m_2) = (1, 0)$.\n\nDetermine the index $k$ (where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$) of the qubit on which the phase-flip error occurred.",
            "solution": "We use the stabilizer formalism. The code space is stabilized by $S_{1}=X_{1}\\otimes X_{2}\\otimes I_{3}$ and $S_{2}=I_{1}\\otimes X_{2}\\otimes X_{3}$, so any encoded state satisfies $S_{j}\\,|\\psi\\rangle=|\\psi\\rangle$ for $j=1,2$.\n\nSuppose a single-qubit phase-flip error $E=Z_{k}$ occurs, so the errored state is $|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle=Z_{k}|\\psi\\rangle$. The measured eigenvalue of $S_{j}$ on $|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle$ is determined by whether $S_{j}$ commutes or anticommutes with $Z_{k}$. Using the relations\n$$\nX_{i}Z_{i}=-Z_{i}X_{i},\\quad X_{i}Z_{j}=Z_{j}X_{i}\\ \\text{for}\\ i\\neq j,\n$$\nwe compute\n$$\nS_{j}\\,|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle=S_{j}Z_{k}|\\psi\\rangle=\\begin{cases}\n+Z_{k}S_{j}|\\psi\\rangle=+|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle,& \\text{if }[S_{j},Z_{k}]=0,\\\\\n-Z_{k}S_{j}|\\psi\\rangle=-|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle,& \\text{if }\\{S_{j},Z_{k}\\}=0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThus, the syndrome bit $m_{j}$ equals $0$ if $S_{j}$ commutes with $Z_{k}$ and equals $1$ if $S_{j}$ anticommutes with $Z_{k}$.\n\nEvaluate the commutation for each $k$:\n- For $k=1$: $S_{1}=X_{1}X_{2}I_{3}$ anticommutes with $Z_{1}$ because of $X_{1}Z_{1}=-Z_{1}X_{1}$ on qubit $1$, while $S_{2}=I_{1}X_{2}X_{3}$ commutes with $Z_{1}$ (acts on different qubits). Hence $(m_{1},m_{2})=(1,0)$.\n- For $k=2$: $S_{1}$ anticommutes with $Z_{2}$ (due to $X_{2}$), and $S_{2}$ also anticommutes with $Z_{2}$ (due to $X_{2}$). Hence $(m_{1},m_{2})=(1,1)$.\n- For $k=3$: $S_{1}$ commutes with $Z_{3}$ (acts as $I_{3}$ on qubit $3$), and $S_{2}$ anticommutes with $Z_{3}$ (due to $X_{3}$).
