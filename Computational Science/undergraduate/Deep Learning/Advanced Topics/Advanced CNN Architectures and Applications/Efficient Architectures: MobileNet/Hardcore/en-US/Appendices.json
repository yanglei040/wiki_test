Work from the following fundamental base and core definitions and do not assume any specialized formulas beyond these principles.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- A Multiply–Accumulate Operation (MAC) is the basic unit of arithmetic combining one multiplication and one addition. For the purposes of this task, count one MAC per weight-times-input contribution to an output.\n- A dense (fully connected) layer mapping an input vector of length $u$ to an output vector of length $v$ uses a weight matrix of size $u \\times v$, thus $u \\cdot v$ MACs per inference for one input vector.\n- A standard two-dimensional convolution with spatial kernel of size $k \\times k$, with $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels and $C_{\\text{out}}$ output channels, applied at spatial resolution $H \\times W$ (stride $1$, same padding) uses $H \\cdot W \\cdot k \\cdot k \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}$ MACs.\n- A depthwise convolution with spatial kernel size $k \\times k$ and $C$ channels applied at resolution $H \\times W$ uses $H \\cdot W \\cdot k \\cdot k \\cdot C$ MACs, because each channel is convolved independently.\n- A $1 \\times 1$ convolution with $C_{\\text{in}}$ inputs and $C_{\\text{out}}$ outputs applied at resolution $H \\times W$ uses $H \\cdot W \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}$ MACs.\n- A Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block for a tensor with $C$ channels consists of: global average pooling to produce a vector of length $C$ (ignore its cost for this problem), followed by two dense layers: a reduction from $C$ to $C/r$ channels, then an expansion from $C/r$ back to $C$ channels, where $r$ is a positive integer reduction ratio. Ignore costs from bias additions, nonlinearities such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and the final sigmoid, and count only MACs from the two dense layers. Assume $C/r$ is an integer in all test cases below.\n\nMobileNetV2 inverted residual block model to analyze:\n- Consider a MobileNetV2 block with stride $1$ whose input and output channel counts are both $C$, using an expansion factor $t$. The block consists of: a $1 \\times 1$ pointwise convolution expanding from $C$ to $tC$, a $3 \\times 3$ depthwise convolution on $tC$ channels, and a $1 \\times 1$ pointwise projection convolution from $tC$ back to $C$. The spatial resolution is $H \\times W$ throughout the block. Ignore any skip connection cost and any non-convolutional operations.\n\nTasks:\n1. From the fundamental base above, derive an expression for the total baseline MACs of the MobileNetV2 block (without SE) as a function of $H$, $W$, $C$, $t$, and kernel size $k = 3$. Then, using the same principles, derive the additional MACs introduced by inserting an SE module operating on the block’s $C$-channel output with reduction ratio $r$.\n2.

Express all accuracy values as decimals in $[0,1]$. No physical units or angles are involved. Your final outputs for each test case should be two floats: [accuracy_gain_per_megaMAC, overhead_fraction]. Round both floats to nine decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, you are given $(H, W, C, t, r, A_{\\text{base}}, A_{\\text{SE}})$, with all quantities integers except accuracies:\n- Case $1$: $H = 56$, $W = 56$, $C = 24$, $t = 6$, $r = 1$, $A_{\\text{base}} = 0.720$, $A_{\\text{SE}} = 0.732$.\n- Case $2$: $H = 56$, $W = 56$, $C = 24$, $t = 6$, $r = 8$, $A_{\\text{base}} = 0.720$, $A_{\\text{SE}} = 0.724$.\n- Case $3$: $H = 28$, $W = 28$, $C = 32$, $t = 6$, $r = 8$, $A_{\\text{base}} = 0.720$, $A_{\\text{SE}} = 0.723$.\n- Case $4$: $H = 14$, $W = 14$, $C = 96$, $t = 6$, $r = 16$, $A_{\\text{base}} = 0.720$, $A_{\\text{SE}} = 0.728$.\n- Case $5$: $H = 7$, $W = 7$, $C = 320$, $t = 6$, $r = 32$, $A_{\\text{base}} = 0.720$, $A_{\\text{SE}} = 0.726$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a list of results for the five cases, where each result is a two-element list in the order [accuracy_gain_per_megaMAC, overhead_fraction].

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective task.

The unit of computational cost is the Multiply-Accumulate operation (MAC).\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the baseline computational cost of a MobileNetV2 inverted residual block without an SE module. The block, as defined, operates at a constant spatial resolution of $H \\times W$ and consists of three convolutional layers.\n\n1.  **Pointwise Expansion Convolution**: This is a $1 \\times 1$ convolution that expands the number of channels from $C$ to $tC$.

The SE module is applied to the output of the block, which has $C$ channels. After global average pooling (whose cost is ignored), the SE module consists of two dense (fully connected) layers.\n\n1.  **Reduction Dense Layer**: This layer reduces the channel vector length from $C$ to $C/r$, where $r$ is the reduction ratio. The cost is the product of the input and output vector lengths.\n    $$ \\text{MACs}_{\\text{SE},1} = C \\cdot (C/r) = \\frac{C^2}{r} $$\n\n2.  **Expansion Dense Layer**: This layer expands the vector length from $C/r$ back to $C$.\n    $$ \\text{MACs}_{\\text{SE},2} = (C/r) \\cdot C = \\frac{C^2}{r} $$\n\nThe total additional MACs from the SE module is the sum of the costs of these two dense layers.\n$$ \\text{MACs}_{\\text{add}} = \\text{MACs}_{\\text{SE},1} + \\text{MACs}_{\\text{SE},2} = \\frac{C^2}{r} + \\frac{C^2}{r} = \\frac{2C^2}{r} $$\n\nWith these derived expressions, we can compute the required metrics for each test case.\n\nThe first metric is the **overhead fraction**, which is the ratio of the additional MACs to the baseline MACs.\n$$ \\text{Overhead Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{MACs}_{\\text{add}}}{\\text{MACs}_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{2C^2/r}{H \\cdot W \\cdot t \\cdot C \\cdot (2C + 9)} = \\frac{2C}{r \\cdot H \\cdot W \\cdot t \\cdot (2C + 9)} $$\n\nThe second metric is the **accuracy gain per added mega-MAC**. This quantifies the efficiency of the added computation in terms of accuracy improvement. It is defined as the difference in accuracy ($A_{\\text{SE}} - A_{\\text{base}}$) divided by the additional MACs converted to millions of MACs (mega-MACs).\n$$ \\text{Accuracy Gain per Mega-MAC} = \\frac{A_{\\text{SE}} - A_{\\text{base}}}{\\text{MACs}_{\\text{add}} / 10^6} $$\n\nThese formulas will now be implemented to process the provided test suite.

Maximizing $A(\\alpha, \\rho)$ is equivalent to minimizing $-A(\\alpha, \\rho)$, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing the function $F(\\alpha, \\rho) = 0.10(1-\\alpha)^{2} + 0.10(1-\\rho)^{2}$, as the $0.80$ term is a constant offset.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha, \\rho, \\lambda) = 0.10(1-\\alpha)^{2} + 0.10(1-\\rho)^{2} - \\lambda \\left(\\alpha \\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the critical points, we set the gradient of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $\\alpha$, $\\rho$, and $\\lambda$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\alpha} = -0.20(1-\\alpha) - \\lambda \\rho = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\rho} = -0.20(1-\\rho) - \\lambda \\alpha = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -\\left(\\alpha \\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\nFrom equation (3), we recover our constraint $\\alpha \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom (1) and (2), we can express $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{0.20(1-\\alpha)}{\\rho}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{0.20(1-\\rho)}{\\alpha}\n$$\nEquating these expressions for $\\lambda$ (we can confirm $\\lambda \\neq 0$, otherwise $\\alpha=1$ and $\\rho=1$, which violates the constraint):\n$$\n\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\rho} = \\frac{1-\\rho}{\\alpha}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha(1-\\alpha) = \\rho(1-\\rho)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha - \\alpha^{2} = \\rho - \\rho^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha - \\rho = \\alpha^{2} - \\rho^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha - \\rho = (\\alpha - \\rho)(\\alpha + \\rho)\n$$\nThis equation yields two possibilities: $\\alpha - \\rho = 0$ or, if $\\alpha \\neq \\rho$, we can divide by $(\\alpha - \\rho)$ to get $\\alpha + \\rho = 1$.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha = \\rho$.\nSubstituting this into the constraint $\\alpha \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\n\\alpha^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nSo, $(\\alpha, \\rho) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$. Since $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707$, these values lie within the domain $(0,1]$. This is a valid candidate for the optimum.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha + \\rho = 1$.\nFrom the constraint, we have $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha}$. Substituting this into the case equation:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} = 1\n$$\nMultiplying by $2\\alpha$ (since $\\alpha  0$):\n$$\n2\\alpha^{2} + 1 = 2\\alpha \\implies 2\\alpha^{2} - 2\\alpha + 1 = 0\n$$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is $\\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac = (-2)^{2} - 4(2)(1) = 4 - 8 = -4$. Since $\\Delta  0$, there are no real solutions for $\\alpha$ in this case.\n\nThus, the only critical point is $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\rho^{\\star} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. This symmetric result is expected given the symmetry in the objective function and constraint with respect to $\\alpha$ and $\\rho$.\n\nNow, we calculate the maximum accuracy $A^{\\star}$ by substituting these optimal values back into the accuracy function:\n$$\nA^{\\star} = A\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = 0.80 - 0.10\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} - 0.10\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\nA^{\\star} = 0.80 - 0.20\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nWe expand the squared term:\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{2}{4} = 1 - \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $A^{\\star}$:\n$$\nA^{\\star} = 0.80 - 0.20\\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nA^{\\star} = 0.80 - \\left(0.20 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} - 0.20 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\right) = 0.80 - (0.30 - 0.20\\sqrt{2})\n$$\n$$\nA^{\\star} = 0.80 - 0.30 + 0.20\\sqrt{2} = 0.50 + 0.2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...\n$$\n$$\nA^{\\star} \\approx 0.50 + 0.2 \\times 1.41421356 = 0.50 + 0.282842712 = 0.782842712\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7828$.",
