            "problem": "Consider a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with a U-Net-like encoder-decoder structure for two-dimensional images. The encoder has three scales. At each encoder scale, the operation sequence is: two convolutions with kernel size $3 \\times 3$, stride $1$, and zero padding, each followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and then a downsampling by max pooling with kernel size $s \\times s$ and stride $s$. The decoder inverts the spatial reductions by using at each decoder scale one transposed convolution (also called a deconvolution) with kernel size $s \\times s$, stride $s$, zero padding, and an integer output padding $o$ to be chosen so that spatial alignment occurs without distortion; this upsampling is followed by a skip connection concatenation and then two convolutions of kernel size $3 \\times 3$, stride $1$, and zero padding. Assume all convolutions and transposed convolutions use unit dilation, and all operations are applied equally in the height and width dimensions.\n\nThe input image is square with size $N \\times N$, where $N = 256$. The downsampling stride is $s = 2$ at every pooling layer, and the upsampling stride is also $s = 2$ at every transposed convolution. The skip connections concatenate the encoder feature map produced immediately before the pooling operation at the corresponding scale with the decoder feature map produced immediately after the transposed convolution at that scale. To ensure concatenation without any spatial distortion, the encoder feature map is symmetrically cropped in height and width (by the same number of pixels on each side) so that its spatial size exactly matches the decoder feature map at the moment of concatenation.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of convolutional output sizing and transposed convolutional output sizing, compute:\n- the required symmetric cropping (in pixels per side) for the encoder feature maps at scale $2$ and scale $1$ so that they align with their corresponding upsampled decoder feature maps at the moment of concatenation, and\n- the minimal integer output padding $o$ to use in each transposed convolution so that the upsampling achieves exact doubling without spatial distortion at the two decoder stages.\n\nNo rounding is required. Express the final answer as a row matrix containing, in order, the cropping per side at scale $2$, the cropping per side at scale $1$, the output padding for the transposed convolution at the decoder stage aligned with scale $2$, and the output padding for the transposed convolution at the decoder stage aligned with scale $1$.",
            "solution": "The user wants to determine the necessary cropping and output padding values for a U-Net-like architecture to ensure spatial alignment during skip connections.\n\nFirst, we establish the formulas for calculating the output spatial dimension ($H_{out}$) from an input dimension ($H_{in}$) for the relevant operations. All operations are symmetric in height and width, so we only need to analyze one dimension.\n\n1.  **Convolution**: For a convolution with kernel size $k$, stride $u$, and padding $p$, the output size is $H_{out} = \\lfloor \\frac{H_{in} + 2p - k}{u} \\rfloor + 1$. The problem specifies convolutions with $k=3$, $u=1$, and $p=0$.\n    $$H_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{H_{in} + 2(0) - 3}{1} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = H_{in} - 3 + 1 = H_{in} - 2$$\n    Each such convolution reduces the spatial dimension by $2$.\n\n2.  **Max Pooling**: For max pooling with kernel size $s$ and stride $s$, the output size is $H_{out} = \\lfloor \\frac{H_{in} - s}{s} \\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor \\frac{H_{in}}{s} \\rfloor$. The problem specifies $s=2$.\n    $$H_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{H_{in}}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\n3.  **Transposed Convolution**: For a transposed convolution with kernel size $k_t$, stride $u_t$, padding $p_t$, and output padding $o$, the general formula is $H_{out} = (H_{in} - 1)u_t - 2p_t + k_t + o$ (assuming unit dilation). The problem specifies $k_t=s$, $u_t=s$, and $p_t=0$, with $s=2$.\n    $$H_{out} = (H_{in} - 1)s - 2(0) + s + o = s \\cdot H_{in} + o = 2H_{in} + o$$\n\nNext, we trace the spatial dimensions through the network's encoder and decoder paths.\n\n**Encoder Path**\n\nThe input image has size $N=256$. Let $H_i$ be the input size to encoder scale $i$, and $H_{skip,i}$ be the size of the feature map produced at scale $i$ before pooling, which is used for the skip connection.\n\n*   **Input**: The initial input size is $H_0 = 256$.\n\n*   **Encoder Scale 1**:\n    *   Input to this scale is $H_0 = 256$.\n    *   The operation sequence is two convolutions. After the first convolution: $256 - 2 = 254$.\n    *   After the second convolution: $254 - 2 = 252$.\n    *   This is the feature map for the skip connection corresponding to this scale: $H_{skip1} = 252$.\n    *   A max pooling operation follows: $\\lfloor 252 / 2 \\rfloor = 126$. This is the input to the next scale.\n\n*   **Encoder Scale 2**:\n    *   Input to this scale is $126$.\n    *   After the first convolution: $126 - 2 = 124$.\n    *   After the second convolution: $124 - 2 = 122$.\n    *   This is the feature map for the skip connection: $H_{skip2} = 122$.\n    *   A max pooling operation follows: $\\lfloor 122 / 2 \\rfloor = 61$. This is the input to the next scale.\n\n*   **Encoder Scale 3 (Bottleneck)**:\n    *   Input to this scale is $61$.\n    *   After the first convolution: $61 - 2 = 59$.\n    *   After the second convolution: $59 - 2 = 57$.\n    *   This is the bottleneck feature map, $H_{bottleneck}=57$, which is the input to the decoder path.\n\n**Decoder Path**\n\nThe decoder path reconstructs the spatial dimensions. Let $c_i$ be the symmetric cropping per side and $o_i$ be the output padding for the decoder stage corresponding to encoder scale $i$.\n\n*   **First Decoder Stage (corresponding to Encoder Scale 2)**:\n    *   The input from the bottleneck is $H_{bottleneck} = 57$.\n    *   A transposed convolution with stride $s=2$ is applied. The output size is $D_{up2} = 2 \\cdot 57 + o_2 = 114 + o_2$.\n    *   This upsampled map must be concatenated with the feature map from the corresponding encoder scale, $H_{skip2} = 122$.\n    *   To match the sizes, $H_{skip2}$ is symmetrically cropped. The size after cropping is $H_{skip2} - 2c_2$.\n    *   The alignment condition is: $122 - 2c_2 = 114 + o_2$.\n    *   Rearranging gives: $2c_2 + o_2 = 8$.\n    *   We must find the minimal non-negative integer $o_2$ that yields an integer solution for $c_2$.\n        *   If $o_2 = 0$, then $2c_2 = 8 \\implies c_2 = 4$. This is a valid integer.\n        *   If $o_2 = 1$, then $2c_2 = 7 \\implies c_2 = 3.5$. This is not an integer crop.\n        *   If $o_2 = 2$, then $2c_2 = 6 \\implies c_2 = 3$. This is valid, but $o_2=2$ is not minimal.\n    *   The minimal integer output padding is $o_2=0$, which gives a cropping of $c_2 = 4$ pixels per side.\n    *   After concatenation, the feature map size is $114$. This map undergoes two convolutions:\n        *   After the first convolution: $114 - 2 = 112$.\n        *   After the second convolution: $112 - 2 = 110$. This is the input to the next decoder stage.\n\n*   **Second Decoder Stage (corresponding to Encoder Scale 1)**:\n    *   The input from the previous stage is $110$.\n    *   A transposed convolution with stride $s=2$ is applied. The output size is $D_{up1} = 2 \\cdot 110 + o_1 = 220 + o_1$.\n    *   This map is concatenated with the feature map from encoder scale 1, $H_{skip1} = 252$.\n    *   The alignment condition after cropping $H_{skip1}$ is: $252 - 2c_1 = 220 + o_1$.\n    *   Rearranging gives: $2c_1 + o_1 = 32$.\n    *   We find the minimal non-negative integer $o_1$ that yields an integer $c_1$.\n        *   If $o_1 = 0$, then $2c_1 = 32 \\implies c_1 = 16$. This is a valid integer.\n        *   If $o_1 = 1$, then $2c_1 = 31 \\implies c_1 = 15.5$. Not an integer.\n    *   The minimal integer output padding is $o_1=0$, which gives a cropping of $c_1 = 16$ pixels per side.\n\nThe computed values are:\n-   Cropping per side at scale 2: $c_2 = 4$.\n-   Cropping per side at scale 1: $c_1 = 16$.\n-   Output padding for the decoder stage aligned with scale 2: $o_2=0$.\n-   Output padding for the decoder stage aligned with scale 1: $o_1=0$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix in the order `[c_2, c_1, o_2, o_1]`.",

If either gradient vector has zero norm at a pixel, define the cosine similarity for that pixel to be $0$.\n- For numerical stability, when evaluating logarithms of probabilities, clip any probability $p$ to the interval $[\\epsilon,1-\\epsilon]$ with $\\epsilon=10^{-12}$.\n\nThe program must return, for each test case, a list with three values:\n- The total multi-task loss as a float (with at least $6$ significant digits), computed as $\\alpha$ times the sum of the semantic per-pixel negative log-likelihood plus $\\beta$ times the sum of the weighted boundary per-pixel negative log-likelihood.\n- The mean gradient alignment (cosine similarity averaged over pixels) as a float.\n- The computed positive-class weight $w_{+}$ as a float.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case result is itself a list, e.g., $[\\,[\\text{loss}_1,\\text{align}_1,w_{+,1}],\\,[\\text{loss}_2,\\text{align}_2,w_{+,2}]\\,]$.\n\nTest suite and parameters:\n\n- Test case $1$:\n    - Image size: $H=2$, $W=2$, feature dimension $D=3$, classes $K=3$.\n    - Shared features $\\mathbf{F}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times D}$ (row-major order):\n      $$\n      \\begin{aligned}\n      \\mathbf{f}_{0,0}&=[\\,0.2,\\,-0.1,\\,0.3\\,],\\quad\n      \\mathbf{f}_{0,1}=[\\,0.0,\\,0.1,\\,-0.2\\,],\\\\\n      \\mathbf{f}_{1,0}&=[\\,0.5,\\,0.2,\\,0.0\\,],\\quad\n      \\mathbf{f}_{1,1}=[\\,-0.3,\\,0.4,\\,0.1\\,].\n      \\end{aligned}\n      $$\n    - Semantic head weights $\\mathbf{W}^{(c)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times D}$:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{W}^{(c)}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0.1 & -0.2 & 0.0\\\\\n      0.0 & 0.3 & -0.1\\\\\n      -0.1 & 0.0 & 0.2\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary head weights $\\mathbf{w}^{(b)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times D}$:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{w}^{(b)}=[\\,0.2,\\,-0.1,\\,0.3\\,].\n      $$\n    - Semantic labels $\\mathbf{Y}\\in\\{0,1,2\\}^{H\\times W}$:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{Y}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0 & 1\\\\\n      2 & 0\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary labels $\\mathbf{B}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{H\\times W}$:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{B}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0 & 1\\\\\n      1 & 0\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Task weights: $\\alpha=1.0$, $\\beta=0.5$.\n\n- Test case $2$:\n    - Image size: $H=3$, $W=1$, feature dimension $D=2$, classes $K=2$.\n    - Shared features:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{f}_{0,0}=[\\,0.0,\\,0.0\\,],\\quad\n      \\mathbf{f}_{1,0}=[\\,0.1,\\,-0.1\\,],\\quad\n      \\mathbf{f}_{2,0}=[\\,-0.2,\\,0.3\\,].\n      $$\n    - Semantic head weights:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{W}^{(c)}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0.05 & 0.04\\\\\n      -0.03 & 0.02\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary head weights:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{w}^{(b)}=[\\,0.1,\\,0.0\\,].\n      $$\n    - Semantic labels:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{Y}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      1\\\\\n      0\\\\\n      1\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary labels:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{B}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0\\\\\n      0\\\\\n      0\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Task weights: $\\alpha=0.8$, $\\beta=1.2$.\n\n- Test case $3$:\n    - Image size: $H=2$, $W=3$, feature dimension $D=2$, classes $K=3$.\n    - Shared features:\n      $$\n      \\begin{aligned}\n      \\mathbf{f}_{0,0}&=[\\,0.3,\\,-0.2\\,],\\quad \\mathbf{f}_{0,1}=[\\,0.0,\\,0.1\\,],\\quad \\mathbf{f}_{0,2}=[\\,-0.1,\\,0.4\\,],\\\\\n      \\mathbf{f}_{1,0}&=[\\,0.2,\\,0.2\\,],\\quad \\mathbf{f}_{1,1}=[\\,-0.3,\\,-0.1\\,],\\quad \\mathbf{f}_{1,2}=[\\,0.5,\\,-0.4\\,].\n      \\end{aligned}\n      $$\n    - Semantic head weights:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{W}^{(c)}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0.2 & -0.1\\\\\n      -0.2 & 0.3\\\\\n      0.1 & 0.0\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary head weights:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{w}^{(b)}=[\\,-0.1,\\,0.2\\,].\n      $$\n    - Semantic labels:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{Y}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      0 & 2 & 1\\\\\n      1 & 0 & 2\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Boundary labels:\n      $$\n      \\mathbf{B}=\n      \\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n      0 & 1 & 1\n      \\end{bmatrix}.\n      $$\n    - Task weights: $\\alpha=0.7$, $\\beta=1.3$.",
            "solution": "First, we derive the mathematical expressions for the required quantities. We consider a single pixel with index $i$. The shared feature vector is $\\mathbf{f}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$.\n\n**Multi-Task Objective Function Derivation**\n\nThe total loss $L_{total}$ is a weighted sum of the semantic segmentation loss and the boundary detection loss, aggregated over all $N=H \\times W$ pixels.\n$$\nL_{total} = \\alpha L_{sem} + \\beta L_{bnd} = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{sem, i} + \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{bnd, i}^{\\text{weighted}}\n$$\n\n**Semantic Segmentation Loss ($L_{sem}$)**\n\nThe semantic head computes class logits $\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ for pixel $i$ via the linear map:\n$$\n\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)} = \\mathbf{W}^{(c)} \\mathbf{f}_i\n$$\nThese logits are converted into a probability distribution over the $K$ classes using the softmax function:\n$$\np_{i,k}^{(c)} = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)})_k = \\frac{\\exp(z_{i,k}^{(c)})}{\\sum_{j=0}^{K-1} \\exp(z_{i,j}^{(c)})}\n$$\nwhere $p_{i,k}^{(c)}$ is the predicted probability that pixel $i$ belongs to class $k$. Given the ground-truth integer label $y_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, K-1\\}$, the semantic loss for pixel $i$ is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the true class, also known as the cross-entropy loss:\n$$\nL_{sem, i} = -\\log(p_{i, y_i}^{(c)})\n$$\nTo ensure numerical stability, the probability $p_{i, y_i}^{(c)}$ is clipped to the interval $[\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon]$, with $\\epsilon = 10^{-12}$, before taking the logarithm.\n\n**Boundary Detection Loss ($L_{bnd}$)**\n\nThe boundary head computes a scalar logit $z_i^{(b)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for pixel $i$:\n$$\nz_i^{(b)} = \\mathbf{w}^{(b)} \\mathbf{f}_i\n$$\nThe logit is converted to a probability of the pixel being a boundary ($b_i=1$) using the sigmoid function:\n$$\np_i^{(b)} = \\sigma(z_i^{(b)}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z_i^{(b)})}\n$$\nThe boundary loss is a weighted binary cross-entropy. The weight $w_+$ for the positive class (boundary present, $b_i=1$) is defined as:\n$$\nw_{+} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } N_1 = 0 \\\\ N_0 / N_1 & \\text{if } N_1 > 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $N_1$ is the total count of pixels with label $1$ and $N_0$ is the count of pixels with label $0$. This weight is applied only to positive samples. The weighted NLL for pixel $i$ with binary label $b_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is:\n$$\nL_{bnd, i}^{\\text{weighted}} = -[w_+ b_i \\log(p_i^{(b)}) + (1 - b_i) \\log(1 - p_i^{(b)})]\n$$\nFor numerical stability, probabilities are clipped to $[\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon]$ before the logarithm is applied.\n\n**Gradient Alignment Derivation**\n\nWe require the gradients of the unweighted, per-pixel loss terms with respect to the shared feature vector $\\mathbf{f}_i$.\n\n**Gradient of Semantic Loss ($\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} L_{sem, i}$)**\n\nThe gradient of the semantic loss $L_{sem, i} = -\\log(p_{i, y_i}^{(c)})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{f}_i$ is found using the chain rule. First, we find the gradient with respect to the logits $\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)}$. The derivative of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the pre-softmax logits $z_{i,j}^{(c)}$ is well-known:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_{sem, i}}{\\partial z_{i,j}^{(c)}} = p_{i,j}^{(c)} - \\delta_{j, y_i}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{j, y_i}$ is the Kronecker delta. Let $\\mathbf{e}_{y_i}$ be the one-hot column vector for the true class $y_i$. The gradient with respect to the logit vector $\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)}$ is $\\mathbf{p}_i^{(c)} - \\mathbf{e}_{y_i}$.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} L_{sem, i} = (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} \\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)})^T \\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)}} L_{sem, i}$. Since $\\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)} = \\mathbf{W}^{(c)} \\mathbf{f}_i$, the Jacobian matrix $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} \\mathbf{z}_i^{(c)}$ is $\\mathbf{W}^{(c)}$. Thus, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g}_i^{(c)} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} L_{sem, i} = (\\mathbf{W}^{(c)})^T (\\mathbf{p}_i^{(c)} - \\mathbf{e}_{y_i})\n$$\n\n**Gradient of Boundary Loss ($\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} L_{bnd, i}^{\\text{unweighted}}$)**\n\nFor gradient alignment, we consider the unweighted boundary loss ($w_+=1$):\n$$\nL_{bnd, i}^{\\text{unweighted}} = -[b_i \\log(p_i^{(b)}) + (1-b_i) \\log(1 - p_i^{(b)})]\n$$\nThe gradient with respect to the logit $z_i^{(b)}$ is a standard result for binary cross-entropy with a sigmoid activation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_{bnd, i}^{\\text{unweighted}}}{\\partial z_i^{(b)}} = p_i^{(b)} - b_i\n$$\nApplying the chain rule, and since $z_i^{(b)} = \\mathbf{w}^{(b)} \\mathbf{f}_i$, we have $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} z_i^{(b)} = (\\mathbf{w}^{(b)})^T$. The gradient becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g}_i^{(b)} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{f}_i} L_{bnd, i}^{\\text{unweighted}} = (p_i^{(b)} - b_i) (\\mathbf{w}^{(b)})^T\n$$\n\n**Mean Gradient Alignment**\n\nFor each pixel $i$, the cosine similarity between the two task gradients $\\mathbf{g}_i^{(c)}$ and $\\mathbf{g}_i^{(b)}$ is calculated:\n$$\n\\text{sim}_i = \\frac{\\mathbf{g}_i^{(c)} \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_i^{(b)}}{\\|\\mathbf{g}_i^{(c)}\\|_2 \\|\\mathbf{g}_i^{(b)}\\|_2}\n$$\nIf either gradient has a norm of zero, $\\text{sim}_i$ is defined as $0$. The mean gradient alignment is the average of these similarities over all $N$ pixels:\n$$\n\\text{Alignment} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{sim}_i\n$$\n\nThe implementation will perform these calculations for each test case using vectorized operations in NumPy for efficiency.",
