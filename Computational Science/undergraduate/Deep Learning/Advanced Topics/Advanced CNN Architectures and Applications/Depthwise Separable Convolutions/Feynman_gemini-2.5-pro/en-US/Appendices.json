            "problem": "A Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) consists of a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies one spatial filter per input channel, and the pointwise convolution uses filters of spatial size $1 \\times 1$ to mix channels. Consider a two-dimensional discrete convolution and use the following fundamental bases:\n\n- The two-dimensional discrete convolution of a single-channel input $x$ with a kernel $w$ at spatial location $(u,v)$ computes a weighted sum over a local receptive field of $x$.\n- Zero-padding of size $p$ extends the input by $p$ zeros on each spatial boundary, and stride $s$ advances the convolution window by $s$ pixels along each spatial axis.\n\nFrom these bases, derive the counting argument that determines how many valid spatial positions the depthwise convolution can produce along height and width when applied to an input of spatial size $(H,W)$ with a square kernel of size $k \\times k$, stride $s$, and symmetric zero-padding $p$.\n\nThen, apply your derivation to the following DSC block:\n\n- Input tensor has height $H = 128$, width $W = 96$, and number of channels $C_{\\text{in}} = 32$.\n- Depthwise convolution uses a square kernel of size $k = 5$, stride $s = 2$, and symmetric zero-padding $p = 1$ on both height and width.\n- Pointwise convolution uses $C_{\\text{out}} = 64$ output channels, stride $1$, and zero-padding $0$.\n\nAssume no dilation, and that the pointwise convolution preserves the spatial dimensions produced by the depthwise convolution. Define one multiply-add operation as one multiplication followed immediately by one addition, counted once per weight-activation pair contributing to a single output value. Bias terms are not counted.\n\nCompute the total number of multiply-add operations required to process one input image through the entire DSC block described above (depthwise stage plus pointwise stage). Express your final answer as a single integer with no units and no rounding. Only provide this total count as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two tasks: first, to derive the formula for the spatial output dimensions of a 2D convolution, and second, to apply this to calculate the total number of multiply-add operations for a specific Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) block.\n\nFirst, we derive the formula for the output dimensions. Consider a single spatial dimension of an input tensor, with size $D_{in}$. When symmetric zero-padding of size $p$ is applied, $p$ zeros are added to each of the two ends of this dimension. The effective size of the padded dimension becomes $D_{padded} = D_{in} + 2p$. A kernel of size $k$ is convolved over this padded dimension with a stride of $s$.\n\nLet the positions of the kernel be indexed by $i$, starting from $i=0$. The receptive field covered by the kernel at position $i$ starts at index $i \\times s$ and ends at index $i \\times s + k - 1$ (using $0$-based indexing). For the kernel to be placed at a valid position, its entire receptive field must lie within the padded dimension. Therefore, the last index covered must be less than the padded dimension size:\n$$i \\times s + k - 1  D_{padded}$$\n$$i \\times s \\le D_{padded} - k$$\n$$i \\le \\frac{D_{padded} - k}{s}$$\nSince $i$ must be an integer, the maximum value for the index $i$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{D_{padded} - k}{s} \\rfloor$. The number of valid positions is the count of possible integer values for $i$, which range from $0$ to $\\lfloor \\frac{D_{padded} - k}{s} \\rfloor$. The total number of such positions, which corresponds to the output dimension $D_{out}$, is:\n$$D_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{D_{padded} - k}{s} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\nSubstituting $D_{padded} = D_{in} + 2p$, we obtain the general formula for an output spatial dimension:\n$$D_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{D_{in} + 2p - k}{s} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\nApplying this to the height ($H$) and width ($W$) dimensions, we get:\n$$H_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{H + 2p - k}{s} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\n$$W_{out} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W + 2p - k}{s} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the total number of multiply-add operations for the given DSC block. The total cost, $\\text{Ops}_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the costs of the depthwise convolution stage, $\\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}}$, and the pointwise convolution stage, $\\text{Ops}_{\\text{pw}}$.\n\n**1. Depthwise Convolution Stage**\nThe input tensor has dimensions $H = 128$, $W = 96$, and $C_{\\text{in}} = 32$.\nThe depthwise convolution parameters are: kernel size $k = 5$, stride $s = 2$, and padding $p = 1$.\nFirst, we compute the spatial dimensions of the output feature map from this stage, which we denote as $(H_{\\text{dw}}, W_{\\text{dw}})$:\n$$H_{\\text{dw}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{128 + 2(1) - 5}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{125}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63$$\n$$W_{\\text{dw}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{96 + 2(1) - 5}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{93}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 46 + 1 = 47$$\nThe depthwise convolution applies a distinct $k \\times k$ filter to each of the $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels. To compute a single value in one output channel's feature map requires $k \\times k$ multiply-add operations. This is repeated for all $H_{\\text{dw}} \\times W_{\\text{dw}}$ spatial locations and for all $C_{\\text{in}}$ channels.\nThe total number of operations for the depthwise stage is:\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}} = C_{\\text{in}} \\times k \\times k \\times H_{\\text{dw}} \\times W_{\\text{dw}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}} = 32 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 63 \\times 47$$\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}} = 32 \\times 25 \\times 2961$$\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}} = 800 \\times 2961 = 2,368,800$$\n\n**2. Pointwise Convolution Stage**\nThe input to this stage is the output of the depthwise stage, with dimensions $(H_{\\text{in}}, W_{\\text{in}}, C_{\\text{in}}) = (63, 47, 32)$.\nThe pointwise convolution is a standard convolution with $1 \\times 1$ filters. Its parameters are: kernel size $k_{pw} = 1$, stride $s_{pw} = 1$, padding $p_{pw} = 0$, and number of output channels $C_{\\text{out}} = 64$. The spatial dimensions are preserved, which is consistent with these parameters.\nTo calculate one value at a single spatial position in one of the $C_{\\text{out}}$ output channels, a dot product is performed across the $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels. This requires $1 \\times 1 \\times C_{\\text{in}} = C_{\\text{in}}$ multiply-add operations. This computation is repeated for all spatial locations in the output map ($H_{\\text{dw}} \\times W_{\\text{dw}}$) and for every output channel ($C_{\\text{out}}$).\nThe total number of operations for the pointwise stage is:\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{pw}} = C_{\\text{in}} \\times C_{\\text{out}} \\times H_{\\text{dw}} \\times W_{\\text{dw}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{pw}} = 32 \\times 64 \\times 63 \\times 47$$\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{pw}} = 2048 \\times 2961 = 6,064,128$$\n\n**Total Operations**\nThe total number of multiply-add operations for the entire DSC block is the sum of the operations from both stages:\n$$\\text{Ops}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{Ops}_{\\text{dw}} + \\text{Ops}_{\\text{pw}} = 2,368,800 + 6,064,128 = 8,432,928$$",

Since the output is a single scalar, the operation is the sum of the Frobenius inner products of corresponding input and kernel slices over all channels.\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\sum_{c=1}^{2} \\langle X^{(c)}, W^{(c)} \\rangle_F = \\langle X^{(1)}, W^{(1)} \\rangle_F + \\langle X^{(2)}, W^{(2)} \\rangle_F\n$$\nThe problem specifies the kernel slices for the full convolution as $W^{(1)} = \\alpha \\, K^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)} = \\beta \\, K^{(2)}$.

The orthogonality of the input channels $X^{(1)}$ and $X^{(2)}$ is a property of the provided data but was not directly required to establish the equality of $y_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{full}}$ under the problem's specific kernel definitions.

The operation consists of a depthwise stage followed by a pointwise stage.\n\n**1. Stage Definitions**\n\n*   **Depthwise Stage**: The problem specifies that the depthwise filter is the identity and the kernel size is $1$. This simplifies the per-channel convolution to a function that applies a bias to each channel independently. Let the depthwise biases be $b_d = (b_{d,1}, b_{d,2})^T$. The output of this stage, $x'$, is given by:\n    $$\n    x' = \\begin{pmatrix} x'_1 \\\\ x'_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot x_1 + b_{d,1} \\\\ 1 \\cdot x_2 + b_{d,2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 + b_{d,1} \\\\ x_2 + b_{d,2} \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n*   **Pointwise Stage**: This stage performs a $1 \\times 1$ convolution, which reduces to a linear combination of the input channels to produce a single scalar output. Let the input to this stage be a vector $z = (z_1, z_2)^T$. The pointwise weights are $w = (w_1, w_2)$ and there is a single output bias $b_p$. The output is:\n    $$\n    y_{\\text{out}} = w_1 z_1 + w_2 z_2 + b_p\n    $$\n\n*   **Nonlinearity**: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is defined as $\\mathrm{ReLU}(t) = \\max\\{0, t\\}$.\n\nWe now derive the functional forms for the two specified orderings of nonlinearity placement.\n\n**2. Ordering (A): ReLU after Depthwise, before Pointwise**\n\nIn this configuration, the ReLU activation is applied to the output of the depthwise stage, and the result is then fed into the pointwise stage.\n\n1.  The input $x=(x_1, x_2)^T$ passes through the depthwise stage, resulting in $x'=(x_1+b_{d,1}, x_2+b_{d,2})^T$.\n2.  The ReLU function is applied element-wise to $x'$:\n    $$\n    x'' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{ReLU}(x_1 + b_{d,1}) \\\\ \\mathrm{ReLU}(x_2 + b_{d,2}) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n3.  The vector $x''$ is the input to the pointwise stage ($z=x''$). The final scalar output, which we denote $f_A(x)$, is:\n    $$\n    f_A(x; b_d, w, b_p) = w_1 \\mathrm{ReLU}(x_1 + b_{d,1}) + w_2 \\mathrm{ReLU}(x_2 + b_{d,2}) + b_p\n    $$\nThe functional class represented by ordering (A) is a linear combination of shifted and rectified inputs. This is the form of a simple two-layer neural network with a hidden layer of two ReLU neurons and a linear output unit. The decision boundary defined by $f_A(x) = 0$ is piecewise linear, allowing it to approximate non-linear and non-convex decision regions.\n\n**3. Ordering (B): ReLU after Pointwise**\n\nIn this configuration, the depthwise and pointwise stages are composed linearly first, and the ReLU activation is applied only to the final scalar output.\n\n1.  The input $x=(x_1, x_2)^T$ passes through the depthwise stage, resulting in $x'=(x_1+b_{d,1}, x_2+b_{d,2})^T$.\n2.  The vector $x'$ is the input to the pointwise stage ($z=x'$).

The ReLU function is applied to this scalar value. The final output, $f_B(x)$, is:\n    $$\n    f_B(x; b_d, w, b_p) = \\mathrm{ReLU}(y_{\\text{pre}}) = \\mathrm{ReLU}(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + (w_1 b_{d,1} + w_2 b_{d,2} + b_p))\n    $$\nThe classification rule is to predict class $1$ if $f_B(x) \\ge 0$. As $\\mathrm{ReLU}(t) \\ge 0$ if and only if $t \\ge 0$, this is equivalent to checking if $y_{\\text{pre}} \\ge 0$. The decision boundary is therefore $y_{\\text{pre}}=0$, which is the equation of a line in the $(x_1, x_2)$ plane. Thus, for any choice of parameters, ordering (B) acts as a linear classifier, capable of learning only hyperplane decision boundaries.\n\n### Benchmark Task Analysis and Implementation Strategy\n\nThe benchmark tasks are designed to probe the differing representational capacities of these two functional forms.\n\n*   **Case 1 (mixing-needed halfspace):** The target is $x_1 - x_2 \\ge 0$. This is a linear decision boundary. As derived, ordering (B) is inherently a linear classifier and should be able to solve this perfectly. Ordering (A) can also represent this linear function, for example, by choosing depthwise biases $b_{d,1}, b_{d,2}$ large enough such that for all inputs on the grid, the arguments to the ReLUs are always positive. In this case, $\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_i+b_{d,i}) = x_i+b_{d,i}$, and the model becomes linear. Both models are expected to achieve perfect accuracy.\n\n*   **Case 2 (sum of positive parts):** The target is $\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_1) + 2\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_2) - 1.0 \\ge 0$. The form of this target function matches the structure of ordering (A) precisely. By selecting parameters $b_{d,1}=0, b_{d,2}=0, w_1=1, w_2=2, b_p=-1$, all of which are available in the specified search grid, ordering (A) can perfectly represent the target function. In contrast, this decision boundary is non-linear, so the linear classifier represented by ordering (B) will be unable to achieve perfect accuracy.\n\n*   **Case 3 (nonnegative boundary equivalence):** The target is $x_1 + 2x_2 - 1.0 \\ge 0$, and all inputs $(x_1, x_2)$ have $x_i \\ge 0$. For ordering (A), if we select $b_{d,1}=0$ and $b_{d,2}=0$, the function becomes $f_A(x) = w_1\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_1) + w_2\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_2) + b_p$. Since $x_i \\ge 0$, $\\mathrm{ReLU}(x_i) = x_i$, so the function simplifies to $f_A(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b_p$. This is identical to the pre-activation function of ordering (B) (with $b_{d,1}=b_{d,2}=0$). Since ordering (A)'s parameter search space contains the parameters that make it equivalent to ordering (B), and the target is a linear separator, both models have the capacity to solve this task perfectly.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by exhaustively searching the discrete parameter grid for each of the six scenarios (3 cases $\\times$ 2 orderings). For each combination of parameters, the model's accuracy is calculated on the corresponding dataset. The maximum accuracy found across all parameter combinations is reported for each scenario.",
