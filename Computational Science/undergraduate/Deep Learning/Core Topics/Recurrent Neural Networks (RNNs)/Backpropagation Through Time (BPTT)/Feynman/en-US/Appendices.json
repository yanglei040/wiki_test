            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem statement from the field of deep learning theory. It requires the derivation of a gradient for a standard linear Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a formal and solvable task based on established principles of multivariable calculus and linear algebra. All necessary definitions and conditions are provided.\n\nWe begin by stating the core definitions provided in the problem:\nRecurrence relation: $h_t = W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t$ for $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$, with initial state $h_0 = 0$.\nReadout equation: $y_t = W_y h_t$.\nLoss function: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\|y_t - s_t\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\|e_t\\|_2^2$, where $e_t = y_t - s_t$.\nThe parameters are matrices $W_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_h \\times d_h}$, $W_x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_h \\times d_x}$, and $W_y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_y \\times d_h}$. The inputs are vectors $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_x}$ and targets $s_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_y}$.\n\nOur goal is to derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the loss function $L$ with respect to the recurrent weight matrix $W_h$, denoted as $\\nabla_{W_h} L$. We will use the chain rule for matrix calculus.\n\nThe loss $L$ is a function of $W_h$ through its influence on the hidden states $\\{h_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. The gradient can be expressed as a sum of contributions from each timestep where $W_h$ is used in the forward pass:\n$$\n\\nabla_{W_h} L = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\nabla_{W_h}^{(\\text{local at } t)} L\n$$\nwhere the \"local\" gradient refers to the gradient with respect to the instance of $W_h$ used in the computation $h_t = W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t$. Using the chain rule, this contribution is given by the outer product of the gradient of the loss with respect to the state $h_t$, and the gradient of the state-update term with respect to $W_h$. Let $\\delta_t = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h_t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ be the gradient of the total loss with respect to the hidden state $h_t$. The gradient of the pre-activation $a_t = W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t$ with respect to $W_h$ is $h_{t-1}^T$. Thus, the contribution to the gradient from timestep $t$ is $\\delta_t h_{t-1}^T$. Summing over all timesteps gives the total gradient:\n$$\n\\nabla_{W_h} L = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\delta_t h_{t-1}^T\n$$\nThis is the standard formula for the recurrent weight gradient in BPTT. However, the problem requires a closed-form expression in terms of the given quantities $W_h, W_y, \\{e_t\\}, \\{h_t\\}$. To achieve this, we must derive a closed form for $\\delta_t$.\n\nThe vector $\\delta_t$ represents the total influence of $h_t$ on the loss $L$. The state $h_t$ influences the loss through the outputs $y_k$ for all subsequent timesteps $k \\ge t$.\n$$\n\\delta_t = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h_t} = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_k} \\frac{\\partial y_k}{\\partial h_k} \\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_t}\n$$\nHere, we apply the chain rule, summing over all paths from $h_t$ to the final loss. The partial derivatives are (using numerator-layout matrix calculus conventions where the gradient of a scalar w.r.t. a column vector is a column vector):\n$1.$ $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^T \\|y_j - s_j\\|_2^2 \\right) = y_k - s_k = e_k$. This is a column vector of size $d_y$.\n$2.$ $\\frac{\\partial y_k}{\\partial h_k} = W_y$. This is the Jacobian matrix of size $d_y \\times d_h$. The term in the chain rule is its transpose, $(\\frac{\\partial y_k}{\\partial h_k})^T = W_y^T$.\n$3.$ $\\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_t}$. We find this by unrolling the recurrence relation:\n$h_k = W_h h_{k-1} + W_x x_k = W_h (W_h h_{k-2} + W_x x_{k-1}) + W_x x_k = \\dots$\nThe dependence of $h_k$ on $h_t$ for $k  t$ is given by:\n$h_k = W_h^{k-t} h_t + \\sum_{j=t+1}^{k} W_h^{k-j} W_x x_j$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore $\\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_t} = W_h^{k-t}$ for $k \\ge t$. The term in the chain rule composition is its transpose, $(W_h^{k-t})^T = (W_h^T)^{k-t}$.\n\nSubstituting these derivatives back into the expression for $\\delta_t$:\n$$\n\\delta_t = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} \\left( \\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_t} \\right)^T \\left( \\frac{\\partial y_k}{\\partial h_k} \\right)^T \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_k} = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} (W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T e_k\n$$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the gradient signal $\\delta_t$ propagated back from all future timesteps $k \\ge t$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\delta_t$ into our equation for the total gradient $\\nabla_{W_h} L$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{W_h} L = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\sum_{k=t}^{T} (W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T e_k \\right) h_{t-1}^T\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression. It decomposes the gradient into a double summation over time. Each term $(W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T e_k h_{t-1}^T$ can be interpreted as a \"correlation\" between the error $e_k$ at a future time $k$ and the hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at a past time $t-1$, mediated by the matrix $(W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T$ which accounts for the propagation of influence through the network's dynamics and readout layer.\n\nNext, we discuss the computational complexity.\n(i) Direct evaluation from the closed-form expression:\nThe formula is $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{k=t}^{T} (W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T e_k h_{t-1}^T$.\nAssume the forward pass has been run, so all $e_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_y}$ and $h_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ are known.\nThe double loop involves $O(T^2)$ terms. For each term $(t, k)$, the computation involves:\n- A matrix power $(W_h^T)^{k-t}$, which, if not pre-computed, takes $O((k-t) d_h^3)$. A pre-computation of all necessary powers of $W_h^T$ up to $T-1$ takes $O(T d_h^3)$.\n- A matrix-vector product $W_y^T e_k$, costing $O(d_h d_y)$.\n- A matrix-vector product $(W_h^T)^{k-t} (W_y^T e_k)$, costing $O(d_h^2)$.\n- An outer product with $h_{t-1}^T$, costing $O(d_h^2)$.\nA naive implementation would be very expensive. A more optimized direct evaluation would proceed as:\n`total_grad = 0`\n`for t = 1 to T:`\n  `inner_sum_vec = 0`\n  `for k = t to T:`\n    `vec = ... compute (W_h^T)^{k-t} W_y^T e_k ...`\n    `inner_sum_vec += vec`\n  `total_grad += outer(inner_sum_vec, h_{t-1})`\nThe most expensive part is the double loop structure. There are approximately $T^2/2$ pairs of $(t,k)$. For each pair, the dominant cost is computing the matrix-vector product with the matrix power, which is $O(d_h^2)$ assuming powers are precomputed. The precomputation costs $O(T d_h^3)$. Therefore, the total complexity is dominated by the nested loops and the precomputation, leading to a complexity of $O(T d_h^3 + T^2 d_h^2)$. The quadratic dependence on the sequence length $T$ makes this method computationally prohibitive for long sequences.\n\n(ii) Evaluation via Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):\nBPTT avoids the explicit calculation of the double summation by using dynamic programming. It computes the gradients via a single backward pass through time. The key is the recursive relationship for $\\delta_t$:\n$\\delta_T = W_y^T e_T$\n$\\delta_t = W_y^T e_t + W_h^T \\delta_{t+1}$ for $t = T-1, \\dots, 1$.\nThe BPTT algorithm for computing $\\nabla_{W_h} L$ is:\n$1.$ Perform a forward pass from $t=1$ to $T$ to compute and store all $h_t$ and $e_t$. Cost: $O(T(d_h^2 + d_h d_x + d_y d_h))$.\n$2.$ Initialize $\\nabla_{W_h} L = 0$ and $\\delta_{T+1} = 0$.\n$3.$ Perform a backward pass from $t=T$ down to $1$:\n   a. Compute $\\delta_t = W_y^T e_t + W_h^T \\delta_{t+1}$. This involves two matrix-vector products and a vector addition, costing $O(d_h d_y + d_h^2)$.\n   b. Add the contribution to the gradient: $\\nabla_{W_h} L \\leftarrow \\nabla_{W_h} L + \\delta_t h_{t-1}^T$. This is an outer product and matrix addition, costing $O(d_h^2)$.\nThe backward pass consists of a single loop of length $T$, with each step costing $O(d_h^2 + d_h d_y)$. The total complexity of the backward pass is $O(T(d_h^2 + d_h d_y))$.\nThe total complexity of BPTT is therefore $O(T(d_h^2 + d_h d_x + d_y d_h))$, which is linear in the sequence length $T$. This is significantly more efficient than the direct evaluation of the closed-form expression.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we establish the closed-form expression for the hidden state $h_t$. The recurrence $h_{t+1} = w h_t$ is a geometric progression. Unrolling it from the initial state $h_0$ gives:\n$$h_t = w^t h_0$$\nThis expression holds for all $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n\n#### Derivation of $\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_{t}}$\nThe final-time loss is $L_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\ell_T = \\frac{1}{2} h_T^2$.\nThe gradient of the loss with respect to an intermediate hidden state $h_t$ is found by applying the chain rule through the computational graph from $h_t$ to $h_T$. The state $h_t$ only influences $L_{\\mathrm{final}}$ through its effect on $h_T$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_{t}} = \\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_T} \\frac{\\partial h_T}{\\partial h_{t}}$$\nThe first term is the derivative of the loss function with respect to its direct input:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h_T} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} h_T^2 \\right) = h_T$$\nThe second term is the derivative of a future state with respect to a past state. Using $h_T = w^{T-t} h_t$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial h_T}{\\partial h_{t}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h_{t}} (w^{T-t} h_t) = w^{T-t}$$\nCombining these results, the gradient for any $t \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, T\\}$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_{t}} = h_T w^{T-t}$$\nThis is one of the requested explicit expressions. We can also express this in terms of $h_0$ by substituting $h_T = w^T h_0$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\partial h_{t}} = (w^T h_0) w^{T-t} = h_0 w^{2T-t}$$\n\n#### Derivation of $\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{sum}}}{\\partial h_{t}}$\nThe distributed loss is $L_{\\mathrm{sum}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{T} \\ell_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{2} h_k^2$.\nThe hidden state $h_t$ influences all losses $\\ell_k$ for $k \\ge t$.

We must consider two cases for the lower bound of the sum.\n\n**Case 1: $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$**\nThe sum is valid as written. We have $\\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_t} = w^{k-t}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{sum}}}{\\partial h_t} = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} h_k w^{k-t}$$\nSubstitute $h_k = w^{k-t} h_t$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{sum}}}{\\partial h_t} = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} (w^{k-t} h_t) w^{k-t} = h_t \\sum_{k=t}^{T} w^{2(k-t)}$$\nLet $j = k-t$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information for a solution. It is a standard numerical exercise in computational differentiation, comparing the specific algorithm of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with a general-purpose reverse-mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) engine.\n\nThe solution will be presented in three parts:\n1.  **Derivation and Implementation of Manual Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: We will derive the gradient update rules for each parameter by explicitly applying the chain rule to the recurrent computation, unrolled over time.\n2.  **Implementation of a Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) Engine**: We will construct a minimal AD engine that builds a computational graph and propagates gradients (adjoints) backwards from the loss to the parameters.\n3.  **Validation and Comparison**: For each test case, we will compute gradients using both methods and find the maximum absolute difference between them, verifying that BPTT is a specific instance of the general reverse-mode AD principle.\n\n### 1. Manual Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\n\nBPTT computes gradients in a recurrent neural network by unrolling the network through time, creating a large, non-recurrent computational graph, and then applying the standard backpropagation algorithm. This is equivalent to accumulating gradients by iterating backwards through time.\n\nLet the adjoint of a variable $V$ be denoted as $\\bar{V} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V}$. The loss is $L = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} L_t$, where $L_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\left\\|\\mathbf{y}_t - \\mathbf{z}_t\\right\\|_2^2$.\n\n**Forward Pass**: First, we compute and store all intermediate values for $t = 1, \\dots, T$, starting with $\\mathbf{h}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{hh}\\,\\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{W}_{xh}\\,\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{b}_h $$\n$$ \\mathbf{h}_t = \\tanh(\\mathbf{a}_t) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{hy}\\,\\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{b}_y $$\n\n**Backward Pass**: We iterate backwards from $t=T$ down to $t=1$. Parameter gradients are accumulated over all timesteps. We initialize all parameter gradients to zero (e.g., $\\bar{\\mathbf{W}}_{hy} = \\mathbf{0}$). The gradient with respect to the hidden state that flows from the future, $\\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{t, \\text{next}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}_t}|_{\\text{from } t+1, \\dots, T}$, is initialized to $\\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{T, \\text{next}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFor each timestep $t = T, \\dots, 1$:\n1.  **Adjoint of the output $\\mathbf{y}_t$**: The gradient of the loss with respect to the output at timestep $t$ is:\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{y}}_t = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{y}_t} = \\frac{\\partial L_t}{\\partial \\mathbf{y}_t} = \\mathbf{y}_t - \\mathbf{z}_t $$\n\n2.  **Adjoints of the output layer parameters ($\\mathbf{W}_{hy}, \\mathbf{b}_y$)**: Using the chain rule on $\\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{hy}\\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{b}_y$:\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{W}}_{hy} \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}_{hy}}\\bigg|_{\\text{from }t} = \\bar{\\mathbf{y}}_t \\mathbf{h}_t^T $$\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{b}}_y \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}_y}\\bigg|_{\\text{from }t} = \\bar{\\mathbf{y}}_t $$\n    The `$\\mathrel{+}=$` denotes accumulation.\n\n3.  **Adjoint of the hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_t$**: The hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_t$ influences the loss through the current output $\\mathbf{y}_t$ and all subsequent hidden states starting from $\\mathbf{h}_{t+1}$. The gradient contribution from the future is already contained in $\\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{t, \\text{next}}$.\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_t = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{y}_t}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}_t}^T \\bar{\\mathbf{y}}_t + \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{t, \\text{next}} = \\mathbf{W}_{hy}^T \\bar{\\mathbf{y}}_t + \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{t, \\text{next}} $$\n\n4.  **Adjoint of the pre-activation $\\mathbf{a}_t$**: Using the chain rule on $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\tanh(\\mathbf{a}_t)$ and the identity $\\frac{d}{du}\\tanh(u) = 1-\\tanh^2(u)$:\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}_t}{\\partial \\mathbf{a}_t}\\right)^T \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_t = \\text{diag}(1 - \\tanh^2(\\mathbf{a}_t)) \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_t = (1 - \\mathbf{h}_t \\odot \\mathbf{h}_t) \\odot \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_t $$\n    where $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product.\n\n5.  **Adjoints of the recurrent layer parameters ($\\mathbf{W}_{hh}, \\mathbf{W}_{xh}, \\mathbf{b}_h$)**: Using the chain rule on $\\mathbf{a}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{hh}\\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{W}_{xh}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{b}_h$:\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{W}}_{hh} \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}_{hh}}\\bigg|_{\\text{from }t} = \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^T $$\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{W}}_{xh} \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}_{xh}}\\bigg|_{\\text{from }t} = \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t \\mathbf{x}_t^T $$\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{b}}_h \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}_h}\\bigg|_{\\text{from }t} = \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t $$\n\n6.  **Adjoint for the previous hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$**: Finally, we compute the gradient to be passed back to the previous timestep. This becomes the `$\\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{\\text{next}}$` for step $t-1$.\n    $$ \\bar{\\mathbf{h}}_{(t-1), \\text{next}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{a}_t}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}}\\right)^T \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{hh}^T \\bar{\\mathbf{a}}_t $$\n\nThis sequence of steps, iterated from $t=T$ to $1$, yields the total gradients for all parameters.\n\n### 2. Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation (AD)\n\nReverse-mode AD is a general technique for computing gradients. It operates in two phases:\n1.  **Forward Pass**: The computation is executed, and a computational graph is built, recording each operation and its input variables (parents).\n2.  **Backward Pass**: Gradients (adjoints) are propagated backward from the final output (the loss) to all input variables by traversing the graph in reverse topological order. For each node in the graph, its adjoint is used to compute the adjoints of its parents, according to the local partial derivative of the operation.\n\nWe will implement a `Variable` class to represent nodes in the graph. Each `Variable` will store its numerical `value`, its `grad` (adjoint), and a `_backward` function that encapsulates the logic for propagating its gradient to its parents. Overloading operators like `+`, `@` (matrix multiplication), etc., allows the graph to be constructed implicitly as the forward pass is written.\n\nThe backward pass starts by setting the gradient of the final loss `Variable` to $1.0$. It then performs a topological sort on the graph and iterates through the sorted nodes in reverse, calling the `_backward` function for each. This process accumulates the gradients in the `.grad` attribute of each parameter `Variable`.\n\n### 3. Implementation and Validation\n\nWe will implement both approaches in Python. The manual BPTT method will follow the derived equations directly. The AD method will use our `Variable` class to build and backpropagate through the RNN computation graph. For each of the four specified test cases, we will:\n1.  Generate parameters, inputs, and targets using the specified dimensions, seeds, and scales.\n2.  Compute the gradients of the five parameter sets ($\\mathbf{W}_{hh}$, $\\mathbf{W}_{xh}$, $\\mathbf{W}_{hy}$, $\\mathbf{b}_h$, $\\mathbf{b}_y$) using both methods.\n3.  Calculate the maximum absolute difference between the gradients obtained from the two methods across all elements of all parameters. This difference should be close to zero, limited only by floating-point precision, thus cross-validating the implementations.\nThe final output will be a list of these maximum differences for each test case.",
