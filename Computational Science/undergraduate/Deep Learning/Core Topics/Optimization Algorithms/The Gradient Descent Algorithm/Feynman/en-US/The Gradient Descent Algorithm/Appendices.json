The choice of a constant learning rate, $\\eta$, is critical; too large, and the algorithm can diverge. This exercise explores a more insidious failure mode: a learning rate that is not large enough to cause divergence but is perfectly wrong, trapping the optimizer in a non-convergent limit cycle. By analyzing a simple quadratic potential, you will derive the exact step size that causes the iterates to bounce between two points forever, never reaching the minimum, providing a stark illustration of the importance of learning rate selection .",

The dynamics of the optimization algorithms decouple along these axes. We can analyze the convergence by studying the scalar recursion for a generic eigenvalue $\\lambda \\in \\{a,b\\}$.\n\n### 1. Gradient Descent (GD) Analysis\n\nThe GD update rule is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{z}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{z}_{t} - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{z}_{t}) $$\nSubstituting $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{z}_t) = H\\mathbf{z}_t$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbf{z}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{z}_t - \\eta H \\mathbf{z}_t = (I - \\eta H) \\mathbf{z}_t $$\nThis is a linear dynamical system. For a component of $\\mathbf{z}_t$ along an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $H$, the scalar update rule is:\n$$ z_{t+1}^{(\\lambda)} = (1 - \\eta \\lambda) z_t^{(\\lambda)} $$\nThe term $c(\\eta, \\lambda) = 1 - \\eta\\lambda$ is the contraction factor for this component. For an iterative method to converge, the magnitude of its contraction factor must be less than $1$ for all modes. The overall convergence rate is determined by the largest magnitude, which is the spectral radius of the iteration matrix $I - \\eta H$:\n$$ \\rho(I - \\eta H) = \\max_{\\lambda \\in \\{a, b\\}} |1 - \\eta \\lambda| $$\nFor convergence, we require $\\rho  1$, which implies $|1 - \\eta\\lambda|  1$ for both $\\lambda=a$ and $\\lambda=b$. This means $-1  1 - \\eta\\lambda  1$, which simplifies to $0  \\eta\\lambda  2$. Since $ab0$, this must hold for $\\lambda=a$, giving the stability condition $0  \\eta  \\frac{2}{a}$.\n\nOur goal is to find the learning rate $\\eta$ that minimizes the worst-case spectral radius:\n$$ \\eta^{\\star} = \\arg\\min_{\\eta} \\max(|1 - \\eta a|, |1 - \\eta b|) $$\nThe minimum of the maximum of two linear functions of $\\eta$ occurs when their absolute values are equal.

Its dynamics are governed by the roots of its characteristic polynomial:\n$$ \\mu^2 - (1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta)\\mu + \\beta = 0 $$\nFor the system to be stable, the magnitudes of both roots, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, must be less than $1$. The convergence rate is determined by $\\rho_\\lambda = \\max(|\\mu_1|, |\\mu_2|)$. The roots are:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta \\pm \\sqrt{(1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta)^2 - 4\\beta}}{2} $$\nThe nature of the roots depends on the discriminant $D = (1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta)^2 - 4\\beta$.\nIf $D \\ge 0$, the roots are real, and the spectral radius is $\\rho_\\lambda = \\frac{|1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta| + \\sqrt{D}}{2}$.\nIf $D  0$, the roots are a complex conjugate pair, and their magnitude is $|\\mu| = \\sqrt{\\text{product of roots}} = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. The spectral radius is $\\rho_\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\beta}$.\n\nTo minimize the worst-case spectral radius $\\max_{\\lambda \\in \\{a,b\\}} \\rho_\\lambda$, we seek to make the spectral radii for both $\\lambda=a$ and $\\lambda=b$ equal and as small as possible. The optimal solution occurs when the dynamics for both eigenvalues are in the complex root regime and on the boundary of the real root regime, i.e., when the discriminant is non-positive, and the spectral radius is $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ for both. This requires:\n$$ (1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta)^2 - 4\\beta \\le 0 \\quad \\text{for } \\lambda \\in \\{a,b\\} $$\n$$ |1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta| \\le 2\\sqrt{\\beta} $$\nThis is equivalent to $-2\\sqrt{\\beta} \\le 1 - \\eta\\lambda + \\beta \\le 2\\sqrt{\\beta}$, which rearranges to:\n$$ (1-\\sqrt{\\beta})^2 \\le \\eta\\lambda \\le (1+\\sqrt{\\beta})^2 $$\nTo minimize $\\beta$ (and thus the spectral radius $\\sqrt{\\beta}$), we want this interval to be as small as possible while still containing $[\\eta b, \\eta a]$. This is achieved by setting the endpoints of the intervals to match:\n$$ \\eta b = (1 - \\sqrt{\\beta})^2 $$\n$$ \\eta a = (1 + \\sqrt{\\beta})^2 $$\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n$$ \\frac{a}{b} = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{\\beta}}{1 - \\sqrt{\\beta}}\\right)^2 $$\nTaking the square root and solving for $\\sqrt{\\beta}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{\\beta}}{1 - \\sqrt{\\beta}} \\implies \\sqrt{a}(1-\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{b}(1+\\sqrt{\\beta}) $$\n$$ \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{\\beta} = \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{b}\\sqrt{\\beta} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} = (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})\\sqrt{\\beta} $$\nThis yields $\\sqrt{\\beta^{\\star}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}}$. Since $ab0$, we have $0  \\sqrt{\\beta^{\\star}}  1$, which is a valid parameter. The optimal momentum parameter is:\n$$ \\beta^{\\star} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}}\\right)^2 $$\nNow, we find the optimal learning rate $\\eta^{\\star}$ using $\\eta a = (1+\\sqrt{\\beta})^2$. First, we compute $1+\\sqrt{\\beta^{\\star}}$:\n$$ 1+\\sqrt{\\beta^{\\star}} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}) + (\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b})}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta^{\\star} a = \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4a}{(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b})^2} $$\n$$ \\eta^{\\star} = \\frac{4}{(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b})^2} $$\nWith these optimal parameters, the spectral radius for both modes is $\\sqrt{\\beta^{\\star}}$, so the worst-case spectral radius for HB is:\n$$ \\rho_{HB} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}} $$\nIn terms of the condition number $\\kappa=a/b$, this is $\\rho_{HB} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\kappa}-1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}+1}$. This rate is significantly better than GD's rate of $\\frac{\\kappa-1}{\\kappa+1}$, especially for large $\\kappa$.\n\n### 3. Discussion and Experiment Proposal\n\nWhen $a \\gg b$, the objective function $f(x,y)$ has a long, narrow valley shape. The condition number $\\kappa = a/b$ is large. The contours of $f$ are highly elongated ellipses. The gradient is steep in the $x$-direction (eigenvalue $a$) and shallow in the $y$-direction (eigenvalue $b$).\n\nFor GD, the optimal learning rate $\\eta_{GD}^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{a+b} \\approx \\frac{2}{a}$ is very small, constrained by the largest eigenvalue $a$ to ensure stability. This small learning rate leads to very slow progress along the flat valley ($y$-direction), as the update $- \\eta \\nabla_y f = -\\eta b y$ is tiny. The algorithm exhibits a characteristic zig-zagging behavior, oscillating across the narrow valley while slowly crawling along its floor toward the minimum.\n\nFor HB, the momentum term $\\beta(\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1})$ acts as a memory of past updates. For the optimal parameters with $a \\gg b$, we have $\\beta^{\\star} \\approx (1 - 2\\sqrt{b/a})^2 \\approx 1 - 4\\sqrt{b/a}$, which is close to $1$. This high value of $\\beta$ ensures that updates are averaged over many steps. The oscillating gradient components across the valley (in the $x$-direction) tend to cancel out over time, while the consistent, small gradient components along the valley (in the $y$-direction) accumulate, building up velocity and accelerating progress. The optimal learning rate $\\eta_{HB}^{\\star} = \\frac{4}{(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b})^2} \\approx \\frac{4}{a}$ is roughly twice that of GD. This larger learning rate is stabilized by the momentum term. The trade-off is potential overshoot; the momentum can cause the iterate to \"fly past\" the minimum and oscillate around it with a larger amplitude than GD, but the overall trajectory is smoother and convergence is much faster.\n\nA concrete experiment to compare the methods would be as follows:\n- **Problem Setup**: Let $a=100$ and $b=1$. This gives a condition number of $\\kappa=100$. The objective is $f(x,y) = 50x^2 + 0.5y^2$.\n- **Algorithm Parameters**:\n  - GD: $\\eta_{GD}^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{100+1} = \\frac{2}{101} \\approx 0.0198$.\n  - HB:\n    - $\\beta^{\\star} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{100}-\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{100}+\\sqrt{1}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)^2 = \\frac{81}{121} \\approx 0.6694$.\n    - $\\eta^{\\star} = \\frac{4}{(\\sqrt{100}+\\sqrt{1})^2} = \\frac{4}{11^2} = \\frac{4}{121} \\approx 0.0331$.\n- **Initialization**: Start at a point that is off-center in the steep direction and far from the minimum in the shallow direction, e.g., $\\mathbf{z}_0 = (x_0, y_0) = (1, 10)$. For HB, initialize with zero velocity by setting $\\mathbf{z}_{-1} = \\mathbf{z}_0$.\n- **Metrics**: Run both algorithms for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., $N=100$). For each iteration $t=0, 1, \\dots, N$, record:\n  1. The iterate position $\\mathbf{z}_t = (x_t, y_t)$.\n  2. The objective function value $f(\\mathbf{z}_t)$.\n  3. The norm of the gradient $\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{z}_t)\\|_2$.\n- **Analysis**:\n  - Plot the trajectories $(\\mathbf{z}_0, \\mathbf{z}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{z}_N)$ for both GD and HB on a 2D contour plot of $f(x,y)$. This will visualize the zig-zagging of GD versus the smoother, faster path of HB.\n  - Plot $f(\\mathbf{z}_t)$ versus $t$ for both methods on a semi-logarithmic scale (logarithm of $f$ vs. linear $t$). This will clearly show the linear convergence rates and demonstrate that HB's convergence slope is much steeper, indicating faster convergence.\n  - Plot $\\|\\nabla f(\\mathbf{z}_t)\\|_2$ versus $t$ on a semi-log scale, which provides another view of the convergence to the critical point.",

All parameters and conditions are formally defined, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the dynamics of the system and the evolution of the expected squared norm of the state vector.\n\nThe loss function is given by $L(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{p} x^{2} - \\lambda_{n} y^{2})$, where $\\lambda_{p}  0$ and $\\lambda_{n}  0$.\nThe gradient of the loss function, $\\nabla L(x, y)$, is:\n$$\n\\nabla L(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{p} x \\\\ -\\lambda_{n} y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{p}  0 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the Hessian matrix at the origin, $\\nabla^2 L(0,0) = \\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_p, -\\lambda_n)$, multiplied by the state vector. As the loss function is quadratic, the gradient is linear, and no approximation is needed.\n\nThe SGD update rule is given by:\n$$\nz_{t+1} = z_{t} - \\eta (\\nabla L(z_{t}) + \\xi_{t})\n$$\nwhere $z_t = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ y_t \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\xi_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I)$. Substituting the gradient, we get:\n$$\nz_{t+1} = z_{t} - \\eta \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{p}  0 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda_{n} \\end{pmatrix} z_t + \\xi_t \\right) = \\left( I - \\eta \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{p}  0 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\right) z_t - \\eta \\xi_t\n$$\nThis results in the following decoupled linear recurrences for the components $x_t$ and $y_t$:\n$$\nx_{t+1} = (1 - \\eta \\lambda_{p}) x_t - \\eta \\xi_{x,t}\n$$\n$$\ny_{t+1} = (1 + \\eta \\lambda_{n}) y_t - \\eta \\xi_{y,t}\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_t = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_{x,t} \\\\ \\xi_{y,t} \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\xi_{x,t}$ and $\\xi_{y,t}$ are independent zero-mean Gaussian random variables with variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\nWe are interested in the evolution of the expected squared Euclidean norm, $E_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\|z_t\\|^2] = \\mathbb{E}[x_t^2 + y_t^2]$. By linearity of expectation, this is $E_t = \\mathbb{E}[x_t^2] + \\mathbb{E}[y_t^2]$. Let us define $u_t = \\mathbb{E}[x_t^2]$ and $v_t = \\mathbb{E}[y_t^2]$.\n\nFor $u_t$, we have:\n$$\nu_{t+1} = \\mathbb{E}[x_{t+1}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[((1 - \\eta \\lambda_{p}) x_t - \\eta \\xi_{x,t})^2]\n$$\n$$\nu_{t+1} = \\mathbb{E}[(1 - \\eta \\lambda_{p})^2 x_t^2 - 2\\eta(1 - \\eta \\lambda_{p}) x_t \\xi_{x,t} + \\eta^2 \\xi_{x,t}^2]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation and the fact that $\\xi_{x,t}$ is independent of $x_t$ with $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{x,t}] = 0$: $\\mathbb{E}[x_t \\xi_{x,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[x_t]\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{x,t}] = 0$. Also, $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{x,t}^2] = \\sigma^2$. This yields the recurrence for $u_t$:\n$$\nu_{t+1} = (1 - \\eta \\lambda_{p})^2 u_t + \\eta^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nBy an identical argument for the $y$ component, we find the recurrence for $v_t$:\n$$\nv_{t+1} = (1 + \\eta \\lambda_{n})^2 v_t + \\eta^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nThe process starts at the origin, $(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)$, so the initial conditions are $u_0 = \\mathbb{E}[x_0^2] = 0$ and $v_0 = \\mathbb{E}[y_0^2] = 0$.\n\nThe escape time $T$ is the smallest non-negative integer $t$ such that $E_t = u_t + v_t \\ge r_*^2$. We can compute $T$ by iterating these recurrences starting from $t=0$ until the condition is met.\n\nNow, we analyze the behavior of $T$. The recurrence for $u_t$ is associated with the positive curvature direction $\\lambda_p$. For typical learning rates satisfying the stability condition $\\eta  2/\\lambda_p$, the multiplicative factor $c_x = (1 - \\eta \\lambda_p)^2$ is less than $1$. Consequently, $u_t$ converges to a finite steady-state value: $u_\\infty = \\frac{\\eta^2 \\sigma^2}{1 - (1-\\eta\\lambda_p)^2}$.\nIn contrast, the recurrence for $v_t$ corresponds to the negative curvature direction $-\\lambda_n$. The factor $c_y = (1 + \\eta \\lambda_n)^2$ is always greater than $1$ for $\\eta  0$ and $\\lambda_n  0$. This means $v_t$ grows exponentially without bound, driving the escape from the saddle point.\n\nThe escape dynamics are therefore dominated by the $y$ component. For large $t$, $E_t \\approx v_t$. The closed-form solution for the recurrence $v_{t+1} = c_y v_t + d$ with $v_0=0$ is $v_t = d \\frac{c_y^t - 1}{c_y - 1}$. Substituting $c_y=(1+\\eta\\lambda_n)^2$ and $d=\\eta^2\\sigma^2$, we have:\n$$\nE_T \\approx v_T = \\eta^2\\sigma^2 \\frac{((1+\\eta\\lambda_n)^2)^T - 1}{(1+\\eta\\lambda_n)^2 - 1} \\ge r_*^2\n$$\nSolving for $T$ provides insight into its dependencies:\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\ln(1 + \\eta \\lambda_n)} \\ln\\left( \\frac{r_*^2 ((1+\\eta\\lambda_n)^2-1)}{\\eta^2\\sigma^2} + 1 \\right)\n$$\n- **Dependence on $\\sigma^2$**: $T$ is approximately proportional to $\\ln(1/\\sigma^2)$. Lower noise variance leads to a logarithmically longer escape time, as the random perturbations that initiate the escape are smaller.\n- **Dependence on $\\eta$**: For small $\\eta  0$, we can use the approximations $\\ln(1 + \\eta\\lambda_n) \\approx \\eta\\lambda_n$ and $(1+\\eta\\lambda_n)^2-1 \\approx 2\\eta\\lambda_n$. The escape time scales as:\n$$\nT \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta\\lambda_n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that as the step size $\\eta$ becomes smaller, the escape time increases, primarily due to the $\\frac{1}{\\eta}$ prefactor.\n- **Dependence on curvatures**: The escape is driven by the negative curvature $\\lambda_n$. A larger magnitude of negative curvature (larger $\\lambda_n$) leads to faster exponential growth and thus a smaller escape time $T$. The positive curvature $\\lambda_p$ only influences a bounded component of the expected norm and has a negligible effect on escape for sufficiently large $r_*$.\n\nThe algorithm to compute $T$ for a given parameter set is:\n1. Handle edge cases: if $r_* \\le 0$, return $T=0$. If $\\sigma^2 = 0$, the particle never leaves the origin, so return $T=-1$.\n2. Initialize time $t=0$, and expected squared components $u=0$ and $v=0$.\n3. Pre-compute constants: $c_x = (1 - \\eta \\lambda_p)^2$, $c_y = (1 + \\eta \\lambda_n)^2$, and the noise term $d = \\eta^2 \\sigma^2$. Also compute the threshold $r_*^2$.\n4. Loop through time steps:\n   a. At step $t$, check if $u+v \\ge r_*^2$. If so, $T=t$ is found; terminate and return $t$.\n   b. Otherwise, update the expected squared components for the next step: $u \\leftarrow c_x u + d$ and $v \\leftarrow c_y v + d$.\n   c. Increment time $t \\leftarrow t+1$.\n\nThis iterative approach is numerically stable and directly implements the derived dynamics.",
