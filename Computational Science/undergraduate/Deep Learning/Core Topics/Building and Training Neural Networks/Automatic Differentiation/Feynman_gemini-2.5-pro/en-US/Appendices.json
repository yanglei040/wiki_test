            "problem": "Consider reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) in the context of deep learning, where gradients of scalar loss functions with respect to parameters are computed efficiently by traversing a computational graph backward using the chain rule. The function of interest is the scalar map $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,y)=\\sin(xy)+\\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$ with $y\\neq 0$. Using only elementary operations compatible with a computational graph (multiplication, sine, exponential, and division), construct a minimal set of intermediate variables that evaluates $f(x,y)$ and a tape that records the parent-child relationships for these operations. Then, using the principle of the chain rule for composite functions and the concept of Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP), derive the exact sequence of backward passes (VJP pulls) needed to obtain the gradient $\\nabla f(x,y)$ by hand. Your derivation should clearly identify the order of traversing the tape in reverse and the local contributions to the adjoints of the inputs at each step. Provide the final analytical expression for $\\nabla f(x,y)$ as a row vector. Do not round; the final answer must be an exact symbolic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The task concerns the application of reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD), a cornerstone algorithm in computational calculus and deep learning, to a differentiable function. The procedure is formalizable and aligns with established principles.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the gradient $\\nabla f(x,y)$ of the function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,y)=\\sin(xy)+\\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$ for $y \\neq 0$, using the principles of reverse-mode AD. This involves a forward pass to construct a computational graph and evaluate the function, followed by a backward pass to propagate gradients.\n\nFirst, we decompose the function into a sequence of elementary operations. This sequence defines the computational graph, or \"tape\". Let the inputs be $v_1 = x$ and $v_2 = y$.\n\n**Forward Pass: Constructing the Computational Graph**\n\nThe evaluation of $f(x,y)$ can be represented by the following minimal set of intermediate variables:\n1.  $v_3 = v_1 \\cdot v_2 = x \\cdot y$\n2.  $v_4 = \\sin(v_3) = \\sin(xy)$\n3.  $v_5 = \\exp(v_1) = \\exp(x)$\n4.  $v_6 = \\frac{v_5}{v_2} = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$\n5.  $v_7 = v_4 + v_6 = \\sin(xy) + \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y} = f(x,y)$\n\nThis sequence constitutes the forward pass. The tape records these operations and their dependencies: $(v_3, \\text{mul}, v_1, v_2)$, $(v_4, \\sin, v_3)$, $(v_5, \\exp, v_1)$, $(v_6, \\text{div}, v_5, v_2)$, $(v_7, \\text{add}, v_4, v_6)$.\n\n**Backward Pass: Gradient Computation using the Chain Rule**\n\nThe backward pass computes the partial derivatives of the final output $v_7$ with respect to each intermediate variable $v_i$, which are denoted as adjoints, $\\bar{v}_i = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_i} = \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_i}$. The process begins by initializing the adjoint of the output node to $1$, i.e., $\\bar{v}_7 = \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_7} = 1$. All other adjoints are initialized to $0$. We then traverse the graph in reverse topological order.\n\nThe core principle is the chain rule. For an operation $v_k = g(v_i, v_j, \\dots)$, the adjoints of its parents are updated by accumulating the child's adjoint multiplied by the local partial derivative:\n$$ \\bar{v}_i = \\bar{v}_i + \\bar{v}_k \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial v_i} $$\n$$ \\bar{v}_j = \\bar{v}_j + \\bar{v}_k \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial v_j} $$\n... and so on. This operation is effectively a Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) pull.\n\nLet's compute the adjoints in reverse order of the forward pass:\n\n1.  **Start:** Initialize adjoints: $\\bar{v}_1=0, \\bar{v}_2=0, \\bar{v}_3=0, \\bar{v}_4=0, \\bar{v}_5=0, \\bar{v}_6=0$.\n    Set the seed for the backward pass: $\\bar{v}_7 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Node $v_7 = v_4 + v_6$:**\n    The parents are $v_4$ and $v_6$.\n    Local partial derivatives: $\\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_4} = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_6} = 1$.\n    Update parent adjoints:\n    $\\bar{v}_4 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_4 + \\bar{v}_7 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_4} = 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    $\\bar{v}_6 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_6 + \\bar{v}_7 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_6} = 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    Current state: $\\bar{v}_4=1, \\bar{v}_6=1$.\n\n3.  **Node $v_6 = \\frac{v_5}{v_2}$:**\n    The parents are $v_5$ and $v_2$.\n    Local partial derivatives: $\\frac{\\partial v_6}{\\partial v_5} = \\frac{1}{v_2}$, $\\frac{\\partial v_6}{\\partial v_2} = -\\frac{v_5}{v_2^2}$.\n    Update parent adjoints:\n    $\\bar{v}_5 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_5 + \\bar{v}_6 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_6}{\\partial v_5} = 0 + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{v_2} = \\frac{1}{y}$.\n    $\\bar{v}_2 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_2 + \\bar{v}_6 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_6}{\\partial v_2} = 0 + 1 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{v_5}{v_2^2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\exp(x)}{y^2}$.\n    Current state: $\\bar{v}_5 = \\frac{1}{y}$, $\\bar{v}_2=-\\frac{\\exp(x)}{y^2}$.\n\n4.  **Node $v_5 = \\exp(v_1)$:**\n    The parent is $v_1$.\n    Local partial derivative: $\\frac{\\partial v_5}{\\partial v_1} = \\exp(v_1)$.\n    Update parent adjoint:\n    $\\bar{v}_1 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_1 + \\bar{v}_5 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_5}{\\partial v_1} = 0 + \\frac{1}{y} \\cdot \\exp(v_1) = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$.\n    Current state: $\\bar{v}_1 = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$.\n\n5.  **Node $v_4 = \\sin(v_3)$:**\n    The parent is $v_3$.\n    Local partial derivative: $\\frac{\\partial v_4}{\\partial v_3} = \\cos(v_3)$.\n    Update parent adjoint:\n    $\\bar{v}_3 \\leftarrow \\bar{v}_3 + \\bar{v}_4 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_4}{\\partial v_3} = 0 + 1 \\cdot \\cos(v_3) = \\cos(xy)$.\n    Current state: $\\bar{v}_3 = \\cos(xy)$.\n\n6.  **Node $v_3 = v_1 \\cdot v_2$:**\n    The parents are $v_1$ and $v_2$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and comparison of two reverse-mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) primitives for the softplus function, $y(x) = \\log(1+e^x)$. One implementation is a \"naive\" direct translation of the formula, and the other is a \"custom VJP\" designed for numerical stability.\n\nFirst, we define the function and its derivative. The softplus function is given by:\n$$y(x) = \\log(1+e^x)$$\nUsing the chain rule, its derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{1+e^x} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(1+e^x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$$\nThis derivative is the logistic sigmoid function, often denoted as $\\sigma(x)$.\n\nA reverse-mode AD primitive for a function $y=f(x)$ generally consists of two parts: a forward pass that computes the primal output value $y$, and a function that provides the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP). The VJP maps a vector from the cotangent space of the output, $\\bar{y}$, to a vector in the cotangent space of the input, $\\bar{x}$, via the relation $\\bar{x} = J_f^T \\bar{y}$, where $J_f$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f$. For a scalar function $y=f(x)$, the Jacobian is simply the scalar derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. The cotangent \"vector\" $\\bar{y}$ is a scalar, denoted as $v$ in the problem statement. Therefore, the VJP is the scalar product $v \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx}$. A standard method to recover the gradient itself is to evaluate the VJP with $v=1$.\n\nWe will now analyze the numerical stability of the naive implementation and derive a stable alternative.\n\n**Naive AD Implementation**\nA direct implementation uses the formulas as written:\n- Primal: $y = \\log(1+e^x)$\n- Gradient: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$\n\nLet us analyze the behavior of these expressions in floating-point arithmetic for extreme values of $x$.\n1.  **Large Positive $x$ (e.g., $x \\to \\infty$):** The term $e^x$ grows exponentially. For sufficiently large $x$ (e.g., $x > 709.78$ in standard $64$-bit floats), $e^x$ overflows, yielding an infinite value (`inf`).\n    - Naive Primal: $y = \\log(1 + \\text{inf}) = \\log(\\text{inf}) = \\text{inf}$. This is numerically incorrect. Asymptotically, for large $x$, $y(x) \\approx \\log(e^x) = x$.\n    - Naive Gradient: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\text{inf}}{1+\\text{inf}} = \\frac{\\text{inf}}{\\text{inf}}$, which evaluates to `NaN` (Not a Number). This is also incorrect. Asymptotically, the gradient should approach $1$.\n\n2.  **Large Negative $x$ (e.g., $x \\to -\\infty$):** The term $e^x$ underflows to $0$.\n    - Naive Primal: $y = \\log(1+0) = 0$. This is numerically stable and correct.\n    - Naive Gradient: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{0}{1+0} = 0$. This is also a stable and correct evaluation.\n\nThe naive implementation is clearly flawed due to overflow for large positive inputs.\n\n**Custom VJP: A Numerically Stable Implementation**\nTo create a stable implementation, we must algebraically rearrange the expressions to avoid computing $e^x$ for large positive $x$.\n\nFor the primal value $y(x)$, when $x > 0$:\n$$y(x) = \\log(1+e^x) = \\log\\left(e^x \\cdot (e^{-x} + 1)\\right) = \\log(e^x) + \\log(1+e^{-x}) = x + \\log(1+e^{-x})$$\nIn this form, for large positive $x$, we compute $e^{-x}$, which safely underflows to $0$. The expression $x + \\log(1+e^{-x})$ correctly evaluates to approximately $x$, avoiding overflow. For $x \\le 0$, the original expression $y(x) = \\log(1+e^x)$ is stable.\n\nFor the gradient $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, when $x > 0$:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} = \\frac{e^x \\cdot e^{-x}}{(1+e^x) \\cdot e^{-x}} = \\frac{1}{e^{-x} + 1}$$\nThis form also avoids overflow for large positive $x$ by using $e^{-x}$, and correctly evaluates to approximately $1$. For $x \\le 0$, the original expression $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$ is stable.\n\nCombining these observations, we can define a piecewise function for stable computation:\n- **Stable Primal $y(x)$**:\n$$\ny_{stable}(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \nx + \\log(1+e^{-x}) & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n\\log(1+e^x) & \\text{if } x \\le 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n- **Stable Gradient $\\frac{dy}{dx}(x)$**:\n$$\ng_{stable}(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\\n\\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} & \\text{if } x < 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe split point for the gradient is chosen as $x=0$, where both expressions evaluate to $\\frac{1}{2}$, ensuring continuity. Using $x \\ge 0$ for the first case ensures the point $x=0$ is handled correctly.\n\nThe custom VJP primitive will implement these stable computations. It will compute $y_{stable}$ and $g_{stable}$, then return $y_{stable}$ and a callable function (a closure) that takes $v$ and returns the product $v \\cdot g_{stable}$.\n\nThe test suite will then compare the outputs of the naive and stable primitives for a set of input values, checking for finiteness and agreement within a specified tolerance, thereby demonstrating the failure of the naive approach and the correctness of the stable one.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and implementation of the gradient of the scalar loss function $\\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma;\\alpha)$ with respect to a symmetric positive definite matrix $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. The loss function is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma;\\alpha) \\;=\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\|\\Sigma\\|_F^2 \\;-\\; \\alpha\\,\\log\\det(\\Sigma)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$ is a positive scalar, $\\|\\cdot\\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm, and $\\det(\\cdot)$ is the determinant. The matrix $\\Sigma$ is guaranteed to be symmetric positive definite ($\\Sigma \\succ 0$), which ensures that $\\det(\\Sigma)  0$.\n\nOur derivation will be based on first principles, starting from the definition of the matrix differential. The gradient $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}$ is the unique symmetric matrix that satisfies the relation $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L} = \\operatorname{tr}((\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L})^\\top \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma) = \\langle \\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}, \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma \\rangle$ for any symmetric perturbation $\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the Frobenius inner product.\n\nThe loss function consists of two terms. We will find the differential of each term separately.\n\n**1. Differential of the Frobenius norm term**\n\nLet the first term be $f_1(\\Sigma) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\|\\Sigma\\|_F^2$. The Frobenius norm is defined as $\\|\\Sigma\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^\\top \\Sigma)}$. Thus, the term is $f_1(\\Sigma) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^\\top \\Sigma)$. Since $\\Sigma$ is symmetric, $\\Sigma^\\top = \\Sigma$, and we can write $f_1(\\Sigma) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^2)$.\n\nTo find its differential, we apply the product rule for differentials:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}f_1 = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^2) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathrm{d}(\\Sigma^2)) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}((\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\\Sigma + \\Sigma(\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma))\n$$\nUsing the linearity and cyclic property of the trace operator ($\\operatorname{tr}(AB) = \\operatorname{tr}(BA)$):\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}f_1 = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}((\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\\Sigma) + \\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma))) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)) + \\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma))) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma$ is symmetric, this is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^\\top \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$. This is in the form $\\operatorname{tr}(G_1^\\top \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$ where $G_1 = \\Sigma$. Therefore, the gradient of the first term is $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}f_1 = \\Sigma$.\n\n**2. Differential of the log-determinant term**\n\nLet the second term be $f_2(\\Sigma) = -\\alpha\\,\\log\\det(\\Sigma)$. Using the chain rule for differentials, where $\\mathrm{d}(\\log u) = u^{-1}\\mathrm{d}u$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}f_2 = -\\alpha\\,\\frac{1}{\\det(\\Sigma)}\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\det(\\Sigma))\n$$\nFor the differential of the determinant, we use Jacobi's identity, which states that for an invertible matrix $\\Sigma$, $\\mathrm{d}\\det(\\Sigma) = \\det(\\Sigma)\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$. This identity is a standard result in matrix calculus. Substituting this into our expression for $\\mathrm{d}f_2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}f_2 = -\\alpha\\,\\frac{1}{\\det(\\Sigma)}\\,\\left(\\det(\\Sigma)\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\\right) = -\\alpha\\,\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma$ is symmetric, its inverse $\\Sigma^{-1}$ is also symmetric. Thus, we can write this as $\\operatorname{tr}((-\\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1})^\\top\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$. This is in the form $\\operatorname{tr}(G_2^\\top \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$, where $G_2 = -\\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1}$. Therefore, the gradient of the second term is $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}f_2 = -\\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1}$.\n\n**3. Total Gradient**\n\nCombining the differentials of the two terms, we get the total differential of the loss function:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L} = \\mathrm{d}f_1 + \\mathrm{d}f_2 = \\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma) - \\alpha\\,\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma) = \\operatorname{tr}((\\Sigma-\\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)\n$$\nThe matrix $G = \\Sigma - \\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1}$ is symmetric because both $\\Sigma$ and $\\Sigma^{-1}$ are symmetric. Thus, $G^\\top = G$. The differential can be written as $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L} = \\operatorname{tr}(G^\\top \\mathrm{d}\\Sigma)$. By definition, the gradient of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the symmetric matrix $\\Sigma$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma;\\alpha) = \\Sigma - \\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1}\n$$\n\n**4. Algorithmic Backward Passes**\n\nThe core of the gradient computation is evaluating the term $\\Sigma^{-1}$. We implement two approaches.\n\n**Algorithm 1 (Stable Cholesky-based backward):** This method avoids explicit computation of the matrix inverse, which is prone to numerical instability for ill-conditioned matrices. Since $\\Sigma$ is symmetric positive definite, it admits a unique Cholesky factorization $\\Sigma = LL^\\top$, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries. To compute $X = \\Sigma^{-1}$, we can solve the linear system $\\Sigma X = I$ for $X$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting the Cholesky factorization gives $LL^\\top X = I$. This can be solved in two stages using triangular solves, which are numerically stable and efficient:\n1.  Solve $LY = I$ for $Y$ using forward substitution. This yields $Y=L^{-1}$.\n2.  Solve $L^\\top X = Y$ for $X$ using backward substitution. This yields $X = (L^\\top)^{-1}Y = (L^\\top)^{-1}L^{-1} = (LL^\\top)^{-1} = \\Sigma^{-1}$.\nThe gradient is then computed as $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L} = \\Sigma - \\alpha X$.\n\n**Algorithm 2 (Generic-determinant backward):** This approach simulates the pathway a generic automatic differentiation (AD) system might take. If the AD system has a rule for the matrix inverse but not a specialized rule for the $\\log\\det$ of an SPD matrix, it would compute the gradient via the explicit inverse. This involves directly calculating $\\Sigma^{-1}$ using a general-purpose inversion algorithm (e.g., based on LU decomposition). The gradient is then computed as $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L} = \\Sigma - \\alpha\\,\\Sigma^{-1}$. This method can be less accurate and stable than the Cholesky-based approach.\n\n**5. Numerical Verification**\n\nThe correctness of the derived gradient and its implementation is verified through two numerical checks.\n\n**Gradient Comparison:** We compute the relative Frobenius-norm difference between the gradient computed by the stable method ($\\nabla_1$) and the generic method ($\\nabla_2$):\n$$\n\\mathrm{err\\_grad} = \\frac{\\|\\nabla_1 - \\nabla_2\\|_F}{\\|\\nabla_1\\|_F}\n$$\nThis measures the numerical discrepancy between the two computational paths.\n\n**Finite-Difference Check:** We validate the analytical gradient $\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}$ (computed via the stable method) by comparing its projection onto a random symmetric direction $H$ (with $\\|H\\|_F=1$) with a finite-difference approximation. The analytical directional derivative is $\\langle \\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}, H \\rangle = \\operatorname{tr}((\\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L})^\\top H)$. The central difference approximation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma+tH;\\alpha) - \\mathcal{L}(\\Sigma-tH;\\alpha)}{2t}\n$$\nfor a small step size $t$ (e.g., $t=10^{-7}$). The relative error between the analytical and numerical directional derivatives is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{err\\_fd} = \\frac{|\\langle \\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}, H \\rangle - \\text{FD approx}|}{|\\langle \\nabla_{\\Sigma}\\mathcal{L}, H \\rangle|}\n$$\nThis check provides strong evidence for the correctness of our derived gradient formula.",
