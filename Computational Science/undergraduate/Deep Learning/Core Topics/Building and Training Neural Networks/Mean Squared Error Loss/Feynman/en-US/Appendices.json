This first exercise provides a foundational comparison between Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), two of the most common loss functions for regression.

The model's accuracy is assessed using loss functions, which quantify the penalty for incorrect predictions. Let the true measured temperature on a given day be denoted by $y$, and the model's predicted temperature be $\\hat{y}$.\n\nTwo common loss functions are being considered:\n1.  The Squared Error Loss, defined as $L_2(y, \\hat{y}) = (y - \\hat{y})^2$.\n2.  The Absolute Error Loss, defined as $L_1(y, \\hat{y}) = |y - \\hat{y}|$.\n\nOn a specific test day in the Antarctic, the model's temperature prediction is off by exactly $3.5$ Kelvin. Calculate the numerical value of the ratio of the penalty assigned by the squared error loss to the penalty assigned by the absolute error loss for this specific prediction.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the squared error loss to the absolute error loss for a given prediction error. Let the true temperature be $y$ and the predicted temperature be $\\hat{y}$.\n\nThe squared error loss is given by the formula:\n$$L_2(y, \\hat{y}) = (y - \\hat{y})^2$$\n\nThe absolute error loss is given by the formula:\n$$L_1(y, \\hat{y}) = |y - \\hat{y}|$$\n\nWe are given that the magnitude of the prediction error is $3.5$ Kelvin. This means that the absolute difference between the true value and the predicted value is $3.5$. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n$$|y - \\hat{y}| = 3.5$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of each loss function for this specific error.\n\nFor the absolute error loss, we can directly substitute the given error magnitude:\n$$L_1 = |y - \\hat{y}| = 3.5$$\nThe penalty from the absolute error loss is $3.5$.\n\nFor the squared error loss, we use the fact that $(y-\\hat{y})^2 = (|y-\\hat{y}|)^2$. Substituting the given error magnitude:\n$$L_2 = (y - \\hat{y})^2 = (|y - \\hat{y}|)^2 = (3.5)^2$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$L_2 = 3.5 \\times 3.5 = 12.25$$\nThe penalty from the squared error loss is $12.25$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the squared error loss to the absolute error loss. Let's call this ratio $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{L_2(y, \\hat{y})}{L_1(y, \\hat{y})}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values for the losses:\n$$R = \\frac{12.25}{3.5}$$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can express $12.25$ as $(3.5)^2$:\n$$R = \\frac{(3.5)^2}{3.5} = 3.5$$\n\nThus, for a prediction error of $3.5$ Kelvin, the penalty from the squared error loss is $3.5$ times larger than the penalty from the absolute error loss. The units of temperature (Kelvin for the error, Kelvin$^2$ for $L_2$, Kelvin for $L_1$) cancel out in the ratio, resulting in a dimensionless quantity.",

This practice guides you through deriving and demonstrating that the optimal constant prediction for a set of data points is their arithmetic mean, the value that minimizes the squared error.

Let the dataset be $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ with $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Define the per-sample loss as the squared error $\\ell(\\hat{y},y) = (\\hat{y}-y)^2$, and define the Mean Squared Error (MSE) empirical risk over a subset $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ as $L(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{D}) = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} (\\theta - y_i)^2$ for a scalar predictor $\\theta$ that is constant within the subset. In the conditional prediction setting with discrete inputs, consider a model that predicts a separate constant for each input value: for each $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, the model returns $f(x) = \\theta_x$, and the empirical risk decomposes by input value as $L_{\\text{emp}}(\\{\\theta_x\\}) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\sum_{i : x_i = x} (\\theta_x - y_i)^2$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and first principles of convex optimization (for example, minimizing a differentiable convex quadratic by setting the derivative to zero), derive what scalar $\\theta_x$ minimizes the empirical risk restricted to a single input value $x$ when samples for that input may be duplicated. Let each sample index $i$ carry a nonnegative integer duplication count $c_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$, and suppose the empirical risk for input $x$ is $L_x(\\theta_x) = \\sum_{i : x_i = x} c_i \\, (\\theta_x - y_i)^2$.

Use a dataset with two input values and the following labels:\n- For $x=0$, let the labels be $y$ values $[1.0, 3.0]$.\n- For $x=1$, let the labels be $y$ values $[0.0, 4.0]$.\n\nFor each test case below, let the duplication counts per sample be specified as arrays aligned with the label order of each input value. For example, for $x=0$ the first count applies to $y=1.0$ and the second to $y=3.0$, and for $x=1$ the first count applies to $y=0.0$ and the second to $y=4.0$. For each test case:\n- Compute the original per-input empirical minimizers (with all duplication counts equal to $1$).\n- Compute the duplicated per-input empirical minimizers using the provided counts.\n- Output, for each input value $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$, the difference $\\Delta_x = \\theta_x^{\\text{dup}} - \\theta_x^{\\text{orig}}$.\n\nDesign a test suite that covers varied duplication scenarios:\n- Test case $1$ (happy path): $x=0$ counts $[1,1]$, $x=1$ counts $[1,3]$.\n- Test case $2$ (boundary, no duplication): $x=0$ counts $[1,1]$, $x=1$ counts $[1,1]$.\n- Test case $3$ (edge, heavy duplication in $x=0$): $x=0$ counts $[5,1]$, $x=1$ counts $[1,1]$.\n- Test case $4$ (edge, balanced duplication in both inputs): $x=0$ counts $[2,2]$, $x=1$ counts $[2,2]$.\n- Test case $5$ (edge, removal of one label in $x=1$ by zero duplication): $x=0$ counts $[1,1]$, $x=1$ counts $[0,2]$.\n\nThe required final output format is a single line containing the list of results, one per test case, where each result is the list $[\\Delta_0,\\Delta_1]$ for that case.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the optimal scalar predictor $\\theta_x$ that minimizes a weighted empirical risk for a specific input value $x$. The risk function is defined as the weighted sum of squared errors.\n\nLet the set of sample indices corresponding to a discrete input value $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ be denoted by $I_x = \\{i \\mid x_i = x\\}$. The empirical risk for this input value, incorporating nonnegative integer duplication counts $c_i$, is given by:\n$$\nL_x(\\theta_x) = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i (\\theta_x - y_i)^2\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_x$ is the constant prediction for input $x$, $\\{y_i\\}_{i \\in I_x}$ are the corresponding target values, and $\\{c_i\\}_{i \\in I_x}$ are the duplication counts.\n\nThe function $L_x(\\theta_x)$ is a quadratic function of $\\theta_x$. It can be expanded as:\n$$\nL_x(\\theta_x) = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i (\\theta_x^2 - 2\\theta_x y_i + y_i^2) = \\left(\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i\\right)\\theta_x^2 - \\left(2\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i y_i\\right)\\theta_x + \\left(\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i y_i^2\\right)\n$$\nThis is an upward-opening parabola in $\\theta_x$ as long as the coefficient of the $\\theta_x^2$ term, $\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i$, is positive. This condition holds if at least one sample for input $x$ has a count $c_i > 0$. Under this condition, the function is strictly convex and has a unique global minimum.\n\nTo find the value of $\\theta_x$ that minimizes $L_x(\\theta_x)$, we apply the first-order necessary condition for optimality by taking the derivative of $L_x(\\theta_x)$ with respect to $\\theta_x$ and setting it to zero.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dL_x(\\theta_x)}{d\\theta_x} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta_x} \\left( \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i (\\theta_x - y_i)^2 \\right)\n$$\n\nBy linearity of differentiation, we can move the derivative inside the summation:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_x(\\theta_x)}{d\\theta_x} = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} \\frac{d}{d\\theta_x} \\left( c_i (\\theta_x - y_i)^2 \\right)\n$$\n\nApplying the chain rule, where $\\frac{d}{du}(u^2) = 2u$:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_x(\\theta_x)}{d\\theta_x} = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i \\cdot 2(\\theta_x - y_i) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\theta_x}(\\theta_x - y_i) = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} 2 c_i (\\theta_x - y_i)\n$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in I_x} 2 c_i (\\theta_x - y_i) = 0\n$$\n\nWe can divide by the constant $2$ and distribute the summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i \\theta_x - \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i y_i = 0\n$$\n\nSince $\\theta_x$ is a constant with respect to the index $i$, it can be factored out of the first sum:\n$$\n\\theta_x \\left( \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i \\right) = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i y_i\n$$\n\nSolving for $\\theta_x$, we obtain the minimizer, which we will denote as $\\theta_x^*$:\n$$\n\\theta_x^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i y_i}{\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i}\n$$\nThis assumes that $\\sum_{i \\in I_x} c_i \\neq 0$. If all counts were zero, $L_x(\\theta_x)$ would be identically zero, and any $\\theta_x$ would be a minimizer. The problem context, however, ensures this denominator is non-zero in all test cases.\n\nTo confirm this critical point is a minimum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2L_x(\\theta_x)}{d\\theta_x^2} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta_x} \\left( \\sum_{i \\in I_x} 2 c_i (\\theta_x - y_i) \\right) = \\sum_{i \\in I_x} 2 c_i\n$$\nSince the counts $c_i$ are nonnegative integers and at least one is positive, the second derivative $\\sum_{i \\in I_x} 2 c_i > 0$. A positive second derivative confirms that the function $L_x(\\theta_x)$ is strictly convex and that the critical point $\\theta_x^*$ is indeed a unique global minimum.\n\nThe derived expression for $\\theta_x^*$ is a weighted average of the target values $\\{y_i\\}_{i \\in I_x}$, where the weights are the duplication counts $\\{c_i\\}_{i \\in I_x}$. In the absence of duplication, all counts are $c_i=1$. The expression then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\theta_x^* \\text{ (unweighted)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_x} y_i}{\\sum_{i \\in I_x} 1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_x} y_i}{|I_x|}\n$$\nThis is the unweighted conditional mean of the target values for the given input $x$.\n\nWhen the counts $c_i$ are not uniform, they act as weights that give more importance to samples with higher duplication. A sample $(x_i, y_i)$ with a large count $c_i$ will contribute more significantly to both the numerator and the denominator of the weighted average. Consequently, the optimal predictor $\\theta_x^*$ is \"pulled\" towards those $y_i$ values that are associated with higher counts. This demonstrates how duplication counts, or more generally sample weights, can bias the minimizer of the squared error loss away from the unweighted conditional mean and toward specific data points deemed more important.\n\nThe simulation will apply this formula to compute the minimizers under different duplication scenarios and quantify the resulting bias as the difference $\\Delta_x = \\theta_x^{\\text{dup}} - \\theta_x^{\\text{orig}}$.",
