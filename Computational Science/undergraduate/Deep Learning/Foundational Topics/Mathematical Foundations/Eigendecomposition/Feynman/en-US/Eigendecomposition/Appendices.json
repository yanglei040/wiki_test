This practice explores how eigendecomposition of the Hessian matrix, which captures this curvature, provides a powerful analytical tool. You will investigate the effect of $L_2$ regularization, a ubiquitous technique in deep learning, and discover its elegant geometric interpretation: it systematically increases the curvature in all directions, making the optimization problem better-conditioned . This exercise bridges theory and practice by having you first derive this property analytically and then verify it precisely through a numerical experiment you will build from scratch.",

            "problem": "Consider binary classification with empirical risk minimization (ERM) using the logistic loss for labels in $\\{0,1\\}$. Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ be the design matrix whose rows are samples, $y \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n}$ be the label vector, and $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be the parameter vector. Define the logistic function $\\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}}$ and the empirical risk $R(w) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell(w; x_i, y_i)$ with $\\ell(w; x_i, y_i) = - y_i \\log \\sigma(x_i^\\top w) - (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\sigma(x_i^\\top w))$. Define the squared Euclidean norm penalty (L2) with strength $\\lambda \\ge 0$ by $P_\\lambda(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\lVert w \\rVert_2^2$, and the regularized risk $R_\\lambda(w) = R(w) + P_\\lambda(w)$. The Hessian of a twice-differentiable function $F$ at $w$ is the matrix of second partial derivatives $\\nabla^2 F(w)$. Using only the definitions of $R(w)$, $P_\\lambda(w)$, and the rules of differentiation, analytically derive the Hessian of $R_\\lambda(w)$ in terms of the Hessian of $R(w)$ and identify how the eigenvalues of the Hessian are affected by the penalty strength $\\lambda$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of optimization and machine learning, is well-posed with a clear and numerically verifiable objective, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nHerein, a complete solution is provided, comprising an analytical derivation followed by the design of a numerical experiment.\n\n### Analytical Derivation of the Hessian and its Spectral Shift\n\nThe objective is to derive the Hessian of the L2-regularized logistic regression risk, $R_\\lambda(w)$, and determine how its eigenvalues are affected by the regularization parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nThe regularized risk is defined as the sum of the empirical risk $R(w)$ and a penalty term $P_\\lambda(w)$:\n$$\nR_\\lambda(w) = R(w) + P_\\lambda(w)\n$$\nwhere $R(w) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell(w; x_i, y_i)$ and $P_\\lambda(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\lVert w \\rVert_2^2$.\n\nThe Hessian operator, $\\nabla^2$, is a linear operator. Therefore, the Hessian of the regularized risk is the sum of the Hessians of the empirical risk and the penalty term:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 R_\\lambda(w) = \\nabla^2 R(w) + \\nabla^2 P_\\lambda(w)\n$$\n\nLet us compute the Hessian of the penalty term, $\\nabla^2 P_\\lambda(w)$. The penalty term is $P_\\lambda(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{d} w_j^2$.\nThe first partial derivative with respect to a component $w_k$ of the vector $w$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_\\lambda(w)}{\\partial w_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_k} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{d} w_j^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\cdot (2 w_k) = \\lambda w_k\n$$\nThis means the gradient is $\\nabla P_\\lambda(w) = \\lambda w$.\n\nThe second partial derivatives form the entries of the Hessian matrix. The $(j,k)$-th entry is:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 P_\\lambda(w))_{jk} = \\frac{\\partial^2 P_\\lambda(w)}{\\partial w_j \\partial w_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_j} (\\lambda w_k)\n$$\nThis derivative is $\\lambda$ if $j=k$, and $0$ if $j \\neq k$. This can be written using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{jk}$.\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 P_\\lambda(w))_{jk} = \\lambda \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThis is the definition of the matrix $\\lambda I_d$, where $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix. Thus, $\\nabla^2 P_\\lambda(w) = \\lambda I_d$.\n\nSubstituting this result back, we obtain the relationship between the regularized and unregularized Hessians:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 R_\\lambda(w) = \\nabla^2 R(w) + \\lambda I_d\n$$\nLet's denote the unregularized Hessian as $H_{\\text{unreg}}(w) = \\nabla^2 R(w)$ and the regularized Hessian as $H_{\\text{reg}}(w, \\lambda) = \\nabla^2 R_\\lambda(w)$. The relationship is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{reg}}(w, \\lambda) = H_{\\text{unreg}}(w) + \\lambda I_d\n$$\nNow, we analyze the effect of this relationship on the eigenvalues. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of the unregularized Hessian $H_{\\text{unreg}}(w)$ with a corresponding eigenvalue $\\mu$. By definition:\n$$\nH_{\\text{unreg}}(w) v = \\mu v\n$$\nApplying the regularized Hessian $H_{\\text{reg}}(w, \\lambda)$ to this eigenvector $v$:\n$$\nH_{\\text{reg}}(w, \\lambda) v = (H_{\\text{unreg}}(w) + \\lambda I_d) v = H_{\\text{unreg}}(w) v + \\lambda I_d v = \\mu v + \\lambda v = (\\mu + \\lambda) v\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $H_{\\text{reg}}(w, \\lambda)$, and its corresponding eigenvalue is $\\mu + \\lambda$. Since the Hessians are real and symmetric, they possess a complete orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. This property holds for all eigenvectors, which implies that the entire spectrum of the regularized Hessian is shifted by a constant value $\\lambda$ relative to the spectrum of the unregularized Hessian.\n\nThe constant spectral shift identified is therefore $\\Delta = \\lambda$. The numerical experiment is designed to verify that the quantity $\\left| \\, \\lambda_j\\big(H_{\\text{reg}}(w_k,\\lambda)\\big) - \\lambda_j\\big(H_{\\text{unreg}}(w_k)\\big) - \\lambda \\, \\right|$ is close to zero, where differences from zero are attributable to floating-point precision errors.\n\n### Numerical Experiment Design\n\nThe numerical experiment is structured to isolate and verify this analytical finding.\n\n1.  **Data Generation**: Synthetic datasets $(X, y)$ are generated with fixed random seeds for reproducibility. The feature matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is sampled from a standard normal distribution. A ground-truth parameter vector $w_\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is also sampled. Logits $z = X w_\\star$ are computed, which are then passed through the logistic function $\\sigma(t) = (1+e^{-t})^{-1}$ to produce probabilities $p_i = \\sigma(z_i)$. The binary labels $y_i$ are then sampled from a Bernoulli distribution, $y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$. For rank-deficient cases, two columns of $X$ are made identical, reducing its rank by at least one.\n\n2.  **Gradient Descent Trajectory**: Full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) is performed for $K$ iterations, starting from $w_0 = 0$. Crucially, the updates use the gradient of the *unregularized* risk $R(w)$, given by $\\nabla R(w) = \\frac{1}{n} X^\\top (\\sigma(Xw) - y)$. This ensures that the sequence of iterates $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_{K-1}$ is independent of $\\lambda$, allowing for a controlled comparison.\n\n3.  **Hessian Evaluation**: At each iterate $w_k$ along this trajectory, both the unregularized and regularized Hessians are computed. The unregularized Hessian of the logistic risk is given by the formula:\n    $$\n    H_{\\text{unreg}}(w_k) = \\nabla^2 R(w_k) = \\frac{1}{n} X^\\top S_k X\n    $$\n    where $S_k$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are $S_{ii} = p_{k,i}(1-p_{k,i})$, with $p_k = \\sigma(Xw_k)$. The regularized Hessian is then found by $H_{\\text{reg}}(w_k, \\lambda) = H_{\\text{unreg}}(w_k) + \\lambda I_d$.\n\n4.  **Spectral Analysis and Metric Calculation**: For each pair of Hessians computed at step $k$, their eigenvalues are calculated using a numerical eigensolver for symmetric matrices, which returns them sorted in ascending order. Let these sorted eigenvalues be $\\lambda_j(H_{\\text{unreg}}(w_k))$ and $\\lambda_j(H_{\\text{reg}}(w_k, \\lambda))$. The core of the analysis is to compute the deviation from the theoretical expectation:\n    $$\n    d_{k,j} = \\left| \\, \\lambda_j\\big(H_{\\text{reg}}(w_k,\\lambda)\\big) - \\lambda_j\\big(H_{\\text{unreg}}(w_k)\\big) - \\lambda \\, \\right|\n    $$\n    The final reported metric, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, is the maximum of these deviations over all eigenvalues $j$ and all GD steps $k$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{\\max} = \\max_{0 \\le k  K} \\left( \\max_j d_{k,j} \\right)\n    $$\n    This value quantifies the maximum discrepancy between the numerical results and the analytical theory, which should be on the order of machine precision.",

At each iteration $t$ with current parameters $\\theta_t$:\n$1.$ We compute the gradient $\\nabla f(\\theta_t)$, its norm $\\|\\nabla f(\\theta_t)\\|$, and the Hessian $H(\\theta_t)$.\n$2.$ We perform an eigendecomposition of $H(\\theta_t)$ to find its smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min}$, and the corresponding unit eigenvector, $v_{\\min}$.\n$3.$ A decision is made based on two thresholds, $g_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$ for the gradient norm and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$ for the negative curvature.\n\nThe update rule is as follows:\n- **If $\\lambda_{\\min}  -\\lambda_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$ and $\\|\\nabla f(\\theta_t)\\| \\le g_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$**: This condition indicates that we are near a stationary point (weak gradient) that has a significant direction of negative curvature. A standard gradient descent step would be very slow. To escape the saddle region, we perform a \"negative curvature escape\" step. This step moves the parameters along the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue. The update rule is:\n$$\n\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t + s_{\\mathrm{esc}} v_{\\min}\n$$\nThe problem requires designing a step size $s_{\\mathrm{esc}}$ that is scaled by the curvature magnitude. A principled choice, inspired by trust-region methods, is to make the step size inversely proportional to the magnitude of the negative curvature, while using a baseline magnitude $s_0$ and a small regularization constant $\\varepsilon$ to prevent division by zero. Thus, we define the escape step size as:\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{esc}} = \\frac{s_0}{|\\lambda_{\\min}| + \\varepsilon}\n$$\nThis design ensures a larger step when the curvature is nearly flat (small $|\\lambda_{\\min}|$) and a smaller, safer step when the curvature is sharp (large $|\\lambda_{\\min}|$). The direction is taken from the unit eigenvector $v_{\\min}$ returned by the eigendecomposition routine.\n\n- **Otherwise**: If the gradient is sufficiently large or if there is no significant negative curvature, the standard gradient descent update is more effective. This update is:\n$$\n\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\theta_t)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the learning rate (step size).\n\nThis iterative procedure is repeated for a maximum of $T=200$ iterations for each specified initial point $\\theta_0$. We will track the number of escape steps taken. After the final iteration, we report the required metrics: the total escape count, whether the final Hessian has a negative eigenvalue, the final loss value, and the final parameter vector, with all real values rounded to $6$ decimal places.",

Consider a nonzero parameter-direction vector and its associated curvature along that direction. Your tasks are to derive a scale-invariant directional curvature measure from first principles, connect it to eigendecomposition, and use it to design a pruning rule.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- For a twice-differentiable scalar loss function, the second-order Taylor expansion around a point yields, for a small step of size $\\alpha$ in direction $\\mathbf{v}$, a quadratic change that is governed by the quadratic form $\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the symmetric Hessian matrix at the point of expansion.\n- The Hessian $\\mathbf{H}$ of a twice-differentiable scalar loss at a point is a real symmetric matrix, hence it admits a real eigendecomposition with an orthonormal eigenbasis and real eigenvalues.\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct a scale-invariant measure of directional curvature from the quadratic form, and use it as a curvature importance score for pruning.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of multivariable calculus and linear algebra as applied to optimization in deep learning, specifically concerning the analysis of the loss landscape via the Hessian matrix. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe core task is to develop and apply a scale-invariant measure of directional curvature. The change in a loss function $L$ for a small step of size $\\alpha$ in a direction $\\mathbf{v}$ from a point $\\mathbf{w}_0$ is approximated by the second-order Taylor expansion:\n$$ L(\\mathbf{w}_0 + \\alpha\\mathbf{v}) \\approx L(\\mathbf{w}_0) + \\alpha \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_0)^{\\top}\\mathbf{v} + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2} \\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v} $$\nAt a critical point where the gradient $\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_0)$ is zero, the local change in loss is determined by the quadratic form $\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the Hessian matrix evaluated at $\\mathbf{w}_0$. This term describes the curvature of the loss surface in the direction of $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Scale-Invariant Curvature Importance Score**\n\nThe quadratic form $\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}$ itself is not a suitable measure of directional curvature because it depends on the magnitude of the direction vector $\\mathbf{v}$. If we scale the vector by a nonzero constant $k$, the quadratic form changes:\n$$ (k\\mathbf{v})^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}(k\\mathbf{v}) = k^2(\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}) $$\nThe measure scales with $k^2$, meaning it reflects the \"length\" of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ rather than just its direction. To create a measure that is intrinsic to the direction alone, we must normalize this quantity. A natural choice for normalization is the squared Euclidean norm of the vector, $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}$. This leads to the **Rayleigh quotient**, which we define as the curvature importance score, $s(\\mathbf{v})$:\n$$ s(\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}} $$\nThis score is scale-invariant for any nonzero scalar $k$:\n$$ s(k\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{(k\\mathbf{v})^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}(k\\mathbf{v})}{(k\\mathbf{v})^{\\top}(k\\mathbf{v})} = \\frac{k^2(\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v})}{k^2(\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v})} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}} = s(\\mathbf{v}) $$\nThis property makes $s(\\mathbf{v})$ a pure measure of curvature in the direction of $\\mathbf{v}$, independent of its magnitude. For numerical stability, as per the problem statement, if the squared norm $\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}$ is less than a small positive constant $\\varepsilon$, we define the score to be $0$. This convention treats directions of negligible magnitude as having zero curvature importance.\n\n**2. Connection to Eigendecomposition and Boundedness**\n\nThe Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ is given as real and symmetric. A fundamental property of such matrices is that they are orthogonally diagonalizable and have real eigenvalues. The Rayleigh-Ritz theorem establishes a direct connection between the Rayleigh quotient and the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{H}$. The theorem states that the value of the Rayleigh quotient for any nonzero vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is bounded by the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{H}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{H}) \\le s(\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}} \\le \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{H}) $$\nThe minimum value, $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{H})$, is achieved when $\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue. Similarly, the maximum value, $\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{H})$, is achieved when $\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector for the largest eigenvalue. This theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing the range of possible curvatures and forms the basis for the verification step required by the problem. For each computed score $s$, we must verify that it lies within the interval $[\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{H}) - \\tau, \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{H}) + \\tau]$ for a given numerical tolerance $\\tau$.\n\n**3. Pruning Rule and Verification Procedure**\n\nThe implemented procedure for each test case adheres to the following logic:\n\n**For each case $k$ with Hessian $\\mathbf{H}_k$, directions $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{k,i}\\}$, threshold $t_k$, cutoff $\\varepsilon$, and tolerance $\\tau$:**\n1.  Initialize a counter for pruned directions, $c_k = 0$, and a boolean flag for bound verification, $b_k = \\text{true}$.\n2.  Perform an eigendecomposition of the symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{H}_k$ to find its real eigenvalues. Identify the minimum eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min}$, and the maximum eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n3.  For each direction vector $\\mathbf{v}_{k,i}$:\n    a. Calculate the squared norm $n_i = \\mathbf{v}_{k,i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}_{k,i}$.\n    b. Compute the curvature importance score, $s_{k,i}$. If $n_i  \\varepsilon$, set $s_{k,i} = 0$. Otherwise, calculate $s_{k,i} = (\\mathbf{v}_{k,i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{H}_k\\mathbf{v}_{k,i}) / n_i$.\n    c. Apply the pruning rule: if $s_{k,i} \\le t_k$, increment the pruned count $c_k$.\n    d. Verify the score against the spectral bounds: if the condition $\\lambda_{\\min} - \\tau \\le s_{k,i} \\le \\lambda_{\\max} + \\tau$ is false, set $b_k = \\text{false}$.\n4.  The final results for the case are the pair $(c_k, b_k)$.\n\nThis procedure is applied systematically to all provided test cases.",
