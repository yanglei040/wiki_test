Let a dataset consist of inputs $x_i$ and targets $t_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$, and consider a linear model $m(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} w_j \\,\\phi_j(x)$ where the basis functions $\\phi_j$ are fixed. The least-squares estimator minimizes the sum of squared residuals and can be computed from a design matrix $X$ with entries $X_{ij} = \\phi_j(x_i)$ using well-tested numerical linear algebra. The two-norm condition number of a matrix, denoted by $\\kappa_2(X)$, quantifies numerical stability of solving linear systems with $X$.\n\nThis problem investigates the effect of input rescaling under the affine transformation $x \\mapsto y = a x + b$ on two families of basis functions: the monomial (Vandermonde) basis and an orthogonal polynomial basis. The monomial basis is defined by $\\phi_j(x) = x^j$ for $j=0,\\dots,d$, and its design matrix $V$ is the Vandermonde matrix. The orthogonal polynomial basis considered here is the Legendre family $\\{P_j(z)\\}_{j=0}^{d}$ evaluated on standardized inputs $z$. Standardization is performed by mapping the observed input range to the interval $[-1,1]$ via\n$$\nz = \\frac{2(x - m_x)}{r_x}, \\quad m_x = \\frac{x_{\\min} + x_{\\max}}{2}, \\quad r_x = x_{\\max} - x_{\\min},\n$$\nand analogously for the rescaled inputs $y$,\n$$\nz' = \\frac{2(y - m_y)}{r_y}, \\quad m_y = \\frac{y_{\\min} + y_{\\max}}{2}, \\quad r_y = y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}.\n$$\nThe Legendre polynomials satisfy the parity property $P_j(-z) = (-1)^j P_j(z)$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions above, you will derive algorithmic tests of the following claims:\n- Invariance claim for the orthogonal polynomial basis: when the design matrix is built from standardized inputs, the coefficients computed by least squares are invariant under $x \\mapsto y = a x + b$ up to a predictable parity adjustment when $a < 0$.\n- Sensitivity claim for the Vandermonde basis: monomial-basis coefficients and the condition number of the design matrix are sensitive to the scaling factor $a$ and shift $b$, often resulting in large changes.\n\nYou must implement a program that, for each test case specified below, performs the following steps in pure mathematical terms:\n1. Generate evenly spaced inputs $x_i$ over a specified interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$.\n2. Compute targets $t_i = f(x_i)$ where $f(x) = \\sin(x)$, with the angle unit in radians.\n3. Fit a degree-$d$ model using the orthogonal polynomial basis $\\{P_j(z)\\}_{j=0}^{d}$ on standardized inputs $z$ built from $x$, obtaining coefficients $w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$. Then apply the rescaling $y_i = a x_i + b$, rebuild standardized inputs $z'$ from $y$, and refit to obtain coefficients $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$.\n4. Test the invariance claim by checking whether $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ equals $w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ up to the parity adjustment $(-\\operatorname{sign}(a))^j$ on the $j$-th coefficient, that is, whether $\\max_j \\left| w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j - \\left(\\operatorname{sign}(a)\\right)^j w^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j \\right|$ is below a tolerance $\\epsilon$.\n5.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical linear algebra and statistical regression, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. It presents a standard, verifiable comparison between two common choices of basis functions.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the numerical stability and coefficient invariance of linear models under an affine transformation of the input variable, $x \\mapsto y = a x + b$. We investigate two types of basis expansions: one using orthogonal polynomials (Legendre polynomials) on a standardized domain, and another using a naive monomial basis.\n\n**1. Orthogonal Polynomial Basis: Legendre Polynomials**\n\nThe key to the stability of the Legendre polynomial basis is the standardization of the input variable. For any variable $v$ defined over an interval $[v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}]$, the standardization map is given by:\n$$\nz(v) = \\frac{2(v - m_v)}{r_v}, \\quad \\text{where } m_v = \\frac{v_{\\min} + v_{\\max}}{2} \\text{ and } r_v = v_{\\max} - v_{\\min}.\n$$\nThis transformation maps the interval $[v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}]$ to $[-1, 1]$, which is the canonical domain of orthogonality for Legendre polynomials. The model is then constructed using basis functions $\\phi_j(x) = P_j(z(x))$.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of the affine transformation $y = a x + b$ on the standardized variable. The original inputs $x_i$ lie in $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$. The rescaled inputs $y_i$ will lie in a new interval $[y_{\\min}, y_{\\max}]$.\n\nCase 1: $a > 0$. The transformation is order-preserving.\n$y_{\\min} = a x_{\\min} + b$ and $y_{\\max} = a x_{\\max} + b$.\nThe new midpoint is $m_y = \\frac{(a x_{\\min} + b) + (a x_{\\max} + b)}{2} = a \\frac{x_{\\min} + x_{\\max}}{2} + b = a m_x + b$.\nThe new range is $r_y = (a x_{\\max} + b) - (a x_{\\min} + b) = a (x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}) = a r_x$.\nThe new standardized variable $z'$ is:\n$$\nz'(y) = \\frac{2(y - m_y)}{r_y} = \\frac{2((ax+b) - (am_x+b))}{a r_x} = \\frac{2a(x - m_x)}{a r_x} = z(x).\n$$\nSince $z'(y_i) = z(x_i)$, the basis functions evaluated at the new points are identical to the old ones: $\\phi_j(y_i) = P_j(z'(y_i)) = P_j(z(x_i)) = \\phi_j(x_i)$. The design matrices for both fits are therefore identical. Since the target vector $\\mathbf{t}$ remains unchanged, the least-squares solution for the coefficients must also be identical: $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}} = w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$.\n\nCase 2: $a < 0$. The transformation is order-reversing.\n$y_{\\min} = a x_{\\max} + b$ and $y_{\\max} = a x_{\\min} + b$.\nThe midpoint $m_y = a m_x + b$ is derived similarly.\nThe new range is $r_y = (a x_{\\min} + b) - (a x_{\\max} + b) = a (x_{\\min} - x_{\\max}) = -a (x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}) = |a| r_x$.\nThe new standardized variable $z'$ is:\n$$\nz'(y) = \\frac{2(y - m_y)}{r_y} = \\frac{2((ax+b) - (am_x+b))}{|a| r_x} = \\frac{a}{|a|} \\frac{2(x - m_x)}{r_x} = -z(x), \\text{ since } a < 0 \\implies a/|a| = -1.\n$$\nThe basis functions for the new fit are $\\phi_j(y_i) = P_j(z'(y_i)) = P_j(-z(x_i))$. Using the parity property of Legendre polynomials, $P_j(-z) = (-1)^j P_j(z)$, we get $\\phi_j(y_i) = (-1)^j P_j(z(x_i))$.\nLet $X^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ be the design matrix for the fit on $x$, with entries $(X^{\\mathrm{leg}})_{ij} = P_j(z(x_i))$. Let $X'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ be the design matrix for the fit on $y$, with entries $(X'^{\\mathrm{leg}})_{ij} = P_j(z'(y_i))$. The relationship is $(X'^{\\mathrm{leg}})_{ij} = (-1)^j (X^{\\mathrm{leg}})_{ij}$. This can be written in matrix form as $X'^{\\mathrm{leg}} = X^{\\mathrm{leg}} S$, where $S$ is a diagonal matrix with $S_{jj} = (-1)^j$.\n\nThe two least-squares problems are to find $w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ and $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ that minimize $\\| X^{\\mathrm{leg}} w^{\\mathrm{leg}} - \\mathbf{t} \\|_2^2$ and $\\| X'^{\\mathrm{leg}} w'^{\\mathrm{leg}} - \\mathbf{t} \\|_2^2$. Substituting the relation between the matrices into the second problem gives $\\| (X^{\\mathrm{leg}} S) w'^{\\mathrm{leg}} - \\mathbf{t} \\|_2^2$. Let $w^* = S w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$. The problem becomes finding $w^*$ that minimizes $\\| X^{\\mathrm{leg}} w^* - \\mathbf{t} \\|_2^2$. By uniqueness of the least-squares solution, $w^* = w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$. Thus, $S w'^{\\mathrm{leg}} = w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$. Since $S$ is its own inverse ($S^2=I$), we can solve for $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$: $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}} = S^{-1} w^{\\mathrm{leg}} = S w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$, which means $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j = (-1)^j w^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j$.\n\nCombining both cases using $\\operatorname{sign}(a)$, we find that $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j = (\\operatorname{sign}(a))^j w^{\\mathrm{leg}}_j$. The invariance test checks this relationship to a numerical tolerance $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$. The boolean $B$ is the result of this test.\n\n**2. Monomial Basis: Vandermonde Matrix**\n\nThe monomial basis is defined by $\\phi_j(x) = x^j$. The design matrix $V_x$ with entries $(V_x)_{ij} = x_i^j$ is a Vandermonde matrix. Unlike the orthogonal basis, this basis has no self-correcting standardization mechanism.\n\nWhen the input is transformed to $y = ax+b$, the new basis functions are $\\phi_j(y) = (ax+b)^j$. Using the binomial expansion:\n$$\n\\phi_j(y) = (ax+b)^j = \\sum_{k=0}^{j} \\binom{j}{k} (ax)^k b^{j-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{j} \\left[ \\binom{j}{k} a^k b^{j-k} \\right] x^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{j} C_{jk} \\phi_k(x)\n$$\nEach new basis function is a linear combination of the old basis functions up to the same degree. This creates a complicated relationship between the coefficient vectors $w^{\\mathrm{van}}$ and $w'^{\\mathrm{van}}$, precluding any simple invariance. The relative change $\\Delta = \\frac{\\| w'^{\\mathrm{van}} - w^{\\mathrm{van}} \\|_2}{\\| w^{\\mathrm{van}} \\|_2 + 10^{-12}}$ is expected to be large.\n\nVandermonde matrices are notoriously ill-conditioned, especially when the interval of points is far from the origin or has a very large/small scale. The columns of the matrix, being powers of $x_i$, can become nearly collinear. For example, if all $|x_i| \\gg 1$, the vectors $[x_i^d]$ and $[x_i^{d-1}]$ will point in very similar directions, leading to a high condition number $\\kappa_2(V_x)$. The transformation $y=ax+b$ can drastically alter the input domain's scale and location, often exacerbating this problem. The ratio of condition numbers, $\\rho = \\frac{\\kappa_2(V_y)}{\\kappa_2(V_x)}$, quantifies this instability. Large values of $|a|$ or $|b|$ are expected to yield large values of $\\rho$.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe described analysis is implemented as follows:\n- For each test case, we generate $n$ inputs $x_i$ and targets $t_i = \\sin(x_i)$.\n- For the Legendre basis, we construct the design matrices $X^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ and $X'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ by first standardizing the $x_i$ and rescaled $y_i$ inputs, respectively, and then evaluating the Legendre polynomials $P_j$ for $j=0, \\dots, d$. The coefficients $w^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ and $w'^{\\mathrm{leg}}$ are found using `numpy.linalg.lstsq`. The invariance claim is tested, yielding a boolean $B$.\n- For the monomial basis, we construct the Vandermonde matrices $V_x$ and $V_y$ using `numpy.vander`. Coefficients $w^{\\mathrm{van}}$ and $w'^{\\mathrm{van}}$ are again found via least squares. The relative coefficient change $\\Delta$ and the condition number ratio $\\rho$ (using `numpy.linalg.cond`) are computed.\n- The results $[B, \\Delta, \\rho]$ are collected for all test cases and formatted as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed and scientifically sound exercise in the field of statistical learning. It requires the implementation of the Lasso regression algorithm and the computation of several standard diagnostic metrics related to model selection and identifiability. The problem statement provides all necessary definitions, parameters, and procedures for three distinct test cases.\n\nThe approach to solving this problem involves three main steps for each test case:\n1.  Construction of the dictionary $\\,\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}\\,$ and the ground-truth data $\\,y = \\Phi \\beta^\\star\\,$, following the specific instructions for each case.\n2.  Numerical solution of the Lasso optimization problem to find an estimated coefficient vector $\\,\\hat{\\beta}\\,$.\n3.  Computation of four diagnostic booleans: $\\,B_{\\mathrm{supp}}\\,$, $\\,B_{\\mathrm{sign}}\\,$, $\\,B_{\\mathrm{IR}}\\,$, and $\\,B_{\\mu}\\,$.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the methodology for each step is provided below.\n\n**1. Lasso Solver: Cyclic Coordinate Descent**\n\nThe Lasso optimization problem is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} \\in \\arg\\min_{\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} \\;\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\lVert y - \\Phi \\beta \\rVert_2^2 \\;+\\; \\lambda \\,\\lVert \\beta \\rVert_1\n$$\nThis is a convex optimization problem. A widely used and effective method for solving it is cyclic coordinate descent. The algorithm iteratively minimizes the objective function with respect to a single coefficient $\\,\\beta_k\\,$, holding all other coefficients fixed.\n\nThe objective function, as a function of $\\,\\beta_k\\,$ alone, is:\n$$\nL(\\beta_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\lVert y - \\sum_{j \\ne k} \\phi_j \\beta_j - \\phi_k \\beta_k \\right\\rVert_2^2 + \\lambda |\\beta_k| + \\lambda \\sum_{j \\ne k} |\\beta_j|\n$$\nLet $\\,r^{(k)} = y - \\sum_{j \\ne k} \\phi_j \\beta_j\\,$ be the partial residual. The terms not involving $\\,\\beta_k\\,$ can be treated as constants. We minimize:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\lVert r^{(k)} - \\phi_k \\beta_k \\right\\rVert_2^2 + \\lambda |\\beta_k| = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\lVert r^{(k)} \\rVert_2^2 - 2\\beta_k (\\phi_k^\\top r^{(k)}) + \\beta_k^2 \\lVert \\phi_k \\rVert_2^2 \\right) + \\lambda |\\beta_k|\n$$\nSince each column $\\,\\phi_k\\,$ is normalized to $\\,\\lVert \\phi_k \\rVert_2 = 1\\,$, this simplifies to minimizing:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\beta_k^2 - 2\\beta_k (\\phi_k^\\top r^{(k)})) + \\lambda |\\beta_k|\n$$\nCompleting the square, this is equivalent to minimizing $\\,\\frac{1}{2}(\\beta_k - z_k)^2 + \\lambda |\\beta_k|\\,$, where $\\,z_k = \\phi_k^\\top r^{(k)}\\,$. The solution to this subproblem is given by the soft-thresholding operator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_k = S_\\lambda(z_k) = \\mathrm{sign}(z_k) \\max(|z_k| - \\lambda, 0)\n$$\nThe cyclic coordinate descent algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize $\\,\\hat{\\beta} = 0\\,$.\n2.  Repeat until convergence:\n    a. For $\\,k = 0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\,$:\n        i.  Compute $\\,z_k = \\phi_k^\\top (y - \\sum_{j \\ne k} \\phi_j \\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\phi_k^\\top y - \\sum_{j \\ne k} (\\phi_k^\\top \\phi_j) \\hat{\\beta}_j\\,$. An efficient update is $\\,z_k = \\phi_k^\\top (y - \\Phi\\hat{\\beta} + \\phi_k \\hat{\\beta}_k) = \\phi_k^\\top r_{current} + \\hat{\\beta}_k\\,$, where $\\,r_{current}\\,$ is the full residual.\n        ii. Update $\\,\\hat{\\beta}_k \\leftarrow S_\\lambda(z_k)\\,$.\n\nThe process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until the change in $\\,\\hat{\\beta}\\,$ falls below a specified tolerance.\n\n**2. Computation of Diagnostic Metrics**\n\nFor each test case, after computing $\\,\\hat{\\beta}\\,$, the following four metrics are evaluated.\n\n-   **$\\,B_{\\mathrm{supp}}\\,$ (Support Recovery):** This boolean is true if the set of indices of non-zero coefficients in $\\,\\hat{\\beta}\\,$ exactly matches the true support $\\,S\\,$. A numerical threshold of $\\,10^{-6}\\,$ is used to identify non-zero coefficients: $\\,\\mathrm{supp}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\{j : |\\hat{\\beta}_j| > 10^{-6}\\}\\,$.\n    $$\n    B_{\\mathrm{supp}} = (\\mathrm{supp}(\\hat{\\beta}) = S)\n    $$\n\n-   **$\\,B_{\\mathrm{sign}}\\,$ (Sign Pattern Recovery):** This boolean is true if two conditions are met: (1) the recovered model has no false positives, i.e., $\\,\\mathrm{supp}(\\hat{\\beta}) \\subseteq S\\,$, and (2) for every index $\\,j \\in S\\,$, the sign of the estimated coefficient matches the true one, i.e., $\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\mathrm{sign}(\\beta^\\star_j)\\,$.\n    This is a stronger condition than support recovery. If $\\,B_{\\mathrm{sign}}\\,$ is true, it implies that $\\,\\mathrm{supp}(\\hat{\\beta}) = S\\,$ (since $\\,\\beta^\\star_j \\ne 0\\,$ for $\\,j \\in S\\,$ implies $\\,\\hat{\\beta}_j \\ne 0\\,$ for $\\,j \\in S\\,$), and therefore $\\,B_{\\mathrm{supp}}\\,$ is also true.\n\n-   **$\\,B_{\\mathrm{IR}}\\,$ (Irrepresentable Condition):** This boolean checks if $\\,\\eta < 1\\,$, a sufficient condition for the Lasso to correctly identify the signs of the true coefficients for a sufficiently small $\\,\\lambda\\,$. The value $\\,\\eta\\,$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\eta \\;=\\; \\big\\lVert \\Phi_{S^c}^\\top \\Phi_S \\big(\\Phi_S^\\top \\Phi_S\\big)^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\beta^\\star_S) \\big\\rVert_\\infty\n    $$\n    where `S^c` is the complement of the support set `S`. The computation involves forming the sub-matrices $\\,\\Phi_S\\,$ and $\\,\\Phi_{S^c}\\,$, computing the Gram matrix $\\,G_S = \\Phi_S^\\top \\Phi_S\\,$, solving a linear system to find $\\,x = G_S^{-1} \\mathrm{sign}(\\beta^\\star_S)\\,$, and then finding the maximum absolute value of the vector $\\,\\Phi_{S^c}^\\top \\Phi_S x\\,$. The condition is checked with a numerical tolerance: $\\,\\eta < 1 - 10^{-8}\\,$.\n\n-   **$\\,B_{\\mu}\\,$ (Mutual Coherence Bound):** This boolean checks a sufficient condition for unique sparse recovery based on the mutual coherence $\\,\\mu(\\Phi)\\,$. The condition is:\n    $$\n    s \\;<\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Big(1 + \\tfrac{1}{\\mu(\\Phi)}\\Big)\n    $$\n    where $\\,s = |S|\\,$ is the sparsity level. The mutual coherence $\\,\\mu(\\Phi) = \\max_{i \\ne j} |\\phi_i^\\top \\phi_j|\\,$ is the largest absolute inner product between distinct normalized columns of $\\,\\Phi\\,$. If $\\,\\mu(\\Phi)=0\\,$, the condition is considered met.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by defining Python functions for each of these components, which will be called for each of the three test cases specified in the problem. The final results will be aggregated into the required output format.",
