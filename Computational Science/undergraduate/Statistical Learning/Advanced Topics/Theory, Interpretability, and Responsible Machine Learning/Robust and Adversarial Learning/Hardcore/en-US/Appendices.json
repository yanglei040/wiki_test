            "introduction": "A fundamental question in robust statistics is how to measure an estimator's resilience to contaminated data. The breakdown point provides a clear and powerful answer, defining the minimum fraction of adversarial data required to corrupt an estimate completely. This practice solidifies this core concept by comparing the non-robust sample mean to resilient alternatives like the trimmed mean and the median, building a strong intuition for the practical limits of statistical estimators .",

            "problem": "Consider the epsilon-contamination model for robust statistical learning in one dimension, where a training sample of size $n$ consists of $(1-\\epsilon)n$ clean points drawn from a base distribution and $\\epsilon n$ adversarial outliers. In this problem, treat the base distribution as a degenerate distribution at $0$ so that clean points are $0$, and let the adversary place all outliers at a large positive value $M$. This worst-case contamination makes the analysis purely combinatorial and avoids randomness.\n\nDefine three estimators of location:\n1. The sample mean $\\bar{x}$.\n2. The symmetric $\\tau$-trimmed mean for $0 \\le \\tau < \\frac{1}{2}$, which trims the $k = \\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor$ smallest and $k$ largest values and averages the remaining $n - 2k$ observations. For a sorted sample $x_{(1)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{(n)}$, the trimmed mean is\n$$\n\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{trim}} = \\frac{1}{n - 2k} \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n-k} x_{(i)}.\n$$\n3. The Tukey median defined by Tukey depth (in one dimension this equals the sample median). For $n$ odd, this is $x_{((n+1)/2)}$; for $n$ even, this is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2+1)}\\right)$.\n\nUse the foundational definition of breakdown point in robust statistics: for an estimator viewed as a functional $T$, the breakdown point at a distribution $P$ is the smallest contamination level $\\epsilon$ at which the estimator can be driven without bound by adversarial contamination, namely\n$$\n\\varepsilon^\\star(T, P) = \\inf \\left\\{\\epsilon \\in [0,1]: \\sup_Q \\left\\| T\\left( (1-\\epsilon)P + \\epsilon Q \\right) \\right\\| = \\infty \\right\\},\n$$\nwhere $Q$ ranges over all possible contaminating distributions. In the finite-sample setting with the explicit construction above, this reduces to asking for the minimal fraction of outliers $\\epsilon$ (equivalently an integer count $m = \\epsilon n$) such that as $M \\to \\infty$, the estimator value grows without bound.\n\nYour tasks:\n- Starting from the above robust breakdown definition and the explicit contamination construction with clean points at $0$ and adversarial outliers at $M$, derive the minimal contamination fraction $\\epsilon^\\star$ required to make each estimator unbounded as $M \\to \\infty$ in the finite-sample setting. Express the answer as a function of $n$ and $\\tau$ where applicable, justifying all rounding needed due to integer counts of outliers.\n- Also determine the asymptotic breakdown points for the three estimators, interpreting the epsilon-contamination model in the limit of large samples, and provide the values that do not depend on $n$.\n- Implement a deterministic program that, for each test case $(n,\\tau)$, returns two triplets:\n  - The asymptotic breakdown points $[\\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{mean}), \\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{trimmed mean}), \\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{Tukey median})]$.\n  - The finite-sample contamination thresholds in the explicit construction $[\\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{mean}}(n), \\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{trim}}(n,\\tau), \\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{Tukey}}(n)]$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following parameter sets $(n,\\tau)$:\n  1. $(100, 0.1)$ as a general case.\n  2. $(101, 0.1)$ to test odd $n$ effects on the median.\n  3. $(100, 0.0)$ to test the boundary where trimming vanishes.\n  4. $(20, 0.2)$ to test discrete rounding effects with moderate trimming.\n  5. $(2, 0.0)$ to test the smallest even sample size.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no spaces. Each test case contributes a pair of lists of three floats: the first list is the asymptotic breakdown points in the order described above, and the second list is the finite-sample thresholds in the same order. The overall output is a list of these pairs for all test cases. For example, the format should be like\n$$\n\\left[\\left[[a_1,a_2,a_3],[b_1,b_2,b_3]\\right],\\left[[\\cdots],[\\cdots]\\right],\\ldots\\right]\n$$\nwhere $a_i$ and $b_i$ are decimal numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of robust statistics, is well-posed with clear definitions, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It is a standard theoretical problem to analyze the breakdown point of location estimators. We will proceed to derive the required quantities.\n\nThe problem defines a specific contamination scenario: for a sample of size $n$, we have $n-m$ \"clean\" data points at value $0$ and $m$ \"adversarial\" outlier points at a large positive value $M$. The contamination fraction is $\\epsilon = m/n$. We seek the minimal integer number of outliers, $m$, that causes an estimator's value to become unbounded as $M \\to \\infty$. The finite-sample breakdown point is this minimal fraction, $\\epsilon^\\star = m/n$. The asymptotic breakdown point is the limit of this fraction as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe sorted sample, denoted $x_{(1)} \\le x_{(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{(n)}$, will consist of $n-m$ zeros followed by $m$ values of $M$. Specifically, $x_{(i)} = 0$ for $i \\le n-m$, and $x_{(i)} = M$ for $i > n-m$.\n\n**1. Sample Mean ($\\bar{x}$)**\n\nThe sample mean is defined as $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.\nFor the given contaminated sample, the sum consists of $n-m$ terms equal to $0$ and $m$ terms equal to $M$.\nThe value of the sample mean is:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( (n-m) \\cdot 0 + m \\cdot M \\right) = \\frac{m M}{n}\n$$\nFor the estimator to be driven to infinity as $M \\to \\infty$, the coefficient of $M$ must be non-zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{m M}{n} = \\infty \\quad \\iff \\quad \\frac{m}{n} > 0 \\quad \\iff \\quad m > 0\n$$\nThe smallest integer $m$ satisfying $m > 0$ is $m=1$.\n\n- **Finite-Sample Breakdown Point**: The minimal number of outliers is $m=1$. The corresponding fraction is:\n$$ \\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{mean}}(n) = \\frac{1}{n} $$\n- **Asymptotic Breakdown Point**: Taking the limit as the sample size $n$ goes to infinity:\n$$ \\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{mean}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0 $$\n\n**2. Symmetric $\\tau$-Trimmed Mean ($\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{trim}}$)**\n\nThe $\\tau$-trimmed mean is calculated by removing the $k = \\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor$ smallest and $k$ largest observations and averaging the remaining $n-2k$ points. Its formula is:\n$$\n\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{trim}} = \\frac{1}{n - 2k} \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n-k} x_{(i)}\n$$\nThe estimator's value is determined by the points $x_{(k+1)}, \\dots, x_{(n-k)}$. In our setup, these points are either $0$ or $M$. The estimator will be bounded (equal to $0$) if all points in the sum are $0$. It will become unbounded if at least one point in the sum is $M$.\n\nThe outliers at $M$ occupy the largest $m$ positions in the sorted sample: $x_{(n-m+1)}, \\dots, x_{(n)}$.\nThe largest $k$ values are trimmed. These are $x_{(n-k+1)}, \\dots, x_{(n)}$.\nIf the number of outliers $m$ is less than or equal to the number of trimmed high-end points $k$ (i.e., $m \\le k$), then all outliers will be part of the trimmed set. The largest index of a remaining point is $n-k$. The smallest index of an outlier is $n-m+1$. If $n-m+1 > n-k$, or $k+1 > m$, all outliers are trimmed.\nBreakdown occurs when at least one outlier is *not* trimmed. This happens when the number of outliers $m$ is large enough to \"spill over\" into the part of the sample that is averaged. This requires the number of outliers to be greater than the number of points trimmed from the top, $k$.\nThe condition for breakdown is therefore $m > k$.\nThe minimal integer $m$ that satisfies this is $m = k+1$. Substituting $k = \\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor$, the minimal number of outliers is $m = \\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor + 1$.\n\n- **Finite-Sample Breakdown Point**: The minimal contamination fraction is:\n$$ \\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{trim}}(n, \\tau) = \\frac{\\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor + 1}{n} $$\n- **Asymptotic Breakdown Point**: We take the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. Using the property that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor}{n} = \\tau$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{trimmed mean}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor + 1}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor}{n} + \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\tau + 0 = \\tau $$\n\n**3. Tukey Median (Sample Median)**\n\nThe sample median's definition depends on the parity of $n$.\nBreakdown occurs if the median value is $M$ or includes a term proportional to $M$, which will happen if one of the central data points is an outlier with value $M$.\n\n- **Case 1: $n$ is odd**. Let $n = 2j+1$. The median is the single central value $x_{((n+1)/2)} = x_{(j+1)}$. Breakdown occurs if this point is an outlier. The outliers are $x_{(n-m+1)}, \\dots, x_{(n)}$. So we need the index of the median to be in the outlier range:\n$$ \\frac{n+1}{2} > n-m \\implies m > n - \\frac{n+1}{2} = \\frac{n-1}{2} $$\nSince $n$ is odd, $(n-1)/2 = j$ is an integer. The smallest integer $m$ satisfying $m > j$ is $m = j+1 = (n+1)/2$.\n\n- **Case 2: $n$ is even**. Let $n = 2j$. The median is the average of the two central values, $\\frac{1}{2}(x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2+1)}) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_{(j)} + x_{(j+1)})$. The estimator becomes unbounded if at least one of these two points is $M$. This is guaranteed if the higher-indexed point, $x_{(j+1)}$, is an outlier. The condition is:\n$$ \\frac{n}{2}+1 > n-m \\implies m > n - \\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{n}{2}-1 $$\nSince $n$ is even, $n/2-1 = j-1$ is an integer. The smallest integer $m$ satisfying $m > j-1$ is $m = j = n/2$.\n\nWe can unify these two cases. The minimal number of outliers is $m=(n+1)/2$ for odd $n$ and $m=n/2$ for even $n$. This corresponds to $m = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n\n- **Finite-Sample Breakdown Point**: The minimal contamination fraction is:\n$$ \\epsilon^\\star_{\\text{Tukey}}(n) = \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n} $$\n- **Asymptotic Breakdown Point**: In the limit of large $n$, $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\approx n/2$.\n$$ \\varepsilon^\\star(\\text{Tukey median}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\n| Estimator | Asymptotic Breakdown Point ($\\varepsilon^\\star$) | Finite-Sample Breakdown Point ($\\epsilon^\\star$) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Sample Mean | $0$ | $\\frac{1}{n}$ |\n| Trimmed Mean | $\\tau$ | $\\frac{\\lfloor \\tau n \\rfloor + 1}{n}$ |\n| Tukey Median | $0.5$ | $\\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n}$ |\n\nThese formulas are implemented to compute the results for the given test cases.",

The influence function is a precise mathematical tool that quantifies the impact of an infinitesimal data contamination on an estimator.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional linear regression model with intercept defined by the data-generating process $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon$, where $x$ is a scalar predictor and $\\varepsilon$ is independent noise. Adopt Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) as the fundamental base: parameters are estimated by minimizing the expected loss under the data distribution. For Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the loss is the squared loss, and for Huber regression the loss is the Huber loss with threshold parameter. Robustness is studied via the Influence Function (IF), which measures the infinitesimal change in the parameter estimate when the data distribution is contaminated at a single point.\n\nYou are to construct and analyze a statistically sound scenario with heavy-tailed noise as follows:\n\n1. Generate a synthetic dataset of size $n = 5000$ using the model $y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i$ with parameters $\\beta_0 = 1.0$ and $\\beta_1 = 1.5$. Draw predictors $x_i$ independently from a standard normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Draw noise $\\varepsilon_i$ independently from a Student's $t$ distribution with degrees of freedom $\\nu = 3$ and scale $s = 1.0$. Use the fixed random seed $42$ for reproducibility.\n\n2. In ERM for linear regression with intercept and one predictor, write the design vector as $\\tilde{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ x\\end{bmatrix}$. Let the loss be $\\rho(r)$ as a function of the residual $r = y - \\tilde{x}^\\top \\theta$, where $\\theta = \\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1\\end{bmatrix}$. Define the score function $\\psi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\rho(r)$ and the estimating equation $\\mathbb{E}[\\psi(r)\\tilde{x}] = 0$. The Influence Function (IF) at a contamination point $z_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ is given by the Gateaux derivative of the parameter functional with respect to an $\\varepsilon$-contamination: consider the contaminated distribution $(1 - \\varepsilon)P + \\varepsilon \\Delta_{z_0}$ and differentiate the solution of the estimating equation at $\\varepsilon = 0$. Use the sensitivity matrix $A = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\{\\psi(r)\\tilde{x}\\}\\right]$ to express the IF.

Set the threshold as $\\delta = k \\cdot \\hat{\\sigma}$, where $k = 1.345$ is a constant and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is a robust scale estimate of $\\varepsilon$ computed as the median absolute deviation (MAD) multiplied by $1.4826$.

All provided data, definitions, and equations are internally consistent, standard in the field, and sufficient to derive a unique numerical solution. The problem asks for a quantitative comparison of the robustness of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Huber regression using the Influence Function (IF), which is a standard tool for this purpose.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of the Euclidean norms of the Influence Functions for Huber regression versus OLS regression, $R = \\|\\mathsf{IF}_{\\text{Huber}}(z_0)\\|_2 \\big/ \\|\\mathsf{IF}_{\\text{OLS}}(z_0)\\|_2$, for four different contamination points $z_0$.

            "introduction": "In modern, security-critical applications, we often need formal guarantees that a classifier is immune to small, malicious input perturbations. Certified robustness provides a method to calculate a \"safe\" radius around a data point within which an adversary, constrained by a specific norm like $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$, cannot change the model's prediction. This practice  offers hands-on experience computing these certified radii by linking the model's gradient to dual norms via Hölder's inequality, turning an abstract mathematical tool into a concrete security assurance.",

            "problem": "You are given a binary classifier in two dimensions defined by the linear scoring function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x} + b$ with fixed parameters $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Classification is by the sign of $f(\\mathbf{x})$, with label $y \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ and a signed margin $m(\\mathbf{x}, y) = y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x})$. Consider adversarial perturbations $\\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ constrained in an $\\ell_{p}$-norm ball around $\\mathbf{x}$, where the adversary seeks to change the classification sign by choosing $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ to make $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) \\leq 0$. The linkage between dual norms via Hölder’s inequality provides a way to certify robustness by lower bounding the required perturbation size. You must construct a simple two-dimensional dataset, apply the fixed linear classifier, and compare certified robustness under $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ perturbation models using the gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} f(\\mathbf{x})$ and the dual norms relationship.\n\nBase facts to use:\n- Hölder’s inequality and dual norms: for any $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $|\\mathbf{a}^{\\top} \\mathbf{b}| \\leq \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|_{q} \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|_{p}$ with $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and the dual of $p=1$ is $q=\\infty$, while the dual of $p=2$ is $q=2$.\n- For the linear model $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x} + b$, the gradient with respect to the input is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}$.\n\nConstruct the dataset:\n- Use the following fixed parameters for the classifier: $\\mathbf{w} = (0.8, -0.6)$ and $b = 0.1$.\n- Consider the following five labeled points in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n    1. $\\mathbf{x}_{1} = (2.0, -1.0)$ with $y_{1} = +1$.\n    2. $\\mathbf{x}_{2} = (0.5, 0.5)$ with $y_{2} = -1$.\n    3. $\\mathbf{x}_{3} = (-1.0, 2.0)$ with $y_{3} = -1$.\n    4. $\\mathbf{x}_{4} = (0.125, 0.0)$ with $y_{4} = +1$.\n    5. $\\mathbf{x}_{5} = (-0.125, 0.0)$ with $y_{5} = +1$.\n\nTasks:\n- For each test point $(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, y_{i})$, compute the signed margin $m_{i} = y_{i} \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}_{i})$.\n- Using the gradient $\\mathbf{g} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}$ and the dual norm linkage provided by Hölder’s inequality, determine the certified robustness radii against $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ adversaries. A certified radius is the largest $\\epsilon$ such that every perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ with $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_{p} \\leq \\epsilon$ cannot change the sign of $f(\\mathbf{x})$. If $m_{i} \\leq 0$, the certified radius is $0$ because the point is already misclassified or on the decision boundary. Express the $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ certified radii for each point as nonnegative real numbers.\n- Round each computed radius to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\n- The five points listed above cover a general case with large positive margin, a misclassified point (negative margin), another correctly classified point with moderate margin, a near-boundary case with small positive margin, and a boundary case with exactly zero margin. This provides coverage of typical and edge conditions.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case contributes a two-element list $[\\text{radius}_{\\ell_{1}}, \\text{radius}_{\\ell_{2}}]$ in the same order as the test cases above. For example, the output should look like:\n$[[r_{1,\\ell_{1}}, r_{1,\\ell_{2}}],[r_{2,\\ell_{1}}, r_{2,\\ell_{2}}],\\dots,[r_{5,\\ell_{1}}, r_{5,\\ell_{2}}]]$\nAll radii must be floats rounded to six decimal places.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions, parameters, and data to solve a standard problem in the adversarial robustness of linear models. The task is to compute certified robustness radii for a given linear classifier and a set of data points, which is a well-defined mathematical procedure. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the general formula for the certified robustness radius of a linear classifier, and then applying this formula to the specific points provided in the dataset.\n\nA linear classifier is defined by a scoring function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x} + b$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the input vector, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the weight vector, and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the bias. The predicted label is $\\text{sign}(f(\\mathbf{x}))$. The true label is denoted by $y \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$. A point $(\\mathbf{x}, y)$ is correctly classified if $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}) > 0$. The quantity $m(\\mathbf{x}, y) = y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x})$ is the signed margin.\n\nAdversarial robustness concerns the stability of the classifier's prediction under small perturbations to the input. An adversary seeks to find a perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ with a small norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_{p}$ that causes a misclassification. For a correctly classified point, this means finding a $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ such that the sign of the classifier's output flips, i.e., $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) \\leq 0$.\n\nThe certified robustness radius, $\\epsilon_p$, is the largest value such that for all perturbations $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ with $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_{p} \\leq \\epsilon_p$, the classification remains unchanged, i.e., $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) > 0$.\n\nFor a linear model, the change in the scoring function under a perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ is given exactly by a first-order approximation:\n$$f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} (\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) + b = (\\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} + b) + \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta} = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}f(\\mathbf{x})^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\delta}$$\nSince $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}$, we have $f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$.\n\nTo determine the robustness, we must find the perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ with norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_p \\leq \\epsilon$ that maximally changes $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta})$ in the negative direction.\n$$y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = y \\cdot (f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}) + y \\cdot (\\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta})$$\nThe term $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x})$ is the initial signed margin $m(\\mathbf{x}, y)$. The adversary seeks to make the term $y \\cdot (\\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta})$ as negative as possible.\nFrom Hölder's inequality, we have $|\\mathbf{a}^{\\top}\\mathbf{b}| \\leq \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|_{q}\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|_{p}$ where $1/p + 1/q = 1$. This implies that the minimum value of $\\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ is $-\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_{q}\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_{p}$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta})$ is:\n$$\\min_{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\|_p \\leq \\epsilon} \\left( y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) \\right) = y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}) - |y| \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q \\epsilon = m(\\mathbf{x}, y) - \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q \\epsilon$$\nThe classifier is guaranteed to be robust as long as this minimum value is greater than $0$:\n$$m(\\mathbf{x}, y) - \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q \\epsilon > 0 \\implies \\epsilon < \\frac{m(\\mathbf{x}, y)}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q}$$\nThe certified radius $\\epsilon_p$ is the threshold value $\\frac{m(\\mathbf{x}, y)}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q}$. This formula is valid only for correctly classified points where $m(\\mathbf{x}, y) > 0$. If a point is misclassified or on the boundary ($m(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\leq 0$), no perturbation is needed to satisfy the non-positive margin condition, so the certified radius is $0$.\nThe general formula for the certified radius is thus:\n$$\\epsilon_p(\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{y \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_q}\\right)$$\nwhere $1/p + 1/q = 1$.\n\nThe problem provides the classifier parameters: $\\mathbf{w} = (0.8, -0.6)$ and $b = 0.1$.\nWe need to compute the certified radii for $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ perturbations.\nFor $\\ell_1$ perturbations ($p=1$), the dual norm is the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm ($q=\\infty$).\n$$\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_{\\infty} = \\max(|0.8|, |-0.6|) = 0.8$$\nFor $\\ell_2$ perturbations ($p=2$), the dual norm is the $\\ell_2$-norm ($q=2$).\n$$\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0.8^2 + (-0.6)^2} = \\sqrt{0.64 + 0.36} = \\sqrt{1} = 1.0$$\nThe formulas for the radii are:\n$$r_{\\ell_1} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{m(\\mathbf{x}, y)}{0.8}\\right)$$\n$$r_{\\ell_2} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{m(\\mathbf{x}, y)}{1.0}\\right)$$\n\nWe now apply these formulas to the five given data points.\n\n1.  **Point 1**: $\\mathbf{x}_{1} = (2.0, -1.0)$, $y_{1} = +1$\n    $f(\\mathbf{x}_1) = (0.8)(2.0) + (-0.6)(-1.0) + 0.1 = 1.6 + 0.6 + 0.1 = 2.3$\n    $m_1 = y_1 \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}_1) = (+1)(2.3) = 2.3$.
