For each group $A$, you will construct Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) points and assess the feasibility of Equalized Odds (EO). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) point at a threshold $\\tau$ is defined by the pair $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})$, where the False Positive Rate (FPR) is the probability that $\\hat{Y}_{\\tau} = 1$ given $Y=0$, and the True Positive Rate (TPR) is the probability that $\\hat{Y}_{\\tau} = 1$ given $Y=1$. The classifier at threshold $\\tau$ predicts $\\hat{Y}_{\\tau} = 1$ if and only if $S \\ge \\tau$. Equalized Odds (EO) requires that the classifier yields identical $\\text{FPR}$ and $\\text{TPR}$ across groups $A=a$ and $A=b$.

We must also satisfy the constraints $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$ and $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$. We need to check all possible non-randomized classifiers, which correspond to setting a single threshold $\\tau$ for each group. The possible thresholds are values of $S$ and values just above/below them, effectively $\\tau > 3$, $\\tau=3$, $\\tau=2$, $\\tau=1$, $\\tau=0$.\n\nFirst, we find the set of valid ROC points for each group that satisfy the constraints.\nFor group $A=a$:\n- $\\tau>3$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0,0)$. Fails $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$.\n- $\\tau=3$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0.2, 0.5)$. Fails $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$.\n- $\\tau=2$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0.4, 0.8)$. Satisfies both $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$ and $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$. Valid.\n- $\\tau=1$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}) = (0.7, 0.9)$. Fails $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$.\n- $\\tau=0$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(1.0, 1.0)$. Fails $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$.\nThe only valid operating point for group $A=a$ is $(0.4, 0.8)$, achieved with $\\tau_a=2$.\n\nFor group $A=b$:\n- $\\tau>3$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0,0)$. Fails $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$.\n- $\\tau=3$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0.2, 0.6)$. Satisfies both constraints. Valid.\n- $\\tau=2$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(0.5, 0.9)$. Satisfies both constraints. Valid.\n- $\\tau=1$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{10}{10}) = (0.7, 1.0)$. Fails $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$.\n- $\\tau=0$: $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})=(1.0, 1.0)$. Fails $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$.\nThe valid operating points for group $A=b$ are $(0.2, 0.6)$ achieved with $\\tau_b=3$, and $(0.5, 0.9)$ achieved with $\\tau_b=2$.\n\nTo satisfy EO, we must find a common valid point. The only valid point for group $a$ is $(0.4, 0.8)$. This point is not in the set of valid points for group $b$, i.e., $\\{(0.2, 0.6), (0.5, 0.9)\\}$. Therefore, it is impossible to choose deterministic thresholds for each group that satisfy both the constraints and the EO condition. EO is infeasible without randomization.\n\n**Task 3: Find mixing probability $\\lambda$ for Equalized Odds**\n\nWe are instructed to fix the classifier for group $A=a$ to use the deterministic threshold $\\tau=2$. This yields the ROC point $(\\text{FPR}_a, \\text{TPR}_a) = (0.4, 0.8)$. As established, this point satisfies the operational constraints.\n\nFor group $A=b$, we use a mixed classifier that randomizes between two thresholds: it uses $\\tau=2$ with probability $\\lambda$ and $\\tau=3$ with probability $1-\\lambda$. The ROC points corresponding to these thresholds for group $b$ are:\n- For $\\tau=2$: $(\\text{FPR}_{b, \\tau=2}, \\text{TPR}_{b, \\tau=2}) = (0.5, 0.9)$.\n- For $\\tau=3$: $(\\text{FPR}_{b, \\tau=3}, \\text{TPR}_{b, \\tau=3}) = (0.2, 0.6)$.\n\nThe TPR and FPR of the mixed classifier for group $b$, denoted $\\text{TPR}_b(\\lambda)$ and $\\text{FPR}_b(\\lambda)$, are linear combinations of the rates at the constituent thresholds, weighted by their respective probabilities.\nUsing the law of total probability:\n$$ \\text{FPR}_b(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\cdot \\text{FPR}_{b, \\tau=2} + (1-\\lambda) \\cdot \\text{FPR}_{b, \\tau=3} $$\n$$ \\text{TPR}_b(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\cdot \\text{TPR}_{b, \\tau=2} + (1-\\lambda) \\cdot \\text{TPR}_{b, \\tau=3} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{FPR}_b(\\lambda) = \\lambda(0.5) + (1-\\lambda)(0.2) = 0.5\\lambda + 0.2 - 0.2\\lambda = 0.3\\lambda + 0.2 $$\n$$ \\text{TPR}_b(\\lambda) = \\lambda(0.9) + (1-\\lambda)(0.6) = 0.9\\lambda + 0.6 - 0.6\\lambda = 0.3\\lambda + 0.6 $$\n\nTo achieve Equalized Odds, we must enforce equality of TPR and FPR across groups:\n$$ \\text{FPR}_a = \\text{FPR}_b(\\lambda) \\implies 0.4 = 0.3\\lambda + 0.2 $$\n$$ \\text{TPR}_a = \\text{TPR}_b(\\lambda) \\implies 0.8 = 0.3\\lambda + 0.6 $$\n\nWe solve either equation for $\\lambda$. Both equations must yield the same solution for a consistent solution to exist.\nFrom the FPR equation:\n$$ 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.3\\lambda $$\n$$ 0.2 = 0.3\\lambda $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{0.2}{0.3} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nFrom the TPR equation:\n$$ 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.3\\lambda $$\n$$ 0.2 = 0.3\\lambda $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{0.2}{0.3} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nBoth equations consistently yield $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{3}$. This value is within the valid range for a probability, $[0,1]$.\nThe resulting ROC point for both groups is $(0.4, 0.8)$, which satisfies the constraints $\\text{TPR} \\ge 0.6$ and $\\text{FPR} \\le 0.5$. Thus, the mixing probability $\\lambda$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",

            "solution": "This problem requires us to find a pair of group-specific thresholds, $(t_0, t_1)$, that satisfy Equalized Odds (EO) and achieve a True Positive Rate (TPR) of $0.8$. The solution proceeds in two steps: first, deriving the analytical formulas for TPR and False Positive Rate (FPR) for each group, and second, using these formulas to solve for the thresholds.\n\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. For a normally distributed variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the probability $P(X \\ge t)$ is $1 - \\Phi(\\frac{t-\\mu}{\\sigma})$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Group-Wise TPR and FPR**\n\nFor each group $g \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the prediction is $\\hat{Y}=1$ if the score $X \\ge t_g$.\n\n**Group A=0:**\nThe distributions are $X \\mid (A=0, Y=1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(2, 1)$ for true positives and $X \\mid (A=0, Y=0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ for true negatives. The rates are functions of the threshold $t_0$:\n$$\n\\text{TPR}_0(t_0) = P(X \\ge t_0 | A=0, Y=1) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_0-2}{1}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(t_0-2)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FPR}_0(t_0) = P(X \\ge t_0 | A=0, Y=0) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_0-0}{1}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(t_0)\n$$\n\n**Group A=1:**\nThe distributions are $X \\mid (A=1, Y=1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(5, 1)$ for true positives and $X \\mid (A=1, Y=0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(3, 1)$ for true negatives. The rates are functions of the threshold $t_1$:\n$$\n\\text{TPR}_1(t_1) = P(X \\ge t_1 | A=1, Y=1) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_1-5}{1}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(t_1-5)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FPR}_1(t_1) = P(X \\ge t_1 | A=1, Y=0) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_1-3}{1}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(t_1-3)\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Thresholds for Equalized Odds**\n\nThe EO condition requires $\\text{TPR}_0(t_0) = \\text{TPR}_1(t_1)$ and $\\text{FPR}_0(t_0) = \\text{FPR}_1(t_1)$. We are also given that the common TPR must be $0.8$.\n\nFirst, we use the TPR constraint to find expressions for $t_0$ and $t_1$:\n$$\n\\text{TPR}_0(t_0) = 1 - \\Phi(t_0 - 2) = 0.8 \\implies \\Phi(t_0 - 2) = 0.2\n$$\n$$\nt_0 - 2 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.2) \\implies t_0 = 2 + \\Phi^{-1}(0.2)\n$$\nFor group 1:\n$$\n\\text{TPR}_1(t_1) = 1 - \\Phi(t_1 - 5) = 0.8 \\implies \\Phi(t_1 - 5) = 0.2\n$$\n$$\nt_1 - 5 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.2) \\implies t_1 = 5 + \\Phi^{-1}(0.2)\n$$\nNext, we verify that these thresholds also satisfy the FPR equality.\n$$\n\\text{FPR}_0(t_0) = 1 - \\Phi(t_0) = 1 - \\Phi(2 + \\Phi^{-1}(0.2))\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FPR}_1(t_1) = 1 - \\Phi(t_1 - 3) = 1 - \\Phi((5 + \\Phi^{-1}(0.2)) - 3) = 1 - \\Phi(2 + \\Phi^{-1}(0.2))\n$$\nThe expressions for $\\text{FPR}_0(t_0)$ and $\\text{FPR}_1(t_1)$ are identical, confirming that the EO condition is satisfied. This is a consequence of the fact that the ROC curves for both groups are identical because the difference between the means of the positive and negative classes is the same for both groups ($2-0=2$ and $5-3=2$).\n\nFor the numerical calculation, we use the value of the standard normal quantile $\\Phi^{-1}(0.2) \\approx -0.84162$.\n$$\nt_0 = 2 + (-0.84162) = 1.15838\n$$\n$$\nt_1 = 5 + (-0.84162) = 4.15838\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nt_0 \\approx 1.158\n$$\n$$\nt_1 \\approx 4.158\n$$\nThe final ordered pair of thresholds is $(1.158, 4.158)$.",
