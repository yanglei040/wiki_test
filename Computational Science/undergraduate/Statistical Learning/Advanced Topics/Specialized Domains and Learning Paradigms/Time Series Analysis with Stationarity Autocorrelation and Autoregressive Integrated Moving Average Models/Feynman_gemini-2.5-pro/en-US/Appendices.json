            "introduction": "A critical step in building an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is selecting the correct order of differencing, denoted by $d$. While differencing is essential for making a non-stationary series stationary, applying it unnecessarily—a mistake known as overdifferencing—can harm your model. This practice will show you that overdifferencing an integrated process introduces a specific, artificial structure that is easily recognizable in its autocorrelation plots . Mastering the ability to spot this signature is a key diagnostic skill that helps ensure your model is appropriately specified.",

An analyst mistakenly applies second differencing to $\\{X_t\\}$ and studies the transformed series $Y_t = \\Delta^2 X_t = X_t - 2X_{t-1} + X_{t-2}$. Which of the following best describes the theoretical behavior of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of $\\{Y_t\\}$ implied by this mis-differencing?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The process $\\{X_t\\}$ is a random walk:\n$$X_t = X_{t-1} + u_t$$\nThis means that the first difference of $\\{X_t\\}$ is the white noise process $\\{u_t\\}$:\n$$\\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1} = u_t$$\nThe process $\\{u_t\\}$ is stationary as it is i.i.d. with constant mean $E[u_t]=0$ and constant variance $Var(u_t)=\\sigma^2$.\n\nThe analyst mistakenly applies a second difference to $\\{X_t\\}$, yielding the process $\\{Y_t\\}$:\n$$Y_t = \\Delta^2 X_t = \\Delta(\\Delta X_t) = \\Delta(u_t) = u_t - u_{t-1}$$\nThis shows that $\\{Y_t\\}$ is a Moving Average process of order $1$, denoted as MA($1$). The general form of an MA($1$) process is $Y_t = \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1}$. In our case, the noise term is $\\epsilon_t = u_t$ and the MA parameter is $\\theta_1 = -1$.\n\nTo determine the ACF and PACF of $\\{Y_t\\}$, we first compute its autocovariances.\nThe mean of $\\{Y_t\\}$ is:\n$$E[Y_t] = E[u_t - u_{t-1}] = E[u_t] - E[u_{t-1}] = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThe variance, or autocovariance at lag $0$, is $\\gamma_0$:\n$$\\gamma_0 = Var(Y_t) = E[Y_t^2] = E[(u_t - u_{t-1})^2] = E[u_t^2 - 2u_t u_{t-1} + u_{t-1}^2]$$\nSince $\\{u_t\\}$ is i.i.d. with mean $0$, $E[u_t u_{t-1}] = E[u_t]E[u_{t-1}] = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\\gamma_0 = E[u_t^2] + E[u_{t-1}^2] = Var(u_t) + Var(u_{t-1}) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2$$\nThe autocovariance at lag $1$, $\\gamma_1$, is:\n$$\\gamma_1 = Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-1}) = E[Y_t Y_{t-1}] = E[(u_t - u_{t-1})(u_{t-1} - u_{t-2})]$$\n$$= E[u_t u_{t-1} - u_t u_{t-2} - u_{t-1}^2 + u_{t-1} u_{t-2}]$$\nDue to the i.i.d. property of $\\{u_t\\}$, all cross-product terms with different time indices have an expectation of zero.\n$$\\gamma_1 = 0 - 0 - E[u_{t-1}^2] + 0 = -Var(u_{t-1}) = -\\sigma^2$$\nThe autocovariance at lag $k \\ge 2$, $\\gamma_k$, is:\n$$\\gamma_k = E[Y_t Y_{t-k}] = E[(u_t - u_{t-1})(u_{t-k} - u_{t-k-1})]$$\nFor $k \\ge 2$, all time indices in the expansion ($t, t-1, t-k, t-k-1$) are distinct. Thus, the expectation of every term is zero.\n$$\\gamma_k = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k \\ge 2$$\n\nNow we compute the autocorrelation function (ACF), $\\rho_k = \\gamma_k / \\gamma_0$.\nFor lag $1$:\n$$\\rho_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_0} = \\frac{-\\sigma^2}{2\\sigma^2} = -0.5$$\nFor lags $k \\ge 2$:\n$$\\rho_k = \\frac{\\gamma_k}{\\gamma_0} = \\frac{0}{2\\sigma^2} = 0$$\nThe theoretical ACF for $\\{Y_t\\}$ has a single non-zero value at lag $1$ of exactly $-0.5$ and cuts off to zero for all subsequent lags. This is the defining characteristic of an MA($1$) process.\n\nNext, we address the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). For a general MA($q$) process, the PACF tails off, meaning it decays towards zero rather than cutting off abruptly. The process $Y_t = u_t - u_{t-1}$ is a special case of an MA($1$) process with parameter $\\theta_1 = -1$. This is a non-invertible MA process, as invertibility requires $|\\theta_1| < 1$. The PACF, $\\phi_{kk}$, can be shown to follow the pattern:\n$$\\phi_{kk} = -\\frac{1}{k+1}$$\nFor example:\n- $\\phi_{11} = \\rho_1 = -0.5 = -1/2$\n- $\\phi_{22} = -1/3 \\approx -0.333$\n- $\\phi_{33} = -1/4 = -0.25$\nThis demonstrates a gradual, monotonic decay towards $0$ as the lag $k$ increases. The PACF does not alternate in sign.\n\nSummary of theoretical behavior:\n- **ACF**: Cuts off after lag $1$, with $\\rho_1 = -0.5$.\n- **PACF**: Decays gradually towards $0$ (specifically, $\\phi_{kk} = -1/(k+1)$).\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. The ACF shows a single pronounced negative spike at lag $1$ of about $-0.5$ and is essentially $0$ for lags greater than $1$; the PACF decays gradually toward $0$, potentially with alternating signs.\n- ACF description: \"single pronounced negative spike at lag $1$ of about $-0.5$\" and \"essentially $0$ for lags greater than $1$\". This is a precise description of our derived ACF.\n- PACF description: \"decays gradually toward $0$\". This is a correct description of the PACF of an MA process. The phrase \"potentially with alternating signs\" is a general statement about decaying PACFs; in this specific case, the decay is monotonic and negative, which is a form of gradual decay. This option aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The ACF decays very slowly and positively from near $1$, characteristic of a near-unit-root autoregression; the PACF has a single large positive spike at lag $1$ and is essentially $0$ afterward.\n- ACF description: Incorrect. The ACF cuts off after lag $1$ and is negative. A slowly decaying positive ACF is characteristic of a process with a unit root or near-unit root in its autoregressive part, such as an AR($1$) with $\\phi \\approx 1$.\n- PACF description: Incorrect. The PACF decays gradually. A single spike in the PACF is characteristic of an AR process.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The ACF shows a single pronounced positive spike at lag $1$ near $+0.5$ and is essentially $0$ for lags greater than $1$; the PACF decays gradually toward $0$.\n- ACF description: Incorrect. The spike at lag $1$ is negative ($-0.5$), not positive. A positive spike would imply a process like $Y_t = u_t + u_{t-1}$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Both the ACF and the PACF cut off after lag $2$, indicating a short-memory process with only two nonzero lags of dependence.\n- ACF description: Incorrect. The ACF cuts off after lag $1$, not $2$.\n- PACF description: Incorrect. The PACF decays gradually; it does not cut off.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The ACF alternates in sign with a slowly decaying oscillation over many lags; the PACF has a single large negative spike at lag $1$ and is essentially $0$ afterward.\n- ACF description: Incorrect. The ACF cuts off. A decaying, oscillating ACF is characteristic of an AR($2$) process with complex roots or an AR process with negative coefficients.\n- PACF description: Incorrect. The PACF decays gradually. A single spike in the PACF is characteristic of an AR($1$) process.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The model is a first-order autoregressive process, AR($1$), given by the recursion $X_t = \\phi X_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t$, where $\\{\\varepsilon_t\\}$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_t] = 0$ and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_t) = \\sigma_\\varepsilon^2$. We are given the condition $|\\phi| < 1$, which ensures weak stationarity. Our objective is to compute the $h$-step-ahead forecast mean and the variance of the forecast error, conditional on the observation $X_t = x_t$.\n\nFirst, we derive the $h$-step-ahead forecast mean, which is the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_{t+h} \\mid X_t = x_t]$.

For each test case, output the list of detected shock indices (using $0$-based indexing). For example, the final output must be of the form\n$[\\,[\\text{indices for Case A}],\\,[\\text{indices for Case B}],\\,[\\text{indices for Case C}],\\,[\\text{indices for Case D}]\\,]$,\nwith each inner list consisting solely of integers in ascending order.\n\nNo physical units are involved; the threshold is dimensionless. Angles in trigonometric functions are in radians by construction via the $\\sin$ function’s argument. All reported quantities must be integers or lists of integers. The computation must be deterministic and require no random number generation.",
            "solution": "### 1. Time Series Generation and Transformation\n\nFor each test case, a discrete-time count process $x_t$ of length $T$ is generated. The process is defined by a baseline component $b_t$ and a shock component $s_t$, such that the final count at time $t$ is $x_t = \\lfloor b_t \\rfloor + s_t$.\n\nCount data often exhibit heteroscedasticity, where the variance is a function of the mean. For a Poisson process, $\\operatorname{Var}(x_t) = \\operatorname{E}(x_t) = \\lambda_t$. To satisfy the constant variance assumption of many time series models, a variance-stabilizing transformation is applied. The problem specifies two such transformations:\n1.  **Square-root transform:** $z_t = \\sqrt{x_t + c}$, with $c=0.5$. This transform is motivated by the Delta method, which shows that for a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ with mean $\\lambda$, the variance of $\\sqrt{X}$ is approximately constant ($\\approx 1/4$) for large $\\lambda$.\n2.  **Logarithmic transform:** $z_t = \\log(x_t + 1)$. This transform is effective when the standard deviation of the data is proportional to the mean.\n\nThe resulting series is $z_t$.\n\n### 2. Stationarity Induction and Centering\n\nThe \"I\" in ARIMA stands for \"Integrated\" and implies that the raw time series is non-stationary but its differences are stationary. Stationarity is induced by differencing the transformed series $z_t$. For a differencing order of $d=1$, the new series $w_t$ is defined as:\n$$w_t = z_t - z_{t-1}, \\quad \\text{for } t = 1, \\dots, T-1$$\nThis operation produces a series of length $N = T-1$. A shock at an original index $t^\\star$ introduces large-magnitude values in $w_{t^\\star}$ and $w_{t^\\star+1}$.\n\nThe ARMA model is to be fitted to a zero-mean series. Therefore, the series $w_t$ is centered by subtracting its sample mean, $\\bar{w}$:\n$$y_\\tau = w_{\\tau+1} - \\bar{w}, \\quad \\text{for } \\tau = 0, \\dots, N-1$$\nwhere $\\bar{w} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} w_t$. The new series $y_\\tau$ has a sample mean of zero. Note the re-indexing from $t$ to $\\tau$ for implementation convenience, where $\\tau = t-1$.\n\n### 3. ARMA(1,1) Parameter Estimation\n\nAn Autoregressive Moving Average ARMA(1,1) model is specified for the stationary, centered series $y_\\tau$. The model is given by:\n$$y_\\tau = \\phi y_{\\tau-1} + \\epsilon_\\tau + \\theta \\epsilon_{\\tau-1}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_\\tau$ is a white noise process with $\\epsilon_\\tau \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, and $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ are the autoregressive and moving average parameters, respectively.\n\nTo estimate $(\\phi, \\theta)$, we use the method of conditional sum of squares (CSS). This involves minimizing an objective function $J(\\phi, \\theta)$ representing the mean squared innovations (residuals). The innovations are defined by rearranging the model equation:\n$$\\epsilon_\\tau = y_\\tau - \\phi y_{\\tau-1} - \\theta \\epsilon_{\\tau-1}$$\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n$$J(\\phi, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{N-1}\\epsilon_\\tau^2$$\nThe recursion requires initial conditions. As specified, we use $y_{-1} = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{-1} = 0$. The first innovation is then $\\epsilon_0 = y_0$.\n\nThis is a numerical optimization problem. We seek $(\\hat{\\phi}, \\hat{\\theta})$ such that:\n$$(\\hat{\\phi}, \\hat{\\theta}) = \\underset{\\phi, \\theta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} \\, J(\\phi, \\theta)$$\nThe optimization is performed subject to the constraints $\\phi \\in (-1, 1)$ and $\\theta \\in (-1, 1)$, which are necessary conditions for the stationarity and invertibility of the ARMA process. A numerical solver, such as a quasi-Newton method with box constraints (e.g., L-BFGS-B), is suitable for this task.\n\n### 4. Shock Detection via Standardized Residuals\n\nAfter obtaining the optimal parameters $(\\hat{\\phi}, \\hat{\\theta})$, the final residual series $\\hat{\\epsilon}_\\tau$ is calculated using the recursive formula with these estimated parameters. These residuals represent the portion of the data not explained by the fitted ARMA model. Shocks or anomalies are expected to manifest as large-magnitude residuals.\n\nThe variance of the white noise process, $\\sigma^2$, is estimated using the mean of the squared residuals:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{N-1}\\hat{\\epsilon}_\\tau^2$$\nNote that $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ is simply the minimized value of the objective function $J(\\hat{\\phi}, \\hat{\\theta})$. The estimated standard deviation is $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}$.\n\nThe residuals are then standardized to have unit variance:\n$$r_\\tau = \\frac{\\hat{\\epsilon}_\\tau}{\\hat{\\sigma}}$$\nStandardized residuals with large absolute values indicate points that are outliers with respect to the model.\n\nThe final step is to identify shock locations. A shock is declared whenever the absolute value of a standardized residual exceeds a specified dimensionless threshold, $T_{\\text{thresh}}$. That is, a shock is detected for each residual index $\\tau$ satisfying:\n$$|r_\\tau| \\ge T_{\\text{thresh}}$$\nThe problem specifies a rule to map the residual index $\\tau$ back to the original time series index $t$. For each $\\tau$ that meets the shock condition, the corresponding original index is reported as $t = \\tau + d$. With the differencing order $d=1$, this becomes:\n$$t = \\tau + 1$$\nThe final output for each test case is a sorted list of these detected shock indices $t$.",
