All necessary parameters are provided, and they are consistent (probabilities sum to $1$ where required). The problem statement is clear, objective, and scientifically grounded within the field of statistical learning. It is well-posed and has a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundational assumptions for a hidden Markov model are:\n1.  **Markov Property**: The probability of the current hidden state depends only on the previous hidden state. $P(q_t|q_{t-1}, q_{t-2}, \\dots, q_1) = P(q_t|q_{t-1})$.\n2.  **Output Independence**: The probability of the current observation depends only on the current hidden state. $P(O_t|q_t, q_{t-1}, \\dots, q_1, O_{t-1}, \\dots, O_1) = P(O_t|q_t)$.\n\nThese assumptions allow the joint probability of an observation sequence $O=(O_1, \\dots, O_T)$ and a hidden state sequence $Q=(q_1, \\dots, q_T)$ to be expressed as:\n$$P(O,Q) = P(q_1) \\prod_{t=2}^{T} P(q_t|q_{t-1}) \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(O_t|q_t) = \\pi_{q_1} b_{q_1}(O_1) \\prod_{t=2}^{T} a_{q_{t-1}q_t} b_{q_t}(O_t)$$\n\nThe probability of the observation sequence $O$ is obtained by summing this joint probability over all possible hidden state sequences $Q$:\n$$P(O) = \\sum_{\\text{all } Q} P(O,Q)$$\n\nWe are asked to compute $P(O=(A,B,A))$ for the given HMM.\n\n**Part 1: Computation by Full Enumeration**\nWith $N=2$ states and a sequence length of $T=3$, there are $N^T = 2^3 = 8$ possible hidden state sequences $Q = (q_1, q_2, q_3)$. We calculate the joint probability $P(O, Q)$ for each sequence and sum the results. The observation sequence is $O=(A,B,A)$.\n\nThe formula for each path is $P(O,Q) = \\pi_{q_1} b_{q_1}(A) a_{q_1q_2} b_{q_2}(B) a_{q_2q_3} b_{q_3}(A)$.\n\n1.  $Q = (X,X,X)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_X b_X(A) a_{XX} b_X(B) a_{XX} b_X(A) = (0.6)(0.5)(0.8)(0.5)(0.8)(0.5) = 0.048$\n2.  $Q = (X,X,Y)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_X b_X(A) a_{XX} b_X(B) a_{XY} b_Y(A) = (0.6)(0.5)(0.8)(0.5)(0.2)(0.2) = 0.0048$\n3.  $Q = (X,Y,X)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_X b_X(A) a_{XY} b_Y(B) a_{YX} b_X(A) = (0.6)(0.5)(0.2)(0.8)(0.3)(0.5) = 0.0072$\n4.  $Q = (X,Y,Y)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_X b_X(A) a_{XY} b_Y(B) a_{YY} b_Y(A) = (0.6)(0.5)(0.2)(0.8)(0.7)(0.2) = 0.00672$\n5.  $Q = (Y,X,X)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_Y b_Y(A) a_{YX} b_X(B) a_{XX} b_X(A) = (0.4)(0.2)(0.3)(0.5)(0.8)(0.5) = 0.0048$\n6.  $Q = (Y,X,Y)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_Y b_Y(A) a_{YX} b_X(B) a_{XY} b_Y(A) = (0.4)(0.2)(0.3)(0.5)(0.2)(0.2) = 0.00048$\n7.  $Q = (Y,Y,X)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_Y b_Y(A) a_{YY} b_Y(B) a_{YX} b_X(A) = (0.4)(0.2)(0.7)(0.8)(0.3)(0.5) = 0.00672$\n8.  $Q = (Y,Y,Y)$: $P(O,Q) = \\pi_Y b_Y(A) a_{YY} b_Y(B) a_{YY} b_Y(A) = (0.4)(0.2)(0.7)(0.8)(0.7)(0.2) = 0.006272$\n\nSumming these probabilities:\n$P(O) = 0.048 + 0.0048 + 0.0072 + 0.00672 + 0.0048 + 0.00048 + 0.00672 + 0.006272 = 0.084992$.\n\n**Part 2: Verification using the Forward Algorithm**\nThe forward algorithm provides a more efficient method derived from the same first principles. The forward variable $\\alpha_t(i)$ is defined as the joint probability of observing the first $t$ observations and being in state $S_i$ at time $t$: $\\alpha_t(i) = P(O_1, \\dots, O_t, q_t=S_i)$.\n\n- **Initialization ($t=1$):** Observation is $O_1=A$.\n$\\alpha_1(X) = \\pi_X b_X(O_1) = (0.6)(0.5) = 0.3$\n$\\alpha_1(Y) = \\pi_Y b_Y(O_1) = (0.4)(0.2) = 0.08$\n\n- **Recursion ($t=2$):** Observation is $O_2=B$.\nThe recursive step is $\\alpha_t(j) = \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_{t-1}(i) a_{ij} \\right] b_j(O_t)$.\n$\\alpha_2(X) = [\\alpha_1(X) a_{XX} + \\alpha_1(Y) a_{YX}] b_X(O_2) = [(0.3)(0.8) + (0.08)(0.3)] (0.5) = [0.24 + 0.024](0.5) = (0.264)(0.5) = 0.132$\n$\\alpha_2(Y) = [\\alpha_1(X) a_{XY} + \\alpha_1(Y) a_{YY}] b_Y(O_2) = [(0.3)(0.2) + (0.08)(0.7)] (0.8) = [0.06 + 0.056](0.8) = (0.116)(0.8) = 0.0928$\n\n- **Recursion ($t=3$):** Observation is $O_3=A$.\n$\\alpha_3(X) = [\\alpha_2(X) a_{XX} + \\alpha_2(Y) a_{YX}] b_X(O_3) = [(0.132)(0.8) + (0.0928)(0.3)] (0.5) = [0.1056 + 0.02784](0.5) = (0.13344)(0.5) = 0.06672$\n$\\alpha_3(Y) = [\\alpha_2(X) a_{XY} + \\alpha_2(Y) a_{YY}] b_Y(O_3) = [(0.132)(0.2) + (0.0928)(0.7)] (0.2) = [0.0264 + 0.06496](0.2) = (0.09136)(0.2) = 0.018272$\n\n- **Termination:**\nThe final probability is the sum of the final forward variables:\n$P(O) = \\alpha_3(X) + \\alpha_3(Y) = 0.06672 + 0.018272 = 0.084992$.\nThe result matches the one obtained from full enumeration, which serves as a verification.\n\n**Part 3: Complexity Comparison**\n\n- **(i) Full Enumeration:**\n  For each of the $N^T$ possible hidden state sequences, the calculation of its joint probability involves $(T-1)$ transition probability multiplications and $T$ emission probability multiplications, for a total of $2T-1$ multiplications per sequence. The sum of these $N^T$ probabilities requires $N^T-1$ additions.\n  For $N=2$ and $T=3$:\n  - Multiplications: $N^T (2T-1) = 2^3 (2 \\cdot 3 - 1) = 8 \\times 5 = 40$.\n  - Additions: $N^T - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.\n\n- **(ii) Forward Algorithm:**\n  The complexity of the forward algorithm is dominated by the recursive step, which is performed $T-1$ times. In each step, for each of the $N$ states, we compute a sum of $N$ terms (requiring $N$ multiplications and $N-1$ additions) and then perform one more multiplication. This gives $N(N)$ multiplications and $N(N-1)$ additions per time step, plus $N$ multiplications for the emission probabilities. The initialization step requires $N$ multiplications. The termination step requires $N-1$ additions. The total complexity is on the order of $O(N^2 T)$.\n  For $N=2$ and $T=3$:\n  - Multiplications:\n    - $t=1$: $N=2$ multiplications.\n    - $t=2$: $N(N) + N = 2(2) + 2 = 6$ multiplications.\n    - $t=3$: $N(N) + N = 2(2) + 2 = 6$ multiplications.\n    - Total: $2 + 6 + 6 = 14$.\n  - Additions:\n    - $t=1$: $0$ additions.\n    - $t=2$: $N(N-1) = 2(2-1) = 2$ additions.\n    - $t=3$: $N(N-1) = 2(2-1) = 2$ additions.\n    - Termination: $N-1 = 1$ addition.\n    - Total: $2 + 2 + 1 = 5$.\n\nThe forward algorithm is significantly more efficient, especially for longer sequences, as it avoids the exponential complexity of enumerating all paths.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability of the observation sequence $(A, B, A)$ is $0.084992$. The problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $4$, $9$, $9$. The following digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant digit).\nThe rounded probability is $0.08499$.",
