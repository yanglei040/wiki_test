Before we can appreciate why an estimator is the \"best,\" we must first define the class of estimators we are working with: *Linear Unbiased Estimators*. This exercise  provides a foundational practice in identifying these properties, helping you distinguish which potential estimates for a parameter are constructed as a simple weighted average of the data (linear) and which will, on average, hit the true target (unbiased).",

            "problem": "An experimentalist makes two independent measurements, $y_1$ and $y_2$, of a physical quantity whose true, unknown value is $\\mu$. Each measurement is subject to a random error. The statistical model for these measurements is given by $y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i$ for $i=1, 2$.\n\nThe random errors $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are assumed to satisfy the following standard properties:\n1.

The errors are uncorrelated, meaning $\\text{Cov}(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) = 0$.\n\nTo combine the two measurements into a single, improved estimate for $\\mu$, a linear estimator of the form $\\tilde{\\mu} = w y_1 + (1-w) y_2$ is proposed, where $w$ is a real-valued weight. Your task is to find the specific numerical value of $w$ that minimizes the variance of this estimator, $\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu})$.",

The variance of the estimator is denoted by $\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu})$.\n\nFirst, we express the variance of $\\tilde{\\mu}$ using the properties of variance. For a linear combination of random variables, the variance is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab \\text{Cov}(X, Y)\n$$\nIn our case, the estimator is $\\tilde{\\mu} = w y_1 + (1-w) y_2$. The variables are $y_1$ and $y_2$, with coefficients $a=w$ and $b=1-w$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu}) = \\text{Var}(w y_1 + (1-w) y_2) = w^2 \\text{Var}(y_1) + (1-w)^2 \\text{Var}(y_2) + 2w(1-w) \\text{Cov}(y_1, y_2)\n$$\nNext, we need to find the variance of each measurement $y_i$ and the covariance between them.\nThe variance of $y_i$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(y_i) = \\text{Var}(\\mu + \\epsilon_i)\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a constant, its variance is zero. Thus, the variance of $y_i$ is simply the variance of the error term $\\epsilon_i$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(y_i) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\n$$\nThis holds for both $i=1$ and $i=2$.\n\nThe covariance between $y_1$ and $y_2$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(y_1, y_2) = \\text{Cov}(\\mu + \\epsilon_1, \\mu + \\epsilon_2)\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a constant, it does not affect the covariance.\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(y_1, y_2) = \\text{Cov}(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)\n$$\nThe problem states that the errors are uncorrelated, which means $\\text{Cov}(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) = 0$. Therefore, $\\text{Cov}(y_1, y_2) = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute these back into the expression for $\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu})$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu}) = w^2 (\\sigma^2) + (1-w)^2 (\\sigma^2) + 2w(1-w)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu}) = w^2 \\sigma^2 + (1-w)^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant variance $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu}) = \\sigma^2 [w^2 + (1-w)^2]\n$$\nTo find the value of $w$ that minimizes this variance, we can define a function $f(w) = w^2 + (1-w)^2$ and find its minimum. Since $\\sigma^2 > 0$, minimizing $f(w)$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu})$.\n\nLet's expand the function $f(w)$:\n$$\nf(w) = w^2 + (1 - 2w + w^2) = 2w^2 - 2w + 1\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $w$, representing a parabola opening upwards. The minimum can be found using calculus by taking the first derivative with respect to $w$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dw} = \\frac{d}{dw}(2w^2 - 2w + 1) = 4w - 2\n$$\nSet the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$\n4w - 2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n4w = 2\n$$\n$$\nw = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dw^2} = \\frac{d}{dw}(4w - 2) = 4\n$$\nSince the second derivative is positive ($4 > 0$), the critical point $w = 1/2$ corresponds to a local minimum. Because $f(w)$ is a parabola, this is a global minimum.\n\nThus, the variance of the estimator $\\tilde{\\mu}$ is minimized when $w = 1/2$.",
