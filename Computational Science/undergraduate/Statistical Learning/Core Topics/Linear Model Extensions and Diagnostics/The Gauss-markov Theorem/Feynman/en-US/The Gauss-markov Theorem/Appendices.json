Before we can appreciate what makes an estimator \"best,\" we must first be able to identify which estimators are \"linear\" and \"unbiased.\" This exercise will sharpen your understanding of these two foundational properties by asking you to sort through a variety of proposed estimators. By applying the definitions of linearity and unbiasedness, you will discover that multiple estimators can satisfy these criteria, which naturally leads to the question of how to choose among them. ",

The variance of the estimator is denoted by $\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu})$.\n\nFirst, we express the variance of $\\tilde{\\mu}$ using the properties of variance. For a linear combination of random variables, the variance is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) + b^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab \\text{Cov}(X, Y)\n$$\nIn our case, the estimator is $\\tilde{\\mu} = w y_1 + (1-w) y_2$. The variables are $y_1$ and $y_2$, with coefficients $a=w$ and $b=1-w$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\mu}) = \\text{Var}(w y_1 + (1-w) y_2) = w^2 \\text{Var}(y_1) + (1-w)^2 \\text{Var}(y_2) + 2w(1-w) \\text{Cov}(y_1, y_2)\n$$\nNext, we need to find the variance of each measurement $y_i$ and the covariance between them.\nThe variance of $y_i$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(y_i) = \\text{Var}(\\mu + \\epsilon_i)\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a constant, its variance is zero.
