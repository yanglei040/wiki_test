This is a principle of physical invariance. Therefore, for any individual with height `x_1` (in cm) or `z_1` (in m) and age `x_2`, the predicted values must be equal:\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{M_1} = \\hat{y}_{M_2}\n$$\nThis implies:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}x_{1} + \\hat{\\beta}_{2}x_{2} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{0} + \\hat{\\gamma}_{1}z_{1} + \\hat{\\gamma}_{2}x_{2}\n$$\nWe are given the relationship between `x_1` and `z_1`: `z_{1} = x_{1}/100`, which is equivalent to `x_{1} = 100z_{1}`. To relate the coefficients, we substitute the definition of `z_1` into the right-hand side of the equality:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}x_{1} + \\hat{\\beta}_{2}x_{2} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{0} + \\hat{\\gamma}_{1}\\left(\\frac{x_{1}}{100}\\right) + \\hat{\\gamma}_{2}x_{2}\n$$\nLet us rearrange the right-hand side to group terms by the original predictors `x_1` and `x_2`:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}x_{1} + \\hat{\\beta}_{2}x_{2} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{0} + \\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}}{100}\\right)x_{1} + \\hat{\\gamma}_{2}x_{2}\n$$\nFor this identity to hold true for all possible values of the predictors `x_1` and `x_2`, the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation must be equal. This is a direct application of the principle of equating coefficients of polynomials.\n\nBy comparing the constant terms (intercepts), we find:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{0}\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the `x_1` term, we find:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{1} = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}}{100}\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the `x_2` term, we find:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{2} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{2}\n$$\nFrom the second equality, we can solve for `\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}`:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{1} = 100 \\cdot \\hat{\\beta}_{1}\n$$\nUsing the given numerical value `\\hat{\\beta}_{1} = 0.12`, we compute `\\hat{\\gamma}_{1}`:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{1} = 100 \\cdot 0.12 = 12\n$$\nThe other coefficients for the model in meters are `\\hat{\\gamma}_{0} = \\hat{\\beta}_{0} = 50` and `\\hat{\\gamma}_{2} = \\hat{\\beta}_{2} = 0.7`.\n\n### Verification\nWe now verify that the fitted value `\\hat{y}` is the same for an individual with height `x_1 = 180` cm and age `x_2 = 50` years.

The baseline risk score is a continuous predictor denoted by $x$ (dimensionless). The model includes an intercept and no interaction terms. The categorical medication predictor is represented using standard indicator variables whose choice of baseline category is altered between two parameterizations of the same fitted model.\n\nParameterization $1$ uses medication $A$ as the baseline and employs indicators $I(B)$ and $I(C)$, defined by $I(B)=1$ if the patient received medication $B$ and $I(B)=0$ otherwise, and similarly for $I(C)$.

Finally, interpret why this computed contrast is invariant to the choice of baseline category even though the sign of some individual coefficients changes with the baseline choice.",
            "solution": "The analysis begins by formalizing the structure of the multiple linear regression model under the two specified parameterizations. In this model, the expected value of the outcome, systolic blood pressure ($y$), is a linear function of a continuous predictor, the baseline risk score ($x$), and a three-level categorical predictor, the medication type ($A$, $B$, or $C$). The model does not include interaction terms, which implies that the effect of the risk score $x$ on $y$ is assumed to be constant across all medication categories, and the difference in the effect of any two medications is constant across all values of $x$.\n\nFirst, we analyze Parameterization $1$, where medication $A$ serves as the baseline category. The model is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{y} = b_{0} + b_{B}I(B) + b_{C}I(C) + \\gamma x\n$$\nHere, $I(B)$ is an indicator variable that equals $1$ if the medication is $B$ and $0$ otherwise. Similarly, $I(C)$ is $1$ if the medication is $C$ and $0$ otherwise. For the baseline category $A$, both $I(B)$ and $I(C)$ are $0$.\n\nThe estimated coefficients are given as $b_{0}=130$, $b_{B}=-6$, $b_{C}=9$, and $\\gamma=1.8$.\n\nFrom this model, we can express the predicted mean systolic blood pressure for each medication category as a function of the risk score $x$:\n- For medication $A$ ($I(B)=0$, $I(C)=0$): $\\hat{y}_{A}(x) = b_{0} + \\gamma x = 130 + 1.8x$\n- For medication $B$ ($I(B)=1$, $I(C)=0$): $\\hat{y}_{B}(x) = b_{0} + b_{B} + \\gamma x = 130 - 6 + 1.8x = 124 + 1.8x$\n- For medication $C$ ($I(B)=0$, $I(C)=1$): $\\hat{y}_{C}(x) = b_{0} + b_{C} + \\gamma x = 130 + 9 + 1.8x = 139 + 1.8x$\n\nIn this parameterization, the intercept $b_{0}$ represents the predicted blood pressure for the baseline group (medication $A$) when the continuous predictor $x$ is zero. The coefficient $b_{B}$ represents the difference in predicted blood pressure between medication $B$ and medication $A$, i.e., $\\hat{y}_{B}(x) - \\hat{y}_{A}(x) = -6$ mmHg. Similarly, $b_{C}$ is the difference between medication $C$ and medication $A$, i.e., $\\hat{y}_{C}(x) - \\hat{y}_{A}(x) = 9$ mmHg.\n\nNext, we analyze Parameterization $2$, where medication $B$ serves as the baseline category. The model is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{y} = a_{0} + a_{A}I(A) + a_{C}I(C) + \\gamma x\n$$\nThe estimated coefficients are given as $a_{0}=124$, $a_{A}=6$, $a_{C}=15$, and $\\gamma=1.8$.\n\nThe predicted mean systolic blood pressure for each medication category is:\n- For medication $A$ ($I(A)=1$, $I(C)=0$): $\\hat{y}_{A}(x) = a_{0} + a_{A} + \\gamma x = 124 + 6 + 1.8x = 130 + 1.8x$\n- For medication $B$ ($I(A)=0$, $I(C)=0$): $\\hat{y}_{B}(x) = a_{0} + \\gamma x = 124 + 1.8x$\n- For medication $C$ ($I(A)=0$, $I(C)=1$): $\\hat{y}_{C}(x) = a_{0} + a_{C} + \\gamma x = 124 + 15 + 1.8x = 139 + 1.8x$\n\nAs expected, since both models represent the same fitted relationship to the same data, the predicted values ($\\hat{y}_{A}(x)$, $\\hat{y}_{B}(x)$, and $\\hat{y}_{C}(x)$) are identical under both parameterizations.\n\nThe quantity that governs the contrast between two medication categories is the difference in their predicted mean outcomes. For example, the contrast between medications $C$ and $A$ is defined as $\\hat{y}_{C}(x) - \\hat{y}_{A}(x)$. This difference is an estimable quantity, meaning its value is invariant to the specific choice of non-singular parameterization (i.e., the choice of baseline category).\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the predicted contrast in systolic blood pressure between medications $C$ and $A$, denoted $y_{C}-y_{A}$, for a baseline risk score of $x=20$. We can compute this using either parameterization.\n\nUsing Parameterization $1$:\nThe contrast is directly given by the coefficient $b_{C}$, which represents the difference between category $C$ and the baseline category $A$.\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{C}(x) - \\hat{y}_{A}(x) = (b_{0} + b_{C} + \\gamma x) - (b_{0} + \\gamma x) = b_{C}\n$$\nThe value of this contrast is $b_C = 9$. Since there are no interaction terms with $x$, this contrast is constant for all values of $x$. Thus, for $x=20$, the contrast is $9$ mmHg.\n\nUsing Parameterization $2$:\nThe contrast must be calculated as the difference between the linear combinations of coefficients that define the means for categories $C$ and $A$.\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{C}(x) - \\hat{y}_{A}(x) = (a_{0} + a_{C} + \\gamma x) - (a_{0} + a_{A} + \\gamma x) = a_{C} - a_{A}\n$$\nSubstituting the given coefficient values:\n$$\na_{C} - a_{A} = 15 - 6 = 9\n$$\nThis confirms that the contrast is $9$ mmHg, regardless of the parameterization used. The value is also independent of the specific value of $x=20$.\n\nThe reason this contrast is invariant to the choice of baseline category is that the coefficients for the indicator variables always represent a comparison relative to the *current* baseline. Changing the baseline changes the reference point, and thus changes the coefficient values, but the underlying differences between any two categories remain constant.\n- With baseline $A$, $b_C$ represents the contrast $(C-A)$.\n- With baseline $B$, $a_A$ represents $(A-B)$ and $a_C$ represents $(C-B)$. The contrast $(C-A)$ can be recovered as $(C-B) - (A-B) = a_C - a_A$.\nThese relationships algebraically demonstrate the invariance. For instance, $a_A = \\hat{y}_A(x) - \\hat{y}_B(x) = (\\hat{y}_A(x) - \\hat{y}_A(x)) - (\\hat{y}_B(x) - \\hat{y}_A(x)) = 0 - b_B = -b_B$. Indeed, $6 = -(-6)$. Likewise, $a_C = \\hat{y}_C(x) - \\hat{y}_B(x) = (\\hat{y}_C(x) - \\hat{y}_A(x)) - (\\hat{y}_B(x) - \\hat{y}_A(x)) = b_C - b_B$. Indeed, $15 = 9 - (-6)$.\nThe contrast $(C-A)$ is an estimable function, and its estimate is unique. Individual coefficients like $b_C$ or $a_C$ are not, by themselves, estimable quantities without reference to a specific model parameterization; their values and interpretations depend on the chosen baseline. The sign change observed in $b_B = -6$ versus $a_A = 6$ is a direct consequence of reversing the direction of comparison: $b_B$ estimates $(B-A)$ while $a_A$ estimates $(A-B)$, so it is necessary that $a_A = -b_B$. The fundamental difference between the effects of medications $A$ and $B$ is preserved.\n\nThe final requested value is the predicted contrast in systolic blood pressure between medications $C$ and $A$, which is $9$ mmHg.",

However, the partial coefficient $\\beta_1$ can be negative. This phenomenon is a form of suppression. The condition for $\\beta_1$ to be negative is:\n$$ \\frac{0.2 - 0.8 \\rho}{1 - \\rho^2} < 0 $$\nSince $0 < \\rho < 1$, the denominator $1 - \\rho^2$ is positive. Thus, the sign of $\\beta_1$ is determined by the numerator:\n$$ 0.2 - 0.8 \\rho < 0 \\implies 0.2 < 0.8 \\rho \\implies \\rho > \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = 0.25 $$\nSo, if $\\rho > 0.25$, the partial effect of $x_1$ on $y$ is negative, despite their positive marginal covariance.\n\n**Conceptual Explanation:**\nThe coefficient $\\beta_1$ represents the expected change in $y$ for a one-unit change in $x_1$, while holding $x_2$ constant. The predictor $x_2$ has a strong positive association with $y$ ($\\operatorname{Cov}(x_2, y) = 0.8$), and $x_1$ is also positively correlated with $x_2$ ($\\rho > 0$). A portion of the observed positive association between $x_1$ and $y$ is mediated through $x_2$: an increase in $x_1$ is associated with an increase in $x_2$, which in turn is associated with a strong increase in $y$. Multiple regression \"partials out\" this indirect effect. If the indirect positive association via $x_2$ is sufficiently strong (i.e., $\\rho$ is large enough), it can mask an underlying negative direct association between $x_1$ and $y$.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nIn the vector space of zero-mean random variables, the OLS coefficient $\\beta_1$ can be understood through orthogonal projections, as specified by the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. The coefficient $\\beta_1$ is the regression coefficient of $y$ on the part of $x_1$ that is orthogonal to $x_2$. Let $x_{1|2}$ be the residual from regressing $x_1$ on $x_2$:\n$$ x_{1|2} = x_1 - \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(x_1, x_2)}{\\operatorname{Var}(x_2)} x_2 = x_1 - \\rho x_2 $$\nThen $\\beta_1$ is given by the simple regression of $y$ on $x_{1|2}$:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(y, x_{1|2})}{\\operatorname{Var}(x_{1|2})} $$\nThe numerator is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(y, x_1 - \\rho x_2) = \\operatorname{Cov}(y, x_1) - \\rho \\operatorname{Cov}(y, x_2) = 0.2 - \\rho(0.8) $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(x_1 - \\rho x_2) = \\operatorname{Var}(x_1) - 2\\rho \\operatorname{Cov}(x_1, x_2) + \\rho^2 \\operatorname{Var}(x_2) = 1 - 2\\rho(\\rho) + \\rho^2(1) = 1 - \\rho^2 $$\nThus, $\\beta_1 = \\frac{0.2 - 0.8\\rho}{1 - \\rho^2}$, confirming our derivation. Geometrically, $\\beta_1$ is not determined by the projection of the vector $y$ onto $x_1$ (which is positive), but by the projection of $y$ onto the vector $x_{1|2}$ (the part of $x_1$ orthogonal to $x_2$). If $\\rho$ is large and positive, the vectors $x_1$ and $x_2$ are close in direction. The vector $x_{1|2}$ represents the \"correction\" needed to go from $\\rho x_2$ to $x_1$. The projection of $y$ onto this \"correction\" vector can be negative even if the projection of $y$ onto $x_1$ is positive. This happens when the strong pull of $y$ towards $x_2$ (due to $\\operatorname{Cov}(y, x_2) = 0.8$) is so dominant that the vector component required for the residual part of $x_1$ becomes negative.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe evaluate $\\beta_1$ at $\\rho = 0.9$:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{0.2 - 0.8(0.9)}{1 - (0.9)^2} = \\frac{0.2 - 0.72}{1 - 0.81} = \\frac{-0.52}{0.19} $$\n$$ \\beta_1 \\approx -2.736842... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\beta_1 = -2.737$.\nThe result confirms the suppression effect: with a high correlation of $\\rho = 0.9$ (which is $> 0.25$), the partial coefficient $\\beta_1$ is indeed negative.",
