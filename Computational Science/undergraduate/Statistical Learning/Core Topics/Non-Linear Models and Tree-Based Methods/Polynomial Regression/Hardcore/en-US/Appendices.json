The columns of the resulting design matrix often become nearly linearly dependent, a problem known as multicollinearity, which leads to numerical instability.

            "solution": "The problem requires a comparison of two methods for solving a polynomial least-squares regression problem. The core task is to find the coefficient vector $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ that minimizes the empirical risk, defined as the mean squared error between the predicted values and the observed responses.\n\nGiven a set of $n$ data points $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, we wish to fit a polynomial of degree $d$. The model is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^d \\beta_k x^k$. The empirical risk function to be minimized is:\n$$ R(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\left\\| y - \\Phi\\beta \\right\\|_2^2 $$\nHere, $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of responses, $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ is the vector of coefficients to be determined, and $\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times (d+1)}$ is the design matrix. The columns of $\\Phi$ are formed by the monomial basis functions, such that $(\\Phi)_{ik} = x_i^k$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$.\n\nWe will explore two methods for finding the optimal coefficients $\\beta$.\n\nMethod 1: Direct Solution via Normal Equations\n\nThe standard method for solving this linear least-squares problem is to find the $\\beta$ that makes the gradient of the risk function, $\\nabla_\\beta R(\\beta)$, equal to zero.\n$$ \\nabla_\\beta R(\\beta) = \\frac{2}{n} \\Phi^\\top (\\Phi\\beta - y) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to the well-known normal equations:\n$$ (\\Phi^\\top \\Phi) \\beta = \\Phi^\\top y $$\nThe solution, which we denote $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})}$, can be found by solving this linear system. However, this approach can be numerically unstable. The condition number of the matrix $\\Phi^\\top \\Phi$ is the square of the condition number of $\\Phi$. For the monomial basis, the columns of $\\Phi$ (i.e., $x^0, x^1, \\dots, x^d$) can become nearly linearly dependent, especially for high degrees $d$ or when data points $x_i$ are clustered. This makes $\\Phi^\\top \\Phi$ ill-conditioned and the numerical solution $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})}$ sensitive to small perturbations and floating-point errors.\n\nMethod 2: Orthonormal Basis Approach\n\nTo mitigate the numerical instability, we can first transform the monomial basis into an orthonormal basis. The problem specifies using the Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm to orthonormalize the columns of $\\Phi$, denoted $\\{\\phi_k\\}_{k=0}^d$. The orthonormality is defined with respect to the empirical inner product $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\frac{1}{n} u^\\top v$ for $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe MGS algorithm generates a new matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times (d+1)}$ whose columns $\\{q_k\\}_{k=0}^d$ are orthonormal, i.e., $\\langle q_j, q_k \\rangle = \\delta_{jk}$, and an upper triangular matrix $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(d+1) \\times (d+1)}$ such that $\\Phi = QR$. The columns of $Q$ span the same space as the columns of $\\Phi$. The MGS process proceeds as follows:\nLet $v_k$ be the working vectors, initialized as $v_k = \\phi_k$.\nFor $k = 0, \\dots, d$:\n1. Compute the norm of the current vector: $r_{kk} = \\|v_k\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle v_k, v_k \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} v_k^\\top v_k}$.\n2. Normalize the vector to get the $k$-th orthonormal basis vector: $q_k = v_k / r_{kk}$.\n3. For all subsequent vectors $j = k+1, \\dots, d$:\n   a. Compute the projection coefficient: $r_{kj} = \\langle q_k, v_j \\rangle = \\frac{1}{n} q_k^\\top v_j$.\n   b. Subtract the projection of $v_j$ onto $q_k$: $v_j \\leftarrow v_j - r_{kj} q_k$. This step is what characterizes the \"modified\" algorithm, as it uses the updated vectors for subsequent projections, which enhances numerical stability compared to the classical version.\n\nWith the decomposition $\\Phi = QR$, the regression model can be rewritten as $y \\approx \\Phi\\beta = (QR)\\beta$. We can re-parameterize the model in terms of the orthonormal basis $Q$ with a new coefficient vector $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$: $y \\approx Q\\alpha$. The risk function becomes:\n$$ R(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{n} \\|y - Q\\alpha\\|_2^2 $$\nThe corresponding normal equations are $(\\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top Q) \\alpha = \\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top y$. By construction, the columns of $Q$ are orthonormal under the specified inner product, so $\\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top Q = I_{d+1}$, the identity matrix. The system simplifies dramatically, yielding a direct solution for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top y $$\nTo find the coefficients in the original monomial basis, we relate $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. From $Q\\alpha \\approx \\Phi\\beta = QR\\beta$, and assuming $Q$ has full column rank, we can left-multiply by $\\frac{1}{n}Q^\\top$ to get $(\\frac{1}{n}Q^\\top Q)\\alpha \\approx (\\frac{1}{n}Q^\\top Q)R\\beta$, which simplifies to $\\alpha \\approx R\\beta$. Since $R$ is upper triangular, the system $R\\beta = \\alpha$ can be solved efficiently and stably for $\\beta$ using back substitution. We denote this solution $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{ortho})}$.\n\nThe comparison of $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})}$ and $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{ortho})}$ serves as a practical demonstration of the numerical benefits of orthogonalization. Any significant difference, quantified by $\\max_{k} |\\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})}_k - \\beta^{(\\mathrm{ortho})}_k|$, highlights the instability of the direct normal equations approach. The second metric, the orthonormality deviation $\\left\\| \\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top Q - I \\right\\|_{\\mathrm{F}}$, measures how well the MGS implementation succeeded in producing an orthonormal basis in finite-precision arithmetic.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1. Construct the monomial design matrix $\\Phi$ for the given data $\\{x_i\\}$ and degree $d$.\n2. Solve $(\\Phi^\\top \\Phi) \\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})} = \\Phi^\\top y$ for $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{mono})}$.\n3. Apply the Modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm with the empirical inner product to $\\Phi$ to obtain matrices $Q$ and $R$.\n4. Calculate $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top y$.\n5. Solve the upper triangular system $R \\beta^{(\\mathrm{ortho})} = \\alpha$ for $\\beta^{(\\mathrm{ortho})}$.\n6. Compute the maximum absolute difference between the two coefficient vectors.\n7. Compute the Frobenius norm of $\\left( \\frac{1}{n} Q^\\top Q - I \\right)$ to check the quality of the orthonormalization.",

All definitions and procedures are standard in the field. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. OLS provides a unique solution given that the design matrix has full column rank, which is guaranteed for polynomial regression with $n_{\\text{in}}=30$ distinct $x$-values and degree $d=3$. The Huber loss function is convex, ensuring that the minimization problem has a unique solution, and the standard IRLS algorithm is a reliable method for finding it.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms.

The specified computations are well within the capabilities of standard numerical libraries and are computationally feasible. The values are abstract and do not represent physical quantities, thus avoiding physical implausibility.\n- **Structure and Triviality**: The problem is well-structured, guiding the user from data generation to model fitting and finally to sensitivity analysis. It is not trivial, as it requires correct implementation of a non-linear optimization algorithm (IRLS) and careful calculation of several specific metrics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe objective is to compare the sensitivity of two regression methods, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and a robust method using Huber loss, to adversarial data poisoning. We will implement both methods to fit a degree-$d$ polynomial, $p(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} \\beta_j x^j$, to datasets contaminated with outliers.\n\n**1. Linear Algebraic Formulation**\n\nBoth regression methods can be expressed within the framework of linear algebra. For a set of $n$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the polynomial model can be written as a system of linear equations $y \\approx X\\beta$, where $y = [y_1, \\dots, y_n]^T$ is the vector of observed values, $\\beta = [\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_d]^T$ is the vector of coefficients to be determined, and $X$ is the $n \\times (d+1)$ design matrix (a Vandermonde matrix):\n$$\nX = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  x_1  x_1^2  \\dots  x_1^d \\\\\n1  x_2  x_2^2  \\dots  x_2^d \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n1  x_n  x_n^2  \\dots  x_n^d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe residual vector is defined as $r = y - X\\beta$.\n\n**2. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**\n\nOLS fitting seeks the coefficient vector $\\beta_{\\text{OLS}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, also known as the squared L2-norm of the residual vector.\n$$\n\\text{minimize} \\quad L(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^2 = \\|y - X\\beta\\|_2^2\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $\\beta$, and its minimum can be found by setting the gradient to zero: $\\nabla_{\\beta} L(\\beta) = -2X^T(y - X\\beta) = 0$. This leads to the well-known normal equations:\n$$\n(X^T X)\\beta = X^T y\n$$\nAssuming $X^T X$ is invertible (which holds if $X$ has full column rank), the unique solution is $\\beta_{\\text{OLS}} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$. Numerically, this system is best solved using methods like QR decomposition or SVD, as encapsulated in a standard linear least-squares solver.\n\n**3. Robust Regression with Huber Loss via IRLS**\n\nThe quadratic nature of the OLS loss function makes it highly sensitive to outliers, as large residuals contribute disproportionately to the total error. Robust regression aims to mitigate this by using a loss function that grows less rapidly for large residuals. The Huber loss function, $\\rho_{\\delta}(r)$, is a hybrid that behaves quadratically for small residuals but linearly for large ones:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\delta}(r) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2} r^2,  \\text{if } |r| \\le \\delta,\\\\\n\\delta |r| - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^2,  \\text{if } |r|  \\delta.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\delta$ is a threshold separating small from large residuals. The objective is to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\rho_{\\delta}(r_i)$. Since this objective is not a simple quadratic function, an iterative approach is required. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is a standard algorithm for this. It works by solving a sequence of weighted least squares problems that converge to the solution of the robust objective.\n\nThe first-order condition for minimizing the Huber objective is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\psi_{\\delta}(r_i) x_{ij} = 0$ for each $j=0, \\dots, d$, where $\\psi_{\\delta}(r) = \\rho'_{\\delta}(r)$ is the score function. By defining a weight function $w(r) = \\psi_{\\delta}(r)/r$, this condition can be rewritten as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w(r_i) r_i x_{ij} = 0$, which are the normal equations for a weighted least squares problem with weights $w_i = w(r_i)$. The weights are given by:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{\\psi_{\\delta}(r_i)}{r_i} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1,  \\text{if } |r_i| \\le \\delta, \\\\\n\\frac{\\delta}{|r_i|},  \\text{if } |r_i|  \\delta.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis formulation gives rise to the IRLS algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Obtain an initial estimate for the coefficients, $\\beta^{(0)}$. The OLS solution is a suitable choice.\n2.  **Iteration**: For $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ until convergence:\n    a.  **Calculate Residuals**: $r^{(k)} = y - X\\beta^{(k)}$.\n    b.  **Estimate Scale**: The threshold $\\delta$ depends on the scale of the residuals. A robust estimate of scale is the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): $\\hat{s} = C \\cdot \\text{median}(|r^{(k)} - \\text{median}(r^{(k)})|)$, where $C = 1.4826$ makes it a consistent estimator for the standard deviation under normality. If $\\hat{s}$ is pathologically small (e.g., less than a small constant $\\varepsilon$), we fall back to a more stable estimate, $\\max(\\text{std}(r^{(k)}), \\varepsilon)$.\n    c.  **Set Threshold**: $\\delta = \\kappa \\hat{s}$, with $\\kappa = 1.345$ being a standard choice for high efficiency.\n    d.  **Compute Weights**: $W^{(k)}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $w_i^{(k)} = \\min(1, \\delta / |r_i^{(k)}|)$. The case $r_i^{(k)} = 0$ is handled by setting $w_i^{(k)}=1$.\n    e.  **Solve Weighted Least Squares**: Update the coefficients by solving the WLS problem:\n        $$\n        \\beta^{(k+1)} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\|(W^{(k)})^{1/2}(y - X\\beta)\\|_2^2\n        $$\n        This is equivalent to solving the weighted normal equations $(X^T W^{(k)} X)\\beta^{(k+1)} = X^T W^{(k)} y$.\n    f. **Check Convergence**: The process terminates if the relative change in the coefficient vector is below a tolerance $\\tau$, i.e., $\\frac{\\|\\beta^{(k+1)} - \\beta^{(k)}\\|_2}{\\|\\beta^{(k)}\\|_2 + \\varepsilon}  \\tau$, or if a maximum number of iterations $M$ is reached.\n\n**4. Data Generation and Analysis**\n\nFollowing the problem specification, a \"clean\" dataset of $n_{\\text{in}} = 30$ inliers is generated from a true cubic polynomial with added Gaussian noise. This dataset is fixed using a specific random seed. For each of the four test cases, a \"poisoned\" dataset is created by appending the specified outliers.\n\nWe first compute the \"clean\" coefficient vectors, $\\beta^{\\text{clean}}_{\\text{OLS}}$ and $\\beta^{\\text{clean}}_{\\text{Huber}}$, by fitting both models to the inlier-only dataset. Then, for each test case, we compute the \"poisoned\" vectors, $\\beta^{\\text{poison}}_{\\text{OLS}}$ and $\\beta^{\\text{poison}}_{\\text{Huber}}$, by fitting the models to the respective combined datasets.\n\nThe sensitivity of each method is quantified using two ratios:\n-   $R_{\\text{drift}}$: This measures how much more the OLS coefficients drift from their \"clean\" values compared to the Huber coefficients when outliers are introduced. A value much larger than $1$ indicates that OLS is significantly less stable.\n-   $R_{\\text{RMSE}}$: This measures how much more the OLS model's predictive accuracy on the original clean data degrades compared to the Huber model. A value much larger than $1$ shows that the OLS model is \"pulled\" further away from the true underlying trend, resulting in a poorer fit for the inliers.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by looping through the test cases, performing the required fits, and computing these metrics according to their precise mathematical definitions. For Case $1$ (no outliers), the \"poisoned\" set is identical to the \"clean\" set, leading to drift and inflation ratios of $1$ by definition.",

Your goal is to quantify and contrast their local bias near sharp changes and their overall accuracy on a set of well-defined test cases. You must derive your approach from the foundational statement that a regression estimator is obtained by minimizing an empirical loss in the form of a sum of squared residuals, and that a cubic smoothing spline is a piecewise polynomial of degree $3$ that balances fidelity to the data against curvature.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Definition of least squares: Given data points $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, an estimator $\\hat{f}$ is obtained by minimizing $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2$ over a function class.\n- Polynomial regression: The function class is $\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^p \\beta_k x^k \\}$ with degree $p$ fixed in advance.\n- Piecewise polynomials (cubic smoothing spline): The function class consists of functions that are polynomials of degree $3$ on subintervals with continuity up to the second derivative, determined by a smoothing parameter that trades off data fit and roughness.\n\nProgramming tasks and specifications:\n- For each test case below, generate a training set $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ with $n=201$ points where $x_i$ are equally spaced on $[0,1]$. The true function value is $f(x_i)$, and observed values are $y_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i$, where $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ with $\\sigma=0.01$. Use a single fixed random seed $12345$ for the entire program so that the noise is reproducible.\n- Fit a degree-$p$ polynomial regression with $p=9$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals on the training set. Implement it by constructing the Vandermonde design matrix and solving the least squares problem.\n- Fit a cubic smoothing spline (piecewise cubic polynomial) to the same training set, with smoothing factor $s = n \\sigma^2$. This produces a piecewise polynomial of degree $3$ with continuous first and second derivatives that approximately balances the residual sum of squares against a curvature penalty. Use a standard cubic smoothing spline routine that adheres to these properties.\n- For evaluation, create a dense grid of $m=4001$ points on $[0,1]$ and compute the predicted values $\\hat{f}_{\\text{poly}}(x)$ and $\\hat{f}_{\\text{spline}}(x)$ on this grid along with the true values $f(x)$.\n- Define the local mean absolute bias in a window of half-width $h$ centered at $c$ as\n$$\n\\text{LMA} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{I}|} \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{I}} \\left| \\hat{f}(x) - f(x) \\right| \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\mathcal{I} = \\{ x \\in [0,1] : |x-c| \\le h \\},\n$$\ncomputed on the dense grid. Define the global mean absolute error as\n$$\n\\text{GMAE} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\left| \\hat{f}(x_j) - f(x_j) \\right|.\n$$\n- For each test case, compute:\n    - The local mean absolute bias for the polynomial model and for the spline model.\n    - The global mean absolute error for the polynomial model and for the spline model.\n    - Two boolean indicators: whether the spline has strictly lower local mean absolute bias than the polynomial, and whether the spline has strictly lower global mean absolute error than the polynomial.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (jump discontinuity):\n    - True function: $f_1(x) = 0.2 + 0.5 x + 0.7 H(x - 0.5)$, where $H$ is the Heaviside step function.\n    - Center $c=0.5$, half-width $h=0.05$.\n- Case $2$ (sharp corner):\n    - True function: $f_2(x) = x - x^2 + 0.5 \\, |x - 0.6|$.\n    - Center $c=0.6$, half-width $h=0.05$.\n- Case $3$ (narrow spike):\n    - True function: $f_3(x) = 0.1 \\sin(8 \\pi x) + \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{(x-0.7)^2}{2 \\cdot 0.02^2} \\right)$.\n    - Center $c=0.7$, half-width $h=0.03$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each test case, output a sub-list containing six values in the following order:\n    $[$ local mean absolute bias of polynomial rounded to six decimal places, local mean absolute bias of spline rounded to six decimal places, a boolean indicating whether the spline’s local bias is strictly smaller, global mean absolute error of polynomial rounded to six decimal places, global mean absolute error of spline rounded to six decimal places, a boolean indicating whether the spline’s global error is strictly smaller $]$.\n- The final output must therefore be a single line of the form\n$[ [a_{1}, b_{1}, t_{1}, c_{1}, d_{1}, u_{1}], [a_{2}, b_{2}, t_{2}, c_{2}, d_{2}, u_{2}], [a_{3}, b_{3}, t_{3}, c_{3}, d_{3}, u_{3}] ]$\nwith no spaces, where $a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i$ are floats rounded to six decimals and $t_i,u_i$ are booleans.

            "solution": "The problem requires a comparative analysis of global polynomial regression and cubic smoothing splines. The analysis will be performed on three test cases featuring functions with non-smooth characteristics, such as a jump discontinuity, a sharp corner, and a narrow spike. The objective is to quantify the local bias and global accuracy of each method.\n\nThe analytical process begins from the foundational principle that a regression estimator $\\hat{f}$ for a dataset $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ is derived by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR), $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2$, over a specified class of functions.\n\n**1. Model Formulation and Estimation Strategy**\n\n**a) Global Polynomial Regression**\nFor polynomial regression of degree $p$, the function class is the set of all polynomials of degree at most $p$. The estimator takes the form:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{\\text{poly}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p} \\beta_k x^k = \\mathbf{x}^T \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}^T = [1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^p]$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p]^T$ is the vector of coefficients. The coefficients are determined by solving the linear least squares problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{f}_{\\text{poly}}(x_i))^2 \\equiv \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\| \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\|_2^2\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{y} = [y_1, \\dots, y_n]^T$ is the vector of observed values, and $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times (p+1)$ Vandermonde matrix where the $(i, j)$-th entry is $X_{ij} = x_i^{j-1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, p+1$. A numerically stable method, such as one based on QR decomposition, is employed to solve this system for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, rather than direct computation via the normal equations $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}) \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$.\n\n**b) Cubic Smoothing Spline**\nA cubic smoothing spline is a piecewise cubic polynomial. Unlike a global polynomial, its structure is locally adaptive. The estimator $\\hat{f}_{\\text{spline}}$ is found by solving a penalized least squares problem, which balances fidelity to the data with a penalty on the function's \"roughness.\" The optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\min_{f} \\left\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \\lambda \\int_{x_1}^{x_n} [f''(t)]^2 dt \\right\\}\n$$\nThe term $\\int [f''(t)]^2 dt$ is a measure of the total curvature of the function $f$. The smoothing parameter $\\lambda \\ge 0$ controls the trade-off: a larger $\\lambda$ results in a smoother function, while $\\lambda \\to 0$ leads to a function that interpolates the data. An equivalent formulation, used by many numerical libraries, is to find the function $f$ that minimizes the roughness penalty $\\int [f''(t)]^2 dt$ subject to the constraint that the SSR is below a certain threshold $s$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2 \\le s\n$$\nThe problem specifies using a smoothing factor $s = n\\sigma^2$, which is a standard choice. This choice implies that the total residual variance of the fit should be approximately equal to the total variance of the measurement noise, as expected for a good fit that does not overfit to the noise.\n\n**2. Algorithmic Implementation Steps**\n\nFor each specified test case, the following procedure is executed:\n\n1.  **Data Generation**: A training set of $n=201$ points $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ is generated. The $x_i$ values are uniformly spaced in the interval $[0,1]$. The corresponding $y_i$ values are computed as $y_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i$, where $f(x)$ is the true function for the test case and $\\epsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\sigma=0.01$. A fixed random seed ($12345$) ensures reproducibility of the noise vector. A dense evaluation grid of $m=4001$ points is also created on $[0,1]$.\n\n2.  **Model Fitting**:\n    - For polynomial regression, a Vandermonde matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ of size $201 \\times 10$ is constructed for polynomial degree $p=9$. The linear least squares problem $\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{y}$ is solved for the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ using `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.\n    - For the cubic smoothing spline, the `scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline` function is used. It is provided with the training data $(x_i, y_i)$ and the smoothing factor $s = n \\sigma^2 = 201 \\cdot (0.01)^2 = 0.0201$. The `k=3` (cubic) default is used.\n\n3.  **Prediction and Evaluation**:\n    - Both fitted models, $\\hat{f}_{\\text{poly}}$ and $\\hat{f}_{\\text{spline}}$, are used to compute predicted values on the dense evaluation grid of $m=4001$ points.\n    - Two metrics are computed to assess performance. The Global Mean Absolute Error (GMAE) is calculated over the entire evaluation grid:\n      $$\n      \\text{GMAE} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\left| \\hat{f}(x_j) - f(x_j) \\right|\n      $$\n    - The Local Mean Absolute (LMA) bias is computed within a specific window $[c-h, c+h]$ defined for each test case:\n      $$\n      \\text{LMA} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{I}|} \\sum_{x_j \\in \\mathcal{I}} \\left| \\hat{f}(x_j) - f(x_j) \\right|\n      $$\n      where $\\mathcal{I} = \\{x_j : |x_j - c| \\le h \\}$ is the set of evaluation points within the window.\n\n4.  **Comparison**: The LMA and GMAE values for the spline are compared to those for the polynomial to determine if the spline provides a strictly better fit, both locally and globally. These comparisons yield two boolean indicators per test case.\n\nThe final output compiles these six values (two LMA, two GMAE, two booleans) for each of the three test cases into a single structured list.",
