To find this, we use the Delta Method, which is based on a first-order Taylor expansion of $\\psi(\\hat{\\theta})$ around the true parameter $\\theta$.

Since $\\psi'(\\theta)$ is a constant for a fixed $\\theta$, we can apply Slutsky's theorem. The asymptotic distribution of $\\sqrt{n}(\\psi(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\psi(\\theta))$ is the distribution of the product of the constant $\\psi'(\\theta)$ and a normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, V_{\\varepsilon})$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is rooted in the fundamental principles of statistical decision theory and consists of a sequence of logically connected tasks for which a unique, meaningful solution can be derived from the provided information. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts, corresponding to the four tasks in the problem description.\n\n**Part 1: Exponential Family Form and Minimal Sufficiency**\n\nWe are given that the class-conditional density of the observation $X \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is Gaussian: $X \\mid Y=y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{y}, \\sigma^{2})$. Let us consider a single such density with parameter $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2  0$. The probability density function (PDF) is\n$$\nf(x; \\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nTo demonstrate that this belongs to a one-parameter natural exponential family, we must write it in the canonical form $f(x; \\eta) = h(x) \\exp(\\eta T(x) - A(\\eta))$. We expand the term in the exponent:\n$$\n-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = -\\frac{x^2 - 2x\\mu + \\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the PDF expression, we can rearrange the terms as follows:\n$$\nf(x; \\mu) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right] \\exp\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}\\right)x - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression matches the natural exponential family form. By comparing terms, we identify:\n- The sufficient statistic: $T(x) = x$.\n- The natural parameter: $\\eta = \\eta(\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$.\n- The base measure: $h(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n- The log-partition function (cumulant-generating function): $A(\\eta) = \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2}$. To express this as a function of $\\eta$, we invert the relationship for the natural parameter: $\\mu = \\eta\\sigma^2$. Substituting this gives $A(\\eta) = \\frac{(\\eta\\sigma^2)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\eta^2 \\sigma^4}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^2\\sigma^2$.\n\nThus, a sufficient statistic for the parameter $\\mu$ is $T(X) = X$.\n\nRegarding minimal sufficiency, a standard result for one-parameter natural exponential families states that if the natural parameter space $\\mathcal{H} = \\{\\eta(\\mu) \\mid \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ contains an open interval, then the corresponding statistic $T(X)$ is minimal sufficient. In this case, the original parameter $\\mu$ belongs to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\sigma^2$ is a fixed positive constant, the natural parameter $\\eta = \\mu/\\sigma^2$ also spans the entire real line, $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{R}$. As $\\mathbb{R}$ is an open set, the regularity conditions are met, and we conclude that $T(X) = X$ is a minimal sufficient statistic for $\\mu$.\n\n**Part 2: Distribution of the Sufficient Statistic**\n\nAs established in Part 1, a sufficient statistic for $\\mu$ is $T(X) = X$. The problem asks for the distribution of $T(X)$ conditional on the class label $Y=y$. This is, by definition, the distribution of $X$ conditional on $Y=y$.\nThe problem statement provides these distributions directly:\n$$\nX \\mid Y=y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{y}, \\sigma^{2})\n$$\nTherefore, the distribution of the sufficient statistic $T(X)$ is:\n- For class $Y=0$: $T(X) \\mid (Y=0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma^{2})$\n- For class $Y=1$: $T(X) \\mid (Y=1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma^{2})$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Bayes-Optimal Decision Rule**\n\nFor a binary classification problem with zero-one loss, the Bayes-optimal decision rule seeks to minimize the probability of misclassification. This is equivalent to assigning an observation $x$ to the class with the maximum posterior probability. The decision rule is to predict $Y=1$ if and only if:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid X=x)  \\mathbb{P}(Y=0 \\mid X=x)\n$$\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $\\mathbb{P}(Y=y \\mid X=x) = \\frac{p(x \\mid Y=y)\\mathbb{P}(Y=y)}{p(x)}$, where $p(x \\mid Y=y)$ is the class-conditional density and $\\mathbb{P}(Y=y) = \\pi_y$ is the class prior. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{p(x \\mid Y=1)\\pi_{1}}{p(x)}  \\frac{p(x \\mid Y=0)\\pi_{0}}{p(x)}\n$$\nSince $p(x)  0$, we can simplify this to a comparison involving the likelihoods and priors:\n$$\np(x \\mid Y=1)\\pi_{1}  p(x \\mid Y=0)\\pi_{0}\n$$\nBy the definition of sufficiency via the Factorization Theorem, any likelihood ratio $\\frac{p(x|\\theta_1)}{p(x|\\theta_0)}$ depends on the data $x$ only through a sufficient statistic $T(x)$. Here, the relevant parameters are $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_0$. Hence, the decision rule must be a function of $T(X)=X$.\n\nTo derive the explicit form of the rule, we take the natural logarithm of both sides (a strictly increasing function):\n$$\n\\ln(p(x \\mid Y=1)) + \\ln(\\pi_{1})  \\ln(p(x \\mid Y=0)) + \\ln(\\pi_{0})\n$$\nThe log-density for a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is $\\ln(p(x; \\mu)) = -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2)$. Substituting this into the inequality:\n$$\n-\\frac{(x-\\mu_{1})^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\ln(\\pi_{1})  -\\frac{(x-\\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\ln(\\pi_{0})\n$$\nThe term $-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2)$ cancels. Rearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{1}}{\\pi_{0}}\\right)  \\frac{(x-\\mu_{1})^2 - (x-\\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $2\\sigma^2$ and expanding the squares in the numerator:\n$$\n2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{1}}{\\pi_{0}}\\right)  (x^2 - 2x\\mu_{1} + \\mu_{1}^2) - (x^2 - 2x\\mu_{0} + \\mu_{0}^2)\n$$\n$$\n2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{1}}{\\pi_{0}}\\right)  -2x\\mu_{1} + 2x\\mu_{0} + \\mu_{1}^2 - \\mu_{0}^2\n$$\nWe isolate the terms containing $x$:\n$$\n2x(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})  \\mu_{1}^2 - \\mu_{0}^2 - 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{1}}{\\pi_{0}}\\right) = \\mu_{1}^2 - \\mu_{0}^2 + 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{0}}{\\pi_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $\\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{0}$, we can divide by $2(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})$. If $\\mu_{1}  \\mu_{0}$, the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$\nx  \\frac{\\mu_{1}^2 - \\mu_{0}^2}{2(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})} + \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{2(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{0}}{\\pi_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the first term gives:\n$$\nx  \\frac{(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})(\\mu_{1} + \\mu_{0})}{2(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{0}}{\\pi_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx  \\frac{\\mu_{0} + \\mu_{1}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{0}}{\\pi_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nThe Bayes-optimal rule is to predict $Y=1$ if and only if $T(X) = X$ exceeds this threshold. This explicitly shows that the decision depends on $X$ only through $T(X)$.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Calculation of the Threshold**\n\nWe are given the numerical values: $\\mu_{0} = 0$, $\\mu_{1} = 3$, $\\sigma^{2} = 1$, $\\pi_{0} = \\frac{13}{20}$, and $\\pi_{1} = \\frac{7}{20}$.

Their moments are: $\\mathbb{E}[D_j]=p$, $\\mathbb{E}[D_j^k]=p$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$ since $D_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and $\\operatorname{Var}(D_j) = p(1-p)$.\n-   The observation noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)$ has moments $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon^2]=\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\n-   The masked feature is $X'_j = D_j X_j$. Due to independence of $D_j$ and $X_j$:\n    -   $\\mathbb{E}[X'_j] = \\mathbb{E}[D_j]\\mathbb{E}[X_j] = p \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    -   $\\mathbb{E}[(X'_j)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[D_j^2 X_j^2] = \\mathbb{E}[D_j^2]\\mathbb{E}[X_j^2] = p\\sigma_j^2$.\n    -   For $j \\neq k$, $\\mathbb{E}[X'_j X'_k] = \\mathbb{E}[D_jX_j D_kX_k] = \\mathbb{E}[D_j]\\mathbb{E}[X_j]\\mathbb{E}[D_k]\\mathbb{E}[X_k]=0$.\n\nLet $\\Sigma = \\operatorname{diag}(\\sigma_1^2, \\dots, \\sigma_d^2)$ be the diagonal covariance matrix of $X$.\n\n### Derivation of the Expected Loss $\\mathbb{E}[L]$\nThe loss is $L = \\frac{1}{2}(y - w^\\top X')^2$. Substituting $y = w_*^\\top X + \\epsilon$ and $X' = D \\odot X$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} (w_*^\\top X + \\epsilon - w^\\top X')^2\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}[ (w_*^\\top X)^2 + \\epsilon^2 + (w^\\top X')^2 + 2(w_*^\\top X)\\epsilon - 2(w_*^\\top X)(w^\\top X') - 2\\epsilon(w^\\top X') ]\n$$\nWe evaluate the expectation of each term:\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon^2]=\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\n-   Terms with a single factor of $\\epsilon$ or a single un-squared factor of $X_j$ or $X'_j$ have an expectation of $0$, because $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[X]=\\mathbb{E}[X']=0$, and all variables are independent. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[(w_*^\\top X)\\epsilon]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon(w^\\top X')]=0$.\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[(w_*^\\top X)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sum_j w_{*j} X_j)^2] = \\sum_j w_{*j}^2 \\mathbb{E}[X_j^2] = \\sum_j w_{*j}^2 \\sigma_j^2 = w_*^\\top \\Sigma w_*$.\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[(w^\\top X')^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sum_j w_j X'_j)^2] = \\sum_j w_j^2 \\mathbb{E}[(X'_j)^2] = \\sum_j w_j^2 p \\sigma_j^2 = p(w^\\top \\Sigma w)$.\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[(w_*^\\top X)(w^\\top X')] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sum_j w_{*j} X_j)(\\sum_k w_k X'_k)] = \\sum_j w_{*j} w_j \\mathbb{E}[X_j X'_j] = \\sum_j w_{*j} w_j \\mathbb{E}[X_j D_j X_j] = \\sum_j w_{*j} w_j \\mathbb{E}[D_j]\\mathbb{E}[X_j^2] = \\sum_j w_{*j} w_j p \\sigma_j^2 = p(w_*^\\top \\Sigma w)$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the expected loss:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( w_*^\\top \\Sigma w_* + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 + p(w^\\top \\Sigma w) - 2p(w_*^\\top \\Sigma w) \\right)\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Variance of the Loss $\\operatorname{Var}(L)$\nWe use the Law of Total Variance: $\\operatorname{Var}(L) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(L|D)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[L|D])$.\nGiven the mask $D$, let $w_D = w \\odot D$. The loss is $L = \\frac{1}{2}Z^2$ where $Z = (w_* - w_D)^\\top X + \\epsilon$. $Z$ is a sum of independent normal variables, so it is normal with mean $\\mathbb{E}[Z]=0$ and variance $\\sigma_Z^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(Z) = (w_*-w_D)^\\top \\Sigma (w_*-w_D) + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\nThe conditional expectation of the loss is $\\mathbb{E}[L|D] = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[Z^2|D] = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_Z^2$.\nThe conditional variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(L|D) = \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{Var}(Z^2|D)$. Since $Z/\\sigma_Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $(Z/\\sigma_Z)^2 \\sim \\chi^2_1$, which has variance $2$. Thus $\\operatorname{Var}(Z^2) = \\sigma_Z^4 \\operatorname{Var}((Z/\\sigma_Z)^2) = 2\\sigma_Z^4$. So, $\\operatorname{Var}(L|D) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_Z^2)^2$.\n\nLet $S_D = (w_*-w_D)^\\top \\Sigma (w_*-w_D) = \\sum_j (w_{*j} - w_j D_j)^2 \\sigma_j^2$. Then $\\sigma_Z^2 = S_D + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\n1.  $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[L|D]) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\frac{1}{2}(S_D + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)) = \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D)$.\n    Since $D_j$ are independent, $\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) = \\sum_j \\operatorname{Var}((w_{*j} - w_j D_j)^2 \\sigma_j^2) = \\sum_j \\sigma_j^4 \\operatorname{Var}((w_j^2 - 2w_{*j}w_j)D_j + w_{*j}^2) = \\sum_j \\sigma_j^4 (w_j^2 - 2w_{*j}w_j)^2 p(1-p)$.\n2.  $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(L|D)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{1}{2}(S_D + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)^2] = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[S_D^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2 S_D + \\sigma_\\epsilon^4] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) + (\\mathbb{E}[S_D])^2 + 2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2 \\mathbb{E}[S_D] + \\sigma_\\epsilon^4) = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{E}[S_D]+\\sigma_\\epsilon^2)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) + 2(\\mathbb{E}[L])^2$.\n\nCombining the terms: $\\operatorname{Var}(L) = (\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) + 2(\\mathbb{E}[L])^2) + \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D) = 2(\\mathbb{E}[L])^2 + \\frac{3}{4}\\operatorname{Var}(S_D)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(L) = 2(\\mathbb{E}[L])^2 + \\frac{3p(1-p)}{4} \\sum_{j=1}^d \\sigma_j^4(w_j^2 - 2w_{*j}w_j)^2\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Expected Update Vector $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w]$\nThe update vector is $\\Delta w = \\eta(y - w^\\top X')X'$. We compute its expectation coordinate-wise.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w_k] = \\eta \\mathbb{E}[(w_*^\\top X + \\epsilon - w^\\top X') X'_k] = \\eta (\\mathbbE[(w_*^\\top X)X'_k] + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon X'_k] - \\mathbb{E}[(w^\\top X')X'_k])\n$$\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon X'_k] = \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]\\mathbb{E}[X'_k] = 0$.\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[(w_*^\\top X)X'_k] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sum_j w_{*j} X_j)(D_k X_k)] = \\sum_j w_{*j} \\mathbb{E}[X_j D_k X_k]$. Only the $j=k$ term is non-zero, yielding $w_{*k}\\mathbb{E}[D_k X_k^2] = w_{*k} \\mathbb{E}[D_k]\\mathbb{E}[X_k^2] = w_{*k} p \\sigma_k^2$.\n-   $\\mathbb{E}[(w^\\top X')X'_k] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sum_j w_j X'_j)X'_k] = \\sum_j w_j \\mathbb{E}[X'_j X'_k]$. Only the $j=k$ term is non-zero, yielding $w_k \\mathbb{E}[(X'_k)^2] = w_k p \\sigma_k^2$.\nCombining gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w_k] = \\eta (w_{*k}p\\sigma_k^2 - w_k p\\sigma_k^2) = \\eta p \\sigma_k^2 (w_{*k} - w_k)\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Per-coordinate Update Variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta w_k)$\nWe compute the variance as $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta w_k) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w_k])^2$. We need the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2]$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2] = \\eta^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (y - w^\\top X')^2 (X'_k)^2 \\right] = \\eta^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[ ((w_*^\\top X - (w\\odot D)^\\top X) + \\epsilon)^2 (D_k X_k)^2 \\right] $$\nSince $\\epsilon$ is zero-mean and independent of all other variables, the cross-term with $\\epsilon$ vanishes when taking the expectation. Using $D_k^2=D_k$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2] = \\eta^2 \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\left[ D_k ((w_*^\\top X - (w\\odot D)^\\top X)^2 X_k^2 \\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[ D_k \\epsilon^2 X_k^2 \\right] \\right) $$\nThe second term is $\\eta^2 \\mathbb{E}[D_k] \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon^2] \\mathbb{E}[X_k^2] = \\eta^2 p \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_k^2$.\nFor the first term, we use the law of total expectation, conditioning on $D$. Let $v_D = w_* - w\\odot D$. We need $\\mathbb{E}_D[D_k \\mathbb{E}_X[(v_D^\\top X)^2 X_k^2 | D]]$.\nThe inner expectation is a 4th moment of zero-mean Gaussian variables. Using properties of moments, this is $\\mathbb{E}_X[(v_D^\\top X)^2 X_k^2 | D] = \\sigma_k^2 \\sum_{j \\neq k} (v_D)_j^2 \\sigma_j^2 + 3((v_D)_k)^2 \\sigma_k^4$.\nWe then take the expectation over $D$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_D\\left[D_k \\left( \\sigma_k^2 \\sum_{j \\neq k} (v_D)_j^2 \\sigma_j^2 + 3((v_D)_k)^2 \\sigma_k^4 \\right)\\right] = p\\sigma_k^2 \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\mathbb{E}_D[(v_D)_j^2]\\sigma_j^2 + 3p(w_{*k}-w_k)^2\\sigma_k^4 $$\nwhere we used that $D_k(v_D)_k = D_k(w_{*k}-w_k)$ and that for $j \\neq k$, $\\mathbb{E}[D_k(v_D)_j^2] = \\mathbb{E}[D_k]\\mathbb{E}[(v_D)_j^2] = p\\mathbb{E}[(v_D)_j^2]$.\nSumming the parts of $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2]$ gives:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2] = \\eta^2 p \\left( \\sigma_k^2 \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\mathbb{E}_D[(v_D)_j^2]\\sigma_j^2 + 3(w_{*k}-w_k)^2\\sigma_k^4 + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2\\sigma_k^2 \\right) $$\nFinally, we subtract the squared mean, $(\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w_k])^2 = \\eta^2 p^2 (w_{*k}-w_k)^2\\sigma_k^4$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta w_k) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta w_k)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta w_k])^2 = \\eta^2 p \\left( \\sigma_k^2 \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\mathbb{E}_D[(v_D)_j^2]\\sigma_j^2 + (3-p)(w_{*k}-w_k)^2\\sigma_k^4 + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2\\sigma_k^2 \\right) $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}_D[(v_D)_j^2] = w_{*j}^2 - 2pw_{*j}w_j+pw_j^2$.
