This foundational practice challenges you to trace the behavior of six key scheduling algorithms—from the simple FCFS to the more complex C-LOOK—on a fixed set of requests. By calculating the total head movement and average response time for each, you will gain a quantitative feel for their relative efficiencies and the core trade-offs they embody. ",

            "problem": "A magnetic hard disk has cylinders indexed from $0$ to $199$. The disk head starts at cylinder $75$ at time $t=0$ with initial sweep direction toward increasing cylinder numbers. Eight read requests arrive simultaneously at $t=0$ with the following cylinder numbers, listed in the order they are presented to the operating system: $40$, $150$, $10$, $90$, $15$, $180$, $60$, $20$. Consider six disk scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, LOOK, Circular SCAN (C-SCAN), and Circular LOOK (C-LOOK). Assume that:\n- All requests arrive at $t=0$ (so response time equals completion time).\n- Seek time is modeled linearly as $t_{\\text{seek}}(d)=\\alpha+\\beta d$, where $d$ is the absolute cylinder distance moved, with $\\alpha=0.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\beta=0.01\\,\\mathrm{ms}/\\text{cylinder}$.\n- The average rotational latency is half a rotation. The disk rotates at $7200$ revolutions per minute, so the mean rotational latency is $T_{\\text{rot}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{60\\times 1000}{7200}\\,\\mathrm{ms}=\\frac{25}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Each request transfers a single sector with constant transfer time $T_{\\text{xfer}}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Therefore, the service time for a request that follows a head movement of distance $d$ is $t(d)=\\alpha+\\beta d+T_{\\text{rot}}+T_{\\text{xfer}}=\\frac{73}{15}+\\frac{d}{100}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- For SCAN and C-SCAN, the head continues to the physical end ($0$ or $199$) before reversing (SCAN) or wrapping (C-SCAN) if no request lies further in the current sweep direction; any such repositioning movement that does not immediately serve a request consumes time modeled purely as $\\beta d$ with no $\\alpha$, no rotation, and no transfer.\n- For LOOK and C-LOOK, the head reverses or wraps only at the last request in the current direction (no travel to the physical end), so there is no repositioning movement beyond the last requested cylinder.\n- Ties in SSTF are broken by choosing the lower-numbered cylinder; for SCAN and C-SCAN, the initial direction is toward increasing cylinder numbers; for LOOK and C-LOOK, the initial sweep is also toward increasing cylinder numbers.\n\nTasks:\n1. For each algorithm (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, LOOK, C-SCAN, C-LOOK), determine the exact service order given the starting position and rules above.\n2. For each algorithm, compute the total head movement in cylinders (include all movement, including any SCAN or C-SCAN repositioning).\n3. For each algorithm, compute the average response time (mean of the completion times of the eight requests) using the service time model $t(d)=\\frac{73}{15}+\\frac{d}{100}$ and including any repositioning time where applicable.\n4. Interpret the differences in total head movement and average response time among the algorithms in terms of locality and fairness.\n\nFinally, define the summary metric $R$ to be the ratio of the maximum total head movement to the minimum total head movement across these six algorithms. Compute $R$. Round your final value of $R$ to four significant figures. Report the final value of $R$ with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is a well-posed and self-contained exercise in analyzing disk scheduling algorithms, a standard topic in computer organization and operating systems. All necessary data, models, and constraints are provided and are scientifically and mathematically sound. Therefore, a complete solution can be derived.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Cylinder range: $[0, 199]$.\n- Initial head position: $C_{\\text{start}}=75$.\n- Initial time: $t=0$.\n- Initial direction of sweep: toward increasing cylinder numbers.\n- Request queue (simultaneous arrival at $t=0$): a set of $N=8$ requests for cylinders $\\{10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 90, 150, 180\\}$.\n- The order of arrival for FCFS is: $40, 150, 10, 90, 15, 180, 60, 20$.\n- The service time for a request following a head movement of distance $d$ is $t(d) = T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta d$, where the constant time component is $T_{\\text{const}} = \\alpha + T_{\\text{rot}} + T_{\\text{xfer}} = \\frac{73}{15}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and the seek time coefficient is $\\beta = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{ms}/\\text{cylinder} = \\frac{1}{100}\\,\\mathrm{ms}/\\text{cylinder}$.\n- The repositioning time for SCAN and C-SCAN is modeled as $t_{\\text{repo}}(d) = \\beta d = \\frac{d}{100}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nSince all requests arrive at $t=0$, the response time for a request is equal to its completion time. The average response time is the mean of the completion times for all $N=8$ requests. Let $S = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_8)$ be the service order of cylinders for a given algorithm. The head starts at $c_0=75$. The distance moved for the $i$-th request is $d_i = |c_i - c_{i-1}|$. The service time for the $i$-th request is $T_i$. The completion time for the $i$-th request is $C_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} T_j$.\n\nWe analyze each of the six algorithms.\n\n**1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**\nThe requests are serviced in the order they arrived.\n- Service Order: $40, 150, 10, 90, 15, 180, 60, 20$.\n- Movement Path: $75 \\to 40 \\to 150 \\to 10 \\to 90 \\to 15 \\to 180 \\to 60 \\to 20$.\n- Head Movements ($d_i$): $d_1=|40-75|=35$, $d_2=|150-40|=110$, $d_3=|10-150|=140$, $d_4=|90-10|=80$, $d_5=|15-90|=75$, $d_6=|180-15|=165$, $d_7=|60-180|=120$, $d_8=|20-60|=40$.\n- Total Head Movement: $\\sum d_i = 35+110+140+80+75+165+120+40 = 765$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time: The sum of completion times is $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} C_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (8-i+1) T_i$.\n  $T_i = \\frac{73}{15} + \\frac{d_i}{100}$.\n  $\\sum C_i = \\frac{73}{15}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}(8-i+1) + \\frac{1}{100}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}(8-i+1)d_i$. The first sum is $\\frac{8 \\times 9}{2} = 36$.\n  $\\sum(8-i+1)d_i = 8(35)+7(110)+6(140)+5(80)+4(75)+3(165)+2(120)+1(40) = 3365$.\n  $\\sum C_i = \\frac{73}{15}(36) + \\frac{3365}{100} = 175.2 + 33.65 = 208.85\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{208.85}{8} = 26.10625\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**2. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**\nThe request with the minimum seek distance from the current head position is selected next.\n- Head at $75$. Distances to $60$ and $90$ are both $15$. Tie-breaking rule selects the lower cylinder, $60$.\n- Path: $75 \\to 60 \\to 40 \\to 20 \\to 15 \\to 10 \\to 90 \\to 150 \\to 180$.\n- Service Order: $60, 40, 20, 15, 10, 90, 150, 180$.\n- Head Movements ($d_i$): $15, 20, 20, 5, 5, 80, 60, 30$.\n- Total Head Movement: $\\sum d_i = 15+20+20+5+5+80+60+30 = 235$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time:\n  $\\sum(8-i+1)d_i = 8(15)+7(20)+6(20)+5(5)+4(5)+3(80)+2(60)+1(30) = 815$.\n  $\\sum C_i = \\frac{73}{15}(36) + \\frac{815}{100} = 175.2 + 8.15 = 183.35\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{183.35}{8} = 22.91875\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**\nThe head sweeps back and forth across the disk.\n- Start at $75$, direction is increasing.\n- Service Order: $90, 150, 180$. Then moves to end $199$, reverses, and services $60, 40, 20, 15, 10$.\n- Total Movement Path: $75 \\to 199 \\to 10$.\n- Total Head Movement: $(199-75) + (199-10) = 124 + 189 = 313$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time:\n  The service order is $(90, 150, 180, 60, 40, 20, 15, 10)$.\n  The head movements between services are $(d_1=15, d_2=60, d_3=30)$. After servicing 180, the head moves $19$ cylinders to reach the end ($199$). This repositioning takes $t_{\\text{repo1}} = 19/100 = 0.19\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The next service is at cylinder $60$, which requires a movement of $d_4=199-60=139$. Subsequent movements are $d_5=20, d_6=20, d_7=5, d_8=5$.\n  The sum of completion times $\\sum C_i$ is the sum of weighted service times, plus the delay from the repositioning move for the last 5 requests:\n  $\\sum C_i = \\sum_{i=1}^8(8-i+1)T_i + 5 \\cdot t_{\\text{repo1}}$, where $T_i = T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta d_i$.\n  This simplifies to $36 T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta \\sum(8-i+1)d_i + 5 t_{\\text{repo1}}$.\n  The weighted sum of distances is: $8(15)+7(60)+6(30)+5(139)+4(20)+3(20)+2(5)+1(5) = 1570$.\n  $\\sum C_i = 175.2 + (1/100)(1570) + 5(0.19) = 175.2 + 15.70 + 0.95 = 191.85\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{191.85}{8} = 23.98125\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**4. LOOK**\nSimilar to SCAN, but the head reverses direction at the last request in the current direction.\n- Service Order: $90, 150, 180$. Reverses at $180$, then services $60, 40, 20, 15, 10$.\n- Total Movement Path: $75 \\to 180 \\to 10$.\n- Total Head Movement: $(180-75) + (180-10) = 105 + 170 = 275$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time: No repositioning time. The movements are $d = (15, 60, 30, 120, 20, 20, 5, 5)$.\n  Weighted sum of distances: $8(15)+7(60)+6(30)+5(120)+4(20)+3(20)+2(5)+1(5) = 1475$.\n  $\\sum C_i = 36 T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta(1475) = 175.2 + 14.75 = 189.95\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{189.95}{8} = 23.74375\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**5. Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)**\nThe head sweeps in one direction only. After reaching the end, it returns to the start and sweeps again.\n- Start at $75$, direction increasing.\n- Service Order: $90, 150, 180$. Move to end $199$, wrap to $0$, then service $10, 15, 20, 40, 60$.\n- Total Movement Path: $75 \\to 199$ (services), $199 \\to 0$ (reposition), $0 \\to 60$ (services).\n- Total Head Movement: $(199-75) + (199-0) + (60-0) = 124 + 199 + 60 = 383$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time:\n  Repositioning moves: $180 \\to 199$ ($d=19$) and $199 \\to 0$ ($d=199$). Total repositioning distance is $218$. Total repositioning time is $t_{\\text{repo}} = 218/100 = 2.18\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The last 5 requests are delayed by this time.\n  The movements are $d = (15, 60, 30, 10, 5, 5, 20, 20)$.\n  Weighted sum of distances: $8(15)+7(60)+6(30)+5(10)+4(5)+3(5)+2(20)+1(20) = 865$.\n  $\\sum C_i = 36 T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta(865) + 5 \\cdot t_{\\text{repo}} = 175.2 + 8.65 + 5(2.18) = 175.2 + 8.65 + 10.9 = 194.75\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{194.75}{8} = 24.34375\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**6. Circular LOOK (C-LOOK)**\nSimilar to C-SCAN, but the head wraps from the last request to the first request of the next cycle.\n- Service Order: $90, 150, 180$. Then wraps to $10$ and services $10, 15, 20, 40, 60$.\n- Head movements are all part of service seeks. Path: $75 \\to 90 \\to \\dots \\to 180 \\to 10 \\to \\dots \\to 60$.\n- Head Movements ($d_i$): $15, 60, 30, |10-180|=170, 5, 5, 20, 20$.\n- Total Head Movement: $15+60+30+170+5+5+20+20 = 325$ cylinders.\n- Average Response Time:\n  Weighted sum of distances: $8(15)+7(60)+6(30)+5(170)+4(5)+3(5)+2(20)+1(20) = 1665$.\n  $\\sum C_i = 36 T_{\\text{const}} + \\beta(1665) = 175.2 + 16.65 = 191.85\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n  Average Response Time = $\\frac{191.85}{8} = 23.98125\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\n| Algorithm | Total Head Movement | Avg. Response Time (ms) |\n|-----------|--------------------:|------------------------:|\n| FCFS      | $765$               | $26.10625$              |\n| SSTF      | $235$               | $22.91875$              |\n| SCAN      | $313$               | $23.98125$              |\n| LOOK      | $275$               | $23.74375$              |\n| C-SCAN    | $383$               | $24.34375$              |\n| C-LOOK    | $325$               | $23.98125$              |\n\n**Interpretation**\n- **Locality and Head Movement**: SSTF minimizes total head movement ($235$ cylinders) by exploiting spatial locality, always choosing the nearest request. FCFS performs the worst ($765$ cylinders) as it ignores locality entirely. The SCAN/LOOK variants fall in between. LOOK ($275$) and C-LOOK ($325$) outperform their SCAN ($313$) and C-SCAN ($383$) counterparts by avoiding unnecessary travel to the physical ends of the disk.\n- **Fairness and Response Time**: FCFS is definitionally fair in terms of preventing starvation but has the highest average response time due to its inefficiency. SSTF provides the lowest average response time, maximizing throughput, but can lead to starvation for distant requests (a fairness issue not apparent in this static batch). The SCAN/LOOK family offers a compromise. C-SCAN and C-LOOK generally provide more uniform wait times than SCAN and LOOK, as requests only ever wait for one sweep direction. In this specific case, LOOK provides the best response time among the sweep-based algorithms, and the average response times for SCAN and C-LOOK happen to be identical due to the specific combination of request locations and timings.\n\n**Final Metric Calculation**\nThe summary metric $R$ is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum total head movement.\n- Maximum total head movement, $H_{\\text{max}} = 765$ (from FCFS).\n- Minimum total head movement, $H_{\\text{min}} = 235$ (from SSTF).\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{H_{\\text{max}}}{H_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{765}{235} = \\frac{153}{47}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$R \\approx 3.25531914...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R = 3.255$.",

            "problem": "A disk has a one-dimensional cylinder address space, and all pending input/output requests arrive simultaneously at time zero. The disk head starts at cylinder $100$, and seek time is proportional to absolute cylinder distance. Ignore rotational latency and transfer time so that the only cost and waiting is due to seeks. Consider two scheduling policies: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and LOOK (the LOOK algorithm is a member of the elevator family; here it proceeds first in the initially given direction and only reverses when there are no more requests in that direction; its initial direction is set to be upward, toward larger cylinder numbers).

The waiting distance for a request is the total head movement from the start until that request is serviced. The variance of these waiting distances is the key metric for comparison.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Requests**: $\\{20, 98, 99, 160, 165, 170, 175, 178, 180\\}$\n- **Start Position**: $100$\n- **FCFS Policy**:\n  - Arrival order: $[99, 98, 20, 160, 165, 170, 175, 178, 180]$\n  - Head Path: $100 \\to 99 \\to 98 \\to 20 \\to 160 \\to 165 \\to \\dots \\to 180$\n  - Total Head Movement (THM): $|99-100| + |98-99| + |20-98| + |160-20| + |180-160| = 1+1+78+140+20 = 240$.\n  - Waiting Distances (WD):\n    - WD($99$) = $1$\n    - WD($98$) = $1+1 = 2$\n    - WD($20$) = $2+78 = 80$\n    - WD($160$) = $80+140 = 220$\n    - Subsequent WDs are $225, 230, 235, 238, 240$.\n  - The set of waiting distances is $\\{1, 2, 80, 220, 225, 230, 235, 238, 240\\}$. This set has a very wide spread, with small values and very large values, suggesting high variance.\n- **LOOK Policy**:\n  - Initial direction is upward. The path will be $100 \\to 160 \\to \\dots \\to 180$ (reverses) $\\to 99 \\to 98 \\to 20$.\n  - Total Head Movement (THM): $(180 - 100) + (180 - 20) = 80 + 160 = 240$.\n  - Waiting Distances (WD):\n    - WD($160$) = $160-100 = 60$\n    - WDs for other upward requests: $65, 70, 75, 78, 80$.\n    - WD($99$) = $(180-100) + (180-99) = 80+81 = 161$.\n    - WDs for other downward requests: $162, 240$.\n  - The set of waiting distances is $\\{60, 65, 70, 75, 78, 80, 161, 162, 240\\}$. These values are more clustered into two groups than the FCFS set, suggesting a lower variance.\n- **Conclusion**: For option A, THM is identical for both policies ($240$). The variance of waiting distances under FCFS is clearly higher due to the erratic service order, which services a few close requests then makes a long trip that penalizes all subsequent requests. The LOOK policy provides more uniform service. Thus, option A satisfies both conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options**\n- **Option B**: THM is $240$ for both. However, a detailed calculation shows that the variance of waiting distances is actually smaller for FCFS than for LOOK, so this option is incorrect.\n- **Option C**: THM for FCFS is $230$, while THM for LOOK is $190$. The THMs are not identical, so this option is incorrect.\n- **Option D**: The FCFS arrival order is identical to the service order generated by the LOOK algorithm. Therefore, THM, waiting distances, and variance will be identical for both policies. Since the variance is not strictly greater for FCFS, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Explanation of Order Effects**\nOption A demonstrates how identical total path lengths can yield different fairness outcomes. Both policies trace paths that span the range from cylinder $20$ to $180$, starting from $100$, resulting in a total movement of $240$ cylinders. However, FCFS's path is inefficiently ordered, creating a \"convoy\" where most requests must wait for the long $20 \\to 160$ seek. This leads to a wide disparity in waiting times (low for the first few, high for the rest), hence high variance. LOOK's path is systematic, servicing all requests in one direction before reversing. This creates a more predictable and equitable distribution of waiting times, resulting in a lower variance and a fairer, more responsive system, even with the same overall work (head movement).",

The disk head starts at cylinder $100$ at time $t=0$ moving toward increasing cylinder numbers. The head moves at constant speed $v=1$ cylinder per unit time. Ignore rotational latency and controller overhead; the cost to complete a sequence of I/O requests is measured as the total head movement, defined as the sum of absolute cylinder differences between consecutive serviced positions.

In SCAN, the head continues in its current direction to the physical end of the disk ($0$ or $199$) before reversing; in LOOK, the head reverses when it reaches the last pending request in the current direction, without going to the physical end unless needed.

Choose the option in which SCAN results in a strictly smaller total head movement than LOOK because the empty extreme tracks in the current direction later receive arrivals that SCAN picks up in the same outward sweep while LOOK has already reversed, thereby forcing a subsequent long traversal.\n\nA. Future arrivals: at time $t=70$, cylinders $\\{195, 198\\}$ arrive.\n\nB. Future arrivals: at time $t=20$, cylinders $\\{160, 165\\}$ arrive.\n\nC. Future arrivals: at time $t=110$, cylinders $\\{195, 198\\}$ arrive.\n\nD. Future arrivals: at time $t=70$, cylinders $\\{3, 5\\}$ arrive.\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question by selecting the correct option(s). Your reasoning must start from the above operational definitions and the physical model (constant-speed head, seek cost equals absolute cylinder travel). In your solution, explain why the selected option(s) satisfy the stated condition and why the others do not, and discuss the notion of anticipatory scheduling in this context along with its associated risks under uncertain future arrivals.",
            "solution": "To solve this problem, we must simulate the head's movement over time for both the SCAN and LOOK algorithms under the conditions specified in each option. The goal is to find a scenario where the total head movement for SCAN is strictly less than that for LOOK.\n\n**Initial State Analysis (applies to all options):**\n- At $t=0$, the head is at cylinder $100$, moving towards higher cylinder numbers. The initial request queue is $\\{10, 30, 120, 130, 150\\}$.\n- Both SCAN and LOOK will first service the requests in the current direction: $120, 130, 150$.\n- The head path is $100 \\to 120 \\to 130 \\to 150$.\n- The time taken is $(120-100) + (130-120) + (150-130) = 20 + 10 + 20 = 50$ time units.\n- At $t=50$, the head is at cylinder $150$. The initial outward requests are serviced. The pending queue is $\\{10, 30\\}$.\n\nThis is the critical point where the algorithms diverge:\n- **LOOK:** Having serviced the last request in its path ($150$), it reverses direction and starts moving toward cylinder $0$.\n- **SCAN:** By definition, it must continue to the physical end of the disk, cylinder $199$, before reversing.\n\nNow, we analyze each option with these behaviors in mind.\n\n**A. Future arrivals: at time $t=70$, cylinders $\\{195, 198\\}$ arrive.**\n- **SCAN:** At $t=50$, the head leaves $150$ toward $199$. At $t=70$, it is at cylinder $150 + (70-50) = 170$. The new requests at $\\{195, 198\\}$ are ahead of it. SCAN continues its outward sweep, services them, reaches the end at $199$, reverses, and services the remaining requests $\\{10, 30\\}$. The total path is one sweep from $100 \\to 199$ and one sweep from $199 \\to 10$.\n  - Total Head Movement (SCAN) = $(199 - 100) + (199 - 10) = 99 + 189 = 288$.\n- **LOOK:** At $t=50$, the head leaves $150$ toward $0$. At $t=70$, it is at cylinder $150 - (70-50) = 130$. The new requests at $\\{195, 198\\}$ are now in the queue. LOOK must first complete its current sweep (servicing $\\{10, 30\\}$), then reverse to service the new requests. The path is three sweeps: $100 \\to 150$, then $150 \\to 10$, then $10 \\to 198$.\n  - Total Head Movement (LOOK) = $(150 - 100) + (150 - 10) + (198 - 10) = 50 + 140 + 188 = 378$.\n- **Result:** SCAN ($288$)  LOOK ($378$). This option satisfies the condition. The scenario demonstrates the risk of LOOK's early reversal; SCAN's \"anticipatory\" sweep to the end paid off by catching the late arrivals efficiently.\n\n**B. Future arrivals: at time $t=20$, cylinders $\\{160, 165\\}$ arrive.**\n- At $t=20$, the head is at cylinder $120$. The new requests extend the outward sweep. The last request is now $165$.\n- **SCAN:** Path is $100 \\to 199 \\to 10$. Total Head Movement = $(199 - 100) + (199 - 10) = 288$.\n- **LOOK:** Reverses at the new last request, $165$. Path is $100 \\to 165 \\to 10$. Total Head Movement = $(165 - 100) + (165 - 10) = 65 + 155 = 220$.\n- **Result:** SCAN > LOOK. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C. Future arrivals: at time $t=110$, cylinders $\\{195, 198\\}$ arrive.**\n- By $t=110$, both algorithms have already reversed and are on their way back from their respective turnaround points.\n- **SCAN:** Reverses at $199$ (at $t=99$). At $t=110$, it's at cylinder $188$, moving toward $0$. The new requests are behind it, requiring a third sweep. Path: $100 \\to 199 \\to 0 \\to 198$. Total Movement = $(199-100) + (199-0) + (198-0) = 496$.\n- **LOOK:** Reverses at $150$ (at $t=50$). At $t=110$, it's at cylinder $90$, moving toward $0$. The new requests are behind it, requiring a third sweep. Path: $100 \\to 150 \\to 10 \\to 198$. Total Movement = $(150-100) + (150-10) + (198-10) = 378$.\n- **Result:** SCAN > LOOK. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D. Future arrivals: at time $t=70$, cylinders $\\{3, 5\\}$ arrive.**\n- The new requests are in the reverse direction. They do not affect the outward sweep.\n- **SCAN:** Path is $100 \\to 199 \\to 0$. Total Movement = $(199 - 100) + (199 - 0) = 298$.\n- **LOOK:** Path is $100 \\to 150 \\to 3$ (the new last request is now 3). Total Movement = $(150 - 100) + (150 - 3) = 50 + 147 = 197$.\n- **Result:** SCAN > LOOK. This option is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A results in SCAN having a smaller total head movement than LOOK. This is because SCAN's rigid sweep to the end of the disk can be viewed as a form of anticipatory scheduling; it \"bets\" that new requests may appear at the far end of the disk. In this case, the bet paid off. LOOK's more conservative strategy of reversing early is usually more efficient but left it poorly positioned to handle the late arrivals, forcing a costly extra traversal of the disk.",
