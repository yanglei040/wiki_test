This first exercise simulates such a scenario, treating defective regions as \"walls\" the disk head cannot cross directly. By tracing the paths of wall-aware versions of SCAN and LOOK, you will gain a concrete understanding of how their fundamental design choices—sweeping to the end versus reversing at the last request—result in significant performance differences when navigating physical constraints .",

            "problem": "A storage system exposes a disk with contiguous cylinders indexed from $0$ to $199$. The arm seek time is modeled as proportional to cylinder distance: if the head moves from cylinder $c_a$ to $c_b$, the seek cost is proportional to $\\lvert c_b - c_a \\rvert$. In addition, two ranges of cylinders are marked as media defect clusters: $[60,79]$ and $[140,149]$. A reliability policy treats each defect cluster as a wall that cannot be swept through seamlessly; crossing a wall requires a recalibration jump whose cost is modeled as an additional fixed penalty equivalent to $W$ cylinders of movement, with $W = 20$. Requests inside defective ranges are never queued, and requests outside may be served in any order consistent with the scheduling algorithm.\n\nYou must select a wall-aware scheduling policy and analyze its behavior. Consider two policies adapted to the presence of walls:\n\n- Wall-aware SCAN without backtracking (WB-SCAN): starting from the current head position and direction, the head sweeps monotonically, serving requests in order of increasing or decreasing cylinder. It continues the sweep to the nearest physical boundary in that direction (end of disk or the near side of a wall). When it reaches a wall, it pays the crossing penalty $W$ to jump to the far side boundary and continues the sweep in the same direction. It reverses only at physical boundaries (end of disk), not at the last request before a wall, even if no requests remain before the boundary in that direction.\n\n- Wall-aware LOOK (WB-LOOK): starting from the current head position and direction, the head sweeps monotonically but reverses immediately at the last outstanding request in the current direction before any boundary (wall or end of disk), avoiding travel to the boundary if it is not needed. It crosses a wall only when there is at least one outstanding request beyond that wall in the current sweep direction; crossing a wall incurs the penalty $W$ and requires moving to the near-side boundary before crossing.\n\nAssume the head is initially at cylinder $c_0 = 50$, moving in the increasing-cylinder direction. The pending request set is $R = \\{20, 30, 58, 85, 132, 155, 170, 190\\}$, all of which are outside the defective ranges. Rotational latency and transfer time are negligible compared to seek costs and wall-crossing penalties. The system’s objective is to minimize the total movement (seek distance plus wall-crossing penalties) required to service all pending requests exactly once.\n\nWhich option best specifies a principled selection criterion for treating defect clusters as walls and correctly analyzes how WB-LOOK navigates these walls compared to WB-SCAN without backtracking on the given instance, including the resulting total movement?\n\nA. Prefer WB-LOOK when request density is sparse near walls or when $W$ is large relative to typical inter-request distances, because reversing at the last request before a wall avoids unnecessary boundary travel and redundant wall crossings. For the given $c_0$, $R$, and walls, WB-LOOK reverses at cylinder $58$, serves $30$ and $20$, then crosses the first wall once going upward and the second wall once, never going to disk ends without demand. Its total movement is $224$, while WB-SCAN pays to sweep to boundaries and crosses both walls twice, also traveling to both disk ends, for a total movement of $364$.\n\nB. Prefer WB-SCAN without backtracking because it eliminates reversals that cause extra repositioning; with walls present, WB-SCAN reverses at the last request before a wall just like WB-LOOK, so both policies incur identical movement of $224$ on the given instance.\n\nC. Prefer WB-SCAN without backtracking when defect clusters exist, because continuous sweeping minimizes jump penalties and end effects; on the given instance, WB-SCAN has total movement $159$, which is strictly less than WB-LOOK’s $224$.\n\nD. Prefer WB-LOOK only when all requests lie on a single side of each wall; otherwise WB-LOOK must traverse to physical ends to reverse and will cross each wall twice like WB-SCAN, yielding the same total movement of $364$ on the given instance.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation process before any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Disk Geometry**: Cylinders are indexed from $0$ to $199$.\n- **Seek Cost Model**: The cost to move from cylinder $c_a$ to $c_b$ is proportional to the distance $\\lvert c_b - c_a \\rvert$. For simplicity, we can measure cost in units of cylinders moved.\n- **Defect Clusters (Walls)**: Two ranges are designated as walls: $[60, 79]$ and $[140, 149]$.\n- **Wall Crossing Penalty**: Crossing a wall incurs an additional fixed cost equivalent to $W = 20$ cylinders of movement. This is a \"recalibration jump\".\n- **Request Handling**: Requests are not queued for cylinders within the defective ranges.\n- **Initial State**: The disk head is at cylinder $c_0 = 50$, and its initial direction of motion is towards increasing cylinder numbers (up).\n- **Request Set**: The set of pending requests is $R = \\{20, 30, 58, 85, 132, 155, 170, 190\\}$.\n- **Algorithm Definitions**:\n    - **Wall-aware SCAN without backtracking (WB-SCAN)**: The head sweeps monotonically, serving requests in order. It continues to the nearest boundary (either a disk end, $0$ or $199$, or the near side of a wall) in its current direction, even if no requests are present in the path to that boundary. At a wall, it pays the penalty $W$ to jump from the near-side boundary to the far-side boundary and continues its sweep. Reversals occur only at the physical disk ends ($0$ and $199$).\n    - **Wall-aware LOOK (WB-LOOK)**: The head sweeps monotonically but reverses direction at the last outstanding request in its current direction before reaching any boundary (wall or disk end). It crosses a wall only if there is an outstanding request beyond it in the current sweep direction. To cross, it must first move to the near-side boundary of the wall and then pay the penalty $W$.\n- **Objective**: Minimize the total movement, defined as the sum of all seek distances and wall-crossing penalties.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a well-established exercise in operating systems, specifically disk scheduling algorithms. The introduction of \"walls\" is a custom constraint, but it is mathematically well-defined and serves as a plausible abstraction for handling defective regions or other physical discontinuities on a storage medium. The problem is scientifically grounded in computer science principles.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The algorithms are described deterministically. For a given initial state and request set, the sequence of head movements and the total cost are uniquely determined. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided data (initial position, request set, wall locations, penalty cost) are sufficient and consistent. The definitions of the algorithms, while dense, are self-contained. The definition of WB-LOOK, \"reverses immediately at the last outstanding request in the current direction before any boundary,\" is slightly ambiguous. It could mean either the last request *in a partition* before a wall, or the last request *on the entire disk* in a given direction. However, this ambiguity can be resolved by analyzing the provided options, which often clarify the intended interpretation in such problems. The structure of the question implies that a single, correct analysis is possible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The definitions and constraints are sufficient to derive a unique solution. We may proceed with the analysis.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nWe will analyze the total movement for both algorithms based on the provided definitions. For analysis, the disk is partitioned by the walls into three service regions: $S_1 = [0, 59]$, $S_2 = [80, 139]$, and $S_3 = [150, 199]$. The request set is partitioned accordingly: $R_1 = \\{20, 30, 58\\}$, $R_2 = \\{85, 132\\}$, and $R_3 = \\{155, 170, 190\\}$.\n\n#### Analysis of WB-SCAN\n\nThe WB-SCAN algorithm sweeps across the entire disk from one end to the other, reversing only at the physical boundaries.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: Head at $c_0 = 50$, moving towards $199$.\n2.  **Upward Sweep ($50 \\to 199$)**:\n    - Move from $50$ to serve request at $58$. Movement: $|58 - 50| = 8$.\n    - The algorithm must proceed to the boundary of Wall 1 ($[60, 79]$), which is cylinder $59$. Movement: $|59 - 58| = 1$.\n    - At $59$, cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. The head jumps to the far side, cylinder $80$.\n    - Continue sweep, serving requests at $85$ and $132$. Movement: $|132 - 80| = 52$.\n    - Proceed to the boundary of Wall 2 ($[140, 149]$), at cylinder $139$. Movement: $|139 - 132| = 7$.\n    - At $139$, cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. Head jumps to the far side, cylinder $150$.\n    - Continue sweep, serving requests at $155, 170, 190$. Movement: $|190 - 150| = 40$.\n    - Proceed to the physical disk end. Movement: $|199 - 190| = 9$.\n    - Total cost for upward sweep: $8 + 1 + 20 + 52 + 7 + 20 + 40 + 9 = 157$.\n3.  **Downward Sweep ($199 \\to 0$)**:\n    - The head reverses at $199$ and moves towards $0$.\n    - Proceed to the boundary of Wall 2 (near side is $150$). Movement: $|150 - 199| = 49$.\n    - Cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. Head jumps to $139$.\n    - Proceed to the boundary of Wall 1 (near side is $80$). Movement: $|80 - 139| = 59$.\n    - Cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. Head jumps to $59$.\n    - Continue sweep, serving requests at $30$ and $20$. Movement: $|20 - 59| = 39$.\n    - Proceed to the physical disk end. Movement: $|0 - 20| = 20$.\n    - Total cost for downward sweep: $49 + 20 + 59 + 20 + 39 + 20 = 207$.\n4.  **Total WB-SCAN Movement**:\n    $$ \\text{Total Cost} = 157 + 207 = 364 $$\n\n#### Analysis of WB-LOOK\n\nThe WB-LOOK algorithm reverses at the last request in a given direction, avoiding trips to boundaries where no requests are pending. The clause \"reverses immediately at the last outstanding request ... before any boundary\" suggests a specialized behavior. Reading this literally and in context with the options suggests that if there is a request that is the last one before a wall boundary, and there are pending requests in the opposite direction, the algorithm may reverse to service them first.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: Head at $c_0 = 50$, moving towards $199$.\n2.  **Initial Upward Move**:\n    - The first request is at $58$. This is the last outstanding request before the boundary of Wall 1. There are outstanding requests in the \"down\" direction ($\\{20, 30\\}$).\n    - The algorithm moves from $50$ to $58$. Movement: $|58 - 50| = 8$.\n    - At $58$, it serves the request and, per this interpretation, reverses direction.\n3.  **First Downward Sweep**:\n    - The head is at $58$, moving towards $0$.\n    - It serves requests at $30$ and $20$. Movement: $|30 - 58| + |20 - 30| = 28 + 10 = 38$.\n    - The request at $20$ is the last one in this direction. All other pending requests are in the \"up\" direction. The head reverses at $20$.\n4.  **Final Upward Sweep**:\n    - The head is at $20$, moving towards $199$.\n    - To service requests at $85, 132, \\dots$, it must cross Wall 1. It moves to the near-side boundary, $59$. Movement: $|59 - 20| = 39$.\n    - Cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. Head jumps to $80$.\n    - Sweep up, serving $85$ and $132$. Movement: $|132 - 80| = 52$.\n    - At $132$, it's the last request before Wall 2. However, there are no pending requests in the \"down\" direction, so there is no reason to reverse. It must continue its sweep.\n    - To cross Wall 2, it moves to the near-side boundary, $139$. Movement: $|139 - 132| = 7$.\n    - Cross the wall. Cost: $W = 20$. Head jumps to $150$.\n    - Continue sweep, serving $155, 170, 190$. Movement: $|190 - 150| = 40$.\n    - The request at $190$ is the last overall. The algorithm terminates.\n5.  **Total WB-LOOK Movement**:\n    $$ \\text{Total Cost} = \\underbrace{8}_{\\text{_50→58_}} + \\underbrace{38}_{\\text{_58→20_}} + \\underbrace{39}_{\\text{_20→59_}} + \\underbrace{20}_{\\text{_W_}} + \\underbrace{52}_{\\text{_80→132_}} + \\underbrace{7}_{\\text{_132→139_}} + \\underbrace{20}_{\\text{_W_}} + \\underbrace{40}_{\\text{_150→190_}} = 224 $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prefer WB-LOOK when request density is sparse near walls or when $W$ is large relative to typical inter-request distances, because reversing at the last request before a wall avoids unnecessary boundary travel and redundant wall crossings. For the given $c_0$, $R$, and walls, WB-LOOK reverses at cylinder $58$, serves $30$ and $20$, then crosses the first wall once going upward and the second wall once, never going to disk ends without demand. Its total movement is $224$, while WB-SCAN pays to sweep to boundaries and crosses both walls twice, also traveling to both disk ends, for a total movement of $364$.**\n- The selection criterion is sound. LOOK-based algorithms excel by avoiding unnecessary travel to boundaries, a benefit amplified by the high cost ($W$) of crossing walls.\n- The description of WB-LOOK's path ($50 \\to 58 \\to \\text{reverse} \\to \\dots$) matches our derived path based on the most plausible interpretation of the algorithm's definition.\n- The calculated movement for WB-LOOK ($224$) is correct.\n- The calculated movement for WB-SCAN ($364$) is correct, and the description of its behavior (sweeping to ends, crossing walls twice) is accurate. It crosses both walls on the way up and on the way down.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Prefer WB-SCAN without backtracking because it eliminates reversals that cause extra repositioning; with walls present, WB-SCAN reverses at the last request before a wall just like WB-LOOK, so both policies incur identical movement of $224$ on the given instance.**\n- The claim that WB-SCAN reverses at the last request before a wall is in direct contradiction to its definition, which states it reverses \"only at physical boundaries (end of disk)\".\n- Consequently, the claim that both policies incur identical movement is false. Our calculation shows WB-SCAN's movement is $364$, not $224$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prefer WB-SCAN without backtracking when defect clusters exist, because continuous sweeping minimizes jump penalties and end effects; on the given instance, WB-SCAN has total movement $159$, which is strictly less than WB-LOOK’s $224$.**\n- The reasoning is flawed. Continuous sweeping to the ends (the \"end effect\") is a known disadvantage of SCAN, not a benefit. In this instance, WB-SCAN incurs four wall crossings with penalty $W$ each, while WB-LOOK incurs only two. Thus, WB-SCAN does not minimize jump penalties here.\n- The stated total movement for WB-SCAN ($159$) is incorrect. Our derived value is $364$. The value $159$ is close to the cost of only the first upward sweep of WB-SCAN ($157$), but this ignores the entire return sweep needed to service all requests.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Prefer WB-LOOK only when all requests lie on a single side of each wall; otherwise WB-LOOK must traverse to physical ends to reverse and will cross each wall twice like WB-SCAN, yielding the same total movement of $364$ on the given instance.**\n- The premise for preferring WB-LOOK is overly restrictive and generally untrue.\n- The claim that WB-LOOK must traverse to physical ends is a fundamental misunderstanding of LOOK algorithms, which are defined by their avoidance of physical ends.\n- The claim that it crosses each wall twice is false for this instance; our analysis shows it crosses each wall only once.\n- The claim that its total movement is $364$ is false; this is the movement for WB-SCAN, not WB-LOOK ($224$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "A simple analysis of disk scheduling often focuses exclusively on minimizing seek time, as it's typically the largest component of service time. But is it the only factor that matters? This practice challenges you to dig deeper by incorporating rotational latency into the performance model. You will investigate a fascinating, albeit hypothetical, scenario to determine if the seemingly inefficient end-to-end sweep of SCAN could ever redeem itself by creating a favorable rotational alignment, allowing it to outperform the more direct path of LOOK .",
            "id": "3681127",
            "problem": "A magnetic disk has $M$ equally spaced sectors per track, rotates with period $T$ (time for one full revolution), and the head’s movement between adjacent cylinders is modeled as taking a constant time $\\alpha$ per cylinder. The platter rotation is uniform, so the angular phase of the sector under the head at time $t$ is $\\theta(t) = 2\\pi t / T \\pmod{2\\pi}$. A request is defined by a pair $(c, s)$ where $c$ is the cylinder index and $s$ is the sector index, with sector angle $\\theta_{r}(s) = 2\\pi s / M$. The controller can begin servicing a request as soon as the head is positioned on the correct cylinder and the requested sector passes under the head. Rotational latency for a request is the minimal positive time until $\\theta(t)$ equals $\\theta_{r}(s)$ after the head arrives at the target cylinder. Assume transfer time is negligible compared to seek and rotational latency.\n\nTwo disk-scheduling algorithms are considered:\n\n- SCAN: The head moves monotonically in one direction (increasing cylinder index here), servicing requests whose cylinders it encounters. It continues to the last cylinder at the end of the disk before reversing direction.\n- LOOK: The head also moves monotonically in one direction, but reverses direction as soon as there are no more requests in the current direction (it does not go to the physical end if there are no requests beyond).\n\nConsider the following specific trace and parameters, chosen to be scientifically plausible:\n\n- Number of sectors per track $M = 100$, rotation period $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ (so angular speed $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$).\n- Per-cylinder seek time $\\alpha = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Head starts at cylinder $c_0 = 100$ with initial phase $\\theta(0) = 0$ and direction increasing cylinder index.\n- Requests (all released at time $t=0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$):\n  1. $(c,s) = (120, 20)$,\n  2. $(150, 50)$,\n  3. $(80, 18)$,\n  4. $(30, 68)$.\n- There are no other requests beyond the highest listed cylinder.\n\nUnder the stated model, answer the following question based on first principles. You may use the facts that seek time between cylinders $c_a$ and $c_b$ is $|c_a - c_b| \\alpha$, the rotation advances by $2\\pi \\alpha / T$ per cylinder moved, and rotational latency for a sector at angle $\\theta_{r}(s)$ upon arrival at clock time $t_a$ is the minimal positive time $\\Delta t$ such that $\\theta(t_a + \\Delta t) = \\theta_{r}(s)$.\n\nWhich statement correctly characterizes when SCAN can be preferable to LOOK purely due to rotational-angle alignment under this standard model (no track skew and no sector remapping across cylinders), and what the constructed trace demonstrates?\n\nA. SCAN is preferable exactly when the extra sweep-to-end time $d_{\\mathrm{end}}$ satisfies $d_{\\mathrm{end}} \\bmod T <$ the rotational latency that LOOK would experience at the first request after reversal; the trace demonstrates SCAN strictly beating LOOK.\n\nB. Under this standard model, SCAN cannot be strictly preferable to LOOK purely due to rotational-angle alignment; at best, SCAN ties LOOK when $d_{\\mathrm{end}} < T$, because the rotational latency difference at the first reversed request equals $d_{\\mathrm{end}} \\bmod T$. The trace demonstrates such a tie via alignment.\n\nC. SCAN is preferable whenever $\\alpha < T/M$ because smaller per-cylinder seek time always aligns phases; the trace demonstrates SCAN’s strict advantage.\n\nD. SCAN becomes preferable only when there are many requests beyond the current direction regardless of rotational alignment; the trace demonstrates this effect.",
            "solution": "The user wants a detailed analysis of the SCAN and LOOK disk-scheduling algorithms, based on a specific model and data trace, to determine the conditions under which SCAN might be preferable to LOOK.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   Number of sectors per track, $M = 100$.\n-   Rotation period, $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Per-cylinder seek time, $\\alpha = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Initial head position, $c_0 = 100$.\n-   Initial time, $t_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Initial disk phase, $\\theta(0) = 0$.\n-   Initial head direction: increasing cylinder index.\n-   Requests (all released at $t=0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$):\n    1.

The parameters ($M$, $T$, $\\alpha$) are scientifically plausible. The definitions of SCAN and LOOK are standard. The core of the problem is to analyze the performance difference stemming from rotational latency effects.\n\nThere is one ambiguity: the maximum cylinder number, $C_{max}$, which is required to calculate the exact path of the SCAN algorithm, is not provided. The problem states SCAN \"continues to the last cylinder at the end of the disk\". However, the question asks for a general characterization of *when* SCAN *can* be preferable and what the *constructed trace demonstrates*. This suggests that the problem is conceptual. We can investigate if a plausible value for $C_{max}$ exists that allows the trace to demonstrate a key principle. If such a value can be found and it leads to a consistent result that matches one of the options, the problem can be considered well-posed in its context. The problem does not require a single numerical answer independent of assumptions, but rather an understanding of the interplay between seek time and rotational latency. Based on this interpretation, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nWe will first derive the general relationship between the performance of SCAN and LOOK and then apply it to the specific trace. The total time to service a batch of requests is the sum of all seek times and rotational latencies.\n\n**General Analysis: SCAN vs. LOOK**\n\nLet's consider the point where the two algorithms diverge. Both SCAN and LOOK will service requests in the initial direction (increasing cylinder index) in the same order. For the given trace, both service R1 ($c=120$) and then R2 ($c=150$). Let $t_{dep, last}$ be the time when the head finishes servicing the last request in the forward sweep (R2 at $c=150$).\n\nAfter this point, LOOK reverses direction and seeks to the next request in the reverse direction, R3 at $c=80$.\nSCAN continues to the physical end of the disk, $C_{max}$, reverses, and then seeks to R3 at $c=80$.\n\nLet $c_{last} = 150$ and $c_{rev} = 80$.\nThe seek time for LOOK to reach R3 is $t_{seek,L} = |c_{last} - c_{rev}|\\alpha = |150 - 80|\\alpha = 70\\alpha$.\nThe arrival time for LOOK at $c=80$ is $t_{arr,L} = t_{dep,last} + 70\\alpha$.\n\nThe seek time for SCAN to reach R3 is the time to travel $150 \\to C_{max} \\to 80$.\n$t_{seek,S} = ((C_{max} - c_{last}) + (C_{max} - c_{rev}))\\alpha = ((C_{max} - 150) + (C_{max} - 80))\\alpha$.\nWe can express this in terms of LOOK's seek time and the extra travel distance for SCAN.\nThe extra travel for SCAN is from $c_{last} \\to C_{max} \\to c_{last}$. The time for this is $d_{\\text{end}} = 2(C_{max} - c_{last})\\alpha = 2(C_{max} - 150)\\alpha$.\n$t_{seek,S} = |c_{last} - c_{rev}|\\alpha + 2(C_{max} - c_{last})\\alpha = t_{seek,L} + d_{\\text{end}}$.\nThe arrival time for SCAN at $c=80$ is $t_{arr,S} = t_{dep,last} + t_{seek,S} = t_{dep,last} + t_{seek,L} + d_{\\text{end}} = t_{arr,L} + d_{\\text{end}}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the rotational latency. The rotational latency, $L$, for a request at angle $\\theta_r$ arriving at time $t_{arr}$ is given by:\n$L = \\frac{T}{2\\pi} \\left( \\theta_r - \\theta(t_{arr}) \\right) \\pmod{2\\pi}$, where the result of the modulo operation on angles is in $[0, 2\\pi)$. This can be written as $L = (T \\frac{\\theta_r}{2\\pi} - t_{arr}) \\pmod T$, with the result in $[0,T)$.\n\nLet $L_L$ be the rotational latency for LOOK at $c_{rev}$, and $L_S$ be for SCAN.\n$L_L = (T \\frac{\\theta_r}{2\\pi} - t_{arr,L}) \\pmod T$.\n$L_S = (T \\frac{\\theta_r}{2\\pi} - t_{arr,S}) \\pmod T = (T \\frac{\\theta_r}{2\\pi} - (t_{arr,L} + d_{\\text{end}})) \\pmod T$.\n$L_S = ((T \\frac{\\theta_r}{2\\pi} - t_{arr,L}) - d_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T = (L_L - d_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T$.\nLet $d'_{\\text{end}} = d_{\\text{end}} \\pmod T$. Then $L_S = (L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T$.\n\nThe total time spent from departure at $c_{last}$ to service completion at $c_{rev}$ is:\n$\\Delta t_L = t_{seek,L} + L_L$.\n$\\Delta t_S = t_{seek,S} + L_S = (t_{seek,L} + d_{\\text{end}}) + (L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T$.\n\nSCAN is preferable to LOOK if $\\Delta t_S < \\Delta t_L$.\n$t_{seek,L} + d_{\\text{end}} + (L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T < t_{seek,L} + L_L$.\n$d_{\\text{end}} + (L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T < L_L$.\n\nWe analyze two cases:\n1.  $L_L \\ge d'_{\\text{end}}$: The term $(L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T$ becomes $L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}$.\n    The inequality is $d_{\\text{end}} + L_L - d'_{\\text{end}} < L_L \\implies d_{\\text{end}} < d'_{\\text{end}}$. This is impossible for $d_{\\text{end}} > 0$, since $d'_{\\text{end}} \\le d_{\\text{end}}$. If $d_{\\text{end}} = 0$, the algorithms are identical. A tie is possible if $d_{\\text{end}} = d'_{\\text{end}}$ (i.e., $d_{\\text{end}} < T$), in which case the inequality becomes $d_{\\text{end}} < d_{\\text{end}}$, which is false. Equality $\\Delta t_S = \\Delta t_L$ holds if $d_{\\text{end}} = d'_{\\text{end}}$, meaning $d_{\\text{end}} < T$.\n2.  $L_L < d'_{\\text{end}}$: The term $(L_L - d'_{\\text{end}}) \\pmod T$ becomes $L_L - d'_{\\text{end}} + T$.\n    The inequality is $d_{\\text{end}} + L_L - d'_{\\text{end}} + T < L_L \\implies d_{\\text{end}} - d'_{\\text{end}} + T < 0$.\n    Since $d_{\\text{end}} \\ge d'_{\\text{end}}$ and $T > 0$, this is impossible.\n\nThis confirms that SCAN can never be strictly preferable to LOOK ($\\Delta t_S \\nless \\Delta t_L$). The best SCAN can do is tie LOOK. A tie ($\\Delta t_S = \\Delta t_L$) occurs if and only if $d_{\\text{end}} < T$ and $L_L \\ge d_{\\text{end}}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Specific Trace**\n\nLet's calculate the state up to the divergence point.\n1.  **Service R1 (120, 20):**\n    -   Seek from $c=100$ to $c=120$. $\\Delta c = 20$. $t_{seek1} = 20 \\alpha = 20 \\times 0.10\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    -   Arrival time at $c=120$: $t_{A1} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    -   Disk angle at arrival: $\\theta(t_{A1}) = 2\\pi \\frac{t_{A1}}{T} = 2\\pi \\frac{2}{10} = 0.4\\pi$.\n    -   Request R1 target angle: $\\theta_{r1} = 2\\pi \\frac{s}{M} = 2\\pi \\frac{20}{100} = 0.4\\pi$.\n    -   Since $\\theta(t_{A1}) = \\theta_{r1}$, rotational latency $L_1 = 0$.\n    -   Service completion time for R1: $t_{S1} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n2.  **Service R2 (150, 50):**\n    -   Seek from $c=120$ to $c=150$. $\\Delta c = 30$. $t_{seek2} = 30 \\alpha = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    -   Arrival time at $c=150$: $t_{A2} = t_{S1} + t_{seek2} = 2 + 3 = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    -   Disk angle at arrival: $\\theta(t_{A2}) = 2\\pi \\frac{5}{10} = \\pi$.\n    -   Request R2 target angle: $\\theta_{r2} = 2\\pi \\frac{50}{100} = \\pi$.\n    -   Again, perfect alignment. Rotational latency $L_2 = 0$.\n    -   Service completion time for R2: $t_{S2} = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This is $t_{dep,last}$.\n\nNow, the algorithms diverge.\n**LOOK Path for R3 (80, 18):**\n-   Seek from $c=150$ to $c=80$. $\\Delta c = 70$. $t_{seek3,L} = 70\\alpha = 7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Arrival time: $t_{A3,L} = t_{S2} + t_{seek3,L} = 5 + 7 = 12\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Disk angle at arrival: $\\theta(t_{A3,L}) = 2\\pi \\frac{12}{10} \\pmod{2\\pi} = 2\\pi(0.2) = 0.4\\pi$.\n-   Request R3 target angle: $\\theta_{r3} = 2\\pi \\frac{18}{100} = 0.36\\pi$.\n-   The disk has just passed the target sector. A near-full rotation is needed.\n-   Rotational latency $L_{L,R3} = (T \\frac{18}{100} - 12) \\pmod{10} = (1.8 - 12) \\pmod{10} = -10.2 \\pmod{10} = 9.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Service completion time for R3 (LOOK): $t_{S3,L} = t_{A3,L} + L_{L,R3} = 12 + 9.8 = 21.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**SCAN Path for R3 (80, 18):**\n-   The problem trace is constructed to demonstrate a principle. Let's see if we can find a plausible $C_{max}$ that results in a tie.\n-   For a tie, we need $d_{\\text{end}} < T$ and $L_{L,R3} \\ge d_{\\text{end}}$. We have $T=10$ and $L_{L,R3}=9.8$. So we need $d_{\\text{end}} \\le 9.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   $d_{\\text{end}} = 2(C_{max} - 150)\\alpha$. Let's choose $d_{\\text{end}} = 9.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   $9.8 = 2(C_{max} - 150)(0.1) \\implies 49 = C_{max} - 150 \\implies C_{max} = 199$. This is a perfectly reasonable maximum cylinder number for a disk.\n-   With $C_{max}=199$, we have $d_{\\text{end}} = 9.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Seek time for SCAN: $t_{seek3,S} = t_{seek3,L} + d_{\\text{end}} = 7 + 9.8 = 16.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Arrival time: $t_{A3,S} = t_{S2} + t_{seek3,S} = 5 + 16.8 = 21.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   Disk angle at arrival: $\\theta(t_{A3,S}) = 2\\pi \\frac{21.8}{10} \\pmod{2\\pi} = 2\\pi(0.18) = 0.36\\pi$.\n-   This is exactly the target angle $\\theta_{r3}$ for R3.\n-   Rotational latency $L_{S,R3} = 0$.\n-   Service completion time for R3 (SCAN): $t_{S3,S} = t_{A3,S} + L_{S,R3} = 21.8 + 0 = 21.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe service completion times are identical: $t_{S3,S} = t_{S3,L} = 21.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The trace demonstrates a tie. The near-full rotation of latency ($9.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) that LOOK experiences is perfectly converted by SCAN into productive seek time to visit the end of the disk and return, arriving at the target cylinder just in time. Since the departure times from R3 are the same, the times for all subsequent requests (R4) will also be identical for both algorithms.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. SCAN is preferable exactly when the extra sweep-to-end time $d_{\\mathrm{end}}$ satisfies $d_{\\mathrm{end}} \\bmod T <$ the rotational latency that LOOK would experience at the first request after reversal; the trace demonstrates SCAN strictly beating LOOK.**\n-   Our derivation proved SCAN can never be strictly preferable. This statement is incorrect.\n-   The trace demonstrates a tie, not SCAN \"strictly beating\" LOOK. This statement is incorrect.\n-   The condition $d'_{\\text{end}} < L_L$ (along with $L_L < d'_{end}$), leads to SCAN being strictly worse. This statement is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Under this standard model, SCAN cannot be strictly preferable to LOOK purely due to rotational-angle alignment; at best, SCAN ties LOOK when $d_{\\mathrm{end}} < T$, because the rotational latency difference at the first reversed request equals $d_{\\mathrm{end}} \\bmod T$. The trace demonstrates such a tie via alignment.**\n-   \"SCAN cannot be strictly preferable to LOOK\": Correct, as derived.\n-   \"at best, SCAN ties LOOK when $d_{\\mathrm{end}} < T$\": Correct. A tie happens if $d_{\\text{end}} < T$ and $L_L \\ge d_{\\text{end}}$. So $d_{\\text{end}} < T$ is a necessary condition for a tie.\n-   \"because the rotational latency difference ... equals $d_{\\mathrm{end}} \\bmod T$\": In the tie case ($d_{\\text{end}} < T, L_L \\ge d_{\\text{end}}$), we have $L_S = L_L - d_{\\text{end}}$. The difference $|L_S - L_L|$ is $d_{\\text{end}}$, which equals $d_{\\text{end}} \\bmod T$ since $d_{\\text{end}} < T$. This reasoning correctly describes the mechanics of the tie.\n-   \"The trace demonstrates such a tie via alignment\": Correct, as shown by our calculation with a plausible $C_{max}=199$.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. SCAN is preferable whenever $\\alpha < T/M$ because smaller per-cylinder seek time always aligns phases; the trace demonstrates SCAN’s strict advantage.**\n-   The condition $\\alpha < T/M$ is $0.10 < 10/100$, which is $0.10 < 0.10$. This premise is false.\n-   The claim \"always aligns phases\" is an unsupported generalization.\n-   The trace does not show a \"strict advantage\".\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. SCAN becomes preferable only when there are many requests beyond the current direction regardless of rotational alignment; the trace demonstrates this effect.**\n-   This misrepresents the role of SCAN. SCAN's travel to the end of the disk is a liability that LOOK avoids. More requests *in the current direction but not at the end* would favor LOOK.\n-   The problem is explicitly about rotational alignment, which this option dismisses.\n-   The trace has no requests beyond $c=150$, so it cannot demonstrate this effect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

Consider two elevator-style disk-scheduling algorithms: Circular SCAN (CSCAN) and Circular LOOK (CLOOK). Requests within an active service epoch are assumed to be uniformly and independently distributed across a contiguous span of $D$ cylinders in a single zone, and the scheduler sees $N \\geq 2$ pending requests per cycle. Define a cycle as the period in which all $N$ requests are serviced exactly once before the next wrap or jump.\n\nModel the expected per-request cost for an algorithm $A \\in \\{\\text{CSCAN}, \\text{CLOOK}\\}$ as\n$$\nC_A \\;=\\; \\alpha \\cdot s_A \\;+\\; \\beta \\cdot r_A \\;+\\; \\gamma \\cdot w_A,\n$$\nwhere $s_A$ is the expected seek distance per request (in cylinders), $r_A$ is the expected rotational-latency contribution per request (in units of time), and $w_A$ is the expected queue waiting-time contribution per request (in units of time). Assume the following widely observed behaviors for elevator scans on uniformly random requests:\n\n- Linearity of movement costs across a cycle: the total per-cycle movement distance is proportional to the sum of inter-request scan gaps plus the wrap or jump between the last and first serviced cylinder.\n- For CSCAN, the head traverses the entire span forward and then wraps the full span, so the total distance per cycle is $2D$ cylinders.\n- For CLOOK, the head traverses only the span between the minimum and maximum requested cylinders and then jumps back across that span, so the total distance per cycle is $2L$ cylinders, where $L$ is the random span between the minimum and maximum of $N$ independent uniform draws on $[0,D]$.\n- The expected span satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[L] \\;=\\; D \\cdot \\frac{N-1}{N+1}$, by properties of order statistics of independent uniform samples.\n- ZBR induces an effective per-cylinder rotational skew penalty that is approximately linear in seek distance over the range of interest.
