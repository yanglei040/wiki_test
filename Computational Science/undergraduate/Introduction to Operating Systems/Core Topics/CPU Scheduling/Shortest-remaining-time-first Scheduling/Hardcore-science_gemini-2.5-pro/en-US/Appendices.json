This practice  challenges you to perform a detailed, step-by-step simulation of Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) scheduling, considering both new process arrivals and I/O blocking. By calculating key metrics like average waiting and turnaround times and comparing them against First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR), you will build a foundational understanding of SRTF's mechanics and its performance characteristics.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-processor system with zero context-switch overhead and a single ready queue. Three classical scheduling policies are to be applied to the same workload: Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF), First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), and Round Robin (RR). For Round Robin, use a fixed time quantum $q=2$ milliseconds. All processes are sequential; each process alternates between Central Processing Unit (CPU) bursts and Input/Output (I/O) events as specified, blocking during I/O. The I/O device is independent of the CPU and services processes concurrently; an I/O event duration is the time a process remains blocked before its next CPU burst becomes available.\n\nWorkload trace (all times in milliseconds):\n- Process $P_1$: arrival at $t=0$; CPU burst $3$, I/O duration $4$, CPU burst $5$.\n- Process $P_2$: arrival at $t=1$; CPU burst $6$, I/O duration $3$, CPU burst $2$.\n- Process $P_3$: arrival at $t=2$; CPU burst $4$.\n- Process $P_4$: arrival at $t=7$; CPU burst $3$, I/O duration $2$, CPU burst $4$.\n\nScheduling semantics:\n- Under SRTF, at any decision point the scheduler selects the ready process with the least remaining time in its current CPU burst; preemption occurs immediately if a newly ready process has a strictly smaller remaining time than the currently running process. Ties in remaining time are broken by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n- Under FCFS, the ready queue is strictly First-In-First-Out; when a process blocks for I/O or completes, the next process at the head of the ready queue is scheduled. When multiple processes become ready at the same time, they are enqueued by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n- Under RR, the ready queue is First-In-First-Out and a running process is preempted after $q=2$ milliseconds if its CPU burst has not completed; upon preemption it is enqueued at the tail. If a CPU burst completes before the quantum expires, the process immediately blocks for I/O or terminates (as appropriate), and the next ready process is scheduled. When multiple processes become ready at the same time, they are enqueued by increasing process identifier $P_i$.\n\nSimultaneous-event order at a time instant $t$ is: CPU burst completions, then time-slice expirations, then I/O completions, then new arrivals; after applying these transitions, the scheduler selects the next process to run according to the policy.\n\nDefinitions to use:\n- For a process $P$, the response time is $T_{\\text{resp}}(P)=T_{\\text{first\\_CPU\\_start}}(P)-T_{\\text{arrival}}(P)$.\n- The turnaround time is $T_{\\text{turn}}(P)=T_{\\text{completion}}(P)-T_{\\text{arrival}}(P)$.\n- The total waiting time in the ready queue is $T_{\\text{wait}}(P)=T_{\\text{turn}}(P)-T_{\\text{cpu}}(P)-T_{\\text{io}}(P)$, where $T_{\\text{cpu}}(P)$ is the sum of all CPU burst durations for $P$, and $T_{\\text{io}}(P)$ is the sum of all I/O durations for $P$.\n\nTask:\n- For SRTF, derive the full schedule from first principles and compute the average waiting time, average response time, and average turnaround time over the set $\\{P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4\\}$.\n- Compute the same three averages for FCFS and RR (with $q=2$ milliseconds).\n- Express all intermediate times and the final averages in milliseconds. No rounding is required; provide exact values.\n- As your final answer, provide the nine averages in a single row matrix in the following order: SRTF-average-wait, SRTF-average-response, SRTF-average-turnaround, FCFS-average-wait, FCFS-average-response, FCFS-average-turnaround, RR-average-wait, RR-average-response, RR-average-turnaround.

Under SRTF, at an arrival instant, the processor would switch to the job with the strictly smallest remaining processing time. To reduce context-switch overhead, the scheduler is modified by a policy: “do not preempt if the running job’s remaining time $r$ is less than a threshold $r_{\\min}$.” Concretely, upon a new arrival with processing requirement $s_{\\text{new}}$, a preemption occurs only if both $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ and $r \\ge r_{\\min}$; otherwise the currently running job continues. Ties in remaining time are broken without preemption (that is, if $s_{\\text{new}} = r$, the current job continues). When a job completes at the exact instant another job arrives, treat the completion as occurring first; the next-job selection at that instant is not counted as a preemption. Context-switch time is negligible and does not extend any job’s processing time. The processor is never idle while jobs are waiting.\n\nThere are $4$ jobs with arrival times $A_i$ and processing requirements $S_i$ (all measured in identical abstract time quanta):\n- Job $J_1$: $A_1 = 0$, $S_1 = 10$.\n- Job $J_2$: $A_2 = 4$, $S_2 = 1$.\n- Job $J_3$: $A_3 = 9$, $S_3 = 1$.\n- Job $J_4$: $A_4 = 10$, $S_4 = 2$.\n\nDefine the response time (turnaround time) of job $i$ as $T_i = C_i - A_i$, where $C_i$ is the completion time of job $i$.

A preemption decision is made when a new job arrives while another job is running. Let the running job have remaining time $r$ and the new job have processing requirement $s_{\\text{new}}$. Preemption occurs if and only if $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ and $r \\ge r_{\\min}$.\n\nWe must analyze the schedule for different values of $r_{\\min}$. The schedule can only change for values of $r_{\\min}$ that alter the outcome of a preemption decision. Let's trace the execution and identify these decision points. The jobs are $J_1(A_1=0, S_1=10)$, $J_2(A_2=4, S_2=1)$, $J_3(A_3=9, S_3=1)$, and $J_4(A_4=10, S_4=2)$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, $J_1$ arrives and starts execution as it is the only job.\n\nAt time $t=4$, $J_2$ arrives with $S_2=1$. $J_1$ has been running for $4$ time quanta, so its remaining time is $r_1 = 10 - 4 = 6$.\nThe preemption condition is checked: $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ becomes $1  6$, which is true. The second part of the condition is $r \\ge r_{\\min}$, which becomes $6 \\ge r_{\\min}$.\nThis creates two distinct scenarios:\n1.  If $6 \\ge r_{\\min}$ (i.e., $r_{\\min} \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$), $J_1$ is preempted by $J_2$.\n2.  If $6  r_{\\min}$ (i.e., $r_{\\min} \\ge 7$), $J_1$ is not preempted.\n\nLet's analyze these scenarios separately.\n\n### Scenario 1: $0 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 6$\n\nAt $t=4$, $J_1$ is preempted. The number of preemptions $P$ is at least $1$. $J_2$ starts running.\n- From $t=4$ to $t=5$, $J_2$ runs and completes. Its completion time is $C_2=5$.\n- At $t=5$, the processor is free. The only job in the ready queue is $J_1$ (with remaining time $r_1=6$). $J_1$ resumes execution.\n- From $t=5$ to $t=9$, $J_1$ runs for another $4$ time quanta.\n- At $t=9$, $J_3$ arrives with $S_3=1$. $J_1$ has now run for a total of $4$ (before preemption) + $4$ (after resuming) = $8$ quanta. Its new remaining time is $r_1 = 10 - 8 = 2$.\nA new preemption decision is made. The condition $s_{\\text{new}}  r$ is $1  2$, which is true. The second condition is $r \\ge r_{\\min}$, which is $2 \\ge r_{\\min}$. This splits Scenario 1 into two sub-cases.\n\n#### Sub-case 1.1: $0 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 2$\nIn this case, $2 \\ge r_{\\min}$ is true. So, a second preemption occurs at $t=9$.\n- $P=2$. $J_1$ is preempted, and $J_3$ starts.\n- From $t=9$ to $t=10$, $J_3$ runs and completes. $C_3=10$.\n- At $t=10$, $J_4$ arrives ($S_4=2$). The completion of $J_3$ is handled first. The scheduler must choose a new job. The ready queue contains $J_1$ (remaining time $r_1=2$) and $J_4$ (service time $S_4=2$). There is a tie in remaining time. Using a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) tie-break rule, $J_1$ is chosen.\n- From $t=10$ to $t=12$, $J_1$ runs and completes. $C_1=12$.\n- From $t=12$ to $t=14$, $J_4$ runs and completes. $C_4=14$.\n\nResponse times $T_i = C_i - A_i$:\n- $T_1 = 12 - 0 = 12$\n- $T_2 = 5 - 4 = 1$\n- $T_3 = 10 - 9 = 1$\n- $T_4 = 14 - 10 = 4$\nMean response time: $\\overline{T} = \\frac{12+1+1+4}{4} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.5$.\nObjective function: $R = c \\cdot P + \\overline{T} = 0.8 \\cdot 2 + 4.5 = 1.6 + 4.5 = 6.1$.\nThis value of $R$ is valid for $r_{\\min} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\n#### Sub-case 1.2: $3 \\le r_{\\min} \\le 6$\nIn this case, $2 \\ge r_{\\min}$ is false. No preemption occurs at $t=9$. The preemption at $t=4$ still occurs.\n- $P=1$. At $t=9$, $J_1$ (with $r_1=2$) continues to run. $J_3$ waits.\n- At $t=10$, $J_4$ arrives ($S_4=2$). $J_1$ has run for one more quantum (from $t=9$ to $t=10$), so its remaining time is now $r_1=1$. The preemption condition for $J_4$ is $2  1$, which is false. $J_1$ continues.\n- From $t=10$ to $t=11$, $J_1$ runs and completes. $C_1=11$.\n- At $t=11$, the scheduler chooses a job. The ready queue contains $J_3$ ($S_3=1$) and $J_4$ ($S_4=2$). $J_3$ has the shortest remaining time and starts.\n- From $t=11$ to $t=12$, $J_3$ runs and completes. $C_3=12$.\n- From $t=12$ to $t=14$, $J_4$ runs and completes. $C_4=14$.\nNote that $C_2$ is still $5$ as $J_2$ ran from $t=4$ to $t=5$.\n\nResponse times $T_i = C_i - A_i$:\n- $T_1 = 11 - 0 = 11$\n- $T_2 = 5 - 4 = 1$\n- $T_3 = 12 - 9 = 3$\n- $T_4 = 14 - 10 = 4$\nMean response time: $\\overline{T} = \\frac{11+1+3+4}{4} = \\frac{19}{4} = 4.75$.\nObjective function: $R = c \\cdot P + \\overline{T} = 0.8 \\cdot 1 + 4.75 = 0.8 + 4.75 = 5.55$.\nThis value of $R$ is valid for $r_{\\min} \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n### Scenario 2: $r_{\\min} \\ge 7$\n\nAt $t=4$, $J_2$ arrives, $J_1$ has remaining time $r_1=6$. The preemption condition $6 \\ge r_{\\min}$ is false. No preemption occurs. $P=0$ so far.\n- $J_1$ continues to run. $J_2$ waits in the ready queue.\n- At $t=9$, $J_3$ arrives ($S_3=1$). $J_1$ has run for $9$ quanta, its remaining time is $r_1=1$. The preemption condition for $J_3$ is $1  1$ (tie), which is false. No preemption. $J_1$ continues.\n- At $t=10$, $J_1$ runs for one more quantum and completes. $C_1=10$.\n- Simultaneously at $t=10$, $J_4$ arrives ($S_4=2$). The completion of $J_1$ is handled first.\n- At $t=10$, the scheduler selects a new job. The ready queue contains: $J_2$ ($S_2=1$), $J_3$ ($S_3=1$), and $J_4$ ($S_4=2$).\n- Both $J_2$ and $J_3$ have the shortest remaining time of $1$. Using an FCFS tie-break, $J_2$ (arrived at $t=4$) is chosen over $J_3$ (arrived at $t=9$).\n- From $t=10$ to $t=11$, $J_2$ runs and completes. $C_2=11$.\n- From $t=11$ to $t=12$, $J_3$ runs and completes. $C_3=12$.\n- From $t=12$ to $t=14$, $J_4$ runs and completes. $C_4=14$.\nIn this scenario, no new jobs arrive while another is running, so there are no further opportunities for preemption. Thus, $P=0$.\n\nResponse times $T_i = C_i - A_i$:\n- $T_1 = 10 - 0 = 10$\n- $T_2 = 11 - 4 = 7$\n- $T_3 = 12 - 9 = 3$\n- $T_4 = 14 - 10 = 4$\nMean response time: $\\overline{T} = \\frac{10+7+3+4}{4} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\nObjective function: $R = c \\cdot P + \\overline{T} = 0.8 \\cdot 0 + 6 = 6.0$.\nThis value of $R$ is valid for all integers $r_{\\min} \\ge 7$.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have calculated the value of $R$ for all possible non-negative integer values of $r_{\\min}$:\n- For $r_{\\min} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, $R = 6.1$.\n- For $r_{\\min} \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, $R = 5.55$.\n- For $r_{\\min} \\ge 7$, $R = 6.0$.\n\nComparing these values, the minimum value of $R$ is $5.55$. This minimum is achieved for any $r_{\\min}$ in the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The problem requires selecting the smallest $r_{\\min}$ if there are multiple minimizers. The smallest value in this set is $3$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $r_{\\min}$ that minimizes $R$ is $3$.",
