This first exercise challenges you to quantify this impact directly. By simulating a workload under both the simple First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policy and the optimal Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy, you will calculate a \"slowdown factor\" that provides a stark, numerical answer to the question: just how bad is the convoy effect for short, interactive jobs?",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the short-job slowdown factor, $\\Phi$, which compares the performance of First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) scheduling for a given set of jobs. The analysis proceeds in four stages: (1) identifying the subset of short jobs, (2) simulating the workload under FCFS to find the mean slowdown of short jobs, (3) simulating the workload under SRPT to find the mean slowdown of short jobs, and (4) computing the ratio $\\Phi$ and interpreting its value.\n\nFirst, we identify the set of short jobs, defined as those with service demand $B_{i} \\le 2$. The service demands are: $B_{1}=20$, $B_{2}=1$, $B_{3}=2$, $B_{4}=1$, $B_{5}=3$, $B_{6}=1$, $B_{7}=4$, and $B_{8}=1$. The jobs satisfying the condition $B_{i} \\le 2$ are $J_{2}$, $J_{3}$, $J_{4}$, $J_{6}$, and $J_{8}$. There are $5$ short jobs.\n\nNext, we analyze the FCFS scheduling discipline. FCFS is non-preemptive and services jobs in their order of arrival. The arrival times $A_i$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10.5, 11$, so the execution sequence is $J_1, J_2, J_3, J_4, J_5, J_6, J_7, J_8$.\n\nThe completion times $C_{i}$ under FCFS are calculated as follows:\n- Job $J_{1}$ ($A_{1}=0, B_{1}=20$): Starts at $t=0$, finishes at $t=20$. $C_{1}=20$.\n- Job $J_{2}$ ($A_{2}=1, B_{2}=1$): Starts after $J_1$ at $t=20$, finishes at $t=20+1=21$. $C_{2}=21$.\n- Job $J_{3}$ ($A_{3}=2, B_{3}=2$): Starts after $J_2$ at $t=21$, finishes at $t=21+2=23$. $C_{3}=23$.\n- Job $J_{4}$ ($A_{4}=3, B_{4}=1$): Starts after $J_3$ at $t=23$, finishes at $t=23+1=24$. $C_{4}=24$.\n- Job $J_{5}$ ($A_{5}=4, B_{5}=3$): Starts after $J_4$ at $t=24$, finishes at $t=24+3=27$. $C_{5}=27$.\n- Job $J_{6}$ ($A_{6}=10, B_{6}=1$): Starts after $J_5$ at $t=27$, finishes at $t=27+1=28$. $C_{6}=28$.\n- Job $J_{7}$ ($A_{7}=10.5, B_{7}=4$): Starts after $J_6$ at $t=28$, finishes at $t=28+4=32$. $C_{7}=32$.\n- Job $J_{8}$ ($A_{8}=11, B_{8}=1$): Starts after $J_7$ at $t=32$, finishes at $t=32+1=33$. $C_{8}=33$.\n\nNow we compute the flow time $F_{i} = C_{i} - A_{i}$ and slowdown $S_{i} = F_{i} / B_{i}$ for the short jobs:\n- $J_2$: $F_{2} = 21 - 1 = 20$. $S_{2} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20$.\n- $J_3$: $F_{3} = 23 - 2 = 21$. $S_{3} = \\frac{21}{2} = 10.5$.\n- $J_4$: $F_{4} = 24 - 3 = 21$. $S_{4} = \\frac{21}{1} = 21$.\n- $J_6$: $F_{6} = 28 - 10 = 18$. $S_{6} = \\frac{18}{1} = 18$.\n- $J_8$: $F_{8} = 33 - 11 = 22$. $S_{8} = \\frac{22}{1} = 22$.\n\nThe mean slowdown of short jobs under FCFS, $\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{FCFS}}$, is:\n$$\n\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{FCFS}} = \\frac{S_{2} + S_{3} + S_{4} + S_{6} + S_{8}}{5} = \\frac{20 + 10.5 + 21 + 18 + 22}{5} = \\frac{91.5}{5} = 18.3\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the SRPT scheduling discipline. SRPT is preemptive and always runs the job with the shortest remaining processing time.\n- $t=0$: $J_{1}$ ($A_{1}=0, B_{1}=20$) arrives and starts. Remaining time $B'_{1}=20$.\n- $t=1$: $J_{2}$ ($A_{2}=1, B_{2}=1$) arrives. $J_{1}$ has run for $1$ unit, so $B'_{1}=19$. Since $B'_{2}=1  B'_{1}=19$, $J_{2}$ preempts $J_{1}$ and starts.\n- $t=2$: $J_{3}$ ($A_{3}=2, B_{3}=2$) arrives as $J_{2}$ finishes. $C_{2}=2$. The jobs in the ready queue are $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=19$) and $J_{3}$ ($B'_{3}=2$). Since $B'_{3}  B'_{1}$, $J_{3}$ starts.\n- $t=3$: $J_{4}$ ($A_{4}=3, B_{4}=1$) arrives. $J_{3}$ has run for $1$ unit, so $B'_{3}=1$. The jobs in the queue are $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=19$), $J_{3}$ ($B'_{3}=1$, running), and $J_{4}$ ($B'_{4}=1$). Since $B'_{4}$ is not strictly less than the running job's remaining time $B'_{3}$, the tie-breaking rule favors the current job, so $J_{3}$ continues.\n- $t=4$: $J_{5}$ ($A_{5}=4, B_{5}=3$) arrives as $J_{3}$ finishes. $C_{3}=4$. Ready queue: $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=19$), $J_{4}$ ($B'_{4}=1$), $J_{5}$ ($B'_{5}=3$). $J_{4}$ starts as it has the minimum remaining time.\n- $t=5$: $J_{4}$ finishes. $C_{4}=5$. Ready queue: $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=19$), $J_{5}$ ($B'_{5}=3$). $J_{5}$ starts.\n- $t=8$: $J_{5}$ finishes. $C_{5}=8$. Only $J_{1}$ is in the system. $J_{1}$ resumes execution.\n- $t=10$: $J_{6}$ ($A_{6}=10, B_{6}=1$) arrives. $J_{1}$ has run for $2$ units (from $t=8$ to $t=10$), so its remaining time is $B'_{1}=19-2=17$. Since $B'_{6}=1  B'_{1}=17$, $J_{6}$ preempts $J_{1}$.\n- $t=10.5$: $J_{7}$ ($A_{7}=10.5, B_{7}=4$) arrives. $J_{6}$ has run for $0.5$ units, $B'_{6}=0.5$. $J_{6}$ continues as $B'_{6}=0.5$ is the minimum.\n- $t=11$: $J_{8}$ ($A_{8}=11, B_{8}=1$) arrives as $J_{6}$ finishes. $C_{6}=11$. Ready queue: $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=17$), $J_{7}$ ($B'_{7}=4$), $J_{8}$ ($B'_{8}=1$). $J_{8}$ starts.\n- $t=12$: $J_{8}$ finishes. $C_{8}=12$. Ready queue: $J_{1}$ ($B'_{1}=17$), $J_{7}$ ($B'_{7}=4$). $J_{7}$ starts.\n- $t=16$: $J_{7}$ finishes. $C_{7}=16$. $J_{1}$ resumes.\n- $t=33$: $J_{1}$ runs for its remaining $17$ units and finishes. $C_{1}=33$.\n\nNow we compute the flow time and slowdown for the short jobs under SRPT:\n- $J_2$: $F_{2} = C_{2} - A_{2} = 2 - 1 = 1$. $S_{2} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n- $J_3$: $F_{3} = C_{3} - A_{3} = 4 - 2 = 2$. $S_{3} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\n- $J_4$: $F_{4} = C_{4} - A_{4} = 5 - 3 = 2$. $S_{4} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n- $J_6$: $F_{6} = C_{6} - A_{6} = 11 - 10 = 1$. $S_{6} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n- $J_8$: $F_{8} = C_{8} - A_{8} = 12 - 11 = 1$. $S_{8} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n\nThe mean slowdown of short jobs under SRPT, $\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{SRPT}}$, is:\n$$\n\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{SRPT}} = \\frac{S_{2} + S_{3} + S_{4} + S_{6} + S_{8}}{5} = \\frac{1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1}{5} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the short-job slowdown factor $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{FCFS}}}{\\overline{S}_{\\text{short}}^{\\text{SRPT}}} = \\frac{18.3}{1.2} = 15.25\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $15.25$.\n\nThis result provides a stark, quantitative measure of the convoy effect. The value $\\Phi=15.25$ indicates that for this workload, an FCFS scheduler degrades the mean slowdown of short jobs by a factor of over $15$ compared to an SRPT scheduler. This is because the long-running job $J_{1}$ ($B_1=20$) arrives first and, under the non-preemptive FCFS policy, monopolizes the processor. This forces all subsequently arriving short jobs ($J_{2}, J_{3}, J_{4}$) to wait in a \"convoy\" behind it, leading to extremely long flow times relative to their small service demands, and thus very high slowdowns. In contrast, the preemptive SRPT policy allows short jobs to run almost immediately upon arrival by preempting the long job. This minimizes their waiting time and keeps their slowdowns close to the ideal value of $1$, at the expense of delaying the long job. The large value of $\\Phi$ demonstrates that policies like FCFS which are blind to job size can be highly detrimental to the performance of short jobs, a phenomenon central to the convoy effect.",

            "problem": "Consider a uniprocessor system executing a batch of jobs using First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling. Use only the core definitions that (i) FCFS is a non-preemptive policy that always runs the earliest-arrived job among those waiting, (ii) turnaround time of a job equals its completion time minus its arrival time, and (iii) when all jobs arrive at time $0$, a job’s turnaround time equals its completion time. A job’s completion time is the time at which its required Central Processing Unit (CPU) service has finished.\n\nAt time $0$, the system has the following ready jobs:\n- Two CPU-bound jobs, labeled $J_{C1}$ and $J_{C2}$, requiring CPU burst times of $12$ and $9$ time units, respectively.\n- Six I/O-bound jobs, labeled $J_{I1}, J_{I2}, \\dots, J_{I6}$, each requiring a CPU burst time of $1$ time unit.\n\nYou will compare two policies:\n\n1. Single-queue FCFS: All jobs are placed in a single FCFS ready queue. When multiple jobs share the same arrival time, the tie-breaker is a fixed total order where CPU-bound jobs precede I/O-bound jobs, and within each class the order is by increasing subscript. Thus, the service order is $J_{C1}$, $J_{C2}$, $J_{I1}$, $J_{I2}$, $J_{I3}$, $J_{I4}$, $J_{I5}$, $J_{I6}$.\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe givens are as follows:\n- A uniprocessor system with First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) non-preemptive scheduling.\n- Total number of jobs is $8$.\n- All jobs arrive at time $t = 0$.\n- Two CPU-bound jobs: $J_{C1}$ with burst time $b_{C1} = 12$ and $J_{C2}$ with burst time $b_{C2} = 9$.\n- Six I/O-bound jobs: $J_{I1}, J_{I2}, \\dots, J_{I6}$, each with burst time $b_{Ik} = 1$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$.\n- Turnaround time for a job $J$ is defined as $T_J = C_J - A_J$, where $C_J$ is the completion time and $A_J$ is the arrival time. Since all jobs arrive at $A_J = 0$, the turnaround time for any job is equal to its completion time, $T_J = C_J$.\n- Two scheduling policies are to be analyzed:\n    1.  **Single-queue FCFS**: A single queue with a fixed service order determined by a tie-breaking rule: $J_{C1}, J_{C2}, J_{I1}, J_{I2}, J_{I3}, J_{I4}, J_{I5}, J_{I6}$.\n    2.  **Per-class FCFS with alternating service**: Two queues, one for CPU-bound jobs ($Q_C$) and one for I/O-bound jobs ($Q_I$). The scheduler alternates selections between non-empty queues, starting with $Q_I$ at time $t=0$. If one queue is empty, it serves from the other.\n- The objective is to compute the convoy reduction factor $R$, defined as the ratio of the mean turnaround time under the single-queue policy to that of the per-class policy.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-defined problem in the domain of operating system process scheduling. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all terms and conditions are specified unambiguously, allowing for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by calculating the mean turnaround time for each policy. The total number of jobs is $N = 8$.\n\n**1. Analysis of Policy 1: Single-queue FCFS**\n\nUnder this policy, the service order is explicitly given: $J_{C1}, J_{C2}, J_{I1}, J_{I2}, J_{I3}, J_{I4}, J_{I5}, J_{I6}$. Since scheduling is non-preemptive and all jobs arrive at $t=0$, the completion time of a job is the sum of the burst times of all preceding jobs plus its own burst time. Let $C_J$ denote the completion time of job $J$.\n\nThe burst times are $b_{C1}=12$ and $b_{C2}=9$ for the CPU-bound jobs, and $b_{Ik}=1$ for each of the six I/O-bound jobs.\n\nThe completion times are calculated sequentially:\n- $C_{C1} = b_{C1} = 12$\n- $C_{C2} = C_{C1} + b_{C2} = 12 + 9 = 21$\n- $C_{I1} = C_{C2} + b_{I1} = 21 + 1 = 22$\n- $C_{I2} = C_{I1} + b_{I2} = 22 + 1 = 23$\n- $C_{I3} = C_{I2} + b_{I3} = 23 + 1 = 24$\n- $C_{I4} = C_{I3} + b_{I4} = 24 + 1 = 25$\n- $C_{I5} = C_{I4} + b_{I5} = 25 + 1 = 26$\n- $C_{I6} = C_{I5} + b_{I6} = 26 + 1 = 27$\n\nSince arrival times are all $0$, these completion times are also the turnaround times. The total turnaround time for Policy 1, denoted $T_{total,1}$, is the sum of these individual turnaround times:\n$$\nT_{total,1} = 12 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 = 180 \\text{ time units}\n$$\nThe mean turnaround time for Policy 1, $\\bar{T}_1$, is:\n$$\n\\bar{T}_1 = \\frac{T_{total,1}}{N} = \\frac{180}{8} = 22.5\n$$\n\n**2.

Consequently, its service time is $T_L$, and each subsequent short job $S_j$ has a service time of $T_{\\text{s,warm}}$.\nThe completion times for the jobs in Order X are:\n-   Completion time of $L$: $C_L = T_L$.\n-   Completion time of $S_1$: $C_{S_1} = T_L + T_{\\text{s,warm}}$.\n-   Completion time of $S_2$: $C_{S_2} = T_L + 2 T_{\\text{s,warm}}$.\n-   In general, the completion time for the $j$-th short job, $S_j$, is: $C_{S_j} = T_L + j \\cdot T_{\\text{s,warm}}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nThe sum of turnaround times (completion times) for Order X is:\n$$\nTT_{X, \\text{sum}} = C_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} C_{S_j} = T_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (T_L + j \\cdot T_{\\text{s,warm}})\n$$\n$$\nTT_{X, \\text{sum}} = T_L + k T_L + T_{\\text{s,warm}} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j\n$$\nUsing the formula for the sum of the first $k$ integers, $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} j = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$, we get:\n$$\nTT_{X, \\text{sum}} = (k+1)T_L + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} T_{\\text{s,warm}}\n$$\nThe average turnaround time for Order X, $\\text{ATT}_X$, is this sum divided by the total number of jobs, $N=k+1$:\n$$\n\\text{ATT}_X = \\frac{(k+1)T_L + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} T_{\\text{s,warm}}}{k+1} = T_L + \\frac{k}{2} T_{\\text{s,warm}}\n$$\n\nNext, consider Order Y, where the job sequence is $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k, L$. In this order, the short jobs run before the cache has been warmed by job $L$. Therefore, each short job $S_j$ has a service time of $T_{\\text{s,cold}}$. The service time of job $L$ remains $T_L$.\nThe completion times for the jobs in Order Y are:\n-   Completion time of $S_1$: $C_{S_1} = T_{\\text{s,cold}}$.\n-   Completion time of $S_2$: $C_{S_2} = 2 T_{\\text{s,cold}}$.\n-   In general, the completion time for the $j$-th short job, $S_j$, is: $C_{S_j} = j \\cdot T_{\\text{s,cold}}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\n-   The completion time of $L$ is the sum of the service times of all preceding jobs plus its own service time: $C_L = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{k} T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\right) + T_L = k T_{\\text{s,cold}} + T_L$.\n\nThe sum of turnaround times for Order Y is:\n$$\nTT_{Y, \\text{sum}} = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{k} C_{S_j}\\right) + C_L = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{k} j \\cdot T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\right) + (k T_{\\text{s,cold}} + T_L)\n$$\n$$\nTT_{Y, \\text{sum}} = T_{\\text{s,cold}} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{k} j\\right) + k T_{\\text{s,cold}} + T_L\n$$\nSubstituting the sum formula:\n$$\nTT_{Y, \\text{sum}} = T_{\\text{s,cold}} \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k T_{\\text{s,cold}} + T_L = T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\left(\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k\\right) + T_L\n$$\n$$\nTT_{Y, \\text{sum}} = T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\left(\\frac{k^2+k+2k}{2}\\right) + T_L = T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\frac{k(k+3)}{2} + T_L\n$$\nThe average turnaround time for Order Y, $\\text{ATT}_Y$, is this sum divided by $N=k+1$:\n$$\n\\text{ATT}_Y = \\frac{T_{\\text{s,cold}}\\frac{k(k+3)}{2} + T_L}{k+1} = \\frac{k(k+3)}{2(k+1)}T_{\\text{s,cold}} + \\frac{1}{k+1}T_L\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum long-job service time $T_L^{\\ast}$ such that the average turnaround time under Order X is strictly less than under Order Y. This is expressed by the inequality $\\text{ATT}_X  \\text{ATT}_Y$.\n$$\nT_L + \\frac{k}{2} T_{\\text{s,warm}}  \\frac{k(k+3)}{2(k+1)}T_{\\text{s,cold}} + \\frac{1}{k+1}T_L\n$$\nWe solve this inequality for $T_L$. First, group the terms involving $T_L$:\n$$\nT_L - \\frac{1}{k+1}T_L  \\frac{k(k+3)}{2(k+1)}T_{\\text{s,cold}} - \\frac{k}{2}T_{\\text{s,warm}}\n$$\n$$\nT_L\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k+1}\\right)  \\frac{k(k+3)}{2(k+1)}T_{\\text{s,cold}} - \\frac{k(k+1)}{2(k+1)}T_{\\text{s,warm}}\n$$\n$$\nT_L\\left(\\frac{k}{k+1}\\right)  \\frac{k}{2(k+1)}\\left[ (k+3)T_{\\text{s,cold}} - (k+1)T_{\\text{s,warm}} \\right]\n$$\nTo isolate $T_L$, we multiply both sides by $\\frac{k+1}{k}$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, this factor is positive, and the inequality direction is preserved.\n$$\nT_L  \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (k+3)T_{\\text{s,cold}} - (k+1)T_{\\text{s,warm}} \\right]\n$$\nThis inequality defines the condition on $T_L$. The maximum value $T_L^{\\ast}$ is the supremum of the set of valid $T_L$ values, which is the boundary of this inequality.\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (k+3)T_{\\text{s,cold}} - (k+1)T_{\\text{s,warm}} \\right]\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for $T_L^{\\ast}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $T_L^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters: $k=10$, $T_{\\text{s,cold}}=20~\\text{ms}$, and $T_{\\text{s,warm}}=5~\\text{ms}$.\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (10+3)(20) - (10+1)(5) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (13)(20) - (11)(5) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ 260 - 55 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(205)\n$$\n$$\nT_L^{\\ast} = 102.5~\\text{ms}\n$$\nThe value $102.5$ has four significant figures as required.",
