This exercise explores this by comparing the non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm with its preemptive counterpart, Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). By working through this problem , you will trace how each scheduler handles an identical workload and discover the precise conditions under which preemption leads to a lower average waiting time, linking this performance gain to the variance in job burst times.",

            "problem": "An operating system runs on a single-core processor with negligible context switch overhead. Consider $4$ independent, CPU-bound jobs with arrivals and CPU bursts given by $(a_1,b_1)=(0,x)$, $(a_2,b_2)=(1,3)$, $(a_3,b_3)=(2,3)$, $(a_4,b_4)=(3,3)$, where $x$ is a real parameter satisfying $x \\geq 3$. Time is measured in an abstract unit $u$. The scheduler uses one of two policies: non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) and preemptive Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). In SRTF, preemption occurs only if an arriving job has strictly smaller remaining time than the currently running job; ties never cause preemption. When multiple jobs are equally eligible, the tie-breaker is earliest arrival time, and if still tied, increasing job index. The processor never idles if any job is ready.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of waiting time, average waiting time, and the operational rules of SJF and SRTF stated above, do the following:\n\n- Construct the exact execution schedules (execution order and run intervals) that each policy produces for the given workload as functions of $x$.\n- From these schedules, derive the per-job waiting times $W_i$ and the average waiting time $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$ under SJF and $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x)$ under SRTF.\n- Determine the condition on $x$ for which $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x)$ is strictly less than $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$.\n\nLet $V(x)$ denote the population variance of the multiset of CPU bursts $\\{x,3,3,3\\}$, measured in $u^2$.

Express your final answer as a single reduced fraction. The final numerical value should be reported without units. No rounding is required.

It describes a standard scenario from operating systems theory (CPU scheduling) with clearly defined rules and a quantifiable objective. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis, making it a non-trivial but solvable exercise in computer science fundamentals. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nI will now proceed with the solution. For all calculations, time is measured in units of $u$.\n\n**Analysis of Non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)**\nUnder a non-preemptive policy, once a job starts, it runs to completion.\n- At time $t=0$, only Job $1$ has arrived. It is selected to run. Its burst time is $b_1 = x$.\n- Job $1$ runs from $t=0$ to $t=x$.\n- During the execution of Job $1$, Jobs $2$, $3$, and $4$ arrive at times $t=1$, $t=2$, and $t=3$, respectively.\n- At time $t=x$, Job $1$ completes. The ready queue contains Jobs $2$, $3$, and $4$.\n- The scheduler must now choose the next job. The burst times are $b_2=3$, $b_3=3$, and $b_4=3$. Since all burst times are equal, the tie-breaking rule of the earliest arrival time is used.\n- Job $2$ arrived at $t=1$, Job $3$ at $t=2$, and Job $4$ at $t=3$. Job $2$ is chosen first.\n- Job $2$ runs from $t=x$ to $t=x+3$.\n- At $t=x+3$, the remaining jobs are Job $3$ and Job $4$. Both have burst time $3$. Job $3$ arrived earlier ($t=2$) than Job $4$ ($t=3$), so Job $3$ is selected.\n- Job $3$ runs from $t=x+3$ to $t=x+6$.\n- Finally, Job $4$ runs from $t=x+6$ to $t=x+9$.\n\nThe schedule for SJF is: Job $1 \\to$ Job $2 \\to$ Job $3 \\to$ Job $4$.\nCompletion times ($C_i$): $C_1=x$, $C_2=x+3$, $C_3=x+6$, $C_4=x+9$.\n\nThe waiting time for each job is $W_i = C_i - a_i - b_i$.\n- $W_{1, \\mathrm{SJF}} = x - 0 - x = 0$\n- $W_{2, \\mathrm{SJF}} = (x+3) - 1 - 3 = x-1$\n- $W_{3, \\mathrm{SJF}} = (x+6) - 2 - 3 = x+1$\n- $W_{4, \\mathrm{SJF}} = (x+9) - 3 - 3 = x+3$\n\nThe average waiting time for SJF is:\n$$ \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} W_{i, \\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{4} (0 + (x-1) + (x+1) + (x+3)) = \\frac{3x+3}{4} $$\n\n**Analysis of Preemptive Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**\nThe behavior of SRTF depends on whether preemption occurs. Preemption happens if an arriving job has a strictly smaller burst time than the remaining time of the currently running job.\n- At $t=0$, Job $1$ arrives and starts running.\n- At $t=1$, Job $2$ arrives with burst $b_2=3$. Job $1$ has been running for $1$ unit of time, so its remaining time is $x-1$. Preemption occurs if $3  x-1$, which is equivalent to $x  4$. This requires a case analysis based on the value of $x$.\n\n**Case 1: $3 \\leq x \\leq 4$**\n- At $t=1$, Job $2$ arrives ($b_2=3$). The remaining time for Job $1$ is $x-1$. Since $x \\leq 4$, we have $x-1 \\leq 3$. The condition for preemption, $3  x-1$, is false. Job $1$ continues to run.\n- At $t=2$, Job $3$ arrives ($b_3=3$). The remaining time for Job $1$ is $x-2$. Since $x \\leq 4$, we have $x-2 \\leq 2$. The condition $3  x-2$ is false. Job $1$ continues.\n- At $t=3$, Job $4$ arrives ($b_4=3$). The remaining time for Job $1$ is $x-3$. Since $x \\leq 4$, we have $x-3 \\leq 1$. The condition $3  x-3$ is false. Job $1$ continues.\n- Job $1$ runs to completion at $t=x$. No preemption occurs. The subsequent scheduling of Jobs $2, 3, 4$ is identical to the SJF case.\n- Therefore, for $3 \\leq x \\leq 4$, the schedule and waiting times are the same as for SJF.\n- $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x) = \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x) = \\frac{3x+3}{4}$ for $3 \\leq x \\leq 4$.\n\n**Case 2: $x  4$**\n- At $t=0$, Job $1$ ($b_1=x$) starts.\n- At $t=1$, Job $2$ ($b_2=3$) arrives. Job $1$ has remaining time $x-1$. Since $x4$, we have $x-13$. The preemption condition $3  x-1$ is met. Job $1$ is preempted, and Job $2$ starts.\n- At $t=2$, Job $3$ ($b_3=3$) arrives. Job $2$ has remaining time $3-1=2$. The preemption condition $3  2$ is false. Job $2$ continues.\n- At $t=3$, Job $4$ ($b_4=3$) arrives. Job $2$ has remaining time $2-1=1$. The preemption condition $3  1$ is false. Job $2$ continues.\n- Job $2$ runs from $t=1$ to $t=1+3=4$, at which point it completes.\n- At $t=4$, the ready queue contains: Job $1$ (remaining time $x-1  3$), Job $3$ (burst $3$), and Job $4$ (burst $3$). The shortest remaining times are $3$ for Jobs $3$ and $4$. Using the tie-breaker, Job $3$ (arrived at $t=2$) is chosen over Job $4$ (arrived at $t=3$).\n- Job $3$ runs from $t=4$ to $t=4+3=7$.\n- At $t=7$, the ready queue contains: Job $1$ (remaining time $x-1  3$) and Job $4$ (burst $3$). Job $4$ has the shorter time and is chosen.\n- Job $4$ runs from $t=7$ to $t=7+3=10$.\n- At $t=10$, only Job $1$ is left. It resumes execution and runs for its remaining $x-1$ time units.\n- Job $1$ completes at $t = 10 + (x-1) = x+9$.\n\nThe completion times ($C_i$) for $x4$ are: $C_1=x+9$, $C_2=4$, $C_3=7$, $C_4=10$.\nWaiting times are calculated as $W_i = C_i - a_i - b_i$:\n- $W_{1, \\mathrm{SRTF}} = (x+9) - 0 - x = 9$\n- $W_{2, \\mathrm{SRTF}} = 4 - 1 - 3 = 0$\n- $W_{3, \\mathrm{SRTF}} = 7 - 2 - 3 = 2$\n- $W_{4, \\mathrm{SRTF}} = 10 - 3 - 3 = 4$\n\nThe average waiting time for SRTF when $x4$ is:\n$$ \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x) = \\frac{1}{4} (9 + 0 + 2 + 4) = \\frac{15}{4} $$\nThis value is constant for all $x  4$.\n\n**Condition for $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x)  \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$**\n- For $3 \\leq x \\leq 4$, we have $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x) = \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$, so the strict inequality does not hold.\n- For $x  4$, we compare $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x) = \\frac{15}{4}$ with $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x) = \\frac{3x+3}{4}$.\nThe inequality is $\\frac{15}{4}  \\frac{3x+3}{4}$.\n$$ 15  3x+3 $$\n$$ 12  3x $$\n$$ 4  x $$\nThis is consistent with our case assumption ($x  4$).\nThus, the strict inequality $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x)  \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$ holds if and only if $x4$.\n\n**Variance Calculation and Critical Value**\nLet $V(x)$ be the population variance of the multiset of burst times $\\{x, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\nThe population mean, $\\mu$, is:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{x+3+3+3}{4} = \\frac{x+9}{4} $$\nThe population variance, $V(x) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum(b_i - \\mu)^2$, is:\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(x - \\frac{x+9}{4}\\right)^2 + 3 \\times \\left(3 - \\frac{x+9}{4}\\right)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{4x - x - 9}{4}\\right)^2 + 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{12 - x - 9}{4}\\right)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{3x - 9}{4}\\right)^2 + 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{3 - x}{4}\\right)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{9(x-3)^2}{16} + \\frac{3(3-x)^2}{16} \\right] $$\nSince $(3-x)^2 = (x-3)^2$:\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{9(x-3)^2 + 3(x-3)^2}{16} \\right] = \\frac{1}{64} [12(x-3)^2] = \\frac{3(x-3)^2}{16} $$\nThe problem asks for a critical variance $V^{\\star}$ such that for all $x \\geq 3$ with $V(x)  V^{\\star}$, the inequality $\\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SRTF}}(x)  \\overline{W}_{\\mathrm{SJF}}(x)$ holds.\nWe found this inequality holds for $x  4$.\nWe must now find the value $V^{\\star}$ that corresponds to the boundary condition $x=4$.\nThe function $V(x) = \\frac{3}{16}(x-3)^2$ is strictly increasing for $x  3$. Therefore, the inequality $x4$ is equivalent to the inequality $V(x)  V(4)$.\nThe critical variance $V^{\\star}$ is the value of the variance at $x=4$.\n$$ V^{\\star} = V(4) = \\frac{3(4-3)^2}{16} = \\frac{3(1)^2}{16} = \\frac{3}{16} $$\nFor any $x \\ge 3$ such that $V(x)  \\frac{3}{16}$, we must have $\\frac{3(x-3)^2}{16}  \\frac{3}{16}$, which implies $(x-3)^2  1$. Since $x \\ge 3$, $x-3 \\ge 0$, so we can take the square root to get $x-3  1$, which gives $x4$. This is precisely the condition for which SRTF is strictly better than SJF.\nThe critical variance value is $\\frac{3}{16}$. This is a reduced fraction.",

            "introduction": "While preemption can improve metrics like average waiting time, it is not a \"free\" operation; every context switch consumes valuable CPU cycles. This practice  presents a crucial lesson in practical system design by demonstrating how the theoretically optimal SRTF algorithm can perform poorly when context switch overhead is significant. You will analyze a scenario where SRTF's aggressive preemption creates excessive overhead and then devise a superior schedule, learning to balance the benefits of preemption with its inherent costs.",

            "problem": "Consider the following single-core Central Processing Unit (CPU) scheduling scenario. A context switch incurs a fixed overhead of $s$ time units, where $0  s  0.2$. A context switch occurs whenever the CPU changes from running one process to running a different process, including the initial dispatch from idle to the first process. The CPU is never idle when at least one process is ready.\n\nProcesses:\n- Long job $L$: arrival time $0$, CPU burst $20$.\n- Short jobs forming a dense arrival cluster:\n  - $S_{1}$: arrival time $1.0$, CPU burst $2.0$.\n  - $S_{2}$: arrival time $1.2$, CPU burst $1.7$.\n  - $S_{3}$: arrival time $1.4$, CPU burst $1.4$.\n  - $S_{4}$: arrival time $1.6$, CPU burst $1.1$.\n  - $S_{5}$: arrival time $1.8$, CPU burst $0.8$.\n\nFundamental definitions to use:\n- A preemptive policy like Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) always runs the ready process with the smallest remaining CPU burst, preempting the current process if a newly arrived process has a smaller remaining time.\n- Waiting time of a process is the total time the process spends in the ready state (not running), which can be computed as turnaround time minus CPU burst time, where turnaround time is completion time minus arrival time.\n- The total completion time (also called makespan) for the workload equals the sum of all CPU bursts plus the total context switch overhead, provided the CPU is not idle.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), build the runtime trace over the interval $[0, \\text{finish}]$ and count the number of context switches. Explain why each preemption occurs under SRTF given $0  s  0.2$.\n2. Propose an alternative schedule that reduces preemptions while maintaining similar waiting time for the short jobs, by deferring preemption until the last short job in the cluster has arrived. Specifically, run $L$ from time $0$ until time $1.8$, then preempt $L$ once to run the short jobs non-preemptively in Shortest Job First order $S_{5}, S_{4}, S_{3}, S_{2}, S_{1}$, and finally resume $L$. Count the number of context switches in this schedule.\n3. Using the above counts and the fundamental relation that the total completion time equals the sum of all CPU bursts plus $s$ times the number of context switches (with no CPU idle time), compute the increase in total completion time incurred by SRTF compared to the alternative schedule. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in $s$ (time units). Do not include units inside the final boxed expression.",
            "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. Under Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), whenever a process arrives with a remaining time shorter than the currently running process, a preemption occurs. Each change of the running process incurs a context switch of duration $s$. The total completion time for this workload, provided the CPU never idles, is the sum of all CPU bursts plus $s$ times the number of context switches.\n\nFirst, compute the aggregate CPU burst time:\n$$\n\\text{CPU\\ bursts\\ sum} = 20 + 2.0 + 1.7 + 1.4 + 1.1 + 0.8 = 27.0.\n$$\nThis base workload time is the same for any schedule that runs all jobs without CPU idleness.\n\nNow trace SRTF qualitatively to count context switches. We assume the initial dispatch from idle to the first process incurs a context switch.\n\n- At time $0$, the system dispatches $L$ and starts running it. This counts as $1$ context switch (idle $\\to L$).\n- At time $1.0$, $S_{1}$ arrives with burst $2.0$, which is less than $L$'s remaining time at $t=1.0$ (which is $20 - (1.0 - s) = 19.0 + s$ because $L$ started at $t=s$ after the initial dispatch). SRTF preempts $L$ and switches to $S_{1}$, adding $1$ context switch ($L \\to S_{1}$).\n- At time $1.2$, $S_{2}$ arrives with burst $1.7$. By then, $S_{1}$ has executed for $(1.2 - (1.0 + s)) = 0.2 - s$ time, so its remaining is $2.0 - (0.2 - s) = 1.8 + s$. Since $1.7  1.8 + s$, SRTF preempts $S_{1}$ and switches to $S_{2}$, adding $1$ context switch ($S_{1} \\to S_{2}$).\n- At time $1.4$, $S_{3}$ arrives with burst $1.4$. $S_{2}$ has executed for $(1.4 - (1.2 + s)) = 0.2 - s$, leaving $1.7 - (0.2 - s) = 1.5 + s$. Since $1.4  1.5 + s$, preempt to $S_{3}$, adding $1$ context switch ($S_{2} \\to S_{3}$).\n- At time $1.6$, $S_{4}$ arrives with burst $1.1$. $S_{3}$ remaining at $1.6$ is $1.4 - (0.2 - s) = 1.2 + s$. Since $1.1  1.2 + s$, preempt to $S_{4}$, adding $1$ context switch ($S_{3} \\to S_{4}$).\n- At time $1.8$, $S_{5}$ arrives with burst $0.8$. $S_{4}$ remaining at $1.8$ is $1.1 - (0.2 - s) = 0.9 + s$. Since $0.8  0.9 + s$, preempt to $S_{5}$, adding $1$ context switch ($S_{4} \\to S_{5}$).\n\nFrom here, no further arrivals occur. Under SRTF, after $S_{5}$ completes, the scheduler selects the ready process with the smallest remaining time from among $\\{S_{4}, S_{3}, S_{2}, S_{1}, L\\}$. The remaining times at this point maintain the order $S_{4}$, then $S_{3}$, then $S_{2}$, then $S_{1}$, then $L$, because each earlier short job had only executed for $(0.2 - s)$ before being preempted by a shorter job and thus still has nearly its full burst minus $(0.2 - s)$.\n\nTherefore, after $S_{5}$ completes, SRTF continues with $S_{4}$, then $S_{3}$, then $S_{2}$, then $S_{1}$, and finally returns to $L$ to finish. Each transition between different processes incurs one context switch. Counting all switches under SRTF:\n- Idle $\\to L$: $1$.\n- $L \\to S_{1}$, $S_{1} \\to S_{2}$, $S_{2} \\to S_{3}$, $S_{3} \\to S_{4}$, $S_{4} \\to S_{5}$: $5$.\n- $S_{5} \\to S_{4}$, $S_{4} \\to S_{3}$, $S_{3} \\to S_{2}$, $S_{2} \\to S_{1}$, $S_{1} \\to L$: $5$.\nHence,\n$$\n\\text{switches}_{\\text{SRTF}} = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11.\n$$\n\nNext, consider the alternative schedule that reduces preemptions yet maintains similar waiting time for the short jobs by deferring preemption until the cluster has fully arrived:\n- Run $L$ from time $0$ until time $1.8$.\n- At time $1.8$, preempt $L$ once and run the short jobs non-preemptively in Shortest Job First order: $S_{5}$, then $S_{4}$, then $S_{3}$, then $S_{2}$, then $S_{1}$.\n- Resume $L$ after the short jobs complete.\n\nCount the context switches in this alternative:\n- Idle $\\to L$: $1$.\n- $L \\to S_{5}$ at $1.8$: $1$.\n- Among short jobs: $S_{5} \\to S_{4}$, $S_{4} \\to S_{3}$, $S_{3} \\to S_{2}$, $S_{2} \\to S_{1}$: $4$.\n- $S_{1} \\to L$: $1$.\nHence,\n$$\n\\text{switches}_{\\text{alt}} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7.\n$$\n\nBy the fundamental relation, with no CPU idleness, the total completion time equals the sum of all CPU bursts plus $s$ times the number of context switches. Since both schedules run the same set of jobs without idle, the difference in total completion time is determined solely by the difference in the number of context switches:\n$$\nT_{\\text{SRTF}} - T_{\\text{alt}} = s \\cdot \\left(\\text{switches}_{\\text{SRTF}} - \\text{switches}_{\\text{alt}}\\right) = s \\cdot (11 - 7) = 4s.\n$$\n\nRegarding waiting time similarity for the short jobs, under SRTF each short job is started very near its arrival but suffers intra-cluster preemptions, while under the alternative schedule each short job begins shortly after $t=1.8$ and runs to completion without intra-cluster preemption. Because the cluster arrives within the narrow interval $[1.0, 1.8]$ and the alternative begins servicing them immediately after $1.8$, the additional waiting of the earliest arrivals (e.g., $S_{1}$) is bounded by approximately $(1.8 - 1.0)$ plus at most a few context switch overheads, while later arrivals (e.g., $S_{5}$) begin almost immediately. This clustering ensures the average waiting time across the short jobs remains similar in magnitude, while the alternative schedule avoids the cascade of intra-cluster preemptions that inflate the context switching overhead. The required calculation, however, is solely the makespan increase, which we have computed.\n\nTherefore, the increase in total completion time incurred by SRTF compared to the alternative schedule is $4s$.",

The objective is to compute the ratio $\\rho = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}}}{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}}}$, where $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}}$ and $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}}$ are the population variances of the completion times for three processes under Round Robin (RR) and non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling policies, respectively.\n\nWe are given $3$ processes, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, with CPU-burst times $B_1 = 30$, $B_2 = 30$, and $B_3 = 90$. All processes arrive at time $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling policy.\nAt time $t=0$, all three processes $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ are in the ready queue. The scheduler must select the process with the shortest burst time. Processes $P_1$ and $P_2$ have the shortest burst times, both equal to $30$. The problem states that ties are broken by process identifier in ascending order. Therefore, $P_1$ is selected to run first.\nSince SJF is non-preemptive, $P_1$ runs to completion.\n$P_1$ runs from $t=0$ to $t=30$. The completion time for $P_1$ is $C_{1, \\mathrm{SJF}} = 30$.\nAt time $t=30$, the remaining processes are $P_2$ (burst time $B_2=30$) and $P_3$ (burst time $B_3=90$). The scheduler selects the shorter job, which is $P_2$.\n$P_2$ runs from $t=30$ to $t=30+30=60$. The completion time for $P_2$ is $C_{2, \\mathrm{SJF}} = 60$.\nAt time $t=60$, the only remaining process is $P_3$.\n$P_3$ runs from $t=60$ to $t=60+90=150$. The completion time for $P_3$ is $C_{3, \\mathrm{SJF}} = 150$.\nThe set of completion times under SJF is $\\{30, 60, 150\\}$.\n\nNow, we compute the population variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}}$. First, we find the mean completion time, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{SJF}}$.\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_{i, \\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{30 + 60 + 150}{3} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80 $$\nNext, we compute the variance.\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (C_{i, \\mathrm{SJF}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{SJF}})^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ (30 - 80)^2 + (60 - 80)^2 + (150 - 80)^2 ] $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ (-50)^2 + (-20)^2 + (70)^2 ] $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ 2500 + 400 + 4900 ] = \\frac{7800}{3} = 2600 $$\n\nSecond, we analyze the preemptive Round Robin (RR) scheduling policy with a time quantum $q = 10$.\nThe initial ready queue order at $t=0$ is $\\langle P_1, P_2, P_3 \\rangle$. The burst times are $B_1=30$, $B_2=30$, $B_3=90$.\nThe execution proceeds as follows, tracking the remaining burst time for each process:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $t \\in [0, 10]$: $P_1$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 20$, $P_2: 30$, $P_3: 90$. Queue: $\\langle P_2, P_3, P_1 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [10, 20]$: $P_2$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 20$, $P_2: 20$, $P_3: 90$. Queue: $\\langle P_3, P_1, P_2 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [20, 30]$: $P_3$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 20$, $P_2: 20$, $P_3: 80$. Queue: $\\langle P_1, P_2, P_3 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [30, 40]$: $P_1$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 10$, $P_2: 20$, $P_3: 80$. Queue: $\\langle P_2, P_3, P_1 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [40, 50]$: $P_2$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 10$, $P_2: 10$, $P_3: 80$. Queue: $\\langle P_3, P_1, P_2 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [50, 60]$: $P_3$ runs. Remaining times: $P_1: 10$, $P_2: 10$, $P_3: 70$. Queue: $\\langle P_1, P_2, P_3 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [60, 70]$: $P_1$ runs. Remaining time for $P_1$ becomes $0$. $P_1$ completes. $C_{1, \\mathrm{RR}} = 70$. Queue: $\\langle P_2, P_3 \\rangle$.\n    \\item $t \\in [70, 80]$: $P_2$ runs. Remaining time for $P_2$ becomes $0$. $P_2$ completes. $C_{2, \\mathrm{RR}} = 80$. Queue: $\\langle P_3 \\rangle$.\n    \\item At $t=80$, only $P_3$ remains, with a remaining burst time of $70$. As it is the only process, it runs to completion without further preemption. It runs for $70$ more time units.\n    \\item $P_3$ runs from $t=80$ to $t=80+70=150$. $P_3$ completes. $C_{3, \\mathrm{RR}} = 150$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe set of completion times under RR is $\\{70, 80, 150\\}$.\n\nNow, we compute the population variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}}$. First, the mean completion time, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{RR}}$.\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_{i, \\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{70 + 80 + 150}{3} = \\frac{300}{3} = 100 $$\nNext, we compute the variance.\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (C_{i, \\mathrm{RR}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{RR}})^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ (70 - 100)^2 + (80 - 100)^2 + (150 - 100)^2 ] $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ (-30)^2 + (-20)^2 + (50)^2 ] $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1}{3} [ 900 + 400 + 2500 ] = \\frac{3800}{3} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\rho = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{RR}}}{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{SJF}}}$.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\frac{3800}{3}}{2600} = \\frac{3800}{3 \\times 2600} = \\frac{38}{3 \\times 26} = \\frac{19 \\times 2}{3 \\times 13 \\times 2} = \\frac{19}{3 \\times 13} = \\frac{19}{39} $$\nThe final answer is the exact fraction.",
