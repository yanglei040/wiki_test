It is based on well-established mathematical principles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides four data points to determine three unknown coefficients ($a, b, c$). The system is overdetermined, which is the standard scenario for a least squares fit. A unique solution exists if and only if the columns of the design matrix are linearly independent. The design matrix $A$ for this problem is given by\n    $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1^2 & x_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2^2 & x_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3^2 & x_3 & 1 \\\\ x_4^2 & x_4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0^2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1^2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1^2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 2^2 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The columns are linearly independent, as shown by setting a linear combination to zero: $\\alpha_1 [0,1,1,4]^T + \\alpha_2 [0,1,1,2]^T + \\alpha_3 [1,1,1,1]^T = [0,0,0,0]^T$. The first row implies $\\alpha_3=0$. This reduces the system to $\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2=0$ and $4\\alpha_1+2\\alpha_2=0$, which yields $\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=0$. Thus, the columns are linearly independent, the matrix $A^T A$ is invertible, and a unique solution exists.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe model for the sensor's output is the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = a x^{2} + b x + c$. The data points are $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 10)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (1, 8)$, $(x_3, y_3) = (1, 6)$, and $(x_4, y_4) = (2, 3)$.\n\nThe objective is to find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, $S(a, b, c)$. The function $S$ is defined as:\n$$S(a, b, c) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (p(x_i) - y_i)^2$$\nSubstituting the given data and the polynomial model:\n$$S(a, b, c) = (a(0)^2 + b(0) + c - 10)^2 + (a(1)^2 + b(1) + c - 8)^2 + (a(1)^2 + b(1) + c - 6)^2 + (a(2)^2 + b(2) + c - 3)^2$$\n$$S(a, b, c) = (c - 10)^2 + (a + b + c - 8)^2 + (a + b + c - 6)^2 + (4a + 2b + c - 3)^2$$\n\nTo minimize $S(a,b,c)$, we must find the point where its gradient with respect to the coefficients is the zero vector.

The training data consists of $N_{\\text{train}}$ pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where the points $x_i$ are sampled uniformly from $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ and $y_i = f(x_i) = \\sin(x_i)$.\n\nThe discrete least squares problem is to find the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{train}}} (p_d(x_i) - y_i)^2\n$$\nThis can be formulated as a linear algebra problem. Let $\\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_{N_{\\text{train}}}]^T$ be the vector of observed function values. The set of equations $p_d(x_i) = y_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N_{\\text{train}}$ forms an overdetermined linear system $A\\mathbf{c} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$, where $A$ is the $N_{\\text{train}} \\times (d+1)$ Vandermonde matrix:\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \\dots & x_1^d \\\\\n1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \\dots & x_2^d \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & x_{N_{\\text{train}}} & x_{N_{\\text{train}}}^2 & \\dots & x_{N_{\\text{train}}}^d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe least squares problem is then equivalent to finding the vector $\\mathbf{c}$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\|\\mathbf{y} - A\\mathbf{c}\\|_2$.\n\nWhile this minimization problem can be solved formally via the normal equations, $A^TA\\mathbf{c} = A^T\\mathbf{y}$, this approach is numerically unstable. The condition number of the matrix $A^TA$ is the square of that of $A$, and Vandermonde matrices are notoriously ill-conditioned, especially for high degrees $d$. A numerically superior method, which will be employed here, is to use a matrix factorization such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of $A$. Modern numerical libraries provide robust linear least squares solvers based on such methods. We will use `numpy.linalg.lstsq` for this purpose.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Generate $N_{\\text{train}}$ training points $x_i$ uniformly on $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ and compute the corresponding target values $y_i = \\sin(x_i)$.\n2.  Construct the $N_{\\text{train}} \\times (d+1)$ Vandermonde matrix $A$ where $A_{ij} = x_i^j$ for $i=1, \\dots, N_{\\text{train}}$ and $j=0, \\dots, d$.\n3.  Solve the linear least squares system $A\\mathbf{c} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$ for the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n4.  Calculate the in-sample Root Mean Squared Error ($\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{train}}$). The predicted values on the training set are $\\hat{y}_i = p_d(x_i)$.\n    $$\n    \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{train}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_{\\text{train}}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{train}}} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}\n    $$\n5.  Generate $N_{\\text{test}} = 200$ test points $u_k$ uniformly on the extrapolation interval $[u_{\\min}, u_{\\max}]$ and compute the true function values $v_k = \\sin(u_k)$.\n6.  Evaluate the polynomial $p_d(x)$ at the test points to get the predicted values $\\hat{v}_k = p_d(u_k)$.\n7.  Calculate the out-of-sample Root Mean Squared Error ($\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{test}}$):\n    $$\n    \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{test}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_{\\text{test}}}\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{test}}} (\\hat{v}_k - v_k)^2}\n    $$\n8.  Apply the decision rule: if $\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{train}} \\le \\varepsilon_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{test}} \\ge \\varepsilon_{\\text{out}}$, where $\\varepsilon_{\\text{in}} = 10^{-2}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{out}} = 5 \\times 10^{-1}$, the result for the test case is $1$. Otherwise, the result is $0$.\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to all specified test cases to determine the final output. The high-degree polynomial models are expected to fit the single cycle of the sine wave very well, but because polynomials are non-periodic and grow unboundedly as $|x| \\to \\infty$, they will diverge drastically from the periodic sine function on intervals far from the origin, leading to a large $\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{test}}$. The low-degree linear model (case $4$) is not flexible enough to capture the curvature of the sine function, resulting in a poor in-sample fit and failing the first condition of the decision rule.",
