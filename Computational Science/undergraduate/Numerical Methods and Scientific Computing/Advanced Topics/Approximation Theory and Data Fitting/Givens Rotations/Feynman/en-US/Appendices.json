            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded task from the field of numerical linear algebra. All provided data are consistent and sufficient to proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the application of a sequence of Givens rotations to a vector. A Givens rotation is an orthogonal transformation that affects only two components of a vector, rotating them in the plane they define. Given a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, a Givens rotation $G(i, j; c, s)$ is designed to modify the components $x_i$ and $x_j$, where $i$ and $j$ are the indices corresponding to the plane of rotation. All other components of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe transformation is defined by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix acting on the subvector $\\begin{pmatrix} x_i \\\\ x_j \\end{pmatrix}$. The parameters $c$ and $s$ are the cosine and sine of the angle of rotation, respectively, and must satisfy the condition $c^2 + s^2 = 1$, which ensures the orthogonality of the transformation. The updated components, denoted $x_i'$ and $x_j'$, are calculated as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_i' \\\\\nx_j'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc  s \\\\\n-s  c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_i \\\\\nx_j\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix-vector multiplication expands to two scalar equations:\n$$\nx_i' = c \\cdot x_i + s \\cdot x_j \\\\\nx_j' = -s \\cdot x_i + c \\cdot x_j\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a sequence of $k$ such rotations, $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$, must be applied to an initial vector $\\mathbf{x}$. The final vector $\\mathbf{x}_{final}$ is the result of the composite transformation $Q\\mathbf{x}$, where $Q = G_k G_{k-1} \\dots G_1$. The application must be sequential:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{(1)} = G_1 \\mathbf{x}^{(0)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}^{(2)} = G_2 \\mathbf{x}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = G_k \\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ is the initial vector.\n\nThe key constraint is to perform this operation without explicitly constructing the $n \\times n$ matrix $Q$. This is the standard and efficient method for applying Givens rotations, as it avoids the storage and computational cost of forming and multiplying large dense matrices. The algorithm proceeds by iterating through the given sequence of rotations. For each rotation $G_m(i, j; c, s)$, only the $i$-th and $j$-th elements of the vector are updated.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n1. Initialize a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ with the provided starting values.\n2. For each rotation $(i, j, c, s)$ in the given sequence $\\mathcal{G}$:\n   a. Extract the current values of the components $x_i$ and $x_j$ from the vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n   b. Since the calculation of both new values, $x_i'$ and $x_j'$, depends on the original values of $x_i$ and $x_j$, care must be taken to use the original values for both computations. A common way to implement this is to store one of the original values, say $x_i$, in a temporary variable before it is overwritten.\n   c. Calculate the new value $x_i' = c \\cdot x_i + s \\cdot x_j$.\n   d. Calculate the new value $x_j' = -s \\cdot x_i + c \\cdot x_j$ (using the original $x_i$).\n   e. Update the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ by setting its $i$-th component to $x_i'$ and its $j$-th component to $x_j'$.\n3. After all rotations in the sequence have been applied, the resulting vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is the final answer.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each test case provided. The final numerical results for each resulting vector will be rounded to eight decimal places as specified.",
