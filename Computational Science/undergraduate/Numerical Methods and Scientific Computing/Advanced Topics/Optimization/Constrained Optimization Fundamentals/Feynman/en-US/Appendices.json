This exercise demonstrates their power by asking you to solve for the projection of a vector onto the probability simplex—a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics .

            "solution": "We begin from the foundational principles of convex optimization. The objective function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\| x - v \\|^{2}$ is strictly convex because its Hessian is the identity matrix, which is positive definite. The constraints $x_{i} \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = 1$ are affine, hence convex. Therefore, the problem is a convex optimization problem with a strictly convex objective and affine constraints, and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimality.\n\nForm the Lagrangian with a single multiplier $\\nu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for the equality constraint and multipliers $\\lambda_{i} \\ge 0$ for the nonnegativity constraints:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x,\\nu,\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - v_{i})^{2} + \\nu \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} - 1 \\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} x_{i}.\n$$\nThe KKT conditions are:\n- Primal feasibility: $x_{i} \\ge 0$ for all $i$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = 1$.\n- Dual feasibility: $\\lambda_{i} \\ge 0$ for all $i$.\n- Complementary slackness: $\\lambda_{i} x_{i} = 0$ for all $i$.\n- Stationarity: $\\nabla_{x} \\mathcal{L} = 0$, which componentwise yields\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{i}} = x_{i} - v_{i} + \\nu - \\lambda_{i} = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x_{i} = v_{i} - \\nu + \\lambda_{i}.\n$$\n\nUse complementary slackness to eliminate $\\lambda_{i}$. There are two cases for each index $i$:\n- If $x_{i}  0$, then complementary slackness implies $\\lambda_{i} = 0$, hence $x_{i} = v_{i} - \\nu$ and thus $v_{i}  \\nu$.\n- If $x_{i} = 0$, then the stationarity condition gives $\\lambda_{i} = \\nu - v_{i}$, and dual feasibility implies $\\nu - v_{i} \\ge 0$, hence $v_{i} \\le \\nu$.\n\nCombining these, the optimizer has the explicit form\n$$\nx_{i}^{\\star} = \\max(v_{i} - \\nu, 0).\n$$\nLet $\\tau := \\nu$ denote the scalar threshold. Enforcing the equality constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{\\star} = 1$ yields the scalar equation\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\max(v_{i} - \\tau, 0) = 1.\n$$\nEquivalently, if $A = \\{ i : v_{i}  \\tau \\}$ is the active set of indices with $x_{i}^{\\star}  0$, then\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in A} (v_{i} - \\tau) = 1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\tau = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in A} v_{i} - 1}{|A|},\n$$\nwith the consistency conditions $v_{i}  \\tau$ for $i \\in A$ and $v_{j} \\le \\tau$ for $j \\notin A$.\n\nWe now apply this to the given instance with $n = 6$ and\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 \\\\ 0.9 \\\\ 0.7 \\\\ 0.4 \\\\ 0.05 \\\\ -0.2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nSort the entries of $v$ in nonincreasing order to test possible active set sizes $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,6\\}$:\n$$\nv_{(1)} = 1.2, \\quad v_{(2)} = 0.9, \\quad v_{(3)} = 0.7, \\quad v_{(4)} = 0.4, \\quad v_{(5)} = 0.05, \\quad v_{(6)} = -0.2.\n$$\nFor each $k$, define\n$$\n\\tau_{k} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_{(i)} - 1}{k},\n$$\nand check the consistency condition $v_{(k)}  \\tau_{k} \\ge v_{(k+1)}$ (with the convention $v_{(7)} = -\\infty$).\n\nCompute candidates:\n- For $k = 1$: $\\tau_{1} = \\frac{1.2 - 1}{1} = 0.2$. Check $v_{(1)}  \\tau_{1}$ is $1.2  0.2$ (true), but $\\tau_{1} \\ge v_{(2)}$ requires $0.2 \\ge 0.9$ (false).

Check $v_{(2)}  \\tau_{2}$ is $0.9  0.55$ (true), but $\\tau_{2} \\ge v_{(3)}$ requires $0.55 \\ge 0.7$ (false). So $k = 2$ is invalid.\n- For $k = 3$: $\\tau_{3} = \\frac{1.2 + 0.9 + 0.7 - 1}{3} = \\frac{2.8 - 1}{3} = \\frac{1.8}{3} = 0.6$. Check $v_{(3)}  \\tau_{3}$ is $0.7  0.6$ (true), and $\\tau_{3} \\ge v_{(4)}$ is $0.6 \\ge 0.4$ (true). Thus $k = 3$ is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the equality-constraint multiplier (threshold) is $\\tau = \\tau_{3} = 0.6$. This uniquely determines the projection via $x_{i}^{\\star} = \\max(v_{i} - 0.6, 0)$, and the sum of the positive parts is indeed $1$:\n$$\n(1.2 - 0.6) + (0.9 - 0.6) + (0.7 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 1.\n$$\nHence, the required scalar threshold is exactly $0.6$.",

The point $x^{(0)}$ is the unique solution to this system. In an active-set method, when the iterate lies at the intersection of the active constraints, we must check the signs of the Lagrange multipliers to determine if the point is optimal or if a constraint must be dropped.\n\nThe stationarity condition of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system for the subproblem defined by the working set states that the gradient of the objective function must be a linear combination of the gradients of the active constraints.
