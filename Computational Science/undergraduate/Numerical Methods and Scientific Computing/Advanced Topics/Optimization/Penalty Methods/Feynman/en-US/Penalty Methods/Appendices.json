This problem uses a simple quadratic objective function with a single linear constraint, a scenario that is analytically solvable. By deriving the exact solutions for both the constrained problem and the penalized version, you will see precisely how the method works and prove that the approximate solution converges to the true one as the penalty parameter $\\mu$ grows .

The penalty method constructs a penalized objective $F_\\mu(x) = f(x) + \\mu \\, g(x)^2$ for a penalty parameter $\\mu > 0$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are clearly defined within the established mathematical framework of constrained optimization and penalty methods.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the quadratic penalty method for a simple convex optimization problem. We are given an objective function $f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = x^\\top x$ and a single linear equality constraint $g(x) = c^\\top x - 1 = 0$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a fixed nonzero vector. The quadratic penalty method approximates the solution to this constrained problem by solving a sequence of unconstrained problems with the penalized objective function $F_\\mu(x) = f(x) + \\mu \\, g(x)^2 = x^\\top x + \\mu(c^\\top x - 1)^2$ for a penalty parameter $\\mu > 0$.\n\nOur analysis proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nTask A: Derivation of the constrained minimizer $x^\\star$.\nTo find the minimizer of $f(x)$ subject to the constraint $g(x)=0$, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda) = f(x) - \\lambda g(x) = x^\\top x - \\lambda (c^\\top x - 1) $$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for optimality require the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$ to be the zero vector, and the constraint to be satisfied.\n$$ \\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda) = 2x - \\lambda c = 0 $$\n$$ g(x) = c^\\top x - 1 = 0 $$\nFrom the first condition, we express the optimal solution $x^\\star$ in terms of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$ x^\\star = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} c $$\nSubstituting this into the constraint equation allows us to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$ c^\\top \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2} c\\right) - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (c^\\top c) = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|c\\|_2^2 = 1 $$\nSince $c$ is a nonzero vector, $\\|c\\|_2^2 > 0$, and we can solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{2}{\\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nSubstituting the value of $\\lambda$ back into the expression for $x^\\star$, we obtain the constrained minimizer:\n$$ x^\\star = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\|c\\|_2^2} \\right) c = \\frac{c}{\\|c\\|_2^2} = \\frac{c}{c^\\top c} $$\nSince the objective function $f(x)$ is strictly convex and the constraint defines a convex set (a hyperplane), this stationary point is the unique global minimizer.\n\nTask B: Derivation of the unconstrained minimizer $x_\\mu$ and convergence analysis.\nThe penalized objective function is $F_\\mu(x) = x^\\top x + \\mu(c^\\top x - 1)^2$. This is an unconstrained, strictly convex function, so its unique minimizer $x_\\mu$ can be found by setting its gradient to zero.\n$$ \\nabla_x F_\\mu(x) = \\nabla_x (x^\\top x) + \\mu \\nabla_x ((c^\\top x - 1)^2) $$\nUsing the chain rule for the penalty term, where $\\nabla_x(u^2) = 2u \\nabla_x u$, we have:\n$$ \\nabla_x F_\\mu(x) = 2x + \\mu \\cdot 2(c^\\top x - 1) \\cdot c = 0 $$\nDividing by $2$ and rearranging terms gives:\n$$ x_\\mu + \\mu(c^\\top x_\\mu - 1)c = 0 $$\n$$ x_\\mu + \\mu(c^\\top x_\\mu)c - \\mu c = 0 $$\n$$ x_\\mu + \\mu c(c^\\top x_\\mu) = \\mu c $$\nThis can be written as a linear system: $(I + \\mu c c^\\top) x_\\mu = \\mu c$. To solve for $x_\\mu$, we can use the Sherman-Morrison formula for the inverse of $(I + \\mu c c^\\top)$, which yields:\n$$(I + \\mu c c^\\top)^{-1} = I - \\frac{\\mu c c^\\top}{1 + \\mu c^\\top c}$$\nApplying this inverse to find $x_\\mu$:\n$$ x_\\mu = \\left(I - \\frac{\\mu c c^\\top}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2}\\right) (\\mu c) = \\mu c - \\frac{\\mu^2 c (c^\\top c)}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} = \\mu c - \\frac{\\mu^2 \\|c\\|_2^2 c}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nSimplifying the scalar coefficient of $c$:\n$$ \\mu - \\frac{\\mu^2 \\|c\\|_2^2}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} = \\frac{\\mu(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2) - \\mu^2 \\|c\\|_2^2}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nThus, the minimizer of the penalized function is:\n$$ x_\\mu = \\frac{\\mu}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} c $$\nTo demonstrate that $x_\\mu \\to x^\\star$ as $\\mu \\to +\\infty$, we take the limit of the expression for $x_\\mu$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\mu \\to +\\infty} x_\\mu = \\lim_{\\mu \\to +\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} \\right) c $$\nWe can divide the numerator and denominator of the scalar fraction by $\\mu$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\mu \\to +\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{1/\\mu + \\|c\\|_2^2} \\right) c = \\left( \\frac{1}{0 + \\|c\\|_2^2} \\right) c = \\frac{c}{\\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nThis limit is exactly the expression for $x^\\star$, which confirms the convergence $x_\\mu \\to x^\\star$.\n\nTask C: Estimation of decay rates.\nWe now analyze the rates at which the error and constraint violation approach zero.\n\nFirst, we analyze the error in the decision variable, $\\|x_\\mu - x^\\star\\|_2$.\n$$ x_\\mu - x^\\star = \\frac{\\mu}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} c - \\frac{1}{\\|c\\|_2^2} c = \\left( \\frac{\\mu \\|c\\|_2^2 - (1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2^2} \\right) c = \\frac{-1}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2^2} c $$\nTaking the Euclidean norm:\n$$ \\|x_\\mu - x^\\star\\|_2 = \\left\\| \\frac{-c}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2^2} \\right\\|_2 = \\frac{\\|c\\|_2}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2} $$\nFor large $\\mu$, the term $1$ is negligible compared to $\\mu \\|c\\|_2^2$. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior is:\n$$ \\|x_\\mu - x^\\star\\|_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu \\|c\\|_2^3} $$\nThis shows that the error norm decays as $O(\\mu^{-1})$. Specifically, $\\|x_\\mu - x^\\star\\|_2 = O(\\mu^{-1}\\|c\\|_2^{-3})$.\n\nNext, we analyze the constraint violation, $|g(x_\\mu)|$.\n$$ g(x_\\mu) = c^\\top x_\\mu - 1 = c^\\top \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} c\\right) - 1 = \\frac{\\mu (c^\\top c)}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} - 1 $$\n$$ g(x_\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu \\|c\\|_2^2 - (1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} = \\frac{-1}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nTaking the absolute value gives the constraint violation:\n$$ |g(x_\\mu)| = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nFor large $\\mu$, the asymptotic behavior is:\n$$ |g(x_\\mu)| \\approx \\frac{1}{\\mu \\|c\\|_2^2} $$\nThis shows that the constraint violation also decays as $O(\\mu^{-1})$. Specifically, $|g(x_\\mu)| = O(\\mu^{-1}\\|c\\|_2^{-2})$.\n\nSummary of formulas for implementation:\nFor a given $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mu > 0$:\n$1$. Error norm: $\\|x_\\mu - x^\\star\\|_2 = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2)\\|c\\|_2}$\n$2$. Constraint violation: $|g(x_\\mu)| = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mu \\|c\\|_2^2}$\n$3$.

The fundamental principle for minimizing a differentiable function is that its gradient must be zero at the minimum. We begin by expressing the objective function in matrix-vector notation.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{v}(x)$ be a row vector of monomials, $\\mathbf{v}(x) = [1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^n]$. The polynomial can then be written as $p(x) = \\mathbf{v}(x)\\mathbf{a}$.\n\nThe data fitting term, $\\sum_{i=0}^{N} (p(x_i) - y_i)^2$, can be expressed using a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and a data vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Let $\\mathbf{X}$ be an $(N+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix where the $i$-th row is $\\mathbf{v}(x_i)$, i.e., $X_{ik} = x_i^k$ for $i=0, \\ldots, N$ and $k=0, \\ldots, n$. Let $\\mathbf{y} = [y_0, y_1, \\ldots, y_N]^T$. The vector of polynomial evaluations at the data points is $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a}$. The data fitting term is the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $||\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}||_2^2$.\n\nThe penalty term involves the constraints $p(0)=1$ and $p(1)=0$. We evaluate the polynomial at the endpoints:\n$p(0) = \\mathbf{v}(0)\\mathbf{a} = [1, 0, \\ldots, 0]\\mathbf{a}$.\n$p(1) = \\mathbf{v}(1)\\mathbf{a} = [1, 1, \\ldots, 1]\\mathbf{a}$.\nLet us define a constraint matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ of size $2 \\times (n+1)$ and a constraint value vector $\\mathbf{d}$ of size $2 \\times 1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v}(0) \\\\ \\mathbf{v}(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe penalty term $\\mu((p(0)-1)^2 + (p(1)-0)^2)$ can be written as $\\mu ||\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}||_2^2$.\n\nThe full objective function is now in quadratic form:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{a}) = ||\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}||_2^2 + \\mu ||\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}||_2^2.\n$$\nThis can be expanded as:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{a}) = (\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y})^T(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}) + \\mu (\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d})^T(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}).\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we compute the gradient of $J(\\mathbf{a})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{a}$ and set it to the zero vector. We use the standard matrix calculus identity $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}} ||\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{b}||_2^2 = 2\\mathbf{A}^T(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{b})$.\n\nApplying this identity to both terms in $J(\\mathbf{a})$:\n$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} ||\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}||_2^2 = 2\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y})$.\n$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} (\\mu ||\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}||_2^2) = 2\\mu\\mathbf{C}^T(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d})$.\n\nThe gradient of the full objective function is the sum of these two gradients:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} J(\\mathbf{a}) = 2\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}) + 2\\mu\\mathbf{C}^T(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}).\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero to find the optimal $\\mathbf{a}$:\n$$\n2\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}) + 2\\mu\\mathbf{C}^T(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{d}) = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nDividing by $2$ and distributing the terms:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nNow, we group the terms involving the unknown vector $\\mathbf{a}$ on the left side and the known terms on the right side:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})\\mathbf{a} + (\\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{d}.\n$$\nThis gives the final linear system for the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{d}.\n$$\nThis is a linear system of the form $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}$, where the system matrix is $\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C}$ and the right-hand side vector is $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\mu\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{d}$. Both $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C}$ are positive semi-definite, so for $\\mu > 0$ their sum is positive definite, guaranteeing a unique solution.\n\nThe implementation will construct these matrices and solve this system for each test case.\nSpecifically, the matrices are:\n*   $(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})_{kj} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} x_i^{k+j}$ for $k,j=0,\\ldots,n$.\n*   $\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   The right-hand side components are $(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y})_k = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} y_i x_i^k$ and $\\mathbf{C}^T\\mathbf{d} = [1, 0, \\ldots, 0]^T$.",

This final practice introduces a more sophisticated and powerful alternative, the Augmented Lagrangian method, which overcomes this very issue . By implementing both the basic penalty method and the Augmented Lagrangian method to solve the same ill-conditioned problem, you will directly compare their performance and understand why the latter is often a more robust and efficient choice in modern optimization software.",

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem in constrained optimization. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires solving an equality-constrained quadratic program (QP) using two distinct methods: the quadratic penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method. We will analyze each method, derive the necessary equations for implementation, and then present the algorithm.\n\nThe optimization problem is defined as:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\; f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^\\top Q x\n$$\n$$\n\\text{subject to} \\quad c(x) = a^\\top x - b = 0\n$$\nwhere $x = [x_1, x_2]^\\top$, $Q = \\operatorname{diag}(q_1, q_2)$ is a positive definite but ill-conditioned matrix, $a = [1, 1]^\\top$, and $b = 1$.\n\n### The Quadratic Penalty Method\n\nThis method transforms the constrained problem into a sequence of unconstrained problems by adding a penalty term to the objective function that penalizes constraint violations. The penalized objective function for a given penalty parameter $\\rho > 0$ is:\n$$\nP(x; \\rho) = f(x) + \\frac{\\rho}{2} c(x)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} x^\\top Q x + \\frac{\\rho}{2} (a^\\top x - b)^2\n$$\nFor a fixed $\\rho_k$ at outer iteration $k$, we find the minimizer $x_{k+1}$ by solving the unconstrained problem $\\min_x P(x; \\rho_k)$. The first-order optimality condition is $\\nabla_x P(x; \\rho_k) = 0$. The gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla_x P(x; \\rho_k) = \\nabla f(x) + \\rho_k c(x) \\nabla c(x) = Qx + \\rho_k (a^\\top x - b) a\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero yields:\n$$\nQx + \\rho_k (a^\\top x) a - \\rho_k b a = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a linear system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n(Q + \\rho_k a a^\\top) x = \\rho_k b a\n$$\nThe matrix $H_P(\\rho_k) = Q + \\rho_k a a^\\top$ is the Hessian of the penalty function $P(x; \\rho_k)$. Since $Q$ is positive definite and $a a^\\top$ is positive semidefinite, $H_P(\\rho_k)$ is symmetric and positive definite (SPD) for any $\\rho_k > 0$. At each step of the outer loop, we solve this $2 \\times 2$ linear system for $x_{k+1}$. The penalty parameter is then increased, i.e., $\\rho_{k+1} = \\gamma_\\rho \\rho_k$ with $\\gamma_\\rho > 1$, and the process is repeated.\n\nThe method terminates when the constraint violation, $|c(x_{k+1})| = |a^\\top x_{k+1} - b|$, falls below a specified tolerance $\\text{tol}$. A known deficiency of this method is that as $\\rho_k \\to \\infty$ (which is required for $c(x) \\to 0$), the condition number of the Hessian $H_P(\\rho_k)$ grows without bound, leading to a numerically ill-conditioned linear system.\n\n### The Augmented Lagrangian Method\n\nThis method, also known as the method of multipliers, enhances the simple penalty approach by adding an estimate of the Lagrange multiplier to the objective. This typically results in better convergence properties and avoids the need for the penalty parameter to go to infinity. The unconstrained subproblem involves minimizing the augmented Lagrangian:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_A(x, \\lambda; \\mu) = f(x) + \\lambda c(x) + \\frac{\\mu}{2} c(x)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier estimate and $\\mu > 0$ is a penalty parameter. At outer iteration $k$, we use the current estimates $\\lambda_k$ and $\\mu_k$ to find the next iterate $x_{k+1}$ by solving $\\min_x \\mathcal{L}_A(x, \\lambda_k; \\mu_k)$. The first-order optimality condition is $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}_A(x, \\lambda_k; \\mu_k) = 0$:\n$$\n\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}_A = \\nabla f(x) + \\lambda_k \\nabla c(x) + \\mu_k c(x) \\nabla c(x) = Qx + \\lambda_k a + \\mu_k (a^\\top x - b) a\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero and rearranging gives the linear system:\n$$\n(Q + \\mu_k a a^\\top) x = (\\mu_k b - \\lambda_k) a\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix $H_A(\\mu_k) = Q + \\mu_k a a^\\top$ is structurally identical to that of the penalty method and is also SPD. After solving for $x_{k+1}$, the Lagrange multiplier estimate is updated using the rule:\n$$\n\\lambda_{k+1} = \\lambda_k + \\mu_k c(x_{k+1})\n$$\nThe penalty parameter $\\mu_k$ does not need to go to infinity. It only needs to be large enough to make the Hessian of the augmented Lagrangian positive definite in the vicinity of the solution, which is already guaranteed here since $Q$ is positive definite. In practice, $\\mu_k$ is increased if the reduction in constraint violation is not sufficient. We will adopt the rule that if $|c(x_{k+1})| > 0.25 |c(x_k)|$ for $k>0$, we update $\\mu_{k+1} = \\gamma_\\mu \\mu_k$; otherwise, $\\mu_{k+1} = \\mu_k$. This strategy allows the method to converge to a feasible and optimal solution under much milder conditions on the penalty parameter, thus circumventing the severe ill-conditioning inherent in the quadratic penalty method.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\n\nFor both methods, we implement an outer loop that iteratively refines the solution. Each outer iteration involves constructing and solving a $2 \\times 2$ SPD linear system. The loop terminates when the constraint violation $|c(x)|$ is below the tolerance $\\text{tol}$ or a maximum of $100$ iterations is reached.\n\nFor the given problem parameters $a = [1, 1]^\\top$ and $b=1$, the matrices $H_P$ and $H_A$ are:\n$$\nH_P(\\rho_k) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_1 + \\rho_k & \\rho_k \\\\ \\rho_k & q_2 + \\rho_k \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad H_A(\\mu_k) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_1 + \\mu_k & \\mu_k \\\\ \\mu_k & q_2 + \\mu_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe right-hand side vectors are:\n$$\nd_P = \\rho_k b a = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_k \\\\ \\rho_k \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad d_A = (\\mu_k b - \\lambda_k) a = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_k - \\lambda_k \\\\ \\mu_k - \\lambda_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe implementation will process the three specified test cases, reporting the number of iterations ($N$), final constraint violation ($V$), and final objective value ($F$) for both the penalty ($P$) and augmented Lagrangian ($A$) methods.",
