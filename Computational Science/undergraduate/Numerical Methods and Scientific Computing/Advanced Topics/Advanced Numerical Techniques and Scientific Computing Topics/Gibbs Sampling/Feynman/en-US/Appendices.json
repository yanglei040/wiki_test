            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the lag-$k$ autocorrelation for the stationary $x$-subchain generated by a deterministic-scan Gibbs sampler on a bivariate normal distribution.\n\nFirst, we must establish the conditional distributions required for the Gibbs sampler.

Draw a new value for $y$, let's call it $y'_t$, from its conditional distribution given the current value of $x$, which is $x_{t-1}$:\n    $y'_t \\sim p(y | x = x_{t-1})$, i.e., $y'_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\rho x_{t-1}, 1-\\rho^2)$.\n2.

We need to find a relationship between $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$. We can express the sampling steps as stochastic equations. Let $\\epsilon_t$ and $\\delta_t$ be independent standard normal random variables, i.e., $\\epsilon_t, \\delta_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, drawn at iteration $t$.\nFrom step 1:\n$$\ny'_t = \\rho x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\epsilon_t\n$$\nFrom step 2:\n$$\nx_t = \\rho y'_t + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\delta_t\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $y'_t$ into the equation for $x_t$:\n$$\nx_t = \\rho (\\rho x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\epsilon_t) + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\delta_t\n$$\n$$\nx_t = \\rho^2 x_{t-1} + \\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\epsilon_t + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\delta_t\n$$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the $x$-subchain. It is an autoregressive process of order $1$, or AR($1$). Let's define the noise term $u_t = \\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\epsilon_t + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\delta_t$. Since $\\epsilon_t$ and $\\delta_t$ are independent of each other and of $x_{t-1}$, the noise term $u_t$ is independent of $x_{t-1}$. The mean of $u_t$ is $E[u_t] = 0$. The variance of $u_t$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(u_t) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\epsilon_t) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\delta_t)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(u_t) = (\\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2})^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_t) + (1-\\rho^2) \\mathrm{Var}(\\delta_t)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(u_t) = \\rho^2(1-\\rho^2)(1) + (1-\\rho^2)(1) = (1-\\rho^2)(\\rho^2+1) = 1-\\rho^4\n$$\nSo the $x$-subchain follows the AR($1$) process:\n$$\nx_t = \\rho^2 x_{t-1} + u_t, \\quad \\text{where } u_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1-\\rho^4)\n$$\nThe problem considers the stationary $x$-subchain. The stationary marginal distribution for $X$ is $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, thus $\\mathrm{Var}(x_t)=1$ for all $t$ in the stationary regime. We can verify this is consistent with the AR($1$) process: $\\mathrm{Var}(x_t) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\rho^2 x_{t-1} + u_t) = (\\rho^2)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(x_{t-1}) + \\mathrm{Var}(u_t) = \\rho^4 \\mathrm{Var}(x_{t-1}) + 1-\\rho^4$. If $\\mathrm{Var}(x_{t-1})=1$, then $\\mathrm{Var}(x_t) = \\rho^4(1) + 1-\\rho^4 = 1$. This confirms the stationary variance.\n\nWe need to find the lag-$k$ autocorrelation, $\\mathrm{Corr}(x_t, x_{t+k})$. By definition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Corr}(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k})}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(x_t)\\mathrm{Var}(x_{t+k})}}\n$$\nIn the stationary state, $\\mathrm{Var}(x_t) = \\mathrm{Var}(x_{t+k}) = 1$. Therefore, the autocorrelation is equal to the autocovariance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Corr}(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k})\n$$\nWe can find a recurrence relation for the autocovariance. For $k \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, \\rho^2 x_{t+k-1} + u_{t+k})\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of covariance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, \\rho^2 x_{t+k-1}) + \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, u_{t+k})\n$$\nThe noise term $u_{t+k}$ is generated from random variables $\\epsilon_{t+k}$ and $\\delta_{t+k}$ drawn at iteration $t+k$. It is therefore independent of $x_t$, which depends only on noise terms up to iteration $t$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, u_{t+k})=0$.\nThis simplifies the expression to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \\rho^2 \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k-1})\n$$\nThis is a geometric recurrence relation. Let $C(k) = \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+k})$. The relation is $C(k) = \\rho^2 C(k-1)$.\nThe base case for the recurrence is at lag $k=0$:\n$$\nC(0) = \\mathrm{Cov}(x_t, x_t) = \\mathrm{Var}(x_t) = 1\n$$\nSolving the recurrence:\n$$\nC(k) = (\\rho^2)^k C(0) = (\\rho^2)^k \\cdot 1 = \\rho^{2k}\n$$\nThis result is valid for any non-negative integer $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. For $k=0$, it gives $\\rho^0=1$, which is correct as $\\mathrm{Corr}(x_t, x_t)=1$.\n\nThus, the lag-$k$ autocorrelation of the stationary $x$-subchain is $\\rho^{2k}$. Note that if the order of updates within the Gibbs scan were reversed (update $x$ then $y$), the resulting AR($1$) process equation for the component subchain and its autocorrelation would remain identical.",
