Integrating over the domain yields:\n$$ -\\int_{0}^{3h} v(x) \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k(x) \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) dx = \\int_{0}^{3h} v(x) f(x) dx $$\nApplying integration by parts to the left-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{3h} \\frac{dv}{dx} k(x) \\frac{du}{dx} dx - \\left[ v(x) k(x) \\frac{du}{dx} \\right]_{0}^{3h} = \\int_{0}^{3h} v(x) f(x) dx $$\nSince the test function $v(x)$ must satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $v(0) = v(3h) = 0$, the boundary term vanishes. The weak formulation is: find $u \\in H_0^1(0, 3h)$ such that for all $v \\in H_0^1(0, 3h)$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{3h} k(x) \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{dv}{dx} dx = \\int_{0}^{3h} f(x) v(x) dx $$\nThe left-hand side defines the bilinear form $a(u,v)$, from which the stiffness matrix is derived.\n\n**Finite Element Discretization**\nWe use continuous, piecewise-linear basis functions $\\phi_i(x)$ (hat functions) associated with each node $x_i$, such that $\\phi_i(x_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The approximate solution is $u_h(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} U_j \\phi_j(x)$.\nThe derivatives of the basis functions are piecewise constant.

This is equivalent to removing the first and fourth rows and columns from the global matrix $K$ to obtain the reduced system for the interior, unknown degrees of freedom $U_2$ and $U_3$. The reduced stiffness matrix, $K_{red}$, is the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix corresponding to nodes $2$ and $3$:\n$$ K_{red} = \\frac{1}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} k_1+k_2 & -k_2 \\\\ -k_2 & k_1+k_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Computing the Spectral Condition Number**\nThe spectral condition number (in the $2$-norm) of a symmetric positive definite matrix is the ratio of its largest eigenvalue to its smallest eigenvalue: $\\kappa_2(A) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}(A)}{\\lambda_{\\min}(A)}$.\n\nWe find the eigenvalues of $K_{red}$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(K_{red} - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\lambda & -\\frac{k_2}{h} \\\\ -\\frac{k_2}{h} & \\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\lambda\\right)^2 - \\left(-\\frac{k_2}{h}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\lambda\\right)^2 = \\frac{k_2^2}{h^2} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\lambda = \\pm \\frac{k_2}{h} $$\nThis gives two possible values for $\\lambda$:\n1.  $\\lambda_a = \\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} - \\frac{k_2}{h} = \\frac{k_1}{h}$\n2.  $\\lambda_b = \\frac{k_1+k_2}{h} + \\frac{k_2}{h} = \\frac{k_1+2k_2}{h}$\n\nSince $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$, it is clear that $\\lambda_b > \\lambda_a$. Therefore:\n- $\\lambda_{\\min}(K_{red}) = \\frac{k_1}{h}$\n- $\\lambda_{\\max}(K_{red}) = \\frac{k_1+2k_2}{h}$\n\nThe spectral condition number of $K_{red}$ is:\n$$ \\kappa_2(K_{red}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}(K_{red})}{\\lambda_{\\min}(K_{red})} = \\frac{\\frac{k_1+2k_2}{h}}{\\frac{k_1}{h}} $$\n$$ \\kappa_2(K_{red}) = \\frac{k_1+2k_2}{k_1} $$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final answer:\n$$ \\kappa_2(K_{red}) = 1 + \\frac{2k_2}{k_1} $$",

With $\\kappa=2$ and $|T|=1/6$, this is $K_e(i,j) = \\frac{1}{3} (\\nabla \\hat{N}_i \\cdot \\nabla \\hat{N}_j)$.\n-   The matrix of dot products $(\\nabla \\hat{N}_i \\cdot \\nabla \\hat{N}_j)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n-   Thus, $K_e = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1/3 & -1/3 & -1/3 \\\\ -1/3 & 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1/3 & 0 & 1/3 & 0 \\\\ -1/3 & 0 & 0 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n-   Since there is only one element, the global matrix $K$ is equal to $K_e$.\n-   The Frobenius norm is $\\|K\\|_F = \\sqrt{1^2 + 4 \\times (-1/3)^2 + 3 \\times (1/3)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4/9 + 3/9} = \\sqrt{16/9} = 4/3$.\n-   All nodes are Dirichlet nodes, so the set of free nodes $F$ is empty. The error is $0$.\n-   Results: $\\|K\\|_F = 4/3 \\approx 1.3333$, error $= 0.0$.\n\n**Case B: Subdivided Tetrahedron**\n-   The domain is the same reference tetrahedron as in Case A, but it is subdivided into four smaller tetrahedra by an interior node $\\mathbf{x}_4 = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25)$.\n-   There are $N=5$ nodes. Node $4$ is the only free node ($F=\\{4\\}$), while nodes $0, 1, 2, 3$ are Dirichlet nodes ($G=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$).\n-   The global stiffness matrix $K$ is a $5 \\times 5$ matrix, assembled from the contributions of the four elements. The calculation of each of the four element stiffness matrices and their summation into $K$ is performed computationally.\n-   The analytic solution for the PDE is $u^\\star(x,y,z) = x+y+z$. Since $u^\\star$ is a linear function, it is perfectly represented by the piecewise linear finite element basis. Therefore, the FEM solution must be exact, meaning the computed value at the interior node $u_4$ must equal the analytic value $u^\\star(\\mathbf{x}_4)$.\n-   $u^\\star(\\mathbf{x}_4) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75$.\n-   The solution for $u_4$ is obtained from the single equation $K_{44}u_4 = -(K_{40}u_0 + K_{41}u_1 + K_{42}u_2 + K_{43}u_3)$. With $u_0=0, u_1=1, u_2=1, u_3=1$, this is $K_{44}u_4 = -(K_{41}+K_{42}+K_{43})$. Due to the barycentric subdivision and mesh symmetry, one can show that $K_{40} = K_{41} = K_{42} = K_{43}$, and also that the row sum is zero ($K_{40}+K_{41}+K_{42}+K_{43}+K_{44}=0$). These properties lead to $u_4 = 0.75$.\n-   Thus, the error is expected to be $0$ (within floating-point precision). The Frobenius norm $\\|K\\|_F$ is computed numerically.\n\n**Case C: Sliver Tetrahedron**\n-   Nodes: $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_1 = (\\epsilon,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_2 = (0,1,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_3 = (0,0,1)$, with $\\epsilon=10^{-6}$.\n-   The Jacobian is a diagonal matrix $J = \\text{diag}(\\epsilon, 1, 1)$. Its determinant is $\\det(J) = \\epsilon$.\n-   The element volume is $|T| = |\\det(J)|/6 = \\epsilon/6$.\n-   The inverse transpose is $J^{-\\top} = \\text{diag}(1/\\epsilon, 1, 1)$.\n-   The physical gradients are scaled anisotropically. For instance, $\\nabla N_2 = J^{-\\top}(1,0,0)^\\top = (1/\\epsilon, 0, 0)^\\top$.\n-   With $\\kappa=1$, the element stiffness matrix is $K_e = \\frac{\\epsilon}{6} G_e^\\top G_e$, which evaluates to:\n$$ K = K_e = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{6\\epsilon} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} & -\\frac{1}{6\\epsilon} & -\\frac{\\epsilon}{6} & -\\frac{\\epsilon}{6} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{6\\epsilon} & \\frac{1}{6\\epsilon} & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\epsilon}{6} & 0 & \\frac{\\epsilon}{6} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\epsilon}{6} & 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\epsilon}{6} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n-   The squared Frobenius norm is $\\|K\\|_F^2 = \\sum_{i,j} K_{ij}^2 = \\frac{1}{9\\epsilon^2} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2\\epsilon^2}{9} = \\frac{1}{9}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} + 1 + 2\\epsilon^2)$.\n-   For $\\epsilon=10^{-6}$, $\\|K\\|_F = \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{10^{12} + 1 + 2 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 10^6/3$.\n-   As in Case A, all nodes are Dirichlet boundary nodes, so $F$ is empty and the error is $0$.\n-   Results: $\\|K\\|_F \\approx 333333.3333$, error $= 0.0$.",

Assume each $k^{e}$ is symmetric positive semidefinite, and no boundary conditions have yet been applied to $K$.\n\nSuppose that, due to a programming bug, the local-to-global mapping routine consistently swaps the two global indices $p$ and $q$ everywhere they occur in the mesh.

It describes a standard procedure in computational engineering (FEM assembly) and postulates a realistic programming error.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based on the well-established Finite Element Method for solving partial differential equations. The concepts of element matrices, global matrices, and local-to-global mapping are fundamental to FEM. The assumption that element matrices $k^{e}$ are symmetric and positive semidefinite for the given elliptic problem is correct. The resulting global matrix $K$ (before applying boundary conditions) is also symmetric and positive semidefinite. No scientific principles are violated.\n- **Well-Posed**: The effect of the described algorithmic error is deterministic. Given a correct matrix $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, the bug produces a unique, well-defined matrix $K$. The question asks for a description of this relationship, which is a well-posed mathematical problem.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and technical. The description of the bug is unambiguous.\n- **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to determine the structure of the resulting matrix $K$ in relation to $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n- **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, or contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe assembly of the global stiffness matrix $K$ is fundamentally an additive process where entries from local element matrices $k^e$ are added into the appropriate locations in $K$. The location is determined by a local-to-global index mapping function, let's call it $\\text{map}(e, \\alpha)$, which returns the global index for the $\\alpha$-th local degree of freedom of element $e$.\n\nThe entry $(I, J)$ of the correctly assembled global stiffness matrix, $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, is given by the sum of all contributions from element matrices:\n$$ (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{IJ} = \\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} (k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, \\delta_{I, \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\alpha)} \\, \\delta_{J, \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\beta)} $$\nwhere $(k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is the entry of the local stiffness matrix for element $e$, $\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is the correct mapping function, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nSince each $k^e$ is symmetric, i.e., $(k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} = (k^e)_{\\beta\\alpha}$, the resulting matrix $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is also symmetric, i.e., $(K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{IJ} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{JI}$.\n\nThe bug introduces an erroneous mapping function, $\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{bug}}$, which swaps the global indices $p$ and $q$. Let $\\pi$ be the permutation operator that swaps $p$ and $q$ and leaves all other indices unchanged:\n$$ \\pi(i) = \\begin{cases} q & \\text{if } i = p \\\\ p & \\text{if } i = q \\\\ i & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe buggy mapping can be expressed as $\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{bug}}(e, \\alpha) = \\pi(\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\alpha))$.\n\nThe incorrectly assembled matrix, $K$, is therefore constructed as:\n$$ K_{IJ} = \\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} (k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, \\delta_{I, \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{bug}}(e, \\alpha)} \\, \\delta_{J, \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{bug}}(e, \\beta)} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the buggy map:\n$$ K_{IJ} = \\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} (k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, \\delta_{I, \\pi(\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\alpha))} \\, \\delta_{J, \\pi(\\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\beta))} $$\nLet's analyze an arbitrary entry $K_{IJ}$ of the buggy matrix. Let $I' = \\pi^{-1}(I)$ and $J' = \\pi^{-1}(J)$. Since $\\pi$ is its own inverse ($\\pi(\\pi(i)) = i$), we have $\\pi^{-1} = \\pi$. Thus, $I' = \\pi(I)$ and $J' = \\pi(J)$.\nThe Kronecker delta has the property $\\delta_{a, \\pi(b)} = \\delta_{\\pi^{-1}(a), b} = \\delta_{\\pi(a), b}$. Applying this, we get:\n$$ K_{IJ} = \\sum_{e} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} (k^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, \\delta_{\\pi(I), \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\alpha)} \\, \\delta_{\\pi(J), \\text{map}_{\\mathrm{true}}(e, \\beta)} $$\nComparing this to the formula for $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, we see that this is precisely the entry $(\\pi(I), \\pi(J))$ of the true matrix:\n$$ K_{IJ} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(I), \\pi(J)} $$\nThis relationship means that the buggy matrix $K$ is obtained from the true matrix $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ by permuting its rows and columns according to $\\pi$. Specifically, row $i$ of $K$ is row $\\pi(i)$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and column $j$ of $K$ is column $\\pi(j)$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$. For example, row $p$ of $K$ is row $q$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and column $p$ of $K$ is column $q$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n\nIn matrix notation, this operation corresponds to a similarity transformation. Let $P$ be the permutation matrix associated with $\\pi$. A permutation matrix is orthogonal, so $P^{-1} = P^{\\top}$. The transformation is given by:\n$$ K = P^{\\top} K_{\\mathrm{true}} P $$\nor equivalently (since $P$ for a swap is symmetric, $P=P^\\top$):\n$$ K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P $$\nWait, the convention for a similarity transformation that results in $A'_{ij} = A_{\\pi(i)\\pi(j)}$ is $A' = P A P^\\top$, where $P_{ij} = \\delta_{i, \\pi(j)}$. Let's re-verify. Let $K' = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top}$.\n$ (K')_{ij} = \\sum_r \\sum_s P_{ir} (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{rs} (P^{\\top})_{sj} $.\n$P_{ir} = \\delta_{i, \\pi(r)}$, so $r=\\pi^{-1}(i)$.\n$(P^{\\top})_{sj} = P_{js} = \\delta_{j, \\pi(s)}$, so $s=\\pi^{-1}(j)$.\nThen $(K')_{ij} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi^{-1}(i), \\pi^{-1}(j)}$.\nMy initial derivation gave $K_{IJ} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(I), \\pi(J)}$. Let's re-check the definition of the matrix transformation.\nIf we relabel the basis vectors as $e'_i = e_{\\pi(i)}$, the new matrix representation $A'$ is related to the old one $A$ by $A'_{ij} = A_{\\pi(i),\\pi(j)}$. This corresponds to conjugation $A' = P^{-1}AP$ where $(Pe_i) = e_{\\pi(i)}$.\nLet's stick to the concrete formula $K_{IJ} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(I), \\pi(J)}$.\nLet's check the relation $K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top}$ where $P$ is the permutation matrix that swaps rows/columns $p$ and $q$. This matrix acts on a vector $v$ as $(Pv)_i = v_{\\pi(i)}$.\nThen $(P K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{ij} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(i), j}$.\nThen $( (P K_{\\mathrm{true}}) P^{\\top} )_{ij} = \\sum_k (P K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{ik} (P^{\\top})_{kj} = \\sum_k (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(i), k} P_{jk}$. The only non-zero term is when $k=\\pi(j)$, so this is $(K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(i), \\pi(j)}$.\nThis confirms that $K_{ij} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(i), \\pi(j)}$ is equivalent to $K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top}$. Note that for a swap permutation, $P=P^\\top$, so this is also $K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P$.\n\nProperties of this transformation:\n1.  **Symmetry**: If $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is symmetric, then $K_{\\mathrm{true}}^{\\top} = K_{\\mathrm{true}}$. The transformed matrix is $K^{\\top} = (P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top})^{\\top} = (P^{\\top})^{\\top} K_{\\mathrm{true}}^{\\top} P^{\\top} = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top} = K$. Thus, $K$ remains symmetric. This makes sense, as the bug is applied symmetrically to both row and column indices during assembly.\n2.  **Eigenvalues**: $K$ and $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ are related by a similarity transformation, since $P$ is an orthogonal matrix ($P^{\\top} = P^{-1}$). Similarity transformations preserve eigenvalues.\n3.  **Sparsity**: The transformation simply permutes the rows and columns. Row $p$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is moved to row $q$ of $K$, row $q$ to row $p$, and similarly for columns. The set of non-zero entries is permuted, but the overall number and pattern (up to this re-indexing) is identical.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $K$ becomes nonsymmetric because only the rows $p$ and $q$ are permuted while the corresponding columns remain unaltered.**\nThis is incorrect. The local-to-global mapping is used for both the row and column indices of the global matrix entry to which an element contribution is added. A bug in this mapping affects both symmetrically. As derived above, the resulting matrix $K$ is symmetric if $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is symmetric. An operation that only permutes rows would result in $K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, which is not in general symmetric.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $K$ equals $P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top}$, where $P$ is the permutation matrix that swaps indices $p$ and $q$; thus $K$ remains symmetric, its eigenvalues match those of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and the sparsity pattern is identical except that rows and columns $p$ and $q$ are exchanged.**\nThis statement accurately describes the consequences of the bug. The transformation is a similarity transformation $K = P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P^{\\top}$ (or $P K_{\\mathrm{true}} P$ since $P=P^\\top$ for a swap). As established in the derivation, such a transformation preserves symmetry and eigenvalues. The description of the effect on the matrix (\"sparsity pattern is identical except that rows and columns $p$ and $q$ are exchanged\") is a correct qualitative description of this permutation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Only the diagonal entries $K_{pp}$ and $K_{qq}$ are swapped; all off-diagonal entries remain the same as in $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$.**\nThis is incorrect. From the relation $K_{IJ} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(I), \\pi(J)}$, we can check various entries:\n- $K_{pp} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(p), \\pi(p)} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{qq}$. (Diagonal entry swapped)\n- $K_{qq} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(q), \\pi(q)} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{pp}$. (Diagonal entry swapped)\n- For an index $i \\ne p, q$, the entry $K_{pi}$ is given by $K_{pi} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{\\pi(p), \\pi(i)} = (K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{qi}$. This is not, in general, equal to $(K_{\\mathrm{true}})_{pi}$. Thus, off-diagonal entries are also changed. Specifically, the entire row $p$ of $K$ is a permutation of row $q$ of $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and vice versa.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. All entries in row and column $p$ of $K$ become zero, while entries in row and column $q$ are doubled relative to $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$.**\nThis is physically and algorithmically unfounded. The bug does not eliminate or duplicate contributions; it reroutes them. Any contribution that should have gone to an entry involving index $p$ in $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is redirected to an entry involving index $q$ in $K$. Conversely, contributions for index $q$ in $K_{\\mathrm{true}}$ are sent to index $p$ in $K$. No entries become zero or are doubled unless they were already zero or the matrix had a very specific, coincidental structure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
