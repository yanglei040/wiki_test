            "problem": "An analyst is trying to estimate the value of $\\theta = E[(U+1)^2]$, where $U$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$. The standard approach is to use a simple Monte Carlo estimator, where one generates samples of $X = (U+1)^2$ and averages them. The precision of this estimator is determined by the variance of a single sample, $\\text{Var}(X)$.\n\nTo improve the efficiency of the estimation, a control variate technique is proposed. A new estimator is constructed using a related random variable $C = U$, for which the expected value is known. The new estimator for a single sample is given by $X(b) = X - b(C - E[C])$, where $b$ is a real-valued constant coefficient to be optimized.\n\nYour task is to determine the theoretical improvement offered by this technique. First, find the optimal coefficient $b^*$ that minimizes the variance of the new estimator, $\\text{Var}(X(b))$. Then, calculate the variance reduction factor, which is the ratio of the variance of a single optimized control variate sample to the variance of a single simple sample.\n\nExpress this variance reduction factor, $\\frac{\\text{Var}(X(b^*))}{\\text{Var}(X)}$, as an exact fraction.",

Two variance reduction strategies are considered: stratified sampling along the $x$-axis and stratified sampling along the $y$-axis. In both strategies, the axis is divided into $L$ equal-width strata, and a total of $n$ samples are drawn with equal allocation across strata, so each stratum contains $m = n/L$ samples.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to design a two-variable function $f(x,y)$ on $[0,1]^2$ such that stratified sampling is highly effective along the $x$-axis but provides no benefit along the $y$-axis, relative to a plain Monte Carlo (MC) estimator. We will derive the necessary properties of $f(x,y)$ from the fundamental definitions of variance and the estimators, and then construct an explicit function that satisfies these properties.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We wish to estimate $I = \\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)] = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 f(x,y) dx dy$.\n\nThe plain MC estimator based on $n$ independent samples $(X_i, Y_i)$ is $\\hat{I}_{MC} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i, Y_i)$. Its variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{MC}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\text{Var}(f(X,Y))$.\n\nThe variance of any random variable $Z$ can be decomposed using the law of total variance with respect to another random variable $W$: $\\text{Var}(Z) = \\mathbb{E}[\\text{Var}(Z|W)] + \\text{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Z|W])$.\n\nFor stratified sampling, we partition the domain. Let $W$ be a discrete random variable indicating the stratum to which a sample $(X,Y)$ belongs.

Let $W_y$ be the random variable indicating the y-stratum. The condition of no variance reduction means the variance reduction term is zero:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y]) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y=j]$ must be a constant for all strata $j=1, \\dots, L$. The conditional expectation in stratum $j$ is the average value of $f$ over that stratum:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y=j] = \\frac{1}{\\text{Area}(S_{y,j})} \\iint_{S_{y,j}} f(x,y) dx dy = L \\int_{\\frac{j-1}{L}}^{\\frac{j}{L}} \\left( \\int_0^1 f(x,y) dx \\right) dy\n$$\nLet $g(y) = \\int_0^1 f(x,y) dx$. The condition is that $L \\int_{\\frac{j-1}{L}}^{\\frac{j}{L}} g(y) dy$ is constant for all $j$. Since this must hold for any number of strata $L$, it implies that $g(y)$ must be a constant for almost every $y \\in [0,1]$.\n$$\n\\int_0^1 f(x,y) dx = C \\quad (\\text{for some constant } C)\n$$\n\n**Condition 2: High Effectiveness for Stratification Along the x-axis**\n\nFor stratification along the $x$-axis, the strata are $S_{x,j} = [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}] \\times [0,1]$. The variance of the x-stratified estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{E}[\\text{Var}(f(X,Y)|W_x)] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^L P(W_x=j) \\text{Var}(f(X,Y)|W_x=j)\n$$\nWith equal-width strata, $P(W_x=j) = 1/L$. Let $h=1/L$ be the width of a stratum.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x}) = \\frac{1}{nL} \\sum_{j=1}^L \\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f(X,Y))\n$$\nHere, $\\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f(X,Y))$ denotes the variance of $f(X,Y)$ where $X \\sim U[\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}]$ and $Y \\sim U[0,1]$.\nThe problem states that this variance should be smaller than $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{MC})$ by a factor that scales like $1/L^2$. Since $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{MC})$ is a constant with respect to $L$ (for a non-constant $f$), we require $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x}) = O(1/L^2)$.\n\nLet's analyze the within-stratum variance, $\\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f)$, by applying the law of total variance, conditioning on $X$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f(X,Y)) = \\mathbb{E}_{S_{x,j}}[\\text{Var}_Y(f(X,Y)|X)] + \\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(\\mathbb{E}_Y[f(X,Y)|X])\n$$\nThe second term, $\\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(\\mathbb{E}_Y[f(X,Y)|X])$, represents the variance due to the change in the function's $y$-average as $x$ varies within the small stratum. If $\\mathbb{E}_Y[f(x,Y)]$ is a smooth function of $x$, say $G(x)$, then its variance over an interval of width $h=1/L$ is approximately $\\frac{h^2}{12} (G'(x_j))^2$, which scales as $O(1/L^2)$. This term contributes to the desired scaling.\n\nThe first term is $\\mathbb{E}_{S_{x,j}}[\\text{Var}_Y(f(X,Y)|X)] = L \\int_{\\frac{j-1}{L}}^{\\frac{j}{L}} \\text{Var}_Y(f(x,Y)) dx$. Summing over strata and dividing by $nL$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{nL} \\sum_{j=1}^L \\left( L \\int_{\\frac{j-1}{L}}^{\\frac{j}{L}} \\text{Var}_Y(f(x,Y)) dx \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\int_0^1 \\text{Var}_Y(f(x,Y)) dx\n$$\nThis part of the total variance does not depend on $L$. For $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x})$ to have the overall scaling of $O(1/L^2)$, this term must be zero.\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\text{Var}_Y(f(x,Y)) dx = 0\n$$\nSince variance is non-negative, this implies $\\text{Var}_Y(f(x,Y))=0$ for almost every $x \\in [0,1]$. This means that for a fixed $x$, $f(x,y)$ must be constant with respect to $y$. Therefore, $f(x,y)$ must be a function of $x$ only, i.e., $f(x,y) = g(x)$.\n\n**Constructing and Verifying the Function**\n\nThe simplest non-trivial smooth function of $x$ is $g(x)=x$. Let us propose the function:\n$$\nf(x,y) = x\n$$\nWe must verify this function satisfies both conditions from first principles.\n\n**Verification of Condition 1 (y-stratification):**\nWe require no variance reduction. The reduction is $\\frac{1}{n}\\text{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y])$. Let's calculate the conditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y=j] = \\mathbb{E}[X|Y \\in [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}]]\n$$\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the condition on $Y$ does not affect the expectation of $X$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X|Y \\in [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}]] = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_0^1 x dx = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe conditional expectation is $1/2$ for all strata $j$. Since it is a constant, its variance is zero:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y)|W_y]) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, stratification along the $y$-axis provides exactly zero variance reduction. Condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n**Verification of Condition 2 (x-stratification):**\nWe require the variance of the x-stratified estimator to be smaller than the plain MC variance by a factor scaling as $1/L^2$.\nThe variance of the plain MC estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{MC}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\text{Var}(f(X,Y)) = \\frac{1}{n}\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{12n}\n$$\nThe variance of the x-stratified estimator is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x}) = \\frac{1}{nL} \\sum_{j=1}^L \\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f(X,Y))$.\nThe variance within stratum $S_{x,j} = [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}] \\times [0,1]$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}_{S_{x,j}}(f(X,Y)) = \\text{Var}(X | X \\in [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}])\n$$\nThis is the variance of a uniform random variable on an interval of width $h=1/L$. The variance of $U[a,b]$ is $(b-a)^2/12$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(X | X \\in [\\frac{j-1}{L}, \\frac{j}{L}]) = \\frac{1}{12} \\left( \\frac{j}{L} - \\frac{j-1}{L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{12L^2}\n$$\nThis within-stratum variance is constant for all strata $j$. The variance of the stratified estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x}) = \\frac{1}{nL} \\sum_{j=1}^L \\left(\\frac{1}{12L^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{nL} \\cdot L \\cdot \\frac{1}{12L^2} = \\frac{1}{12nL^2}\n$$\nNow, compare the variances:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{S,x})}{\\text{Var}(\\hat{I}_{MC})} = \\frac{1/(12nL^2)}{1/(12n)} = \\frac{1}{L^2}\n$$\nThe variance is reduced by a factor of precisely $1/L^2$, which scales as $1/L^2$. Thus, condition 2 is strictly satisfied.\n\nThe function $f(x,y)=x$ fulfills all the requirements of the problem.",
