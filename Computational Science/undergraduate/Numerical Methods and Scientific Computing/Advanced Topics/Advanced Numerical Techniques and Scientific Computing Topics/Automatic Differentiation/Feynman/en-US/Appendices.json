This practice guides you in creating a `Dual` number class, an elegant structure that bundles a value $v$ with its derivative $v'$. By teaching standard arithmetic operators how to handle these `Dual` numbers, you will see how derivatives can be propagated forward through any calculation automatically. This hands-on implementation demystifies the mechanics of forward mode AD and showcases the power of operator overloading in scientific computing .",

            "problem": "You are asked to implement forward mode automatic differentiation (forward mode AD) using operator overloading in a high-level language. The core idea is to track both the value and the derivative of expressions with respect to a single scalar input by propagating derivatives through elementary operations. You will create a class that represents a pair consisting of a real value and its derivative with respect to an independent variable. You must then use this class to evaluate a specific polynomial and its derivative at a set of inputs. The implementation must not rely on any prebuilt automatic differentiation tools or symbolic manipulation libraries.\n\nImplement a class whose instances represent numbers augmented with derivative information. The class must support standard arithmetic so that when the class is used in a computation, both the value and the derivative are computed automatically. The implementation must support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer exponentiation. Interactions with built-in numeric types must behave naturally on either side of the operator.\n\nUse the class to evaluate the polynomial function\n$$\nf(x) = 3x^{5} - 2x^{3} + 7x - 11\n$$\nand its derivative at several inputs. Your program should compute, for each input $x$, both the function value $f(x)$ and the derivative $f'(x)$ using forward mode automatic differentiation, and also compute the same two quantities using ordinary floating-point evaluation and standard calculus for verification. For each input $x$, compute the absolute errors\n$$\ne_{\\text{val}} = \\lvert f_{\\text{AD}}(x) - f(x) \\rvert, \\quad e_{\\text{der}} = \\lvert f'_{\\text{AD}}(x) - f'(x) \\rvert,\n$$\nwhere $f_{\\text{AD}}(x)$ and $f'_{\\text{AD}}(x)$ denote, respectively, the value and derivative returned by your automatic differentiation evaluation.\n\nAngle units are not involved. No physical units are involved.\n\nTest suite:\n- Evaluate at the following ordered list of inputs $[0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 2.5, 10.0]$. These cover a boundary input $0.0$, simple integer inputs $1.0$ and $-1.0$, a non-integer input $2.5$, and a larger magnitude input $10.0$.\n\nProgram requirements:\n- Define the polynomial $f(x)$ once using arithmetic operators; a single definition must work identically whether $x$ is a built-in real number or an instance of your class.\n- For each test input $x$ in the specified order, create an instance representing the independent variable with derivative $1.0$, evaluate the polynomial to obtain $f_{\\text{AD}}(x)$ and $f'_{\\text{AD}}(x)$, evaluate the same polynomial using ordinary floating-point arithmetic to obtain $f(x)$, evaluate the analytical derivative $f'(x)$ using standard calculus, and compute $e_{\\text{val}}$ and $e_{\\text{der}}$ as defined above.\n- Collect the results in the same order as the inputs.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element must be a two-element list $[e_{\\text{val}}, e_{\\text{der}}]$ for the corresponding input. For example, the printed line should look like\n\"[ [e_val_for_x0, e_der_for_x0], [e_val_for_x1, e_der_for_x1], ... ]\"\nwith no spaces requirement enforced other than those produced by your print, but it must be a single line that encodes a list of lists in the natural language’s list syntax.\n\nYour program must be self-contained and must not read any input from the user or any external file. The results for the provided test suite must be the only content of the printed output line.",
            "solution": "We derive forward mode automatic differentiation (automatic differentiation (AD)) for a single scalar input using well-established differential calculus rules. The foundational base comprises standard differentiation rules: linearity, the product rule, the quotient rule, the chain rule, and the power rule for integer exponents.\n\nWe represent a computation on an independent variable $x$ by associating to each intermediate quantity a pair $\\left(v, d\\right)$, where $v$ is the real value and $d = \\frac{dv}{dx}$ is the derivative with respect to $x$. We now derive how to propagate these pairs through arithmetic operations directly from calculus.\n\nAddition and subtraction:\nSuppose $u = (u, u')$ and $v = (v, v')$ represent two differentiable quantities with respect to $x$. Then\n$$\n(u + v, \\, \\frac{d}{dx}(u+v)) = (u + v, \\, u' + v'),\n$$\nand similarly for subtraction,\n$$\n(u - v, \\, \\frac{d}{dx}(u-v)) = (u - v, \\, u' - v').\n$$\nThese follow from linearity of differentiation.\n\nMultiplication:\nUsing the product rule,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv'.\n$$\nHence, for pairs $(u,u')$ and $(v,v')$, the product becomes\n$$\n(uv, \\, u'v + uv').\n$$\n\nDivision:\nUsing the quotient rule,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^{2}},\n$$\nso the propagated pair is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{u}{v}, \\, \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nprovided $v \\neq 0$.\n\nInteger power:\nFor an integer $n$, by the power rule and chain rule,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(u^{n}\\right) = n u^{n-1} u'.\n$$\nThus the propagated pair is\n$$\n\\left(u^{n}, \\, n u^{n-1} u'\\right).\n$$\nFor a real constant exponent $p$, the same expression $\\left(u^{p}, \\, p u^{p-1} u'\\right)$ holds when $u > 0$, but for this task it suffices to correctly support integer exponents because the target function is a polynomial.\n\nForward mode AD implementation:\nWe encode each quantity as a class instance storing two real numbers $(v,d)$. The class overloads the arithmetic operators so that when it participates in an expression, it applies the above propagation formulas. Interactions with built-in real numbers are handled by treating a real $c$ as the pair $(c, 0)$. The independent variable $x$ is represented as $(x,1)$.\n\nTarget function:\nWe consider the polynomial\n$$\nf(x) = 3x^{5} - 2x^{3} + 7x - 11.\n$$\nBecause $f$ is a polynomial, when it is written once in terms of overloaded arithmetic, it computes both the value and the derivative automatically. For verification, we use its analytical derivative obtained from standard calculus:\n$$\nf'(x) = 15x^{4} - 6x^{2} + 7.\n$$\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n1. Define a class whose instances store $(v,d)$ and implement the overloaded operators $+$, $-$, $\\times$, $\\div$, and exponentiation by an integer as derived above.\n2. Define $f(x)$ once using arithmetic operators. This single definition can be applied to either a built-in real or to an instance of the class.\n3. For each test input $x \\in \\{0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 2.5, 10.0\\}$, create the seeded variable $(x,1)$, evaluate $f$ to obtain $(f_{\\text{AD}}(x), f'_{\\text{AD}}(x))$, evaluate $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ as ordinary floating-point computations, and compute\n$$\ne_{\\text{val}} = \\lvert f_{\\text{AD}}(x) - f(x) \\rvert, \\quad e_{\\text{der}} = \\lvert f'_{\\text{AD}}(x) - f'(x) \\rvert.\n$$\n4. Collect the pair $[e_{\\text{val}}, e_{\\text{der}}]$ for each $x$ in the specified order and print them as a single list on one line.\n\nCorrectness:\nThe propagation rules are directly derived from the linearity of differentiation, the product rule, the quotient rule, and the power rule. Because a polynomial is composed via repeated applications of these elementary operations, the forward mode AD evaluation yields the exact analytical derivative of $f$ at any point $x$ within floating-point rounding. Therefore, the absolute errors $e_{\\text{val}}$ and $e_{\\text{der}}$ are expected to be extremely small, typically near zero up to floating-point roundoff, across all test inputs.\n\nOutput:\nThe program prints a single line representing a list of two-element lists $[e_{\\text{val}}, e_{\\text{der}}]$, one per test case, in the same order as the inputs. No other output is produced.",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The task concerns the application of reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD), a cornerstone algorithm in computational calculus and deep learning, to a differentiable function. The procedure is formalizable and aligns with established principles.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the gradient $\\nabla f(x,y)$ of the function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,y)=\\sin(xy)+\\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$ for $y \\neq 0$, using the principles of reverse-mode AD. This involves a forward pass to construct a computational graph and evaluate the function, followed by a backward pass to propagate gradients.\n\nFirst, we decompose the function into a sequence of elementary operations. This sequence defines the computational graph, or \"tape\". Let the inputs be $v_1 = x$ and $v_2 = y$.\n\n**Forward Pass: Constructing the Computational Graph**\n\nThe evaluation of $f(x,y)$ can be represented by the following minimal set of intermediate variables:\n1.  $v_3 = v_1 \\cdot v_2 = x \\cdot y$\n2.  $v_4 = \\sin(v_3) = \\sin(xy)$\n3.  $v_5 = \\exp(v_1) = \\exp(x)$\n4.  $v_6 = \\frac{v_5}{v_2} = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y}$\n5.  $v_7 = v_4 + v_6 = \\sin(xy) + \\frac{\\exp(x)}{y} = f(x,y)$\n\nThis sequence constitutes the forward pass. The tape records these operations and their dependencies: $(v_3, \\text{mul}, v_1, v_2)$, $(v_4, \\sin, v_3)$, $(v_5, \\exp, v_1)$, $(v_6, \\text{div}, v_5, v_2)$, $(v_7, \\text{add}, v_4, v_6)$.\n\n**Backward Pass: Gradient Computation using the Chain Rule**\n\nThe backward pass computes the partial derivatives of the final output $v_7$ with respect to each intermediate variable $v_i$, which are denoted as adjoints, $\\bar{v}_i = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_i} = \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_i}$. The process begins by initializing the adjoint of the output node to $1$, i.e., $\\bar{v}_7 = \\frac{\\partial v_7}{\\partial v_7} = 1$. All other adjoints are initialized to $0$. We then traverse the graph in reverse topological order.\n\nThe core principle is the chain rule. For an operation $v_k = g(v_i, v_j, \\dots)$, the adjoints of its parents are updated by accumulating the child's adjoint multiplied by the local partial derivative:\n$$ \\bar{v}_i = \\bar{v}_i + \\bar{v}_k \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial v_i} $$\n$$ \\bar{v}_j = \\bar{v}_j + \\bar{v}_k \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial v_j} $$\n... and so on.

Evaluate and aggregate the maximum relative error over each of the following three input sets, designed to cover a typical range, near-zero inputs, and boundary values close to the largest finite derivative that should not overflow in double precision:\n- Case A (general range): $[-123.45,\\,-0.0314159,\\,-10^{-8},\\,10^{-8},\\,0.0314159,\\,123.45]$.\n- Case B (near-zero but finite derivatives): $[1.2345\\times 10^{-120},\\,-4.321\\times 10^{-110},\\,7.89\\times 10^{-130},\\,-9.99\\times 10^{-140},\\,5.0\\times 10^{-150},\\,-8.0\\times 10^{-150}]$.\n- Case C (boundary near overflow of the derivative but still finite): $[1.5\\times 10^{-154},\\,-1.5\\times 10^{-154},\\,2.2\\times 10^{-154},\\,-2.2\\times 10^{-154}]$.\n\nFor each case, compute four aggregated metrics:\n- Maximum relative error for forward mode naive.\n- Maximum relative error for forward mode stabilized.\n- Maximum relative error for reverse mode naive.\n- Maximum relative error for reverse mode stabilized.\n\n6) Final output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing all twelve results, ordered by cases A, B, C, each contributing the four metrics above, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The order is:\n$[\\mathrm{A\\_FwdNaive},\\mathrm{A\\_FwdStab},\\mathrm{A\\_RevNaive},\\mathrm{A\\_RevStab},\\mathrm{B\\_FwdNaive},\\mathrm{B\\_FwdStab},\\mathrm{B\\_RevNaive},\\mathrm{B\\_RevStab},\\mathrm{C\\_FwdNaive},\\mathrm{C\\_FwdStab},\\mathrm{C\\_RevNaive},\\mathrm{C\\_RevStab}]$.\nAs an example of the formatting only, a list like $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5,r_6,r_7,r_8,r_9,r_{10},r_{11},r_{12}]$ is acceptable. Your program must not read input, and must compute and print these twelve values using double precision arithmetic. No physical units are involved. All angles, if any, must be in radians; however, no trigonometric functions are required in this task.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of four different automatic differentiation (AD) rules for the scalar reciprocal function, $y = f(x) = 1/x$. These rules are categorized as \"naive\" and \"stabilized\" for both forward and reverse modes of AD. The objective is to compare their numerical accuracy, particularly for inputs that challenge the limits of double-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n\n### 1. Preliminaries: The Analytical Derivative\n\nThe function under consideration is the reciprocal function:\n$$\ny = f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}\n$$\nThe analytical derivative, which serves as our ground truth for accuracy validation, is obtained by the power rule of differentiation:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x) = \\frac{dy}{dx} = -1 \\cdot x^{-2} = -\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to evaluate how closely the AD methods can approximate this exact derivative, $g_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x)$.\n\n### 2. Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation\n\nForward mode AD is based on the propagation of derivatives forward through a computation graph. We use the dual number representation, where a number $v$ and its derivative $\\dot{v}$ with respect to an independent variable are combined into a single entity $v + \\dot{v}\\varepsilon$, with the property $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$.\n\nLet the input be represented by the dual number $x + \\dot{x}\\varepsilon$. We wish to find the corresponding dual number for the output, $y + \\dot{y}\\varepsilon$.\n$$\ny + \\dot{y}\\varepsilon = f(x + \\dot{x}\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{x + \\dot{x}\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTo separate the primal ($y$) and tangent ($\\dot{y}$) components, we perform an algebraic manipulation analogous to a first-order Taylor expansion:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x + \\dot{x}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{x(1 + \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x}\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{1}{x} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x}\\varepsilon\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the geometric series expansion $(1+u)^{-1} = 1 - u + u^2 - \\dots$ with $u = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x}\\varepsilon$, and leveraging the property $\\varepsilon^2=0$ which truncates the series after the linear term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x}\\varepsilon + \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^2)\\right) = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x^2}\\varepsilon\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the form $y + \\dot{y}\\varepsilon$, we extract the update rules:\n- Primal update: $y = \\frac{1}{x}$\n- Tangent update: $\\dot{y} = -\\frac{\\dot{x}}{x^2}$\n\nFrom this, we derive the two required forward mode rules. To compute the derivative $f'(x)$, we set the seed tangent $\\dot{x}=1$.\n\n**Forward Mode Naive Rule:**\nThe rule is implemented by directly using the input primal value $x$ to compute the tangent.\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\nThis rule requires computing $x^2$ and then performing a division.\n\n**Forward Mode Stabilized Rule:**\nThis rule is formulated to reuse the computed primal output $y = 1/x$. A simple substitution into the tangent update formula yields:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -\\frac{\\dot{x}}{x^2} = -\\dot{x} \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = -\\dot{x} y^2\n$$\nWith $\\dot{x}=1$, the rule becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -y^2\n$$\nThis variant first computes $y=1/x$ and then squares the result, avoiding a re-computation involving the input $x$.\n\n### 3. Reverse Mode Automatic Differentiation\n\nReverse mode AD propagates sensitivities, or adjoints, backward from the output of a computation to its inputs. The adjoint of a variable $v$, denoted $\\bar{v}$, is defined as the partial derivative of a final scalar objective function $L$ with respect to $v$, i.e., $\\bar{v} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v}$.\n\nFor a function $y=f(x)$, the chain rule for adjoints relates the input adjoint $\\bar{x}$ to the output adjoint $\\bar{y}$:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\bar{y} \\frac{dy}{dx}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the local partial derivative of the node. In our case, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -1/x^2$. Substituting this into the adjoint propagation rule gives:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\bar{y} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the derivative of the function $f(x)$ itself, we can conceptualize the objective function as being the function output, $L=y$. In this setting, the seed adjoint is $\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y} = 1$. The resulting input adjoint $\\bar{x}$ is then $\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n**Reverse Mode Naive Rule:**\nThe update is expressed directly in terms of the input primal $x$. With $\\bar{y}=1$:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = -\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\nThis computational rule is identical to the naive forward mode rule.\n\n**Reverse Mode Stabilized Rule:**\nThis rule leverages the primal value $y = 1/x$, which is computed during a mandatory forward pass that precedes the reverse pass in any reverse mode AD system.\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\bar{y} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right) = -\\bar{y} \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = -\\bar{y} y^2\n$$\nWith $\\bar{y}=1$, the rule becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = -y^2\n$$\nThis computational rule is identical to the stabilized forward mode rule. The distinction lies in the conceptual framework of AD, but the floating-point operations performed are the same.\n\n### 4. Verification and Implementation\n\nThe four derived rules are implemented as distinct functions. Their numerical accuracy is evaluated against the analytical derivative $g_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x) = -1/x^2$. The metric for comparison is the relative error for each input value $x$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{rel\\_err}(x) = \\frac{\\lvert g_{\\mathrm{AD}}(x) - g_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x)\\rvert}{\\lvert g_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x)\\rvert}\n$$\nThe test protocol requires aggregating the maximum relative error across the specified sets of inputs for each of the four rules. Any input $x$ that results in a non-finite value for either the AD-computed derivative or the exact derivative is excluded from the error calculation, as is any case where the exact derivative is zero (which does not occur for finite, non-zero $x$). The implementation will use `np.double` to enforce double-precision arithmetic and `np.isfinite` for validity checks.\n\nThe distinction between the \"naive\" and \"stabilized\" implementations lies in the order of floating-point operations.\n- Naive: `g = -1.0 / (x * x)`\n- Stabilized: `y = 1.0 / x`, `g = -y * y`\nAlthough algebraically equivalent, these two sequences of operations can produce different results due to rounding errors, and the magnitude of this difference is what the experiment is designed to measure, a foundational concept in numerical analysis.",
