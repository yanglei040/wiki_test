            "introduction": "Beyond simply proving a root exists, the Intermediate Value Theorem provides the foundation for powerful numerical algorithms that can approximate roots to any desired precision. This problem introduces the bisection method, a classic root-finding algorithm that iteratively applies the IVT to halve the search interval. By performing the first few steps of this method by hand, you will gain a concrete understanding of how this theoretical guarantee is translated into a practical computational procedure. ",

            "problem": "The bisection method is a numerical algorithm for finding roots of a continuous function. It is based on the Intermediate Value Theorem, which guarantees that if a continuous function $f(x)$ has values of opposite sign at the endpoints of an interval $[a, b]$, i.e., $f(a)f(b)  0$, then there must be at least one root of the function within that interval.\n\nThe method proceeds iteratively as follows:\n1.  Start with an initial interval $[a_1, b_1]$ where a root is known to exist.\n2.  For the $n$-th iteration, calculate the midpoint of the current interval $[a_n, b_n]$:\n    $$c_n = \\frac{a_n + b_n}{2}$$\n3.  Evaluate the function at the midpoint, $f(c_n)$.\n4.  Determine the next interval, $[a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}]$, which will be half of the current one.\n    - If $f(a_n)f(c_n)  0$, the root lies in the first half, so the new interval is $[a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}] = [a_n, c_n]$.\n    - If $f(c_n)f(b_n)  0$, the root lies in the second half, so the new interval is $[a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}] = [c_n, b_n]$.\n    - If $f(c_n) = 0$, then $c_n$ is the root, and the process stops.\n\nConsider the equation $x^3 = 10$. This can be restated as finding a root for the function $f(x) = x^3 - 10$. Starting with the initial interval $[a_1, b_1] = [2, 3]$, apply the bisection method to determine the value of the third midpoint, $c_3$.",

This problem explores what happens when the crucial condition of continuity is violated, leading to a \"gap\" in the function's range.
