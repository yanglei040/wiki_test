This exercise delves into the concept of machine epsilon, which quantifies the smallest distinguishable gap between numbers in a floating-point system. By calculating it for a hypothetical, simplified 8-bit system, you will gain tangible insight into why finite precision is the root of round-off error .",

In this system, each number is represented using 1 bit for the sign ($S$), 4 bits for a biased exponent ($E$), and 3 bits for the fraction part of the mantissa ($M$).\n\nThe value of a number is given by the formula:\n$$V = (-1)^S \\times (1.M)_2 \\times 2^{E - \\text{bias}}$$\n\nThe mantissa is normalized, meaning it is of the form $(1.M)_2$, which represents the binary number $1$ followed by the 3-bit fraction $M$. The exponent bias is defined as $\\text{bias} = 2^{k-1} - 1$, where $k$ is the number of bits in the exponent field.\n\nIn any floating-point system, there is a fundamental limitation on precision known as machine epsilon ($\\epsilon_m$). It is defined as the smallest positive number that, when added to 1, results in a value greater than 1 in that system's representation.\n\nCalculate the value of the machine epsilon for this 8-bit floating-point system.

            "introduction": "Beyond the hardware's inherent limitations, errors also arise from the mathematical approximations we use. Many functions in scientific computing are evaluated using truncated infinite series. This practice explores how to manage this \"truncation error\" by determining how many terms of a Maclaurin series are needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy, a crucial skill for developing reliable numerical libraries .",

            "problem": "A programmer is tasked with implementing a high-precision natural logarithm function, `log(y)`, for a specialized computational library. To handle inputs `y` that are very close to 1, the function uses the Maclaurin series expansion for $f(x) = \\ln(1+x)$, where $x = y-1$.

            "problem": "A real quadratic polynomial has the form $ax^{2} + bx + c$ with $a \\neq 0$. In floating-point arithmetic adhering to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard for double precision, a widely used approximation model is $\\mathrm{fl}(z) = z(1+\\delta)$ with $|\\delta| \\leq u$, where $u$ is the unit roundoff. When computing a root that involves subtracting two nearly equal quantities, catastrophic cancellation can dominate the forward error. Starting from the algebraic identities for the exact roots $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$, namely $r_{1}+r_{2} = -b/a$ and $r_{1} r_{2} = c/a$, derive an algebraic rearrangement that yields the root closer to zero while minimizing subtractive cancellation in the regime $b^{2} \\gg 4ac$. Then, using your rearranged expression, evaluate the smaller-magnitude root for the specific coefficients $a = 1$, $b = 10^{8}$, and $c = 1$. Round your final numerical value to ten significant figures. Express your final answer in scientific notation as $a \\times 10^{b}$.",

The other root, $r_2 = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, is stable as it sums two numbers of the same sign.\n\nTo find a stable formula for the smaller root ($r_1$ in this case), we use Vieta's formula for the product of roots: $r_1 r_2 = c/a$. We can compute the stable root $r_2$ first and then find $r_1$ as $r_1 = \\frac{c/a}{r_2}$.\n$$ r_1 = \\frac{c/a}{\\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}} = \\frac{2c}{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} $$\nThis rearranged expression is numerically stable because the denominator involves an addition of two large negative numbers.
