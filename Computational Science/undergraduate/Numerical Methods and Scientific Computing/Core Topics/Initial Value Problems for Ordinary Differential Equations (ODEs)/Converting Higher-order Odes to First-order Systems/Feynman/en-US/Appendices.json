This exercise serves as a crucial conceptual check by presenting a plausible but incorrect method for converting a second-order ODE. By analyzing why this approach fails, you will solidify your understanding of what constitutes a valid, \"closed\" state-space system—the essential starting point for any numerical solver.",

            "problem": "Consider the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) $$y''(t)=f\\big(y(t)\\big),$$ with initial conditions $$y(t_0)=y_0,\\quad y'(t_0)=w_0,$$ where $f$ is a given sufficiently smooth function and $t$ denotes time. A student proposes to convert this ODE into a first-order state-space system suitable for standard numerical integrators by defining the state vector as $$\\mathbf{v}(t)=\\begin{bmatrix}v_1(t)\\\\ v_2(t)\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}y(t)\\\\ y''(t)\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Using only the core definition that a first-order state-space representation must have the form $$\\mathbf{v}'(t)=\\mathbf{G}\\big(t,\\mathbf{v}(t)\\big),\\quad \\mathbf{v}(t_0)=\\mathbf{v}_0,$$ where the right-hand side depends only on the current time and the current state, select the best explanation for why this proposal is not a valid state-space representation for use with standard first-order ODE solvers.\n\nA. It is not valid because the resulting system is not closed: expressing $v_1'(t)$ and $v_2'(t)$ requires quantities such as $y'(t)$ and $y'''(t)$ that are not functions of $\\big(t,v_1(t),v_2(t)\\big)$ alone, and the standard initial data $y(t_0)$ and $y'(t_0)$ do not directly provide a consistent $\\mathbf{v}(t_0)$ without introducing higher derivatives.\n\nB. It fails only when $f$ is nonlinear; if $f$ is linear, defining $v_1=y$ and $v_2=y''$ always yields a valid first-order state-space system.\n\nC. It is invalid because autonomous equations like $y''=f(y)$ cannot be written in state-space form; a valid state-space form requires explicit time dependence in the right-hand side.\n\nD. It is invalid because numerical integrators for initial value problems require the ODE to remain in second-order form; converting to first order is generally not allowed for implementation reasons.",
            "solution": "To determine why the student's proposal is invalid, we must check if it meets the definition of a first-order state-space system. A valid representation must be \"closed,\" meaning the time derivative of the state vector, $\\mathbf{v}'(t)$, can be expressed as a function $\\mathbf{G}$ that depends only on the time $t$ and the state vector $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ itself, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}'(t) = \\mathbf{G}(t, \\mathbf{v}(t))$.\n\nThe student proposes the state vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1(t) \\\\ v_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y(t) \\\\ y''(t) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe original ODE is $y''(t) = f(y(t))$. We can substitute this into the state vector definition:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} y(t) \\\\ f(y(t)) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1(t) \\\\ f(v_1(t)) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, let's compute the time derivative of the state vector, $\\mathbf{v}'(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}'(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1'(t) \\\\ v_2'(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{d}{dt}y(t) \\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}y''(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y'(t) \\\\ y'''(t) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nLet's analyze each component to see if it can be expressed as a function of only $t$, $v_1(t)$, and $v_2(t)$.\n\n1.  **Analyzing $v_1'(t)$:** The first component is $v_1'(t) = y'(t)$. The quantity $y'(t)$ (the velocity) is not part of the defined state vector $\\mathbf{v}(t) = [y(t), y''(t)]^T$. We cannot express $y'(t)$ as a function of $v_1=y$ and $v_2=y''$ without solving the original ODE, which is what we are trying to do in the first place. The system is not closed because the evolution of $v_1$ depends on a quantity, $y'$, that is external to the defined state.\n\n2.  **Analyzing $v_2'(t)$:** The second component is $v_2'(t) = y'''(t)$. Using the original ODE, $y''=f(y)$, we can find $y'''$ by differentiating with respect to time using the chain rule:\n    $$\n    y'''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}y''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}f(y(t)) = f'(y(t)) \\cdot y'(t)\n    $$\n    This expression also depends on $y'(t)$, which, as established, is not part of the state vector. Therefore, $v_2'(t)$ cannot be written as a function of only $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Initial Conditions:** The standard initial conditions for the second-order ODE are $y(t_0)=y_0$ and $y'(t_0)=w_0$. To start a numerical integration of the proposed system, we would need the initial state vector $\\mathbf{v}(t_0) = [v_1(t_0), v_2(t_0)]^T$. According to the proposal, this would be:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}(t_0) = \\begin{bmatrix} y(t_0) \\\\ y''(t_0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\\\ f(y(t_0)) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\\\ f(y_0) \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n    This initial vector is constructed using only $y_0$. The crucial initial condition $y'(t_0)=w_0$ is completely ignored. Without this information, the unique solution to the original ODE cannot be determined.\n\n**Conclusion:** The proposed state vector fails for two main reasons: it results in an \"open\" system where the state's derivative depends on external quantities, and it fails to incorporate all the necessary initial conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n*   **A:** This option correctly states that the system is not closed because expressing the derivatives $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ requires quantities ($y'$ and $y'''$) that are not functions of the state variables $(v_1, v_2)$. It also correctly notes that the standard initial conditions cannot be consistently used. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n*   **B:** This is incorrect. The failure is structural and does not depend on whether $f$ is linear or nonlinear. For the linear case $y'' = -k y$, the proposed state is $\\mathbf{v} = [y, -ky]^T$. The derivative is $\\mathbf{v}' = [y', -ky']^T$. The dependency on the external quantity $y'$ remains.\n*   **C:** This is incorrect. Autonomous equations are routinely and validly converted to state-space form. The standard method $(x_1=y, x_2=y')$ yields the valid autonomous system $x_1' = x_2, x_2' = f(x_1)$.\n*   **D:** This is incorrect and states the opposite of standard numerical practice. The vast majority of general-purpose ODE solvers are designed for first-order systems, making the conversion of higher-order ODEs a fundamental and necessary step.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is given in Option A.",

Let the state vector be composed of the angle $\\theta$ and its time derivative, the angular velocity $\\omega$.\nWe define the state variables as:\n$$\nz_1(t) = \\theta(t)\n$$\n$$\nz_2(t) = \\omega(t) = \\theta'(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n$$\nOur goal is to find expressions for the time derivatives of these state variables, $z_1'$ and $z_2'$, in terms of $z_1$ and $z_2$ themselves.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $z_1$:\n$$\nz_1' = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta) = \\theta'\n$$\nBy our definition of $z_2$, we have $\\theta' = z_2$. Therefore, the first equation of our system is:\n$$\nz_1' = z_2\n$$\nNext, we compute the derivative of $z_2$:\n$$\nz_2' = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\omega) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta') = \\theta''\n$$\nThe original second-order ODE, $\\theta'' + \\sin(\\theta) = 0$, can be rearranged to solve for $\\theta''$:\n$$\n\\theta'' = -\\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nSubstituting our state variable definitions, $\\theta = z_1$, we get:\n$$\n\\theta'' = -\\sin(z_1)\n$$\nThus, the second equation of our system is:\n$$\nz_2' = -\\sin(z_1)\n$$\nCombining these two first-order equations, we obtain the autonomous system for the state vector $\\mathbf{z}(t) = (\\theta(t), \\omega(t))^T = (z_1(t), z_2(t))^T$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nz_1' = z_2 \\\\\nz_2' = -\\sin(z_1)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIn vector form, if $\\mathbf{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta \\\\ \\omega \\end{pmatrix}$, then $\\mathbf{z}' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}$.

The state space is a cylinder, as the angle $\\theta$ is periodic.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the system with trigonometric embedding**\n\nWe are asked to consider an alternative state representation using the variables $x = \\sin(\\theta)$ and $y = \\cos(\\theta)$. We must determine if a closed, autonomous system for $(x, y)$ can be derived.\n\nLet's find the time derivatives of $x$ and $y$ using the chain rule.\nFor $x(t) = \\sin(\\theta(t))$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\sin(\\theta(t)) = \\frac{d(\\sin(\\theta))}{d\\theta} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\theta'\n$$\nUsing the definitions $y = \\cos(\\theta)$ and $\\omega = \\theta'$, we have:\n$$\nx' = y \\omega\n$$\nFor $y(t) = \\cos(\\theta(t))$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\cos(\\theta(t)) = \\frac{d(\\cos(\\theta))}{d\\theta} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\sin(\\theta) \\cdot \\theta'\n$$\nUsing the definitions $x = \\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\omega = \\theta'$, we have:\n$$\ny' = -x \\omega\n$$\nThe system for $(x, y)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx' = y \\omega \\\\\ny' = -x \\omega\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThese equations for $x'$ and $y'$ depend on a third variable, $\\omega = \\theta'$, which is not expressible solely in terms of $x$ and $y$. For example, $\\omega$ can take any real value, whereas $x$ and $y$ are constrained by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Therefore, a closed two-dimensional autonomous system for $(x, y)$ does not exist.\n\nTo create an autonomous system, we must perform a minimal augmentation by including $\\omega$ as a state variable. The state vector now becomes $(x, y, \\omega)$. We already have equations for $x'$ and $y'$, and we now need an equation for $\\omega'$.\nThe derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n$$\n\\omega' = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta') = \\theta''\n$$\nFrom the original pendulum equation, we know that $\\theta'' = -\\sin(\\theta)$. By our definition, $x = \\sin(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\omega'$ gives:\n$$\n\\omega' = -x\n$$\nThis equation depends only on the state variable $x$, so the system is now closed.

This formulation introduces an algebraic constraint, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, which must hold for all time $t$. Standard numerical integrators (like explicit Euler or Runge-Kutta methods) do not automatically preserve such invariants. Over many time steps, numerical errors can accumulate, causing the solution to drift away from the constraint surface (a cylinder in the $(x, y, \\omega)$ space), leading to a physically meaningless result where $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) \\neq 1$. This formulation is thus a good model for testing and demonstrating the value of geometric integrators or projection methods, which are specifically designed to preserve such geometric or algebraic structures.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the time derivative of the constraint**\n\nWe are given the constraint function $C(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$. We need to compute its total time derivative, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$, along the trajectories of the autonomous system derived in Task 2.\n\nUsing the chain rule for multivariable functions, the total time derivative of $C(x(t), y(t))$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dt}\n$$\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2) = 2x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^2) = 2y\n$$\nNext, we substitute these partial derivatives and the expressions for $x' = y\\omega$ and $y' = -x\\omega$ from our $3$-dimensional system into the equation for $\\frac{dC}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = (2x)(y\\omega) + (2y)(-x\\omega)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = 2xy\\omega - 2xy\\omega\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe result that $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$ confirms that $C(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ is a constant of motion, or an invariant, for the system. This is expected, as $x^2 + y^2 = \\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta)$, which must always equal $1$. The dynamics are thus confined to the surface of a cylinder defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ in the state space of $(x, y, \\omega)$.\nThe final answer is the exact simplified expression for $\\frac{d}{dt} C(x,y)$, which is $0$.",
