            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a fixed-point iteration scheme for the second-order Adams-Moulton method and the analysis of its convergence for a specific ordinary differential equation (ODE). The starting point is the fundamental integral identity for the solution $y(t)$ of the ODE $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_{n}) + \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) \\, dt$$\nHere, $t_n$ and $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ are two consecutive time points, with step size $h$.\n\nThe corrector method is the second-order Adams-Moulton method, which is obtained by approximating the integral using the trapezoidal rule. The trapezoidal rule for the integral of a function $\\phi(t)$ over $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$ is given by $\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\phi(t) \\, dt \\approx \\frac{h}{2}[\\phi(t_n) + \\phi(t_{n+1})]$. Applying this rule to the function $f(t, y(t))$ yields:\n$$\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) \\, dt \\approx \\frac{h}{2} [f(t_n, y(t_n)) + f(t_{n+1}, y(t_{n+1}))]$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the integral identity and replacing the exact solutions $y(t_n)$ with their numerical approximations $y_n$, we obtain the implicit formula for $y_{n+1}$:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} [f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})]$$\nThis is the second-order Adams-Moulton method, also known as the implicit trapezoidal rule. The equation is implicit because the unknown quantity $y_{n+1}$ appears on both sides.\n\nTo solve this implicit equation for $y_{n+1}$, a fixed-point iteration is used, as stated in the problem. The iteration is of the form $y_{n+1}^{(k+1)} = g(y_{n+1}^{(k)})$, where $k$ is the iteration index. By inspection of the implicit equation, the fixed-point map $g$ is defined by the right-hand side. Let us use a generic variable $z$ to represent the argument of $g$ to avoid confusion. The map $g$ is:\n$$g(z) = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} [f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, z)]$$\nThe fixed-point iteration is then $y_{n+1}^{(k+1)} = g(y_{n+1}^{(k)})$.\n\nFor the fixed-point iteration to be guaranteed to converge to a unique solution, the map $g$ must be a contraction mapping on the domain of interest. According to the Contraction Mapping Theorem (or Banach Fixed-Point Theorem), this is true if the Lipschitz constant $L$ of $g$ is strictly less than $1$. For a continuously differentiable map $g$, the Lipschitz constant $L$ with respect to its variable $z$ can be taken as the supremum of the absolute value of its derivative:\n$$L = \\sup_{z} \\left| \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} \\right|$$\nWe compute the derivative of $g(z)$ with respect to $z$. The terms $y_n$ and $f(t_n, y_n)$ are constants with respect to $z$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( y_n + \\frac{h}{2} f(t_n, y_n) + \\frac{h}{2} f(t_{n+1}, z) \\right) = \\frac{h}{2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(t_{n+1}, z)$$\nNote that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$ is shorthand for the partial derivative of $f(t, y)$ with respect to its second argument $y$, evaluated at $(t_{n+1}, z)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the function $f(t, y) = 10y + \\sin(t)$. Its partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(t, y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (10y + \\sin(t)) = 10$$\nThis partial derivative is a constant, independent of both $t$ and $y$. Therefore, its value at $(t_{n+1}, z)$ is also $10$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the derivative of $g$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{h}{2} \\times 10 = 5h$$\nThe Lipschitz constant $L$ is the supremum of the absolute value of this derivative. Since $5h$ is a constant, we have:\n$$L = |5h|$$\nThe problem provides the step size $h = 0.3$. We can now calculate the numerical value of $L$:\n$$L = |5 \\times 0.3| = |1.5| = 1.5$$\nThe condition for guaranteed convergence of the fixed-point iteration is $L  1$. In this case, $L = 1.5$, which is greater than $1$. Therefore, the map $g$ is not a contraction, and the simple fixed-point iteration is not guaranteed to converge. It is expected to diverge unless the initial guess $y_{n+1}^{(0)}$ happens to be the exact solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the Lipschitz constant $L$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$L = 1.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $1.500$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it presents a well-defined, scientifically-grounded task in numerical analysis. It asks for the implementation of a second-order Adams-Moulton method with adaptive step-size control to solve a set of initial value problems (IVPs). All necessary functions, parameters, and algorithmic components are specified, forming a complete and non-contradictory problem statement.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a numerical approximation to the solution of a scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ with a given initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$. The exact solution satisfies the integral equation\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) \\, dt\n$$\nThe method specified is a predictor-corrector scheme that approximates this integral.\n\n**1. Predictor-Corrector Framework**\n\nThe algorithm is a PECE (Predict-Evaluate-Correct-Evaluate) scheme. For each step from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$, where $h$ is the step size, the procedure is as follows:\n\n- **Predictor (P):** An explicit method is used to generate a first estimate, $y_{n+1}^p$, of the solution at $t_{n+1}$. The problem specifies the Forward Euler method:\n  $$\n  y_{n+1}^{p} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)\n  $$\n  The local truncation error of this predictor is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.\n\n- **Corrector (C):** An implicit method is used to refine the prediction. The problem specifies the second-order Adams-Moulton (AM2) method, which is equivalent to the trapezoidal rule for quadrature:\n  $$\n  y_{n+1}^{c} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} \\left( f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}^{c}) \\right)\n  $$\n  This equation is implicit because the unknown $y_{n+1}^{c}$ appears on both sides. The local truncation error of this corrector is $\\mathcal{O}(h^3)$.\n\n**2. Solving the Implicit Corrector Equation**\n\nTo find $y_{n+1}^{c}$, we must solve the nonlinear algebraic equation. This is achieved using a one-dimensional Newton's method. We define a residual function $G(y)$ whose root is the desired solution $y_{n+1}^{c}$:\n$$\nG(y) = y - y_n - \\frac{h}{2} \\left( f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y) \\right) = 0\n$$\nNewton's method generates a sequence of approximations $y^{(k)}$ starting from an initial guess, which is naturally the predictor value, $y^{(0)} = y_{n+1}^p$. The iterative update rule is:\n$$\ny^{(k+1)} = y^{(k)} - \\frac{G(y^{(k)})}{G'(y^{(k)})}\n$$\nThe derivative of $G(y)$ with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\nG'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left[ y - y_n - \\frac{h}{2} \\left( f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y) \\right) \\right] = 1 - \\frac{h}{2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(t_{n+1}, y)\n$$\nThe problem provides the analytical partial derivative $\\partial f/\\partial y$ for each test case, simplifying the implementation. The Newton iteration proceeds for a fixed maximum number of steps or until the change $|y^{(k+1)} - y^{(k)}|$ falls below a small tolerance. If convergence is not achieved, the step is considered to have failed.\n\n**3. Adaptive Step-Size Control**\n\nA key feature of the algorithm is its ability to adjust the step-size $h$ to maintain the local error below a specified tolerance, $\\mathrm{tol}$.\n\n- **Local Error Estimation:** The difference between the predictor and corrector values serves as a proxy for the local error. The error estimate $e_n$ for the step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ is:\n  $$\n  e_n = \\left| y_{n+1}^{p} - y_{n+1}^{c} \\right|\n  $$\n  Since the predictor's local error is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ and the corrector's is $\\mathcal{O}(h^3)$, their difference is dominated by the lower-order term, so $e_n = \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.\n\n- **Step Acceptance/Rejection:** After computing $y_{n+1}^c$ and $e_n$, the step is accepted if $e_n \\le \\mathrm{tol}$. If accepted, the state is updated: $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ and $y_{n+1} = y_{n+1}^c$. If $e_n  \\mathrm{tol}$ or if the Newton's method failed to converge, the step is rejected, and the state $(t_n, y_n)$ is retained.\n\n- **Step-Size Update:** A new step size, $h_{\\text{new}}$, is computed after every attempted step (whether accepted or rejected). The goal is to choose a step size for which the error would be approximately equal to $\\mathrm{tol}$. Since $e_n \\approx C h^2$ for some constant $C$, the ideal step size $h_{\\text{opt}}$ would satisfy $\\mathrm{tol} \\approx C h_{\\text{opt}}^2$. This implies $h_{\\text{opt}} \\approx h \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tol}/e_n}$. The problem provides a more robust and practical formula, including a safety factor $s$, growth/shrink limits $g_{\\min}$ and $g_{\\max}$, and absolute bounds $h_{\\min}$ and $h_{\\max}$:\n  $$\n  h_{\\text{new}} = \\min\\left(h_{\\max}, \\max\\left(h_{\\min}, h \\cdot \\min\\left(g_{\\max}, \\max\\left(g_{\\min}, s \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{tol}}{e_n + \\epsilon}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right)\n  $$\n  Here, $\\alpha = 1/2$ is chosen to match the error order $e_n = \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. The small constant $\\epsilon  0$ prevents division by zero if $e_n=0$.\n\n**4. Overall Algorithm**\n\nThe complete algorithm to integrate from $t_0$ to $T$ is:\n\n$1$. Initialize $t \\leftarrow t_0$, $y \\leftarrow y_0$, and $h \\leftarrow h_0$.\n$2$. Begin a loop that continues as long as $t  T$.\n$3$. At the start of each step, if $t+h  T$, set $h = T-t$ to ensure the final step lands exactly on $T$.\n$4$. Calculate the predictor $y_{n+1}^p = y + h f(t, y)$.\n$5$. Use Newton's method to solve for the corrector $y_{n+1}^c$, starting with $y_{n+1}^p$.\n$6$. If Newton's method fails:\n    a. The step is rejected.\n    b. The step size is aggressively reduced, for instance, $h \\leftarrow \\max(h_{\\min}, h \\cdot g_{\\min})$.\n    c. Go back to step $3$ to retry the step with the smaller $h$.\n$7$. If Newton's method converges:\n    a. Compute the error estimate $e_n = |y_{n+1}^p - y_{n+1}^c|$.\n    b. Calculate the proposed new step size $h_{\\text{new}}$ using the full-control formula.\n    c. If $e_n \\le \\mathrm{tol}$:\n        i. The step is accepted. Update state: $t \\leftarrow t+h$, $y \\leftarrow y_{n+1}^c$.\n        ii. Update the step size for the next attempt: $h \\leftarrow h_{\\text{new}}$.\n    d. If $e_n  \\mathrm{tol}$:\n        i. The step is rejected. The state $(t, y)$ is not changed.\n        ii. Update the step size for the next attempt: $h \\leftarrow h_{\\text{new}}$.\n        iii.
