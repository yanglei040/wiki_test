Do not assume any formula for the method is given; derive and implement it based on these fundamental principles. All trigonometric functions must use radians.\n\nThe IVP is defined by the differential equation $y^{\\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t))$ with an initial condition $y(t_{0})=y_{0}$, where $y(t)$ may be scalar or vector-valued.

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. The following is a complete, reasoned solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and implementation of the implicit midpoint rule for solving initial value problems (IVPs), followed by a numerical verification of its convergence order. The implementation must solve the implicit equation at each time step using Newton's method with a numerically approximated Jacobian.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Implicit Midpoint Rule**\n\nAn initial value problem is defined by a first-order ordinary differential equation and an initial condition:\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t) = f(t, y(t)), \\quad y(t_0) = y_0\n$$\nIntegrating the differential equation over a single time step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ yields the exact relation:\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(\\tau, y(\\tau)) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nThe implicit midpoint rule is derived by approximating the integral using the one-point rectangular quadrature rule evaluated at the midpoint of the interval, $t_{n+1/2} = t_n + h/2$. This approximation is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(\\tau, y(\\tau)) \\, d\\tau \\approx h \\cdot f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral form gives a one-step formula relating the numerical approximations $y_n \\approx y(t_n)$ and $y_{n+1} \\approx y(t_{n+1})$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\approx y_n + h \\cdot f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis formula is not yet computable because the value $y(t_n + h/2)$ is unknown. To form a practical scheme, we approximate this midpoint value using a centered average of the values at the beginning and end of the step, which is a second-order accurate approximation:\n$$\ny\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{y(t_n) + y(t_{n+1})}{2} \\approx \\frac{y_n + y_{n+1}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the scheme results in the **implicit midpoint rule**:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, \\frac{y_n + y_{n+1}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is implicit because the unknown value $y_{n+1}$ appears on both sides. For a general nonlinear function $f$, this represents a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that must be solved for $y_{n+1}$ at each time step.\n\n**2. Solving the Implicit Equation with Newton's Method**\n\nTo find $y_{n+1}$ at each step, we must solve a root-finding problem. Let $z$ be a candidate for the solution $y_{n+1}$. We define a residual function $G(z)$ whose root is the desired value:\n$$\nG(z) = z - y_n - h f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, \\frac{y_n + z}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis nonlinear equation (or system of equations for vector-valued $y$) is solved iteratively using Newton's method. Starting with an initial guess $z^{(0)}$, successive approximations $z^{(k)}$ are generated by the formula:\n$$\nz^{(k+1)} = z^{(k)} - [J_G(z^{(k)})]^{-1} G(z^{(k)})\n$$\nwhere $J_G(z^{(k)})$ is the Jacobian matrix of $G$ with respect to $z$, evaluated at the current iterate $z^{(k)}$. The problem specifies an explicit Euler step as the initial guess: $z^{(0)} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)$.\n\nThe analytical Jacobian of $G(z)$ is found by differentiation with respect to $z$:\n$$\nJ_G(z) = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z} = I - h \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, \\frac{y_n + z}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix. Applying the chain rule, and letting $f_y$ denote the Jacobian of $f$ with respect to its second argument (the state $y$), we have:\n$$\nJ_G(z) = I - \\frac{h}{2} f_y\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, \\frac{y_n + z}{2}\\right)\n$$\nAs required, this Jacobian is approximated numerically. For a vector function $G(z)$ of dimension $d$, the $j$-th column of the Jacobian matrix $J_G$ is approximated using a forward finite difference:\n$$\n(J_G)_{:,j} \\approx \\frac{G(z + \\epsilon e_j) - G(z)}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, d\n$$\nwhere $e_j$ is the $j$-th standard basis vector and $\\epsilon$ is a small perturbation (e.g., $\\epsilon \\approx 10^{-8}$). For a scalar problem ($d=1$), this simplifies to $G'(z) \\approx (G(z+\\epsilon) - G(z))/\\epsilon$.\n\nThe iteration at each time step proceeds until the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|G(z^{(k)})\\|$, falls below a specified tolerance of $10^{-12}$, or until a maximum of $20$ iterations is reached.\n\n**3. Verification of Convergence Order**\n\nFor a numerical method of order $p$, the global error $E(h)$ at a fixed final time $T$, defined as $E(h) = \\|y_{\\text{numerical}}(T) - y_{\\text{exact}}(T)\\|$, behaves as $E(h) \\approx C h^p$ for a constant $C$ and sufficiently small step size $h$. The error norm is the absolute value for scalar problems and the Euclidean norm for vector problems.\n\nGiven two simulations with step sizes $h_1$ and $h_2 = h_1/2$, the corresponding errors are $E(h_1) \\approx C h_1^p$ and $E(h_2) \\approx C (h_1/2)^p$. The ratio of these errors is:\n$$\n\\frac{E(h_1)}{E(h_2)} \\approx \\frac{C h_1^p}{C (h_1/2)^p} = 2^p\n$$\nSolving for $p$ gives the observed order of convergence:\n$$\np \\approx \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E(h_1)}{E(h_2)}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies using three step sizes $(h_1, h_2, h_3)$ where $h_2=h_1/2$ and $h_3=h_2/2$. This allows for two independent estimates of the order, $p_{12}$ and $p_{23}$:\n$$\np_{12} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E(h_{1})}{E(h_{2})}\\right), \\quad p_{23} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E(h_{2})}{E(h_{3})}\\right)\n$$\nThe final reported estimate is the average of these two values, $\\hat{p} = (p_{12} + p_{23}) / 2$. The implicit midpoint rule is a symmetric one-step method, and its theoretical order of convergence is $p=2$. The computed values of $\\hat{p}$ are therefore expected to be close to $2$.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a general-purpose ODE solver for the implicit midpoint rule, which calls a Newton solver at each step. This framework is then applied to the three specified test cases to compute and report the respective average observed orders of convergence.",

Denote the sub-diagonal by $a_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$, the diagonal by $d_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$, and the super-diagonal by $c_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\n- Derive and implement a single-step Backward Euler method (Backward Euler method (BE)) for the IVP $y'(t)=A y(t)$ without performing a dense inversion. At each time step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + h$, set up and solve the linear system for $y^{n+1}$ using a tridiagonal solver based on Gaussian elimination specialized for tridiagonal matrices (often called the Thomas algorithm), which operates in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory.\n- Validate the tridiagonal solver by comparing its results to those obtained via a dense linear solver for the same linear system at each step, and report the maximum absolute difference.\n\nUse the following test suite. For each case, perform the specified operations and record a single floating-point number equal to the infinity-norm (maximum absolute value) of the difference between the solution computed by the tridiagonal solver and the solution computed by a dense solver. No physical units apply in this problem.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (happy path, small $n$): Let $n=5$. Define $A$ by $d_i=-2$ for $i=1,\\dots,5$, $a_i=1$ for $i=1,\\dots,4$, and $c_i=1$ for $i=1,\\dots,4$. Use time step $h=0.05$. Take initial condition $y^0 = [1,0,0,0,0]^T$. Perform a single Backward Euler step and record the infinity-norm of the difference between the tridiagonal solution and the dense solution.\n- Case $2$ (diagonal-only, boundary condition coverage): Let $n=10$. Define $A$ diagonal by $d_i=-i$ for $i=1,\\dots,10$, and $a_i=0$, $c_i=0$. Use $h=0.2$. Take $y^0=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]^T$. Perform a single Backward Euler step and record the difference.\n- Case $3$ (larger dimension, strong diagonal dominance): Let $n=50$. Define $A$ by $d_i=-5$ for $i=1,\\dots,50$, $a_i=-2$ for $i=1,\\dots,49$, $c_i=-1$ for $i=1,\\dots,49$. Use $h=0.1$. Take $y^0$ with components $y^0_j = j/50$ for $j=0,\\dots,49$. Perform a single Backward Euler step and record the difference.\n- Case $4$ (edge case $h=0$): Let $n=8$. Define $A$ by $d_i=-3$ for $i=1,\\dots,8$, $a_i=1$ for $i=1,\\dots,7$, $c_i=1$ for $i=1,\\dots,7$. Use $h=0$. Take $y^0$ with components $y^0_j = j$ for $j=0,\\dots,7$. Perform a single Backward Euler step and record the difference.\n- Case $5$ (multiple steps, cumulative stability): Let $n=20$. Define $A$ by $d_i=-1.6$ for $i=1,\\dots,20$, $a_i=0.8$ for $i=1,\\dots,19$, $c_i=0.9$ for $i=1,\\dots,19$. Use $h=0.05$. Take $y^0=[1,1,\\dots,1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{20}$. Perform $100$ uniform Backward Euler steps to reach $t=5.0$, and record the difference between the tridiagonal-based result and the dense-based result.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5]$), where each $r_i$ is the floating-point difference specified for Case $i$.\n\nThe implementation must avoid any full matrix inversion and must use an algorithm that exploits the tridiagonal structure to achieve linear-time complexity per solve. All computations are in pure mathematics with no physical units. Angles are not involved. Percentages are not involved; any fraction should be represented as a decimal number. The program must be self-contained, require no input, and adhere to the specified execution environment.",
            "solution": "An Initial Value Problem (IVP) for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is defined by the differential equation $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ for $t \\ge t_0$, along with an initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$. The problem under consideration is a linear, time-invariant system of the form:\n$$\ny'(t) = A y(t), \\quad y(0) = y^0\n$$\nwhere $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a constant, tridiagonal matrix.\n\nTo solve this IVP numerically, we employ a time-stepping method. The problem specifies the use of the Backward Euler (BE) method, which is an implicit method known for its strong stability properties (A-stability). We discretize the time domain with a uniform time step $h$, such that $t^k = k h$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The solution at each time step is denoted by $y^k \\approx y(t^k)$.\n\nThe Backward Euler method approximates the derivative at the next time step, $t^{n+1}$, using a backward difference formula:\n$$\ny'(t^{n+1}) \\approx \\frac{y^{n+1} - y^n}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the ODE evaluated at $t=t^{n+1}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{y^{n+1} - y^n}{h} = A y^{n+1}\n$$\nThis equation is implicit because the unknown, $y^{n+1}$, appears on both sides. To solve for $y^{n+1}$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\ny^{n+1} - h A y^{n+1} = y^n\n$$\nFactoring out $y^{n+1}$ yields a linear system of equations:\n$$\n(I - hA) y^{n+1} = y^n\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. At each time step, we must solve this linear system for the unknown vector $y^{n+1}$, given the known vector $y^n$ from the previous step.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is tridiagonal. Let its diagonals be represented by the vectors $d$ (main diagonal, length $n$), $a$ (sub-diagonal, length $n-1$), and $c$ (super-diagonal, length $n-1$). Using $1$-based indexing, the non-zero entries of $A$ are $A_{i,i} = d_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$, $A_{i+1,i} = a_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$, and $A_{i,i+1} = c_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\n\nThe matrix of the linear system to be solved, $M = I - hA$, inherits this tridiagonal structure. Its diagonals are:\n- Main diagonal: $\\tilde{d}_i = 1 - h d_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$.\n- Sub-diagonal: $\\tilde{a}_i = -h a_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\n- Super-diagonal: $\\tilde{c}_i = -h c_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\n\nSolving a tridiagonal system can be done much more efficiently than solving a general dense system. A direct inversion of the matrix $M$ would be an $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operation and would destroy the sparse structure, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory. Instead, we use the Thomas algorithm (also known as the Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm or TDMA), which is a specialized form of Gaussian elimination that solves the system in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time using $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory.\n\nThe Thomas algorithm consists of two phases: forward elimination and backward substitution. Consider the system $M x = y^n$, written component-wise using the diagonals of $M$: $\\tilde{a}_i$ (sub), $\\tilde{d}_i$ (main), and $\\tilde{c}_i$ (super).\n$$\n\\tilde{a}_{i-1} x_{i-1} + \\tilde{d}_i x_i + \\tilde{c}_i x_{i+1} = y^n_i \\quad (\\text{with } \\tilde{a}_0=0, \\tilde{c}_n=0)\n$$\n1.  **Forward Elimination**: The algorithm modifies the super-diagonal coefficients and the right-hand side vector. We compute new coefficients $c'_i$ and $y'_{i}$ (using $0$-based indexing for implementation clarity):\n    - For $i=0$:\n      $$\n      c'_0 = \\frac{\\tilde{c}_0}{\\tilde{d}_0}, \\quad y'_0 = \\frac{y^n_0}{\\tilde{d}_0}\n      $$\n    - For $i=1, \\dots, n-2$:\n      $$\n      c'_i = \\frac{\\tilde{c}_i}{\\tilde{d}_i - \\tilde{a}_{i-1} c'_{i-1}}, \\quad y'_i = \\frac{y^n_i - \\tilde{a}_{i-1} y'_{i-1}}{\\tilde{d}_i - \\tilde{a}_{i-1} c'_{i-1}}\n      $$\n    - For $i=n-1$:\n      $$\n      y'_{n-1} = \\frac{y^n_{n-1} - \\tilde{a}_{n-2} y'_{n-2}}{\\tilde{d}_{n-1} - \\tilde{a}_{n-2} c'_{n-2}}\n      $$\n    This transforms the system into an upper bidiagonal form.\n\n2.  **Backward Substitution**: The solution $x = y^{n+1}$ is found by substituting backwards:\n    - For $i=n-1$:\n      $$\n      x_{n-1} = y'_{n-1}\n      $$\n    - For $i=n-2, \\dots, 0$:\n      $$\n      x_i = y'_i - c'_i x_{i+1}\n      $$\n\nFor each test case, we perform one or more steps of the Backward Euler method. We construct the matrix $M=I-hA$ and its diagonals, and the right-hand side vector $y^n$. We then solve for $y^{n+1}$ using both the implemented Thomas algorithm ($y_{\\text{tri}}^{n+1}$) and a general-purpose dense linear solver ($y_{\\text{dense}}^{n+1}$) provided by a standard library for validation. The final result for each case is the infinity-norm of the difference vector, $\\max_i |(y_{\\text{tri}}^{n+1})_i - (y_{\\text{dense}}^{n+1})_i|$. For the multi-step case, this comparison is performed after the final time step. The matrices in the test cases are chosen such that $I-hA$ is diagonally dominant, ensuring the numerical stability of the Thomas algorithm without pivoting.",
