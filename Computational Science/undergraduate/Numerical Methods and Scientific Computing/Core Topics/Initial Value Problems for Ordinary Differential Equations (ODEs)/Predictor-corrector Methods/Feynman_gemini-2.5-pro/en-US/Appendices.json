We will use the explicit Euler method as a 'predictor' to make an initial guess for the solution at the next step, and then use the implicit Trapezoidal rule as a 'corrector' to refine this guess. This practice  provides a concrete, step-by-step walkthrough of the predict-evaluate-correct cycle that is central to this family of numerical techniques.",
