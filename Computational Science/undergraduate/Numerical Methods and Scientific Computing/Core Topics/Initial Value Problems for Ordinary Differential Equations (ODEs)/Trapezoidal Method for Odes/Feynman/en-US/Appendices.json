            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and analysis of a numerical method for the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $y'(t) = f(y(t))$ where $f(y) = y^2$. The derivation starts from the integral form of the ODE.\n\nThe exact solution over a single time step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ is given by the integral relation:\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_{n}) + \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} y'(t) \\, dt = y(t_{n}) + \\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} y(t)^{2} \\, dt\n$$\nWe are asked to approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule. The trapezoidal rule for an integral $\\int_{a}^{b} g(t) \\, dt$ is given by $\\frac{b-a}{2} (g(a) + g(b))$.\nIn our case, $g(t) = y(t)^2$, $a=t_n$, $b=t_{n+1}$, and the step size is $h = t_{n+1} - t_n$. Applying the rule gives:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{n}}^{t_{n+1}} y(t)^{2} \\, dt \\approx \\frac{h}{2} (y(t_n)^2 + y(t_{n+1})^2)\n$$\nReplacing the exact values $y(t_n)$ and $y(t_{n+1})$ with their numerical approximations, denoted by $y_n$ and $y_{n+1}$ respectively, we obtain the implicit one-step method known as the trapezoidal method for this ODE:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} (y_n^2 + y_{n+1}^2)\n$$\nThis is the implicit algebraic relation linking $y_{n+1}$ and $y_n$.\n\nTo show that this is a quadratic equation in $y_{n+1}$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{h}{2} y_{n+1}^2 - y_{n+1} + \\left(y_n + \\frac{h}{2} y_n^2\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is an equation of the form $Ay_{n+1}^2 + By_{n+1} + C = 0$, with coefficients $A = \\frac{h}{2}$, $B = -1$, and $C = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} y_n^2$. Thus, it is a quadratic equation for the unknown $y_{n+1}$.\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $y_{n+1}$ using the quadratic formula, $y_{n+1} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)\\left(y_n + \\frac{h}{2} y_n^2\\right)}}{2\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 2h(y_n + \\frac{h}{2} y_n^2)}}{h}\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 2hy_n - h^2 y_n^2}}{h}\n$$\nThe problem requires selecting the branch that satisfies the consistency condition $y_{n+1} \\to y_n$ as $h \\to 0$. We analyze the two branches in this limit.\nFor the '+' branch:\n$$\n\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 2hy_n - h^2 y_n^2}}{h}\n$$\nAs $h \\to 0$, the numerator approaches $1 + \\sqrt{1} = 2$, while the denominator approaches $0$. The limit tends to infinity, which is inconsistent.\nFor the '-' branch, we have a $0/0$ indeterminate form. We can use L'Hôpital's rule or a Taylor expansion. Using a Taylor expansion for $\\sqrt{1-x} \\approx 1 - \\frac{x}{2}$ for small $x$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 - 2hy_n - h^2 y_n^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(2hy_n + h^2 y_n^2) = 1 - hy_n - \\frac{1}{2}h^2 y_n^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the '-' branch:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\approx \\frac{1 - (1 - hy_n - \\frac{1}{2}h^2 y_n^2)}{h} = \\frac{hy_n + \\frac{1}{2}h^2 y_n^2}{h} = y_n + \\frac{1}{2}hy_n^2\n$$\nIn the limit as $h \\to 0$, this expression becomes $y_n$. Thus, the correct branch is the one with the minus sign. The explicit formula for the step is:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2hy_n - h^2 y_n^2}}{h}\n$$\nNext, we determine the largest positive step size $h_{\\max}(y_{n})$ for which $y_{n+1}$ is real-valued. This requires the discriminant of the quadratic equation to be non-negative:\n$$\n1 - 2hy_n - h^2 y_n^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $y_n  0$ and we seek $h  0$, we can rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality for $h$:\n$$\ny_n^2 h^2 + 2y_n h - 1 \\le 0\n$$\nThe corresponding quadratic equation $y_n^2 h^2 + 2y_n h - 1 = 0$ has roots given by:\n$$\nh = \\frac{-2y_n \\pm \\sqrt{(2y_n)^2 - 4(y_n^2)(-1)}}{2y_n^2} = \\frac{-2y_n \\pm \\sqrt{8y_n^2}}{2y_n^2} = \\frac{-2y_n \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}y_n}{2y_n^2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}{y_n}\n$$\nSince the coefficient $y_n^2$ of the $h^2$ term is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The inequality $y_n^2 h^2 + 2y_n h - 1 \\le 0$ holds for $h$ values between the two roots. The roots are $h_1 = \\frac{-1-\\sqrt{2}}{y_n}$ and $h_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{y_n}$. Since $h$ must be positive, the valid range is $0  h \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{y_n}$. The largest positive step size is therefore:\n$$\nh_{\\max}(y_n) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{y_n}\n$$\nFinally, we briefly justify the behavior of $h_{\\max}(y_n)$ near the solution's blow-up time. The exact solution to $y' = y^2$ with $y(0)=y_00$ is found by separation of variables: $\\frac{dy}{y^2} = dt \\implies -1/y = t - 1/y_0 \\implies y(t) = \\frac{y_0}{1-ty_0}$. This solution exhibits finite-time blow-up, meaning $y(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t$ approaches the singularity at $t_{blow-up} = 1/y_0$. As the numerical solution approaches this singularity, the value of $y_n$ becomes arbitrarily large. Consequently, $h_{\\max}(y_n) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)/y_n$ tends to $0$. This means the numerical method requires an infinitesimally small step size to proceed as it approaches the singularity, which is a manifestation of the extreme stiffness of the problem near the blow-up time.\n\nThe problem asks for a two-entry row matrix containing the explicit formula for $y_{n+1}$ and the expression for $h_{\\max}(y_n)$.",

            "problem": "Implement a program that constructs and analyzes an implicit one-step method for a scalar initial value problem derived from the fundamental integral form. Consider the initial value problem defined by the ordinary differential equation $y'(t) = -100\\,y(t) + 100\\,t + 101$ with initial condition $y(0) = 1$. Starting from the identity $y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t))\\,dt$ and the fact that numerical quadrature can approximate the integral of a smooth function on a short interval, derive the implicit discrete equation resulting from applying the classical trapezoidal quadrature rule to the integral.

It is a substantive and non-trivial task that requires both derivation and implementation.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivations and Method Analysis\n\nThe solution requires several analytical derivations before implementation. The ODE is of the form $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$, where $f(t, y) = -100y + 100t + 101$.\n\n#### Derivation of the Exact Solution\nThe ODE $y' + 100y = 100t + 101$ is a first-order linear ODE. We solve it using an integrating factor $I(t) = e^{\\int 100 dt} = e^{100t}$. Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$ e^{100t}y' + 100e^{100t}y = (100t + 101)e^{100t} $$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(y(t)e^{100t}) = (100t + 101)e^{100t} $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ y(t)e^{100t} = \\int (100t + 101)e^{100t} dt $$\nThe integral on the right is solved using integration by parts, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$, with $u = 100t+101$ and $dv = e^{100t}dt$. This yields $du = 100dt$ and $v = \\frac{1}{100}e^{100t}$.\n$$ \\int (100t + 101)e^{100t} dt = (100t+101)\\frac{e^{100t}}{100} - \\int \\frac{e^{100t}}{100} (100) dt = (t + 1.01)e^{100t} - \\int e^{100t}dt $$\n$$ = (t + 1.01)e^{100t} - \\frac{1}{100}e^{100t} + C = (t+1)e^{100t} + C $$\nThus, the general solution is:\n$$ y(t) = t + 1 + Ce^{-100t} $$\nApplying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$:\n$$ 1 = 0 + 1 + Ce^0 \\implies C = 0 $$\nThe exact solution is $y_{\\text{exact}}(t) = t + 1$. The value at the final time $T=1$ is $y_{\\text{exact}}(1) = 1+1=2$.\n\n#### Derivation of the Trapezoidal Method\nStarting from the integral form of the ODE over a single step $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$:\n$$ y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) dt $$\nWe approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule, $\\int_a^b g(x)dx \\approx \\frac{b-a}{2}(g(a)+g(b))$. Let $h=t_{n+1}-t_n$, $y_n \\approx y(t_n)$, and $y_{n+1} \\approx y(t_{n+1})$.\n$$ \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) dt \\approx \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y(t_n)) + f(t_{n+1}, y(t_{n+1}))) $$\nSubstituting this into the integral equation gives the implicit trapezoidal method:\n$$ y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})) $$\nThis is an implicit equation because the unknown $y_{n+1}$ appears on both sides.\n\n#### Setup for Inner Solvers\nTo find $y_{n+1}$ at each step, we must solve this equation. Let $w$ be the unknown value for $y_{n+1}$.\n\n**1. Fixed-Point Iteration:**\nThe equation is rearranged to form a fixed-point mapping $w = G(w)$:\n$$ w = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, w)) $$\nThe iteration is $w^{(k+1)} = G(w^{(k)})$, starting with $w^{(0)} = y_n$. The process is repeated until $|w^{(k+1)} - w^{(k)}|  10^{-12}$.\nConvergence is governed by the contraction mapping principle, which requires $|G'(w)|  1$. The derivative is:\n$$ G'(w) = \\frac{d}{dw} \\left( y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, w)) \\right) = \\frac{h}{2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(t_{n+1}, w) $$\nFor the given problem, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -100$. Thus, $G'(w) = -50h$. The iteration converges if $|-50h|  1$, or $h  0.02$.\n*   For $h=0.001$: $|-50(0.001)|=0.05  1$. Converges.\n*   For $h=0.01$: $|-50(0.01)|=0.5  1$. Converges.\n*   For $h=0.02$: $|-50(0.02)|=1$. This is a boundary case where convergence is not guaranteed and will be extremely slow, or may fail. The iteration will not meet the tolerance within $100$ steps.\n*   For $h=0.05$: $|-50(0.05)|=2.5  1$. Diverges.\nTherefore, the fixed-point method is expected to fail for $h=0.02$ and $h=0.05$.\n\n**2. Newton's Method:**\nWe solve for the root of the residual function $F(w) = 0$, where:\n$$ F(w) = w - y_n - \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, w)) = 0 $$\nThe Newton-Raphson iteration is $w^{(k+1)} = w^{(k)} - \\frac{F(w^{(k)})}{F'(w^{(k)})}$, starting with $w^{(0)} = y_n$. The process repeats until the residual is small: $|F(w^{(k)})|  10^{-12}$.\nThe derivative $F'(w)$ is:\n$$ F'(w) = \\frac{d}{dw} \\left( w - y_n - \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, w)) \\right) = 1 - \\frac{h}{2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(t_{n+1}, w) $$\nFor our problem, $F'(w) = 1 - \\frac{h}{2}(-100) = 1 + 50h$.\nSince $f(t,y)$ is linear in $y$, the residual $F(w)$ is a linear function of $w$. Consequently, Newton's method will find the exact root of this linear equation in a single iteration (barring floating-point inaccuracies). Thus, for each time step, the number of Newton iterations is expected to be $1$.\n\n### Step 3: Computational Algorithm\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize a list to store the final results.\n2.  Define the function $f(t,y) = -100y + 100t + 101$ and its partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -100$.\n3.  Define the exact solution $y_{\\text{exact}}(t) = t+1$. The final value is $y_{\\text{exact}}(1)=2$.\n4.  Loop through each step size $h \\in \\{0.001, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05\\}$.\n5.  For each $h$, run two separate simulations from $t=0$ to $t=1$: one using Newton's method as the inner solver, and one using the fixed-point method.\n6.  In each simulation, initialize $t=0$, $y=1$, and the total iteration counter.\n7.  Iterate $N=T/h$ times. In each step, call the respective inner solver (Newton or fixed-point) to find $y_{n+1}$ from $y_n$. Accumulate the number of iterations returned by the solver.\n8.  For the fixed-point simulation, if any step fails to converge in $100$ iterations, set a failure flag. The final iteration count will be $-1$.\n9.  After the loops, calculate the final error for the Newton method result.\n10.

This practice investigates this crucial qualitative feature for the trapezoidal method.

            "problem": "Consider the scalar initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation (ODE)\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y), \\quad y(t_0) = y_0,\n$$\nwith the requirement that the true solution satisfies $y(t) gt; 0$ for all $t \\ge t_0$. Many models, such as population dynamics, impose $y(t) gt; 0$ as a physical constraint. A numerical method is said to preserve positivity if, starting from $y_0 gt; 0$, it produces numerical approximations $y_n$ that remain strictly positive for all steps $n$.\n\nYour task is to investigate whether the trapezoidal method preserves positivity. Start from the fundamental integral form of the initial value problem over a single time step:\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t))\\, dt,\n$$\nand recall that the trapezoidal quadrature approximates an integral over an interval by the average of the integrand at the endpoints times the interval length. Using only this base, derive the trapezoidal time-stepping relation. Then, specialize to the linear test equation\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\mu y, \\quad \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R},\n$$\nand determine from first principles the condition on the time step size $h$ (in relation to $\\mu$) under which the trapezoidal method does or does not preserve positivity, assuming $y_0  0$.\n\nWrite a program that:\n- Implements the trapezoidal method update for the linear test equation in a way that can generate the discrete sequence $\\{y_n\\}_{n=0}^N$ starting from $y_0 gt; 0$ with uniform step size $h$.\n- For each test case below, returns a boolean indicating whether $y_n gt; 0$ for all $n = 1,2,\\ldots,N$ (strict positivity at every step).\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets $(\\mu, y_0, h, N)$:\n- Case $1$: $(\\mu, y_0, h, N) = (-1, 1.0, 0.1, 10)$.\n- Case $2$: $(\\mu, y_0, h, N) = (-1, 1.0, 3.0, 5)$.\n- Case $3$: $(\\mu, y_0, h, N) = (1, 0.1, 0.5, 6)$.\n- Case $4$: $(\\mu, y_0, h, N) = (1, 1.0, 3.0, 1)$.\n- Case $5$: $(\\mu, y_0, h, N) = (-10, 0.5, 0.19, 3)$.\n\nNo physical units are involved.

            "solution": "The problem requires an investigation into the positivity-preserving properties of the trapezoidal method for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This validation will proceed in three steps: first, deriving the trapezoidal method from the provided integral form; second, specializing this method for the linear test equation; and third, deriving the condition on the time step $h$ that ensures positivity is maintained.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Trapezoidal Method**\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus applied to the ODE $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y)$ over the time interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$ gives the exact relation:\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t))\\, dt\n$$\nThe problem specifies approximating the integral using the trapezoidal quadrature rule. This rule approximates the area under a curve by the area of a trapezoid formed by the function's values at the interval endpoints. For an integrand $g(t)$ over $[a, b]$, the approximation is $\\int_a^b g(t) dt \\approx \\frac{b-a}{2}(g(a) + g(b))$.\n\nApplying this to our integral, we set the interval as $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$ with length $h = t_{n+1} - t_n$, and the integrand is $f(t, y(t))$. The approximation is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t))\\, dt \\approx \\frac{h}{2} \\left[ f(t_n, y(t_n)) + f(t_{n+1}, y(t_{n+1})) \\right]\n$$\nWe define the numerical approximations as $y_n \\approx y(t_n)$ and $y_{n+1} \\approx y(t_{n+1})$. Substituting this approximation back into the exact integral relation yields the trapezoidal time-stepping formula:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} \\left[ f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) \\right]\n$$\nThis is an implicit method because the unknown value $y_{n+1}$ appears on both sides of the equation, as an argument to the function $f$ on the right-hand side.\n\n**Step 2: Specialization for the Linear Test Equation**\n\nThe linear test equation is given by $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\mu y$, where $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For this ODE, the function $f(t, y)$ is simply $f(t, y) = \\mu y$. Substituting this specific form of $f$ into the trapezoidal formula, we get:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} \\left[ (\\mu y_n) + (\\mu y_{n+1}) \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain an explicit update rule, we must algebraically solve for $y_{n+1}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} - \\frac{h\\mu}{2} y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h\\mu}{2} y_n\n$$\nFactoring out $y_{n+1}$ on the left-hand side and $y_n$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\left(1 - \\frac{h\\mu}{2}\\right) = y_n \\left(1 + \\frac{h\\mu}{2}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming that $1 - \\frac{h\\mu}{2} \\neq 0$, we can isolate $y_{n+1}$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{h\\mu}{2}}{1 - \\frac{h\\mu}{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the discrete recurrence relation for the trapezoidal method applied to the linear test equation. The term in the parenthesis is the amplification factor that determines how the solution evolves from one step to the next.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Positivity-Preserving Condition**\n\nA method preserves positivity if, starting with an initial condition $y_0  0$, all subsequent approximations $y_n$ remain strictly positive. From the recurrence relation derived above, if we assume $y_n  0$, then the sign of $y_{n+1}$ is determined entirely by the sign of the amplification factor:\n$$\nR(h\\mu) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{h\\mu}{2}}{1 - \\frac{h\\mu}{2}}\n$$\nFor $y_{n+1}$ to be strictly positive, we require $R(h\\mu)  0$. Let the product $z = h\\mu$. The condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2}  0\n$$\nA quotient is positive if and only if the numerator and denominator have the same sign. This is equivalent to their product being positive, provided the denominator is non-zero.\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{z}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{2}\\right)  0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 - \\frac{z}{2} \\neq 0\n$$\nThe product simplifies to a difference of squares:\n$$\n1 - \\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right)^2  0\n$$\n$$\n1  \\frac{z^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\n4  z^2\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\n|z|  2\n$$\nSubstituting back $z = h\\mu$, we arrive at the condition for strict positivity preservation:\n$$\n|h\\mu|  2\n$$\nIf $|h\\mu| = 2$, then $z^2 = 4$, which means $1-z^2/4=0$. This implies that either the numerator or the denominator (but not both) of $R(z)$ is zero. If $z=2$, the denominator is zero, leading to a division by zero. If $z=-2$, the numerator is zero, leading to $y_{n+1}=0$, which violates strict positivity. If $|h\\mu|  2$, the amplification factor is negative, causing the solution to change sign at each step, violating positivity.\n\nTherefore, the trapezoidal method preserves positivity for the linear test equation if and only if the product of the step size $h$ and the parameter $\\mu$ satisfies $|h\\mu|  2$.",
