Let a fixed time step $h > 0$ be given, and consider the one-step numerical methods forward Euler, backward Euler, and the trapezoid rule (also known as the Crank–Nicolson method). Starting from the fundamental definitions of these methods as explicit or implicit one-step approximations of $y'(t) = f(t,y)$, derive the corresponding discrete update relations for this ODE. Using the foundational notion of the amplification factor (also called the stability function) for the linear test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, where the one-step update can be written as $y_{n+1} = R(z)\\,y_{n}$ with $z = \\lambda h$, obtain the amplification factors for each method. Then specialize to the case $\\lambda = i\\omega$ and determine the absolute value of the amplification factor for each method. From first principles, explain how these absolute values determine whether the discrete solutions spiral outward, inward, or remain on a circle in the complex plane as $n$ increases.

It is a standard, fundamental problem in the field of numerical analysis for ordinary differential equations. It tests the understanding of stability for basic numerical methods when applied to purely oscillatory systems. The problem statement is self-contained, with all necessary definitions and variables provided. The terms used are precise and standard. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Discrete Update Relations**\nWe are given the ordinary differential equation $y'(t) = f(t,y)$ where $f(t,y) = i\\omega y(t)$. Let $y_n$ be the numerical approximation of $y(t_n)$ at time $t_n = n h$.\n\n1.  **Forward Euler Method**: This is an explicit method defined by $y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)$.\n    Substituting $f(t_n, y_n) = i\\omega y_n$, we get:\n    $$y_{n+1} = y_n + h (i\\omega y_n) = (1 + i\\omega h) y_n$$\n\n2.  **Backward Euler Method**: This is an implicit method defined by $y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$.\n    Substituting $f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = i\\omega y_{n+1}$, we get:\n    $$y_{n+1} = y_n + h (i\\omega y_{n+1})$$\n    To find $y_{n+1}$, we must solve for it:\n    $$y_{n+1} - i\\omega h y_{n+1} = y_n$$\n    $$y_{n+1}(1 - i\\omega h) = y_n$$\n    $$y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 - i\\omega h} y_n$$\n\n3.  **Trapezoid Rule (Crank-Nicolson Method)**: This is an implicit method defined by $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}))$.\n    Substituting the specific form of $f$, we have:\n    $$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2}(i\\omega y_n + i\\omega y_{n+1})$$\n    Again, we solve for $y_{n+1}$:\n    $$y_{n+1} - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2} y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2} y_n$$\n    $$y_{n+1}\\left(1 - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}\\right) = y_n\\left(1 + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}\\right)$$\n    $$y_{n+1} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}}{1 - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}} y_n$$\n\n**Amplification Factors and Their Moduli**\nThe numerical update for the linear test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is of the form $y_{n+1} = R(z)y_n$, where $z = \\lambda h$. The function $R(z)$ is the amplification factor or stability function. For our specific problem, $\\lambda = i\\omega$, so $z = i\\omega h$.\n\n1.  **Forward Euler**: The update is $y_{n+1} = (1 + i\\omega h) y_n$. Comparing this to $y_{n+1} = R(i\\omega h)y_n$, we identify the amplification factor as:\n    $$R_{\\text{FE}}(i\\omega h) = 1 + i\\omega h$$\n    The absolute value (modulus) of this complex number is:\n    $$|R_{\\text{FE}}(i\\omega h)| = |1 + i\\omega h| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega h)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2}$$\n\n2.  **Backward Euler**: The update is $y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 - i\\omega h} y_n$. The amplification factor is:\n    $$R_{\\text{BE}}(i\\omega h) = \\frac{1}{1 - i\\omega h}$$\n    Its absolute value is:\n    $$|R_{\\text{BE}}(i\\omega h)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{1 - i\\omega h}\\right| = \\frac{|1|}{|1 - i\\omega h|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\omega h)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2}}$$\n\n3.  **Trapezoid Rule**: The update is $y_{n+1} = \\frac{1 + i\\omega h/2}{1 - i\\omega h/2} y_n$. The amplification factor is:\n    $$R_{\\text{TR}}(i\\omega h) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}}{1 - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}}$$\n    Its absolute value is:\n    $$|R_{\\text{TR}}(i\\omega h)| = \\left|\\frac{1 + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}}{1 - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}}\\right| = \\frac{|1 + \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}|}{|1 - \\frac{i\\omega h}{2}|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1^2 + (\\frac{\\omega h}{2})^2}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\frac{\\omega h}{2})^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{(\\omega h)^2}{4}}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{(\\omega h)^2}{4}}} = 1$$\n    This is because the numerator and denominator are complex conjugates of each other, which always have the same modulus.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**\nThe exact solution to $y'(t) = i\\omega y(t)$ with $y(0) = y_0$ is $y(t) = y_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$. The modulus of the exact solution is $|y(t)| = |y_0||\\exp(i\\omega t)| = |y_0| = r_0$, which is constant for all time $t$. This means the exact solution traverses a circle of radius $r_0$ in the complex plane.\n\nThe numerical solution follows the recurrence $y_{n+1} = R(i\\omega h) y_n$. Taking the modulus of both sides gives $|y_{n+1}| = |R(i\\omega h) y_n| = |R(i\\omega h)| |y_n|$. By induction, after $n$ steps, we have $|y_n| = |R(i\\omega h)|^n |y_0|$. The behavior of the numerical solution's modulus depends on the value of $|R(i\\omega h)|$:\n\n-   If $|R(i\\omega h)| > 1$: The modulus $|y_n|$ grows with each step. The numerical solution spirals outwards, away from the true solution's circular path. For the Forward Euler method, since $\\omega > 0$ and $h > 0$, we have $(\\omega h)^2 > 0$, which implies $|R_{\\text{FE}}(i\\omega h)| = \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2} > 1$. Thus, the Forward Euler method is unconditionally unstable for this problem, always producing a solution that spirals outwards with exponentially increasing amplitude.\n\n-   If $|R(i\\omega h)| < 1$: The modulus $|y_n|$ decreases with each step. The numerical solution spirals inwards, decaying towards the origin. For the Backward Euler method, since $(\\omega h)^2 > 0$, we have $\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2} > 1$, which implies $|R_{\\text{BE}}(i\\omega h)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2}} < 1$. Thus, the Backward Euler method introduces artificial numerical dissipation, causing the solution to spiral inwards.\n\n-   If $|R(i\\omega h)| = 1$: The modulus $|y_n|$ remains constant, $|y_n| = |y_0|$ for all $n$. The numerical solution points remain on the initial circle of radius $r_0$, just like the exact solution. For the Trapezoid rule, we found $|R_{\\text{TR}}(i\\omega h)| = 1$ for all $\\omega$ and $h$. This means the method is conservative; it exactly preserves the modulus of the solution, which is a key property of the underlying physical system being modeled (e.g., conservation of energy or probability).\n\n**Closed-Form Expressions for $|y_N|$**\nUsing the relation $|y_N| = |R(i\\omega h)|^N |y_0|$ and the definition $r_0 = |y_0|$, we can write the closed-form expressions for the modulus after $N$ steps.\n\n1.  **Forward Euler**:\n    $$|y_N|_{\\text{FE}} = \\left(\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2}\\right)^N r_0 = r_0 \\left(1 + (\\omega h)^2\\right)^{\\frac{N}{2}}$$\n\n2.  **Backward Euler**:\n    $$|y_N|_{\\text{BE}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega h)^2}}\\right)^N r_0 = r_0 \\left(1 + (\\omega h)^2\\right)^{-\\frac{N}{2}}$$\n\n3.  **Trapezoid Rule**:\n    $$|y_N|_{\\text{TR}} = (1)^N r_0 = r_0$$\n\nThese expressions quantify the long-term behavior of the magnitude of the numerical solution for each method.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the theory of linear multistep methods, and poses a well-defined set of analytical and computational tasks.

We derive the LTE from first principles. Let $y(t)$ be a sufficiently smooth exact solution to the ODE $y' = f(t, y(t))$. The LTE at step $n+1$ is defined by substituting the exact solution into the numerical scheme. To align with the standard definition of a $k$-step method, we shift the indices by $+1$ to express the method as computing step $n+2$ from previous steps:\n$$\ny_{n+2} - 2y_{n+1} + y_n = h(f_{n+2} - f_{n+1})\n$$\nThe linear difference operator $\\mathcal{L}$ for this method is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[y(t); h] = y(t+2h) - 2y(t+h) + y(t) - h\\left(y'(t+2h) - y'(t+h)\\right)\n$$\nThe local truncation error is $T_{n+2} = \\mathcal{L}[y(t_n); h]/h$. Consistency requires that for any sufficiently smooth solution $y(t)$, $T_{n+k} \\to 0$ as $h \\to 0$.\n\nWe perform Taylor series expansions of $y(t+h)$, $y(t+2h)$, $y'(t+h)$, and $y'(t+2h)$ around the point $t$:\n\\begin{align*}\ny(t+h) &= y(t) + h y'(t) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(t) + \\frac{h^3}{6} y'''(t) + O(h^4) \\\\\ny(t+2h) &= y(t) + 2h y'(t) + \\frac{(2h)^2}{2} y''(t) + \\frac{(2h)^3}{6} y'''(t) + O(h^4) \\\\\n&= y(t) + 2h y'(t) + 2h^2 y''(t) + \\frac{4h^3}{3} y'''(t) + O(h^4) \\\\\ny'(t+h) &= y'(t) + h y''(t) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y'''(t) + O(h^3) \\\\\ny'(t+2h) &= y'(t) + 2h y''(t) + \\frac{(2h)^2}{2} y'''(t) + O(h^3) \\\\\n&= y'(t) + 2h y''(t) + 2h^2 y'''(t) + O(h^3)\n\\end{align*}\nSubstitute these expansions into the operator $\\mathcal{L}[y(t); h]$:\n\nFirst part (involving $y$):\n\\begin{align*}\n& y(t+2h) - 2y(t+h) + y(t) \\\\\n&= \\left(y(t) + 2h y' + 2h^2 y'' + \\frac{4h^3}{3} y'''\\right) - 2\\left(y(t) + h y' + \\frac{h^2}{2} y'' + \\frac{h^3}{6} y'''\\right) + y(t) + O(h^4) \\\\\n&= (1-2+1)y(t) + (2-2)h y'(t) + (2-1)h^2 y''(t) + \\left(\\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{2}{6}\\right)h^3 y'''(t) + O(h^4) \\\\\n&= h^2 y''(t) + h^3 y'''(t) + O(h^4)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSecond part (involving $y'$):\n\\begin{align*}\n& h\\left(y'(t+2h) - y'(t+h)\\right) \\\\\n&= h\\left[ \\left(y'(t) + 2h y'' + 2h^2 y'''\\right) - \\left(y'(t) + h y'' + \\frac{h^2}{2} y'''\\right) + O(h^3) \\right] \\\\\n&= h\\left[ h y''(t) + \\frac{3h^2}{2} y'''(t) + O(h^3) \\right] \\\\\n&= h^2 y''(t) + \\frac{3h^3}{2} y'''(t) + O(h^4)\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining both parts:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{L}[y(t); h] &= \\left(h^2 y''(t) + h^3 y'''(t)\\right) - \\left(h^2 y''(t) + \\frac{3h^3}{2} y'''(t)\\right) + O(h^4) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2}h^3 y'''(t) + O(h^4)\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe local truncation error is $T_{n+2} = \\mathcal{L}[y(t_n); h]/h = -\\frac{1}{2}h^2 y'''(t_n) + O(h^3)$.\nSince $T_{n+2} \\to 0$ as $h \\to 0$, the method is **consistent**. The order of accuracy is $p=2$, as the leading term in the LTE is $O(h^2)$.\n\n### Part 2: Zero-Stability Analysis\n\nZero-stability pertains to the behavior of the numerical solution for the homogeneous problem $y' = 0$, or equivalently, in the limit $h \\to 0$. For the given method, setting $f \\equiv 0$ (or $h=0$) gives the homogeneous linear difference equation:\n$$\ny_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1} = 0\n$$\nTo analyze its stability, we examine the roots of its first characteristic polynomial, $\\rho(z)$. Assuming a solution of the form $y_n=z^n$, we substitute it into the difference equation:\n$$\nz^{n-1}(z^2 - 2z + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial is $\\rho(z) = z^2 - 2z + 1 = (z-1)^2$. The roots of $\\rho(z)=0$ are $z_1=1$ and $z_2=1$, a double root at $z=1$.\n\nThe **root condition** for zero-stability states that:\n1.  All roots of $\\rho(z)$ must lie within or on the unit circle in the complex plane (i.e., $|z_i| \\le 1$).\n2.  Any root on the unit circle (i.e., $|z_i|=1$) must be simple (i.e., have multiplicity $1$).\n\nThe roots of our method are $z_1=z_2=1$. They are on the unit circle, satisfying the first condition. However, the root at $z=1$ has multiplicity $2$, which violates the second condition.\nTherefore, the method is **not zero-stable**.\n\n### Part 3: Explanation of Divergence\n\nThe Dahlquist Equivalence Theorem states that a linear multistep method is convergent if and only if it is both consistent and zero-stable. Since our method is consistent but not zero-stable, it is **not convergent**.\n\nThe failure of zero-stability implies that errors, once introduced, will be amplified in an unbounded manner as the number of steps $n$ increases. This can be seen by examining the general solution to the homogeneous recurrence $y_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1} = 0$. For a double root at $z=1$, the general solution is not just $c_1 (1)^n$, but includes a linearly growing term:\n$$\ny_n = c_1 + c_2 n\n$$\nThe $c_1$ term corresponds to the principal root that approximates the true solution. The $c_2 n$ term is a parasitic solution that does not correspond to the behavior of the ODE. At a fixed final time $T$, the number of steps is $n = T/h$. The parasitic component thus behaves as $c_2 n = c_2 T/h$. As the step size $h$ is reduced ($h \\to 0$), the number of steps $n$ grows, and this parasitic solution grows without bound.\n\nFor the full problem $y'=\\lambda y$, the recurrence relation is $y_{n+1}(1 - h\\lambda) = (2 - h\\lambda)y_n - y_{n-1}$. The characteristic equation for this recurrence is $(1-h\\lambda)z^2 - (2-h\\lambda)z + 1 = 0$. Its roots are $z_1 = (1-h\\lambda)^{-1}$ and $z_2 = 1$. The general solution is $y_n = c_1 z_1^n + c_2 z_2^n = c_1 ((1-h\\lambda)^{-1})^n + c_2$.\nThe root $z_1 \\approx 1+h\\lambda$ for small $h$, and $z_1^n \\approx (e^{h\\lambda})^n = e^{\\lambda nh} = e^{\\lambda t_n}$, so $z_1$ is the principal root that tracks the true solution. The root $z_2=1$ is the parasitic root.\n\nThe coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined by the starting values $y_0$ and $y_1$. A small perturbation $\\varepsilon$ in the starting values, $y_1 = y_{\\text{exact}}(h) + \\varepsilon$, excites the parasitic mode. An analysis shows that $c_2$ is proportional to $\\varepsilon/h$. Specifically, for $\\lambda \\ne 0$, $c_2 \\approx -\\varepsilon/(\\lambda h)$, and for $\\lambda=0$, $c_2=\\varepsilon$. In both cases, the coefficient of the parasitic term grows as $h \\to 0$. This means that even an infinitesimal initial perturbation is amplified, leading to a global error that diverges as $O(1/h)$.\n\nFor the case with perfect starting values ($\\varepsilon=0$), the coefficient $c_2$ should be zero in exact arithmetic. However, any floating-point round-off error introduced at any step of the computation acts like a new perturbation, exciting the parasitic mode. Therefore, divergence is inevitable, though it may take more steps to become apparent if the initial data is very accurate.",

            "introduction": "In practical applications, adaptive time-stepping is used to efficiently solve ODEs by adjusting the step size $h$ to meet a prescribed local error tolerance. However, for stiff systems, this can lead to a critical pitfall: the error controller may select a step size that is accurate enough locally but violates the system's stringent stability requirements. This coding-based practice  tasks you with implementing an adaptive solver to reveal how a focus on consistency alone can lead to instability and non-convergence, a crucial lesson in computational science.",

            "problem": "Implement and analyze an adaptive explicit Euler time-stepper for a linear stiff system, focusing on the interplay among consistency, stability, and convergence. The system is the linear autonomous ordinary differential equation with diagonal matrix $$A = \\mathrm{diag}(-1,-1000)$$ so that $$y'(t) = A\\,y(t), \\quad y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2,$$ with exact solution $$y(t) = \\big(y_1(0)\\,e^{-t},\\; y_2(0)\\,e^{-1000\\,t}\\big).$$ Your program must do the following, grounded in fundamental definitions.\n\n- Use the one-step explicit Euler method as the base scheme. Consistency means the local truncation error tends to zero as the time step size tends to zero. For the scalar linear test equation $$z'(t) = \\lambda z(t),$$ the explicit Euler update yields $$z_{n+1} = z_n + h\\,\\lambda\\,z_n,$$ where $$h>0$$ is the time step. Derive the absolute stability region using the linear test equation and the definition of absolute stability in terms of amplification factors for one-step methods. You must implement a diagnostic that, for each accepted step of size $$h$$, checks whether the step lies inside the absolute stability region simultaneously for both eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1000$.\n\n- Use step doubling as a local error estimator. For a current state $$y_n$$ at time $$t_n$$ and trial step size $$h$$, compute\n  - One full step of explicit Euler: $$y^{(1)} = y_n + h\\,f(y_n), \\quad f(y) = A\\,y.$$\n  - Two half-steps of explicit Euler: $$y^{(2)} = y_n + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\,f(y_n), \\quad y^{(2)} = y^{(2)} + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\,f\\big(y^{(2)}\\big),$$ reusing the symbol $$y^{(2)}$$ for the final doubled result for brevity.\n  - A scalar error estimate $$\\mathrm{est} = \\lVert y^{(2)} - y^{(1)} \\rVert_{\\infty}.$$\n  Accept the step if $$\\mathrm{est} \\le \\mathrm{tol},$$ where $$\\mathrm{tol} > 0$$ is a user-specified tolerance. On acceptance, advance $$y_{n+1} := y^{(2)}$$ and $$t_{n+1} := t_n + h.$$\n  Use the standard controller based on the second-order behavior of the step-doubling difference for a first-order base method to update the next step size:\n  $$h_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\min\\big(h_{\\max},\\; \\max\\big(h_{\\min},\\; s \\cdot h \\cdot \\max(0.1,\\; (\\mathrm{tol}/\\max(\\mathrm{est},\\epsilon))^{1/2})\\big)\\big),$$\n  where the safety factor is $$s=0.9,$$ the minimum step is $$h_{\\min} = 10^{-16},$$ and $$\\epsilon = 10^{-300}$$ prevents division by zero. On rejection, keep $$t_n, y_n$$ unchanged and only update $$h \\leftarrow h_{\\mathrm{new}}.$$ Ensure the final step hits the final time exactly by clipping $$h \\le T - t_n$$ at each iteration.\n\n- Convergence assessment: compute the final-time global error as $$\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - y_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)\\rVert_{\\infty}.$$\n\n- Stability assessment under adaptivity: during the integration, maintain a boolean flag that is `True` if and only if every accepted step satisfies the absolute stability condition for explicit Euler simultaneously for $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1000$, according to the region derived from the linear test equation definition. If any accepted step violates this, set the flag to `False` and keep integrating.\n\n- Termination and safeguards: terminate when $$t \\ge T$$. Use a hard cap of $$10^7$$ total trial steps to avoid infinite loops; if the cap is reached, terminate and report the metrics computed up to that point.\n\nTest suite and required inputs. For each test case, you are given $$(\\mathrm{tol},\\; y_1(0),\\; y_2(0),\\; T,\\; h_0,\\; h_{\\max}),$$ where $$h_0$$ is the initial step size guess and $$h_{\\max}$$ is the maximum allowed step size. Use $$h_{\\min} = 10^{-16}$$ as above. The test suite contains the following four cases:\n\n- Case A (happy path with moderate tolerance over a short horizon): $$(\\mathrm{tol}, y_1(0), y_2(0), T, h_0, h_{\\max}) = (10^{-2},\\; 1,\\; 1,\\; 10^{-1},\\; 5\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5\\times 10^{-2}).$$\n- Case B (initial guess outside stability; adaptivity should reduce and maintain stability): $$(5\\times 10^{-2},\\; 1,\\; 1,\\; 10^{-2},\\; 10^{-2},\\; 10^{-2}).$$\n- Case C (stiff component initially tiny; local error control may accept unstable steps, demonstrating how adaptivity can break stability): $$(10^{-1},\\; 1,\\; 10^{-12},\\; 5\\times 10^{-1},\\; 5\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5\\times 10^{-2}).$$\n- Case D (hard cap at the absolute stability boundary via $$h_{\\max}$$): $$(10^{-3},\\; 1,\\; 1,\\; 1,\\; 2\\times 10^{-3},\\; 2\\times 10^{-3}).$$\n\nFor each case, your program must compute:\n- The final-time global error $$E = \\lVert y_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - y_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)\\rVert_{\\infty}.$$\n- The boolean $$S$$ indicating whether every accepted step lay in the absolute stability region for both eigenvalues.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as\n$$[E_A,\\;S_A,\\;E_B,\\;S_B,\\;E_C,\\;S_C,\\;E_D,\\;S_D],$$\nwhere each $$E_\\bullet$$ is a floating-point number and each $$S_\\bullet$$ is a boolean. No units are involved in this problem, and no angles appear. Express numbers as plain decimal floats in the output.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and analysis of an adaptive explicit Euler method for a stiff linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution will be presented in two parts: first, a theoretical derivation of the stability condition, and second, an outline of the adaptive algorithm as specified.\n\nThe ODE system is given by $y'(t) = A y(t)$, where $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A = \\mathrm{diag}(-1, -1000)$. The eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are therefore $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1000$. The disparate magnitudes of these eigenvalues indicate that the system is stiff.\n\nTo analyze the numerical stability of the explicit Euler method, we consider the scalar linear test equation $z'(t) = \\lambda z(t)$, where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a constant. Applying the explicit Euler method, $z_{n+1} = z_n + h f(t_n, z_n)$, with a time step $h>0$ and $f(t,z) = \\lambda z$, yields the recurrence relation:\n$$z_{n+1} = z_n + h \\lambda z_n = (1 + h\\lambda) z_n$$\nThe term $g(w) = 1+w$, where $w = h\\lambda$, is the amplification factor. For a one-step method to be absolutely stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity, ensuring that numerical errors are not amplified over successive steps. The region of absolute stability is the set of $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for which $|g(w)| \\le 1$.\n$$ |1 + h\\lambda| \\le 1 $$\nFor the given problem, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1000$ are real and negative. Consequently, $w = h\\lambda$ is also real and negative. The stability condition simplifies to:\n$$ -1 \\le 1 + h\\lambda \\le 1 $$\nThis is equivalent to the two inequalities:\n1. $1 + h\\lambda \\le 1 \\implies h\\lambda \\le 0$. Since $h>0$ and $\\lambda<0$, this is always satisfied.\n2. $-1 \\le 1 + h\\lambda \\implies -2 \\le h\\lambda$.\n\nThus, for a real, negative $\\lambda$, the explicit Euler method is absolutely stable if and only if $h\\lambda \\in [-2, 0]$. This imposes an upper bound on the step size $h$:\n$$ h \\le -\\frac{2}{\\lambda} $$\nFor the given system, this condition must hold for both eigenvalues simultaneously:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = -1$: $h \\le -\\frac{2}{-1} = 2$.\n- For $\\lambda_2 = -1000$: $h \\le -\\frac{2}{-1000} = 0.002$.\n\nTo ensure stability for the entire system, the step size $h$ must satisfy the most restrictive condition, which is $h \\le 0.002$. The numerical implementation will track whether every accepted step adheres to this bound.\n\nThe adaptive algorithm is constructed as follows:\n1.  **Base Method**: The one-step explicit Euler method, $y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(y_n)$, where $f(y) = Ay$. This method has first-order accuracy, meaning its local truncation error (LTE) is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.\n\n2.  **Local Error Estimation**: Step doubling is used. From the current state $y_n$ at time $t_n$, two separate approximations for the solution at $t_n+h$ are computed:\n    - A single step of size $h$: $y^{(1)} = y_n + h A y_n$.\n    - Two consecutive steps of size $h/2$: A temporary state $y_{n+1/2} = y_n + \\frac{h}{2} A y_n$ is computed, followed by $y^{(2)} = y_{n+1/2} + \\frac{h}{2} A y_{n+1/2}$.\n    The LTE of $y^{(2)}$ is smaller than that of $y^{(1)}$. The difference between these two approximations provides an estimate of the local error. A scalar error measure is defined as $\\mathrm{est} = \\lVert y^{(2)} - y^{(1)} \\rVert_{\\infty}$.\n\n3.  **Step Size Control**: The step is accepted if the error estimate is within a specified tolerance, $\\mathrm{est} \\le \\mathrm{tol}$. If accepted, the state is advanced to $y_{n+1} = y^{(2)}$ (using the more accurate approximation) and time is advanced to $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$. If rejected, the state and time remain $y_n$ and $t_n$. In either case, a new step size $h_{\\mathrm{new}}$ is proposed for the next iteration using a standard Proportional-Integral (PI) type controller logic. The LTE for a first-order method is proportional to $h^2$. To achieve a target error $\\mathrm{tol}$, the new step size is adjusted based on the current estimated error: $h_{\\mathrm{new}} \\approx h (\\mathrm{tol}/\\mathrm{est})^{1/2}$. The algorithm employs the specific formula:\n    $$h_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\min\\big(h_{\\max},\\; \\max\\big(h_{\\min},\\; s \\cdot h \\cdot \\max(0.1,\\; (\\mathrm{tol}/\\max(\\mathrm{est},\\epsilon))^{1/2})\\big)\\big)$$\n    Here, $s=0.9$ is a safety factor, $\\epsilon$ avoids division by zero, and the bounds $h_{\\min}$, $h_{\\max}$, and the factor $0.1$ prevent excessively large or small changes in the step size.\n\n4.  **Convergence and Stability Assessment**:\n    - **Convergence**: The global error is computed at the final time $T$ as $E = \\lVert y_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - y_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)\\rVert_{\\infty}$, where $y_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T) = (y_1(0)e^{-T}, y_2(0)e^{-1000T})$.\n    - **Stability**: A boolean flag, initialized to $\\mathrm{True}$, is maintained. If any accepted step has a size $h > 0.002$, the flag is set to $\\mathrm{False}$, indicating that at least one step violated the absolute stability condition dictated by the stiffest component of the system.\n\nThis design enables a practical examination of the relationship between consistency (local error control), stability (boundedness of the numerical solution), and convergence (accuracy of the final global solution), particularly in the context of stiff equations where local error control does not guarantee stability. Case C is designed to illustrate this specific failure mode, where an unstable step can be accepted by the error controller because the corresponding unstable solution component is initially too small to produce a significant local error estimate. Case D, by contrast, enforces stability via the choice of $h_{\\max}$, demonstrating that while stability is maintained, the step size may be severely restricted by accuracy requirements even if it is within the stable range.",
