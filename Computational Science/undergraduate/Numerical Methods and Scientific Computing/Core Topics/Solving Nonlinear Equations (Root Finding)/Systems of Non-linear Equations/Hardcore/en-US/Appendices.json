The equations are given by:\n$$f_1(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 4 = 0$$\n$$f_2(x, y) = xy - 3 = 0$$\nThe engineer decides to use Newton's method for systems. The iterative formula for this method is given by $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k - [J(\\mathbf{x}_k)]^{-1} \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}_k)$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)^T$, $\\mathbf{F} = (f_1, f_2)^T$, and $J(\\mathbf{x})$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\\mathbf{F}$.\n\nAfter some trials, the engineer observes that choosing an initial guess $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ that lies on either the x-axis (where $y_0 = 0$) or the y-axis (where $x_0 = 0$) is a poor strategy for this specific system.

For any initial guess on an axis, the first iteration of Newton's method produces a point that is also on an axis, preventing the algorithm from ever moving towards a solution, as the solutions do not lie on an axis.\nB. For any initial guess on an axis, the function vector $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is a zero vector, which incorrectly signals to the algorithm that a solution has been found.\nC. The Jacobian matrix is singular for any point on the x-axis or y-axis, causing the method to fail immediately due to an inability to compute the matrix inverse.\nD. The point $(0,0)$ is the only location where the Jacobian is singular. An initial guess on an axis that is close to the origin leads to a nearly-singular Jacobian, causing the subsequent iteration to produce a point extremely far from the true solution, indicating poor convergence behavior.\nE. The system of equations has no real solutions, so Newton's method will fail to converge regardless of the initial guess.",

In particular, $J$ is not singular at generic points on the axes (except at the origin). This immediately shows option C is false.\n\nNext, evaluate $\\mathbf{F}$ on the axes. On the $x$-axis with $y=0$,\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(x,0)=\\bigl(x^{2}-4,\\,-3\\bigr),\n$$\nwhich is never the zero vector. On the $y$-axis with $x=0$,\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(0,y)=\\bigl(-y^{2}-4,\\,-3\\bigr),\n$$\nwhich is also never the zero vector. Hence option B is false.\n\nNow check whether Newton’s method remains on an axis after one iteration. Use the Newton step $\\mathbf{s}$ defined by $J\\mathbf{s}=-\\mathbf{F}$. On the $x$-axis ($y=0$), we have\n$$\nJ(x,0)=\\begin{pmatrix}2x  0\\\\ 0  x\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad \\mathbf{F}(x,0)=\\begin{pmatrix}x^{2}-4\\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}=-J^{-1}\\mathbf{F}=-\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2x}  0\\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{x}\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x^{2}-4\\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\begin{pmatrix}-\\frac{x^{2}-4}{2x}\\\\ \\frac{3}{x}\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nso the next iterate is\n$$\nx_{1}=x-\\frac{x^{2}-4}{2x}=\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{2}{x},\\qquad y_{1}=0+\\frac{3}{x}=\\frac{3}{x}.\n$$\nSince $y_{1}=\\frac{3}{x}\\neq 0$ for any finite $x$, the iterate immediately leaves the axis. A similar calculation on the $y$-axis ($x=0$) solves\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}0  -2y\\\\ y  0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}s_{x}\\\\ s_{y}\\end{pmatrix}=-\\begin{pmatrix}-y^{2}-4\\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}y^{2}+4\\\\ 3\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhich yields $s_{x}=\\frac{3}{y}$ and $s_{y}=-\\frac{y^{2}+4}{2y}$, so\n$$\nx_{1}=0+\\frac{3}{y}=\\frac{3}{y},\\qquad y_{1}=y-\\frac{y^{2}+4}{2y}=\\frac{y}{2}-\\frac{2}{y}.\n$$\nAgain, the iterate leaves the axis immediately. Therefore option A is false.\n\nTo rule out option E, we check for real solutions. From $xy=3$ we have $y=\\frac{3}{x}$, and substituting into $x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ gives\n$$\nx^{2}-\\frac{9}{x^{2}}=4\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; x^{4}-4x^{2}-9=0.\n$$\nLet $t=x^{2}$. Then $t^{2}-4t-9=0$, so $t=2\\pm\\sqrt{13}$. The admissible root is $t=2+\\sqrt{13}>0$, hence\n$$\nx=\\pm\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{13}},\\qquad y=\\frac{3}{x}=\\pm\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{13}}},\n$$\nwhich shows there are two real solutions. Therefore option E is false.\n\nIt remains to identify the fundamental reason axes are a poor choice for initial guesses. Since\n$$\n\\det J(x,y)=2(x^{2}+y^{2}),\n$$\nthe Jacobian is singular at $(0,0)$ and becomes ill-conditioned when $(x,y)$ is close to the origin. The explicit inverse is\n$$\nJ(x,y)^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2(x^{2}+y^{2})}\\begin{pmatrix}x  2y\\\\ -y  2x\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhose entries scale like $\\frac{1}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ times linear functions of $x$ and $y$. Near the origin this produces large Newton steps. On the axes in particular, the Newton updates derived above contain terms like $\\frac{3}{x}$ or $\\frac{3}{y}$, which become very large in magnitude when the initial guess is on an axis and close to the origin. This ill-conditioning explains the observed poor performance and is precisely captured by option D.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that the Jacobian is singular at the origin and nearly singular for axis-aligned initial guesses near the origin, leading to instability and poor convergence.",

            "solution": "The user wants to solve a system of non-linear equations, $f(x,y)=0$, using Newton's method. I will begin by deriving the iteration formula from first principles.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{bmatrix}$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The system of non-linear equations is given by the vector-valued function $f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{0}$. Newton's method is an iterative algorithm that generates a sequence of approximations $\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\dots$ that, under suitable conditions, converge to a root of $f$.\n\nThe derivation starts from the first-order multivariate Taylor expansion of $f$ around the current iterate $\\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + J_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nwhere $J_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f$ evaluated at $\\mathbf{x}_k$.

By substituting $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}$ for $\\mathbf{x}$ and setting the approximation to zero, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} \\approx f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + J_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the update step, $\\Delta\\mathbf{x}_k = \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$\nJ_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\\Delta\\mathbf{x}_k = -f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nAssuming the Jacobian matrix is invertible, we can solve for $\\Delta\\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{x}_k = -[J_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)]^{-1}f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nThe Newton iteration is then defined by the update rule:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}_k = \\mathbf{x}_k - [J_f(\\mathbf{x}_k)]^{-1}f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n$$\nNow, we apply this general formula to the specific function given in the problem:\n$$\nf(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x,y) \\\\ f_2(x,y) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x^3 - 3xy^2 - 1 \\\\ 3x^2y - y^3 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J_f(x,y)$ consists of the partial derivatives of $f$'s components:\n$$\nJ_f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3x^2 - 3y^2  -6xy \\\\ 6xy  3x^2 - 3y^2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the inverse of the Jacobian, we first compute its determinant:\n$$\n\\det(J_f(x,y)) = (3x^2 - 3y^2)(3x^2 - 3y^2) - (-6xy)(6xy) = 9(x^2 - y^2)^2 + 36x^2y^2\n$$\n$$\n\\det(J_f(x,y)) = 9(x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4) + 36x^2y^2 = 9(x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4) = 9(x^2 + y^2)^2\n$$\nThe determinant is zero only when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which occurs only at the origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$. At this point, the Jacobian is singular, and the Newton step is undefined. This is consistent with $(0,0)$ being a critical point of the underlying complex map $g(z)=z^3-1$, as its derivative $g'(z)=3z^2$ is zero at $z=0$.\n\nFor any $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, the inverse of the a $2 \\times 2$ matrix is given by $[J_f]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(J_f)}\\begin{bmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{bmatrix}$.

Initialize counters for the total number of iterations and the number of converged trajectories.\n2.  Generate $K=64$ initial points $(x_0, y_0)$ on a circle of radius $\\varepsilon$ centered at the root $r_1=(1,0)$ using the formula $(x_0,y_0) = (1+\\varepsilon\\cos\\theta, \\varepsilon\\sin\\theta)$, with $\\theta_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{K}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, K-1\\}$.\n3.  For each initial point, execute the Newton's method iteration up to a maximum of $M=50$ times.\n4.  In each iteration, check for convergence. An iterate $(x,y)$ is considered converged if the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|f(x,y)\\|_2$, is less than or equal to $\\tau_f=10^{-12}$, or if its distance to the nearest known root is less than or equal to $\\tau_r=10^{-8}$. If convergence occurs at iteration $i$, the number of iterations for this trajectory is recorded as $i$, and the counters are updated.\n5.  An iteration is considered divergent if the iterate's norm $\\|(x,y)\\|_2$ exceeds $R_{\\max}=10$. If an initial guess fails to converge within $M$ iterations, it is counted as non-convergent.\n6.  After processing all $K$ initial points for a given $\\varepsilon$, calculate the mean number of iterations for the successfully converged trajectories. If no trajectories converge, this mean is reported as $M$.\n7.  Calculate the fraction of trajectories that converged.\n8.  The final output will be two lists: one containing the mean iteration counts and the other containing the convergence fractions for the specified sequence of $\\varepsilon$ values.\nFor the case $\\varepsilon=0$, the initial guess is $(1,0)$, which is a root. The algorithm should correctly identify this as converged in $0$ iterations.",
