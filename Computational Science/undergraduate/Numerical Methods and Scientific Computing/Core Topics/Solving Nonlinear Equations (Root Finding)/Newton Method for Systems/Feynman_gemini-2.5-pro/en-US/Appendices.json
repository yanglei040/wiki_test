            "solution": "The user has requested an analysis of Newton's method for a specific nonlinear system, starting from an initial guess on a line where the Jacobian matrix is singular.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nI will first validate the problem statement according to the specified protocol.\n\n**1. Extract Givens:**\n- A twice continuously differentiable mapping $F:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n- The root-finding problem is $F(x,y)=\\mathbf{0}$.\n- The system has two properties:\n    1. The set of solutions contains the isolated root at $(0,0)$.\n    2. The Jacobian determinant vanishes along the line $y=x$.\n- A specific system is provided: $F(x,y)=\\begin{bmatrix} (y-x)^2 \\\\ x+y \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- The initial guess for Newton's method is $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (a,a)$ with $a \\neq 0$.\n- The task is to analyze the behavior of the first Newton step from this initial guess.\n\n**2. Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientific Grounding and Objectivity**: The problem is a well-defined mathematical exercise in the field of numerical analysis. It concerns the behavior of Newton's method, a standard algorithm. The language is precise and objective. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Consistency Check of the Provided System**:\n    - **Root at $(0,0)$**: We evaluate $F(0,0) = \\begin{bmatrix} (0-0)^2 \\\\ 0+0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}$. So, $(0,0)$ is a root.\n    - **Isolated Root**: To find all roots, we set $F(x,y)=\\mathbf{0}$. This requires $(y-x)^2=0$ and $x+y=0$. The first equation implies $y=x$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $x+x=0$, which simplifies to $2x=0$, so $x=0$. If $x=0$, then $y=0$. Thus, $(0,0)$ is the unique and therefore isolated root. The first property is satisfied.\n    - **Singular Jacobian on $y=x$**: We must compute the Jacobian matrix, $J_F(x,y)$.\n      Let $F(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x,y) \\\\ f_2(x,y) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (y-x)^2 \\\\ x+y \\end{bmatrix}$.\n      The partial derivatives are:\n      $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = 2(y-x)(-1) = -2(y-x)$\n      $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = 2(y-x)(1) = 2(y-x)$\n      $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = 1$\n      $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = 1$\n      The Jacobian matrix is $J_F(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} -2(y-x) & 2(y-x) \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n      The determinant is $\\det(J_F(x,y)) = (-2(y-x))(1) - (2(y-x))(1) = -4(y-x)$.\n      Along the line $y=x$, the determinant is $\\det(J_F(x,x)) = -4(x-x) = 0$. The second property is satisfied.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the analysis of a specific, well-defined iteration of a standard numerical method on a given function from a given starting point. All necessary information is provided.\n\n**3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem statement is valid, self-contained, and mathematically sound. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of Newton's method is to find a step $\\mathbf{s}_k = \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \\mathbf{x}_k$ by solving the linear system derived from the first-order Taylor expansion of $F$ around the current iterate $\\mathbf{x}_k$:\n$$J_F(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\mathbf{s}_k = -F(\\mathbf{x}_k)$$\nThe next iterate is then given by $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\mathbf{s}_k$.\n\nWe analyze the first step ($k=0$) starting from the initial guess $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ a \\end{bmatrix}$, where $a \\neq 0$.\n\n**1. Evaluate $F(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ and $J_F(\\mathbf{x}_0)$:**\n- **Function value:**\n  $F(\\mathbf{x}_0) = F(a,a) = \\begin{bmatrix} (a-a)^2 \\\\ a+a \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2a \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- **Jacobian matrix:**\n  $J_F(\\mathbf{x}_0) = J_F(a,a) = \\begin{bmatrix} -2(a-a) & 2(a-a) \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  As established, this matrix is singular since its determinant is $0$.\n\n**2. Formulate and Analyze the Linearized Newton System:**\nThe system for the Newton step $\\mathbf{s}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} s_x \\\\ s_y \\end{bmatrix}$ is $J_F(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\mathbf{s}_0 = -F(\\mathbf{x}_0)$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} s_x \\\\ s_y \\end{bmatrix} = - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2a \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2a \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation corresponds to the following system of scalar equations:\n1. $0 \\cdot s_x + 0 \\cdot s_y = 0$\n2. $1 \\cdot s_x + 1 \\cdot s_y = -2a$\n\nThe first equation, $0=0$, is redundant. The system effectively reduces to the single equation $s_x + s_y = -2a$.\nA linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ is consistent if $\\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space of $A$. Here, the column space of $J_F(a,a)$ is the span of $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The vector $-F(a,a) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2a \\end{bmatrix}$ is indeed in this column space (with a scaling factor of $-2a$). Therefore, the system is **consistent**.\n\nSince the Jacobian matrix is singular, the solution is **not unique**. The set of all possible Newton steps $\\mathbf{s}_0$ is the line in the $(s_x, s_y)$-plane defined by $s_x + s_y = -2a$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Consequence for the Newton Step:**\nBecause the solution for $\\mathbf{s}_0$ is not unique, any algorithm that relies on computing a unique matrix inverse $J_F^{-1}$ will fail. However, robust linear solvers do not compute the inverse directly. For a consistent but underdetermined system, they find a particular solution. A standard choice is the unique **least-norm solution**, which is the solution $\\mathbf{s}_0$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm $\\| \\mathbf{s}_0 \\|_2 = \\sqrt{s_x^2 + s_y^2}$.\n\nTo find this least-norm solution, we minimize $s_x^2 + s_y^2$ subject to the constraint $s_x + s_y = -2a$. Substituting $s_y = -2a - s_x$ into the expression to minimize:\n$g(s_x) = s_x^2 + (-2a - s_x)^2 = s_x^2 + 4a^2 + 4as_x + s_x^2 = 2s_x^2 + 4as_x + 4a^2$.\nTo find the minimum, we set the derivative with respect to $s_x$ to zero:\n$g'(s_x) = 4s_x + 4a = 0 \\implies s_x = -a$.\nFrom the constraint, $s_y = -2a - s_x = -2a - (-a) = -a$.\nThus, the unique least-norm solution for the Newton step is $\\mathbf{s}_{LN} = \\begin{bmatrix} -a \\\\ -a \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**4. Determine the Next Iterate:**\nIf this specific least-norm step is taken, the next iterate $\\mathbf{x}_1$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{x}_0 + \\mathbf{s}_{LN} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ a \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -a \\\\ -a \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThis means that if the algorithm selects the least-norm solution, Newton's method converges to the root $(0,0)$ in a single iteration.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The Jacobian is singular, so the Newton step is not uniquely defined; any algorithm that requires inverting the Jacobian will fail at $(a,a)$. However, if one replaces the inverse by the least-norm solution to the linearized system, the resulting Newton step drives the iterate to $(0,0)$ in a single iteration.**\n- **Verdict: Correct.** This statement accurately summarizes our findings. The Jacobian at $(a,a)$ is singular. The Newton system is consistent but has infinitely many solutions, so the step is not unique. A naive implementation seeking $J_F^{-1}$ would fail. The specific least-norm solution is $\\mathbf{s}_0 = (-a, -a)$, which makes the next iterate $\\mathbf{x}_1 = (0,0)$.\n\n**B. The linearized Newton system at $(a,a)$ has a unique solution $s=(-a,-a)$, therefore the Newton step is uniquely defined and converges in one iteration.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The central claim that the system has a unique solution is false. The singularity of the Jacobian implies that if a solution exists, there must be infinitely many.\n\n**C. The linearized Newton system at $(a,a)$ is inconsistent for all $a\\neq 0$, so Newton's method cannot take even a single step from $(a,a)$.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** We explicitly showed that the system is consistent because the right-hand side vector $-F(a,a)$ lies in the column space of the Jacobian matrix $J_F(a,a)$. A step can be taken.\n\n**D. From $(a,a)$, any solution of the linearized system yields a next iterate different from $(0,0)$, hence one-step convergence is impossible from points on the line $y=x$.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The quantifier \"any\" makes this statement false. While it is true that most solutions lead to a next iterate different from $(0,0)$, we found a specific solution, $\\mathbf{s}_0 = (-a,-a)$, which leads to one-step convergence. This single counterexample invalidates the statement.\n\n**E. Newton's method converges quadratically from any initial guess on the line $y=x$, even though the Jacobian determinant is zero there, because the first component $(y-x)^2$ is nonnegative.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** This statement makes two flawed claims. First, quadratic convergence is not guaranteed; in fact, a singular Jacobian at the root typically leads to linear convergence. Our analysis for a generic step from $(a,a)$ would show that subsequent steps exhibit linear, not quadratic, convergence if one-step convergence does not occur. Second, the reason provided (\"because the first component... is nonnegative\") is a non-sequitur and has no bearing on the rate of convergence in this context.",

The first is the standard full-step Newton's method, and the second is a damped version employing a backtracking line search to ensure convergence from a wider range of initial guesses.\n\n### Problem Formulation\n\nA nonlinear system of equations is given by a function $F:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. We seek a root $x^\\star$ such that $F(x^\\star) = 0$. Newton's method is an iterative process that, given an iterate $x^{(k)}$, finds the next iterate $x^{(k+1)}$ by approximating $F$ with its first-order Taylor expansion around $x^{(k)}$:\n$$\nF(x^{(k)} + p) \\approx F(x^{(k)}) + J(x^{(k)})p\n$$\nwhere $J(x^{(k)})$ is the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $x^{(k)}$. To find a root of the approximation, we set the right-hand side to zero and solve for the step $p$, called the Newton step:\n$$\nJ(x^{(k)})p^{(k)} = -F(x^{(k)})\n$$\nThis is a system of linear equations for the search direction $p^{(k)}$.\n\n### Standard vs. Damped Newton's Method\n\n**1. Standard Full-Step Newton's Method:**\nThe next iterate is always computed by taking the full Newton step:\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + p^{(k)}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to setting the step size $\\alpha=1$. This method exhibits local quadratic convergence but may fail to converge (i.e., diverge or oscillate) if the initial guess $x^{(0)}$ is not sufficiently close to the solution $x^\\star$.\n\n**2. Damped Newton's Method with Backtracking Line Search:**\nTo globalize the convergence, a step size $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$ is introduced:\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\alpha p^{(k)}\n$$\nThe step size $\\alpha$ is chosen to ensure a sufficient decrease in a merit function, which measures how far we are from a solution. A common choice for the merit function is $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lVert F(x)\\rVert_2^2$.

The directional derivative in the direction $p^{(k)}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla\\phi(x^{(k)})^T p^{(k)} = (J(x^{(k)})^T F(x^{(k)}))^T p^{(k)} = F(x^{(k)})^T J(x^{(k)}) p^{(k)}\n$$\nSubstituting $J(x^{(k)})p^{(k)} = -F(x^{(k)})$, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla\\phi(x^{(k)})^T p^{(k)} = F(x^{(k)})^T (-F(x^{(k)})) = -\\lVert F(x^{(k)}) \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThis shows that the Newton direction $p^{(k)}$ is a descent direction for the merit function $\\phi(x)$, provided $J(x^{(k)})$ is non-singular. The sufficient decrease condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi(x^{(k)} + \\alpha p^{(k)}) \\le \\phi(x^{(k)}) - \\sigma \\alpha \\lVert F(x^{(k)}) \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThe backtracking line search algorithm starts with $\\alpha=1$ and successively reduces it by a factor $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ (e.g., $\\beta = \\frac{1}{2}$) until this condition is met or $\\alpha$ becomes smaller than a prescribed minimum $\\alpha_{\\min}$.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\n\nA robust solver is developed to encapsulate both methods. It accepts the system's function $F$, its Jacobian $J$, an initial guess $x^{(0)}$, and control parameters.\n\n**Core Steps within the Solver:**\n1.  Initialize the iteration counter $k=0$ and the solution vector $x = x^{(0)}$.\n2.  Begin the main loop, which continues as long as the iteration count $k  N_{\\max}$.\n3.  At each iteration, evaluate $F(x)$ and check for convergence: if $\\lVert F(x) \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$, the process terminates successfully.\n4.  Evaluate the Jacobian $J(x)$.\n5.  Solve the linear system $J(x) p = -F(x)$ for the search direction $p$. To handle cases where $J(x)$ is singular or ill-conditioned, we use a least-squares solver, which finds the $p$ that minimizes $\\lVert J(x)p + F(x) \\rVert_2$.\n6.  If damping is enabled, perform a backtracking line search:\n    a. Start with $\\alpha = 1$.\n    b. Repeatedly check the sufficient decrease condition.\n    c. If the condition fails, update $\\alpha \\leftarrow \\beta\\alpha$.\n    d. If $\\alpha$ falls below $\\alpha_{\\min}$, the search is considered stalled, and the iteration halts.\n7.  If damping is disabled, simply set $\\alpha=1$.\n8.  Update the solution: $x \\leftarrow x + \\alpha p$.\n9.  Increment the iteration counter $k \\leftarrow k+1$.\n10. If the loop completes without convergence, the method has failed. The final state and a failure status are returned.\n\n### Test Cases Analysis\n\n**Case A  B: Rosenbrock-gradient System**\nThis system is derived from the gradient of the classic Rosenbrock function, a difficult non-convex optimization benchmark. The solution is at $x^\\star = (1, 1)$, where $F_R(x^\\star) = 0$.\n-   **Case A (poor initial guess):** Starting from $x^{(0)}=(-1.2,\\,1.0)$, the initial iterate is far from the solution. The local quadratic approximation of Newton's method is inaccurate, causing the full-step method to take large, non-productive steps, leading to divergence or oscillation. The damped method, by enforcing a decrease in the merit function, takes smaller, more cautious steps, successfully navigating the complex landscape towards the solution. This demonstrates the superior global convergence properties of the damped method.\n-   **Case B (good initial guess):** Starting from $x^{(0)}=(1.2,\\,1.2)$, the iterate is in the basin of attraction of the solution. Here, the local quadratic model is a good approximation. The full step $\\alpha=1$ satisfies the sufficient decrease condition, so the damped method behaves identically to the full-step method. Both are expected to converge rapidly due to Newton's quadratic convergence rate near a solution.\n\n**Case C: Near-singular Jacobian System**\nThe system has a solution at $x^\\star = (0, 0)$, where the Jacobian $J_S(0,0)$ is singular. Starting at $x^{(0)}=(10^{-4},\\,10^{-4})$, the initial Jacobian is nearly singular. This tests the robustness of the linear solver. The use of a least-squares solver for the Newton step is crucial here. The condition for this test case is that the damped method must converge and its final merit function value, $\\phi(x_{final})$, must be less than or equal to that of the full-step method. As the damped method is guaranteed to not worsen the merit function value at each step (unlike the full-step method), it is expected to achieve a final state that is at least as good as, if not better than, the full-step method's final state, thus satisfying the test condition.\n\nThe program implements these functions, solvers, and test cases to produce the required boolean results.",
