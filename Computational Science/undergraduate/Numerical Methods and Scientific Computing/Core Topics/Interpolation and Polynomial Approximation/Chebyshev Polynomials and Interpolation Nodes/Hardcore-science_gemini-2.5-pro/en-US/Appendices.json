Your implementation must be a complete, runnable program that carries out the computations numerically and reports quantitative metrics that enable a clear comparison of the two node choices. All angles must be interpreted in radians.\n\nUse only foundational definitions and well-tested facts as your starting point:\n- The interpolation problem is: given nodes $\\{x_j\\}_{j=0}^n$ in $[-1,1]$ and data values $y_j=f(x_j)$, construct the unique polynomial $p_n$ of degree at most $n$ such that $p_n(x_j)=y_j$ for all $j$.\n- The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $\\{T_k\\}_{k\\ge 0}$ are defined by $T_k(\\cos\\theta)=\\cos(k\\theta)$ for $\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and the Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes are the extrema of $T_n$, namely $x_k=\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{k\\pi}{n}\\right)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,n$, with $\\pi$ measured in radians.\n- The Runge phenomenon refers to the large endpoint oscillations that may occur when interpolating analytic functions with high-degree polynomials at equispaced nodes on $[-1,1]$.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. For each node family and each degree $n$, construct the interpolating polynomial $p_n$ without using any pre-existing black-box interpolation routines. You may use any mathematically equivalent and numerically stable formulation consistent with the definition of polynomial interpolation (for example, a barycentric realization of Lagrange interpolation, or a Newton form constructed from divided differences). Ensure numerical stability.\n2. Approximate the uniform error $\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty}$ on $[-1,1]$ by sampling $p_n$ and $f$ on a uniform grid of $M$ points in $[-1,1]$. Use $M=20001$.\n3. Quantify endpoint behavior using two measures on the union of endpoint windows $[-1,-1+w]\\cup[1-w,1]$ with $w=0.1$:\n   - The endpoint error amplitude $E_{\\mathrm{end}}=\\max_{x\\in[-1,-1+w]\\cup[1-w,1]} |f(x)-p_n(x)|$.\n   - An endpoint oscillation count defined as the number of strict sign changes of a discrete derivative of $p_n$ on the sampled grid restricted to $[-1,-1+w]\\cup[1-w,1]$. Compute the derivative via a centered finite-difference on the uniform grid and threshold small magnitudes by declaring values with absolute value $\\le \\tau$ as zero, where $\\tau=10^{-8}$. A strict sign change is counted whenever two consecutive nonzero derivative samples have opposite signs. Zeros should be ignored (do not count transitions involving zero; compress runs of zeros by carrying forward the last nonzero sign when determining changes).\n4. Compare equispaced nodes and Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes for each $n$ using the above metrics.\n\nTest suite and parameters:\n- Use degrees $n\\in\\{5,10,20\\}$.\n- For each $n$, use both node families:\n  - Equispaced nodes: $x_j=-1+\\dfrac{2j}{n}$ for $j=0,1,\\dots,n$.\n  - Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes: $x_k=\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{k\\pi}{n}\\right)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,n$, with $\\pi$ in radians.\n\nRequired outputs per degree $n$:\n- For equispaced nodes: three values in this order $(\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty},\\ E_{\\mathrm{end}},\\ \\text{oscillation count})$.\n- For Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes: three values in this order $(\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty},\\ E_{\\mathrm{end}},\\ \\text{oscillation count})$.\n- Thus, for each $n$, report six values. For all three values of $n$, report a total of $18$ values.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program must produce a single line of output containing all $18$ results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered by $n=5$, then $n=10$, then $n=20$, and within each $n$ the equispaced triplet followed by the Chebyshev–Lobatto triplet. For example, your output should look like\n  $[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,\\ a_7,a_8,a_9,a_{10},a_{11},a_{12},\\ a_{13},a_{14},a_{15},a_{16},a_{17},a_{18}]$,\n  where all $a_i$ are numbers in the specified order.\n- Express all floating-point outputs rounded to $8$ decimal places; oscillation counts must be integers.\n\nAngle unit specification:\n- Wherever the cosine function is used to define nodes, the argument must be in radians.\n\nYour program must be fully self-contained, require no user input, and rely only on the Python standard library and the specified numerical library. The only permitted numerical library is a standard numerical array library. The output must be reproducible under the given specifications.",
            "solution": "We begin with the definition of polynomial interpolation. For nodes $\\{x_j\\}_{j=0}^n\\subset[-1,1]$ and values $y_j=f(x_j)$, there exists a unique polynomial $p_n \\in \\mathbb{P}_n$ with $p_n(x_j)=y_j$ for all $j$. Any representation consistent with this definition is acceptable. From a numerical methods perspective, a robust approach uses the barycentric Lagrange formulation, which realizes the same interpolant while improving numerical stability compared to the naive Lagrange formula.\n\nFoundational facts used:\n1. Interpolation error identity: For $f \\in C^{n+1}([-1,1])$, the pointwise error can be expressed as\n   $$ f(x)-p_n(x)=\\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi_x)}{(n+1)!}\\prod_{j=0}^n (x-x_j), $$\n   for some $\\xi_x \\in (-1,1)$ depending on $x$. This identity shows that the node placement $\\{x_j\\}$ shapes the factor $\\prod_{j=0}^n(x-x_j)$ and hence the size and distribution of the error.\n2. Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $\\{T_k\\}$ satisfy $T_k(\\cos\\theta)=\\cos(k\\theta)$ for $\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The extrema of $T_n$ occur at $x_k=\\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right)$, $k=0,\\dots,n$, which are the Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes. These nodes cluster near the endpoints and are known to tame the magnitude of $\\prod_{j=0}^n(x-x_j)$ on $[-1,1]$ relative to equispaced nodes.\n3. The Runge phenomenon arises prominently for equispaced nodes as $n$ grows, amplifying oscillations near endpoints even for analytic $f$. Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes mitigate this by distributing nodes according to the density induced by the map $x=\\cos\\theta$ with uniformly spaced $\\theta$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Function and grid:\n  - Define $f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{1+25x^2}$ on $[-1,1]$.\n  - Use a uniform grid $\\{x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i\\}_{i=0}^{M-1}$ with $M=20001$ points spanning $[-1,1]$ to approximate $\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty}$ by sampling.\n- Node generation:\n  - Equispaced nodes: $x_j=-1+\\dfrac{2j}{n}$ for $j=0,\\dots,n$.\n  - Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes: $x_k=\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{k\\pi}{n}\\right)$ for $k=0,\\dots,n$ with $\\pi$ in radians.\n- Interpolation construction:\n  - Use the barycentric Lagrange interpolant (which is mathematically equivalent to the unique interpolating polynomial) with weights $w_j=\\left(\\prod_{m\\ne j}(x_j-x_m)\\right)^{-1}$. Scaling all $w_j$ by a common nonzero factor leaves the interpolant invariant and can be used to normalize the weights for numerical stability.\n  - For evaluation at a point $x$, the first barycentric formula reads\n    $$ p_n(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^n \\dfrac{w_j}{x-x_j} y_j}{\\sum_{j=0}^n \\dfrac{w_j}{x-x_j}}, $$\n    with the convention that if $x=x_j$ (to numerical tolerance), then $p_n(x)=y_j$ exactly to enforce interpolation and avoid division by zero.\n  - Vectorize evaluation across the entire grid $\\{x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i\\}$ for efficiency.\n- Error metrics:\n  - Compute the sampled error $e_i=|f(x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i)-p_n(x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i)|$ and approximate $\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty}$ by $\\max_i e_i$.\n  - Define endpoint windows with width $w=0.1$ as $[-1,-1+w] \\cup [1-w,1]$, i.e., $[-1,-0.9] \\cup [0.9,1]$, and compute $E_{\\mathrm{end}}=\\max\\{e_i: x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i \\in [-1,-0.9] \\cup [0.9,1]\\}$.\n- Oscillation metric:\n  - Approximate the derivative of $p_n$ on the grid by a centered finite-difference, i.e., the standard second-order accurate discrete derivative on a uniform grid with edge handling.\n  - Threshold small derivative magnitudes using $\\tau=10^{-8}$: map values with absolute value $\\le \\tau$ to $0$, leaving other values unchanged. Define the sign sequence $s_i=\\mathrm{sign}(p_n'(x^{\\mathrm{eval}}_i))$ with the thresholding applied.\n  - Restrict to indices in the union of endpoint windows. Remove zeros by compressing the sequence to its nonzero elements, and count strict sign changes: the number of indices where two consecutive nonzero signs differ (i.e., their product is negative). This yields an integer oscillation count for the endpoint regions.\n- Test suite:\n  - Degrees $n\\in\\{5,10,20\\}$. For each $n$, compute the triple $(\\lVert f-p_n\\rVert_{\\infty}, E_{\\mathrm{end}}, \\text{oscillation count})$ first for equispaced nodes and then for Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes.\n- Output formatting:\n  - For each $n$, concatenate the equispaced triple followed by the Chebyshev–Lobatto triple, yielding $6$ values per $n$ and $18$ values overall when $n=5,10,20$ are processed in order.\n  - Round all floating-point outputs to $8$ decimal places; keep oscillation counts as integers.\n  - Print a single line in the form of a comma-separated list enclosed in brackets.\n\nWhy this reveals the Runge phenomenon:\n- By the error identity, equispaced nodes do not control $\\max_{x\\in[-1,1]}\\left|\\prod_{j=0}^n(x-x_j)\\right|$ as $n$ grows, leading to large endpoint oscillations even for analytic $f$. Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes, arising from the extrema of $T_n$, effectively minimize the sup norm of the nodal polynomial up to scaling, spreading error more uniformly and suppressing endpoint blow-up. The global sup norm error and the endpoint error amplitude directly quantify these effects. The oscillation count detects spurious oscillatory behavior in $p_n$ near endpoints that is absent in $f$ (which is monotone on each endpoint window), providing a complementary qualitative assessment that is reduced for Chebyshev–Lobatto nodes relative to equispaced nodes.",
