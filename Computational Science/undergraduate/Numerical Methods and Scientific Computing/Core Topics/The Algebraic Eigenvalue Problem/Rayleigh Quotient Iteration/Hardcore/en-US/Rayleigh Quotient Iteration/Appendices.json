This exercise will solidify your understanding of what the quotient represents, especially in the ideal case where the vector is a true eigenvector of the matrix. By using a simple diagonal matrix where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are immediately obvious, you can directly verify how the Rayleigh quotient, $R(M, v) = \\frac{v^T M v}{v^T v}$, connects a vector to its corresponding eigenvalue.",
