Computation of Gershgorin Disks**\n\nWe compute the center $a_{ii}$ and radius $R_i$ for each of the four rows.\n\nFor row $i=1$:\nThe center is the diagonal element $a_{11} = 5$.\nThe radius is the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements:\n$R_1 = |0.2| + |0.1| + |0.1| = 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.4$.\nThe first Gershgorin disk is $D_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 0.4\\}$.\n\nFor row $i=2$:\nThe center is $a_{22} = 5$.\nThe radius is $R_2 = |0.15| + |0.1| + |0.05| = 0.15 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.3$.\nThe second Gershgorin disk is $D_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 0.3\\}$.\n\nFor row $i=3$:\nThe center is $a_{33} = -10$.\nThe radius is $R_3 = |0.05| + |0.05| + |0.2| = 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.3$.\nThe third Gershgorin disk is $D_3 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - (-10)| \\le 0.3\\}$, which is $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z + 10| \\le 0.3\\}$.\n\nFor row $i=4$:\nThe center is $a_{44} = -10$.\nThe radius is $R_4 = |0.05| + |0.05| + |0.25| = 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.25 = 0.35$.\nThe fourth Gershgorin disk is $D_4 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - (-10)| \\le 0.35\\}$, which is $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z + 10| \\le 0.35\\}$.\n\n**2. Disjointness of Disk Unions**\n\nLet's define two sets as the union of these disks:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is the union of two disks, $D_1$ and $D_2$. Both disks are centered at $z=5$. Since the radius of $D_2$ ($R_2=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_1$ ($R_1=0.4$), the disk $D_2$ is entirely contained within $D_1$, i.e., $D_2 \\subset D_1$. Therefore, their union is simply the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2 = D_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 0.4\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, the set $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is the union of two disks, $D_3$ and $D_4$, both centered at $z=-10$. The radius of $D_3$ ($R_3=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_4$ ($R_4=0.35$), so $D_3 \\subset D_4$. Their union is the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4 = D_4 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z + 10| \\le 0.35\\}$.\n\nTo show that $\\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ are disjoint, we compare the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $c_1 = 5$. The radius of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $R_{\\mathcal{G}_1} = 0.4$.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is $c_2 = -10$. The radius of $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is $R_{\\mathcal{G}_2} = 0.35$.\n\nThe distance between the centers is $d = |c_1 - c_2| = |5 - (-10)| = |15| = 15$.\nThe sum of the radii is $R_{sum} = R_{\\mathcal{G}_1} + R_{\\mathcal{G}_2} = 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75$.\n\nSince $d = 15$ is greater than $R_{sum} = 0.75$, the two disks $\\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ are disjoint. Thus, $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. Eigenvalue Count**\n\nAn important extension of the Gershgorin circle theorem states that if the union of $k$ Gershgorin disks forms a connected component that is disjoint from the union of the other $n-k$ disks, then this component contains exactly $k$ eigenvalues of the matrix (counting multiplicities).\n\nIn our case, the set of all four Gershgorin disks, $\\mathcal{G} = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3 \\cup D_4$, can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: $\\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{G}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{G}_2$, with $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$ is formed from the union of $k=2$ disks. This set is connected (in fact, it is a single disk).\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$ is formed from the union of the remaining $n-k = 4-2=2$ disks. This set is also connected.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is a connected component formed by $2$ disks and is disjoint from the rest of the Gershgorin disks, it must contain exactly $2$ eigenvalues of $A$.\nSimilarly, $\\mathcal{G}_2$ must contain the other $2$ eigenvalues.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of eigenvalues in the \"rightmost disjoint set (the one whose disks are centered near $5$)\". This corresponds to the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$, which is centered at $z=5$ on the real axis, while $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is centered at $z=-10$.\n\nTherefore, the number of eigenvalues of $A$ lying in the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is exactly $2$.",

This exercise explores a fascinating scenario where a matrix has purely real eigenvalues, yet its Gershgorin disks extend far into the complex plane .

            "problem": "You are tasked with designing a family of real-valued matrices whose eigenvalues are all real, yet whose Gershgorin circles extend significantly into the complex plane. Consider the family of matrices defined by\n$$A(r) = 3 I_{7} + r T,$$\nwhere $I_{7}$ is the $7 \\times 7$ identity matrix, $r  0$ is a real parameter, and $T$ is the $7 \\times 7$ real symmetric tridiagonal matrix with ones on the first sub-diagonal and first super-diagonal and zeros elsewhere; that is, $T_{i,i+1} = T_{i+1,i} = 1$ for $i = 1,2,\\dots,6$, and $T_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nUsing only foundational facts about real symmetric matrices and the localization of eigenvalues via the Gershgorin circle theorem, determine the smallest value of $r$ such that the union of the Gershgorin circles associated with $A(r)$ contains at least one point whose imaginary part has magnitude at least $31$, while all eigenvalues of $A(r)$ are real.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the smallest positive real number $r$ such that the union of the Gershgorin circles associated with the matrix $A(r)$ contains a point whose imaginary part has a magnitude of at least $31$.\n\nThe matrix family is defined by $A(r) = 3 I_{7} + r T$, where $I_{7}$ is the $7 \\times 7$ identity matrix, $r  0$ is a real parameter, and $T$ is a $7 \\times 7$ real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The non-zero entries of $T$ are $T_{i,i+1} = T_{i+1,i} = 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 6$. Since both $I_{7}$ and $T$ are real symmetric matrices, their linear combination $A(r)$ is also a real symmetric matrix for any real $r$. A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that all eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real. This is consistent with the information provided in the problem.\n\nWe now apply the Gershgorin circle theorem. For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, this theorem states that all its eigenvalues are contained within the union of $n$ disks in the complex plane, called Gershgorin circles. The $i$-th circle, denoted $D_i$, is centered at the diagonal entry $A_{ii}$ and has a radius $R_i$ equal to the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in the $i$-th row. The circle is defined as:\n$$D_i = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - A_{ii}| \\le R_i \\}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}|.$$\n\nLet's construct the matrix $A(r)$. The entries of $A(r)$ are given by $A_{ij} = 3 \\delta_{ij} + r T_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe diagonal entries are $A_{ii} = 3 + r T_{ii}$. Since $T$ has zeros on its main diagonal, $T_{ii} = 0$, which gives $A_{ii} = 3$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, 7$.\nThe off-diagonal entries are $A_{ij} = r T_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$. Based on the definition of $T$, the only non-zero off-diagonal entries are $A_{i,i+1} = r$ and $A_{i+1,i} = r$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 6$.\nThe explicit form of the matrix is:\n$$A(r) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3  r  0  0  0  0  0 \\\\\nr  3  r  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  r  3  r  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  r  3  r  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  r  3  r  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  r  3  r \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  r  3\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe centers of all $7$ Gershgorin circles are located at the diagonal entries, so for every circle $D_i$, the center is at the point $3$ on the real axis.\n\nNext, we compute the radii $R_i$. Since the problem specifies $r  0$, we have $|r| = r$.\nFor the first row ($i=1$): The radius is $R_1 = |A_{12}| + \\sum_{j  2} |A_{1j}| = |r| + 0 = r$.\nFor the last row ($i=7$): The radius is $R_7 = |A_{76}| = |r| = r$.\nFor the intermediate rows ($i=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$): The radius is $R_i = |A_{i,i-1}| + |A_{i,i+1}| = |r| + |r| = 2r$.\n\nSo, we have two distinct types of Gershgorin circles:\n1. Two circles, $D_1$ and $D_7$, centered at $3$ with radius $r$.\n2. Five circles, $D_2, D_3, D_4, D_5, D_6$, centered at $3$ with radius $2r$.\n\nThe union of all these circles, $\\mathcal{G} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^7 D_i$, is the region guaranteed to contain all the eigenvalues. Since all circles are concentric (centered at $z=3$) and the parameter $r$ is positive, it follows that $2r  r$. The union of these disks is therefore determined by the largest disk. The largest radius is $2r$. Thus, the union $\\mathcal{G}$ is the single closed disk defined by:\n$$\\mathcal{G} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 3| \\le 2r \\}.$$\n\nThe problem requires that this region $\\mathcal{G}$ contains at least one point $z = x + iy$, with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, such that the magnitude of its imaginary part is at least $31$. This condition is expressed as $|y| \\ge 31$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of $|y|$ for a point $z = x+iy$ within the disk $\\mathcal{G}$. The inequality defining the disk is $|(x-3) + iy| \\le 2r$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is:\n$$(x-3)^2 + y^2 \\le (2r)^2.$$\nTo maximize $|y|$, we must choose $x$ such that the non-negative term $(x-3)^2$ is minimized. Its minimum value is $0$, which is achieved when $x=3$. Substituting $x=3$ into the inequality gives:\n$$0^2 + y^2 \\le (2r)^2 \\implies y^2 \\le 4r^2.$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find $|y| \\le 2r$. This means the maximum possible magnitude of the imaginary part for any point in the union of the Gershgorin circles is exactly $2r$.\n\nThe problem's condition is that this maximum magnitude must be at least $31$. We must therefore have:\n$$2r \\ge 31.$$\nWe are asked for the smallest value of $r$ that satisfies this condition. The minimum value is attained when equality holds:\n$$2r = 31.$$\nSolving for $r$, we find:\n$$r = \\frac{31}{2}.$$\nThis value of $r$ is positive, as required. For $r = 31/2$, the union of the Gershgorin circles is the disk $|z-3| \\le 31$. This disk includes the points $z = 3 \\pm 31i$, for which the imaginary part has a magnitude of exactly $31$. Any smaller value of $r$ would result in a disk where the maximum magnitude of the imaginary part is less than $31$. Therefore, the smallest required value of $r$ is $31/2$.",

For any point $z$ in disk $\\mathcal{D}_i(t)$, we have $\\Re(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Re(z) \\le \\Re(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$ and $\\Im(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Im(z) \\le \\Im(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$.\n\nThe real-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 3-2t, 5-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 3+2t, 5+2t\\} = 5 + 2t.\n$$\nThe imaginary-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 2-2t, 3-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 2+2t, 3+2t\\} = 3 + 2t.\n$$\nThe area of the bounding rectangle is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = ((5 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) \\cdot ((3 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) = (4 + 4t)(2 + 4t) = 8 + 24t + 16t^2.\n$$\n\n**3. Computation of $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$**\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_k(t)\\}_{k=1}^3$ of the matrix $A(t)$ must be computed. Except for trivial cases (like $t=0$), this generally requires a numerical algorithm. For each specified value of $t$, the matrix $A(t)$ is constructed, and its eigenvalues are found using a standard numerical library. Let the computed eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1(t), \\lambda_2(t), \\lambda_3(t)$.\n\nThe bounds of the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing the eigenvalues are:\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n\nThe area of this eigenvalue bounding box is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t)).\n$$\n\n**4. Computation of the Localization Tightness Ratio $\\rho(t)$**\n\nThe ratio $\\rho(t)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t)}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)} = \\frac{16t^2 + 24t + 8}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)}.\n$$\nFor $t=0$, $A(0)=D$. The Gershgorin disks are single points (the diagonal entries), and these are also the eigenvalues. Thus, $\\mathcal{G}(0)$ is the set of eigenvalues, which implies $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0)$.\n$\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = 8 + 24(0) + 16(0)^2 = 8$.\nThe eigenvalues are $1+\\mathrm{i}, 3+2\\mathrm{i}, 5+3\\mathrm{i}$. The eigenvalue bounding box area is $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0) = (5-1) \\cdot (3-1) = 8$.\nSo, $\\rho(0) = 8/8 = 1$. For $t0$, the Gershgorin set provides an inclusion region for the eigenvalues, so $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) \\ge \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$ and $\\rho(t) \\ge 1$. The value of $\\rho(t)$ quantifies the looseness of the Gershgorin bound as approximated by axis-aligned rectangles.\n\nThe following implementation computes $\\rho(t)$ for each test value of $t$.",
