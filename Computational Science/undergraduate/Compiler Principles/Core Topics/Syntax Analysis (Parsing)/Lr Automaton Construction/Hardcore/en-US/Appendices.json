The LR(0) closure function $\\operatorname{closure}(I)$ on a set of items $I$ is defined as follows: start with all items in $I$, and for any item $[A \\to \\alpha \\cdot B \\beta]$ in the current set where $B$ is a nonterminal, include every production $B \\to \\gamma$ as the item $[B \\to \\cdot \\gamma]$, repeating until a fixed point.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the total number of `goto` transitions that are absent in an erroneously constructed LR(0) automaton compared to the correct one. The error is a specific omission of one item during the initial closure computation.\n\nThe given augmented grammar has the following productions, with terminals $\\{x, y, z, w\\}$ and nonterminals $\\{S', S, T, U, W\\}$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS' &\\to S \\\\\nS  &\\to T\\ U \\\\\nT  &\\to x\\ T \\\\\nT  &\\to y \\\\\nU  &\\to z\\ U \\\\\nU  &\\to W \\\\\nW  &\\to w\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first constructing the relevant parts of the correct LR(0) automaton, $M_{\\text{true}}$, and then comparing this to the automaton constructed with the specified error, $M_{\\text{err}}$. The missing transitions are those present in $M_{\\text{true}}$ but absent in $M_{\\text{err}}$ as a direct or indirect consequence of the initial omission.\n\n**1. Correct Automaton Construction ($M_{\\text{true}}$)**\n\nThe construction of the automaton begins with the closure of the initial item $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$.\nThe correct initial state, $I_{0}$, is computed as follows:\n$I_0 = \\operatorname{closure}(\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\})$\n- The initial set is $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$.\n- The item $[S' \\to \\cdot S]$ has a nonterminal $S$ after the dot, so we add all productions for $S$. This adds $[S \\to \\cdot T U]$.\n- The new item $[S \\to \\cdot T U]$ has a nonterminal $T$ after the dot, so we add all productions for $T$. This adds $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ and $[T \\to \\cdot y]$.\n- No more items can be added.\nThus, the correct initial state is:\n$$I_0 = \\{[S' \\to \\cdot S],\\ [S \\to \\cdot T U],\\ [T \\to \\cdot x T],\\ [T \\to \\cdot y]\\}$$\n\nThe question concerns the consequences of omitting the item $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$. We must trace all transitions that depend on this item's presence.\n\nFirst, consider the transitions from $I_0$. The item $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ has the terminal $x$ after the dot. This enables a `goto` transition on $x$.\n$$ \\operatorname{goto}(I_0, x) = \\operatorname{closure}(\\{[T \\to x \\cdot T]\\}) $$\nThe kernel of the new state is $\\{[T \\to x \\cdot T]\\}$. To compute its closure, we inspect the grammar symbol after the dot, which is the nonterminal $T$. We must add all productions for $T$ in the form $[T \\to \\cdot \\gamma]$. This adds $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ and $[T \\to \\cdot y]$.\nThis yields a new state, which we label $I_3$:\n$$ I_3 = \\{[T \\to x \\cdot T],\\ [T \\to \\cdot x T],\\ [T \\to \\cdot y]\\} $$\nSo, in the correct automaton, there is a transition:\n$$ I_0 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3 $$\n\nNow, we must find all transitions that are present in $M_{\\text{true}}$ only because state $I_3$ exists. These are the outgoing transitions from $I_3$. We compute them using the `goto` function on $I_3$:\n- On symbol $T$: From the item $[T \\to x \\cdot T]$, we have $\\operatorname{goto}(I_3, T) = \\operatorname{closure}(\\{[T \\to x T \\cdot]\\})$. Since there is no symbol after the dot, the closure is just the kernel itself. This creates a new state $I_9 = \\{[T \\to x T \\cdot]\\}$. The transition is:\n  $$ I_3 \\xrightarrow{T} I_9 $$\n- On symbol $x$: From the item $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$, we have $\\operatorname{goto}(I_3, x) = \\operatorname{closure}(\\{[T \\to x \\cdot T]\\})$. This is exactly the computation that led to state $I_3$ itself. Thus, we have a self-loop:\n  $$ I_3 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3 $$\n- On symbol $y$: From the item $[T \\to \\cdot y]$, we have $\\operatorname{goto}(I_3, y) = \\operatorname{closure}(\\{[T \\to y \\cdot]\\})$. This creates a state $I_4 = \\{[T \\to y \\cdot]\\}$. The transition is:\n  $$ I_3 \\xrightarrow{y} I_4 $$\n  (Note: State $I_4$ is also reachable from $I_0$ via $\\operatorname{goto}(I_0, y)$, so the state itself is not exclusively dependent on $I_3$, but this specific transition to it is.)\n\nTo summarize, the existence of the item $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ in $I_0$ is directly responsible for the creation of the transition $I_0 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$ and the state $I_3$. The existence of state $I_3$, in turn, is responsible for the creation of the three transitions $I_3 \\xrightarrow{T} I_9$, $I_3 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$, and $I_3 \\xrightarrow{y} I_4$.\n\n**2. Erroneous Automaton Construction ($M_{\\text{err}}$)**\n\nThe practitioner starts with an incorrect initial state, which omits one item:\n$$ I_{0}^{\\text{err}} = \\{[S' \\to \\cdot S],\\ [S \\to \\cdot T U],\\ [T \\to \\cdot y]\\} $$\n\nWe now analyze the construction of the automaton starting from $I_{0}^{\\text{err}}$.\nTo find the transitions missing \"directly from $I_{0}^{\\text{err}}$\", we compute its `goto` transitions and compare them to those from the correct $I_0$.\nIn $I_{0}^{\\text{err}}$, there is no item with the symbol $x$ immediately following the dot. Therefore, the set $\\{[A \\to \\alpha \\cdot x \\beta] \\mid [A \\to \\alpha \\cdot x \\beta] \\in I_{0}^{\\text{err}}\\}$ is empty.\nThis means $\\operatorname{goto}(I_{0}^{\\text{err}}, x)$ is undefined.\nConsequently, the transition $I_0 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$ that exists in $M_{\\text{true}}$ does not exist in $M_{\\text{err}}$. This is the first missing transition.\n\nAccording to the problem, we must also count \"downstream incorrect goto edges... from any state that would exist only if $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ had been present\".\nBecause the transition $I_0 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$ is missing, state $I_3$ is never created in the erroneous automaton. It is an unreachable state from $I_{0}^{\\text{err}}$. State $I_3$ is precisely a \"state that would exist only if $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ had been present\".\nSince state $I_3$ is absent in $M_{\\text{err}}$, all of its outgoing `goto` transitions are also absent. These are the downstream missing edges. As determined in the previous section, these are:\n- $I_3 \\xrightarrow{T} I_9$\n- $I_3 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$\n- $I_3 \\xrightarrow{y} I_4$\n\nAll other states and transitions in the correct automaton are reachable from $I_0$ via paths that do not involve the transition on $x$ from $I_0$. For example, $\\operatorname{goto}(I_0, T)$ produces a state $I_2 = \\{[S \\to T \\cdot U], [U \\to \\cdot z U], [U \\to \\cdot W], [W \\to \\cdot w]\\}$. This computation depends only on the item $[S \\to \\cdot T U]$ and the productions for $U$ and $W$, none of which are affected by the initial error. Thus, $\\operatorname{goto}(I_{0}^{\\text{err}}, T)$ correctly produces this same state $I_2$, and the portion of the automaton reachable from $I_2$ is constructed correctly.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe single omission of the item $[T \\to \\cdot x T]$ from the initial state leads to the following set of missing transitions in the erroneously constructed automaton:\n1.  The direct consequence: The transition on $x$ from the initial state, $I_0 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$.\n2.  The downstream consequences: All transitions originating from the non-existent state $I_3$. These are $I_3 \\xrightarrow{T} I_9$, $I_3 \\xrightarrow{x} I_3$, and $I_3 \\xrightarrow{y} I_4$.\n\nThe total number of missing `goto` transitions is the sum of these, which is $1 + 3 = 4$.",

Using the fundamental definitions of LR(0) items, the closure operation, and the goto operation, the canonical collection of LR(0) item sets is constructed.

            "solution": "The problem requires the identification and resolution of a shift-reduce conflict in the initial state of an LR($0$) automaton for a given context-free grammar. The resolution must be achieved through a minimal number of production modifications.\n\nThe augmented grammar provided is defined by the productions:\n$$\nS' \\to S \\\\\nS \\to A \\mid a A b \\\\\nA \\to B \\mid a b \\\\\nB \\to \\epsilon\n$$\nwhere $S'$ is the augmented start symbol, $S, A, B$ are nonterminal symbols, $a, b$ are terminal symbols, and $\\epsilon$ represents the empty string.\n\nFirst, we must construct the initial state of the canonical LR($0$) automaton, denoted as $I_0$. This state is defined as the closure of the set containing the initial item, $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$. The closure operation systematically adds new items based on the grammar's productions. An item of the form $[X \\to \\alpha \\cdot Y \\beta]$, where $Y$ is a nonterminal, causes the addition of all items $[Y \\to \\cdot \\gamma]$ for each production $Y \\to \\gamma$.\n\nThe construction of $I_0$ proceeds as follows:\n1.  The initial set is $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$.\n2.  The item $[S' \\to \\cdot S]$ has the nonterminal $S$ following the dot. Therefore, we add all items corresponding to the productions of $S$, with the dot at the beginning. The productions for $S$ are $S \\to A$ and $S \\to a A b$. This yields the items $[S \\to \\cdot A]$ and $[S \\to \\cdot a A b]$. The set becomes $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S], [S \\to \\cdot A], [S \\to \\cdot a A b]\\}$.\n3.  The newly added item $[S \\to \\cdot A]$ has the nonterminal $A$ after the dot. We add items for all productions of $A$, which are $A \\to B$ and $A \\to a b$. This introduces the items $[A \\to \\cdot B]$ and $[A \\to \\cdot a b]$. The set is now $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S], [S \\to \\cdot A], [S \\to \\cdot a A b], [A \\to \\cdot B], [A \\to \\cdot a b]\\}$.\n4.  The item $[A \\to \\cdot B]$ has the nonterminal $B$ after the dot. We add an item for the single production of $B$, which is $B \\to \\epsilon$. This adds the item $[B \\to \\cdot \\epsilon]$, conventionally written as $[B \\to \\cdot]$.\n5.  At this point, the set of items for state $I_0$ is $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S], [S \\to \\cdot A], [S \\to \\cdot a A b], [A \\to \\cdot B], [A \\to \\cdot a b], [B \\to \\cdot]\\}$. No further items can be added, so the closure is complete.\n\nAs correctly stated in the problem, the state $I_0$ contains both the item $[A \\to \\cdot a b]$ and the item $[B \\to \\cdot]$.\n-   The item $[A \\to \\cdot a b]$ is a *shift item*. Upon seeing the terminal $a$ as the next input symbol, it instructs the parser to perform a shift action.\n-   The item $[B \\to \\cdot]$ is a *reduce item*. It indicates that the right-hand side of the production $B \\to \\epsilon$ has been recognized. An LR($0$) parser must then perform a reduce action, regardless of the lookahead symbol.\n\nThe coexistence of a shift item and a reduce item in the same state creates a *shift-reduce conflict*. The parser cannot deterministically choose between shifting and reducing.\n\nTo eliminate this conflict, we must modify the grammar so that these two types of items do not appear together in the initial state. The conflict arises because the nonterminal $A$ can derive both a string that starts with a terminal ($A \\Rightarrow ab$) and the empty string ($A \\Rightarrow B \\Rightarrow \\epsilon$). Both of these possibilities are introduced into the initial state's closure via the production $S \\to A$.\n\nWe are asked for a minimal modification, limited to a single addition, deletion, or refactoring of a production. Let's analyze the effect of deleting the production $A \\to B$. This action represents a single modification.\n\nThe modified grammar, which we will call $G_{mod}$, has the following productions:\n$$\nS' \\to S \\\\\nS \\to A \\mid a A b \\\\\nA \\to a b \\\\\nB \\to \\epsilon\n$$\nIn $G_{mod}$, the nonterminal $B$ is no longer reachable from the start symbol $S$. The modification is solely the deletion of the production $A \\to B$.\n\nNow, let's re-compute the initial state, $I'_0$, for the modified grammar $G_{mod}$ by taking the closure of $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$.\n1.  The initial set is $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S]\\}$.\n2.  From $[S' \\to \\cdot S]$, we add items for the productions of $S$: $[S \\to \\cdot A]$ and $[S \\to \\cdot a A b]$. The set becomes $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S], [S \\to \\cdot A], [S \\to \\cdot a A b]\\}$.\n3.  From the item $[S \\to \\cdot A]$, we must add items for the productions of $A$. In $G_{mod}$, the only production for $A$ is $A \\to a b$. We add the item $[A \\to \\cdot a b]$.\n4.  The set of items for state $I'_0$ is now $\\{[S' \\to \\cdot S], [S \\to \\cdot A], [S \\to \\cdot a A b], [A \\to \\cdot a b]\\}$. The closure is now complete, as there are no further nonterminals immediately following a dot in any newly added items.\n\nThe new initial state $I'_0$ does not contain any reduce items (i.e., items where the dot is at the end of the production rule's right-hand side, such as $[X \\to \\gamma \\cdot]$). It only contains shift items. Consequently, the shift-reduce conflict in the initial state has been resolved.\n\nSince a single production deletion was sufficient to eliminate the conflict, the minimal number of productions that must be changed, $N$, is at most $1$. Given that the original grammar did contain a conflict, a change is necessary, so $N > 0$. Therefore, the minimal number of required changes is precisely $1$.",
