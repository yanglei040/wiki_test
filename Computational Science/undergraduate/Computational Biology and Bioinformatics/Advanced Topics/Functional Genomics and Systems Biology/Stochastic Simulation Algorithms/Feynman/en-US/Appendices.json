Divides the heterodimer propensity by $2$ and omits the $1/2$ in the homodimer propensity, both of which are incorrect. The derived probabilities and post-reaction propensities follow from those wrong formulas and are thus incorrect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD.

Each trajectory starts from the same initial state $(A_0, X_0)$ but follows a different path due to stochasticity. A counter is maintained for each of the two specified outcomes:\n- **Extinction**: A trajectory is counted as an \"extinction\" event if it terminates because $X$ becomes $0$ while $A > 0$ and $t < T_{\\max}$.\n- **Explosion**: A trajectory is counted as an \"explosion\" (resource exhaustion) event if it terminates because $A$ becomes $0$ while $X > 0$ and $t < T_{\\max}$.\n\nAfter running all $N$ trajectories for a given parameter set, the empirical probabilities are calculated as the fraction of trajectories that resulted in each outcome:\n$$P_{\\text{extinction}} = \\frac{\\text{extinction\\_count}}{N}$$\n$$P_{\\text{explosion}} = \\frac{\\text{explosion\\_count}}{N}$$\n\nFor reproducibility, the random number generator is seeded with the specified value before starting the $N$ simulations for each test case.",
