            "problem": "You are given the task of designing and implementing an algorithm to detect the existence of \"iso-motifs\" in signed, directed biological networks. An iso-motif is defined here as two instances of the same motif topology whose regulatory signs differ. This concept captures, for example, the coexistence of coherent and incoherent Feed-Forward Loops (FFLs) in transcriptional regulation networks, where a coherent FFL has a direct regulation whose sign equals the product of the two-step path signs, while an incoherent FFL has a mismatch between these signs. Your algorithm must be formulated purely in mathematical terms and implemented as a complete, runnable program.\n\nFundamental base definitions:\n- A signed, directed graph is represented by a sign adjacency matrix $S \\in \\{-1,0,+1\\}^{n \\times n}$ for a set of $n$ nodes, where $S[u,v] = +1$ indicates activation from node $u$ to node $v$, $S[u,v] = -1$ indicates inhibition, and $S[u,v] = 0$ indicates the absence of an edge.\n- A motif template is a directed topology represented by a binary adjacency matrix $M \\in \\{0,1\\}^{k \\times k}$ over $k$ positions, with $M[i,i] = 0$ for all $i$. An induced match of $M$ in $S$ is an injective mapping $\\phi: \\{0,\\dots,k-1\\} \\to \\{0,\\dots,n-1\\}$ such that for all ordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $i \\neq j$, the presence or absence of an edge exactly matches the template: $M[i,j] = 1$ if and only if $S[\\phi(i),\\phi(j)] \\neq 0$, and $M[i,j] = 0$ if and only if $S[\\phi(i),\\phi(j)] = 0$.\n- For any induced match $\\phi$, define the sign signature vector $\\sigma_M(\\phi)$ by listing the signs of $S[\\phi(i),\\phi(j)]$ for all template edges $(i,j)$ with $M[i,j]=1$ in a fixed, canonical order (lexicographic order on $(i,j)$). Two motif instances are sign-distinct if their sign signature vectors are not identical.\n\nYour task is to implement an algorithm that, given a host signed network $S$ and a motif template $M$, determines whether there exist at least two induced matches of $M$ in $S$ with distinct sign signature vectors.

            "solution": "The problem statement submitted for analysis is valid. It is scientifically grounded, mathematically well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguity. The definitions of a signed directed graph, a motif template, an induced match, and a sign signature vector are precise and align with established concepts in computational biology and graph theory. The objective, which is to determine the existence of at least two sign-distinct instances of a motif, is a concrete and solvable computational task. We shall proceed with the derivation of a correct and complete algorithm.\n\nThe central task is to determine if a given signed directed network $S$ contains at least two induced instances of a motif template $M$ that differ in their sign patterns. Formally, let $S$ be represented by a sign adjacency matrix of size $n \\times n$ with entries from $\\{-1, 0, +1\\}$, and let $M$ be a binary adjacency matrix of size $k \\times k$ representing the motif topology. We are asked to determine if the set of sign signatures, $\\Sigma_{S,M}$, contains more than one unique element, where $\\Sigma_{S,M} = \\{ \\sigma_M(\\phi) \\mid \\phi \\text{ is an induced match of } M \\text{ in } S \\}$. The problem is thus to compute the truth value of the statement $|\\Sigma_{S,M}| > 1$.\n\nOur algorithm will be constructed directly from these first principles, as required. The foundation of the algorithm is a systematic search for all induced matches of $M$ in $S$. An induced match is an injective map $\\phi$ from the $k$ positions of the template, $\\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$, to the $n$ nodes of the host graph, $\\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$. The set of all such injective maps is equivalent to the set of ordered $k$-permutations of the $n$ node indices.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Enumeration of Potential Mappings**: We generate all possible injective mappings from the $k$ template positions to the $n$ graph nodes. This is achieved by iterating through all $k$-permutations of the node set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Let $p = (p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{k-1})$ be such a permutation, defining a candidate mapping $\\phi(i) = p_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$. The total number of such permutations is $P(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\n\n2.  **Verification of Induced Match Condition**: For each candidate mapping $\\phi$ (represented by a permutation $p$), we must rigorously verify if it constitutes an induced match. According to the definition, this requires that for every pair of distinct template positions $(i, j)$, an edge exists between $\\phi(i)$ and $\\phi(j)$ in $S$ if and only if an edge exists between $i$ and $j$ in $M$. This translates to the following logical condition which must hold for all $i, j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$ with $i \\neq j$:\n    $$\n    (M[i,j] = 1) \\iff (S[\\phi(i), \\phi(j)] \\neq 0)\n    $$\n    If this condition is violated for even a single pair $(i,j)$, the mapping $\\phi$ is not an induced match, and we discard it and proceed to the next permutation.\n\n3.  **Extraction and Collection of Signatures**: If a mapping $\\phi$ satisfies the induced match condition for all $k(k-1)$ distinct position pairs, it is a valid match. We then proceed to extract its sign signature vector, $\\sigma_M(\\phi)$.\n    - We first establish a canonical ordering for the edges of the template $M$. Let $E_M = \\{(i,j) \\mid M[i,j] = 1, 0 \\le i, j < k\\}$. We order the elements of $E_M$ lexicographically. Let this ordered sequence be $(e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m)$, where $m = |E_M|$.\n    - For each edge $e_r = (i, j)$ in this canonical sequence, we find the corresponding sign $S[\\phi(i), \\phi(j)]$.\n    - The sign signature $\\sigma_M(\\phi)$ is the tuple of these signs, collected in the canonical order: $(\\text{sign}(S, \\phi, e_1), \\dots, \\text{sign}(S, \\phi, e_m))$.\n    - We maintain a set data structure, denoted $\\mathcal{F}$, to store the unique sign signatures discovered so far. Upon finding a valid match and constructing its signature, we add the signature to $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n4.  **Termination Condition**: The primary objective is to determine if more than one unique signature exists. Therefore, after adding a new signature to $\\mathcal{F}$, we check its size. If at any point $|\\mathcal{F}| > 1$, we have proven the existence of at least two sign-distinct instances (an iso-motif). The algorithm can then immediately terminate its search for the given $(S, M)$ pair and report a result of `True`. If the enumeration of all $P(n,k)$ permutations completes and $|\\mathcal{F}|$ remains less than or equal to $1$, it signifies that all found instances of the motif (if any) share the same sign pattern. In this case, the result is `False`.\n\nThis brute-force, definition-driven approach guarantees correctness, as it exhaustively checks all possibilities without relying on potentially fallible heuristics. For the specified test cases, where $n$ and $k$ are small, this method is computationally feasible. For example, in Case 2 with $n=6$ and $k=3$, the number of permutations is $P(6,3) = 120$, and for each, we perform $k(k-1)=6$ checks, which is a trivial computational load.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the test cases:\n- Case 1: The host graph contains two FFLs, at nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ and $\\{2,3,4\\}$. Both yield the signature $(+1, +1, +1)$. The set of signatures $\\mathcal{F}$ never exceeds size one. Result: `False`.\n- Case 2: The graph contains two FFLs. The one at $\\{0,1,2\\}$ has signature $(+1, -1, +1)$, and the one at $\\{3,4,5\\}$ has signature $(+1, +1, +1)$. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ grows to size two. Result: `True`.\n- Case 3: The graph topology does not permit any FFLs. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ remains empty. Result: `False`.\n- Case 4: The subgraph on nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ is not an *induced* FFL because there is an extra edge $S[2,0]=+1$ where the template demands a non-edge ($M[2,0]=0$). No induced matches are found. Result: `False`.\n- Case 5: The graph contains two induced $3$-node chains. The match on nodes $\\{0,1,2\\}$ gives signature $(+1,+1)$. The match on nodes $\\{3,4,0\\}$ gives signature $(-1,+1)$. The set $\\mathcal{F}$ reaches size two. Result: `True`.\n\nThe algorithm is thus verified against all provided scenarios.",

The concentration of their products, denoted by the dimensionless variables $A(t)$, $B(t)$, and $C(t)$, evolves according to the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{u(t) - A}{\\tau_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\frac{P_B - B}{\\tau_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{P_C(A,B) - C}{\\tau_C}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_X > 0$ is the degradation time constant for species $X$. The system is driven by an external input signal $u(t)$, which is a step function from $u(0^-)=0$ to $u(0^+)=1$. The initial state of the system is $A(0)=0$, $B(0)=0$, and $C(0)=0$.\n\nThe production terms $P_B$ and $P_C$ describe the regulatory interactions. The problem contrasts two scenarios for the regulation of gene $B$:\n$1$. The baseline scenario (superscript $(0)$), where $B$ is only regulated by $A$:\n$$\nP_B^{(0)}(A) = \\alpha_B \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AB},n_{AB})\n$$\n$2$. The negative autoregulation scenario (superscript $(-)$), where $B$ inhibits its own production:\n$$\nP_B^{(-)}(A,B) = \\alpha_B \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AB},n_{AB}) \\, H_{\\mathrm{rep}}(B;K_{BB},n_{BB})\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_B$ is the maximal production rate, and $H_{\\mathrm{act}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{rep}}$ are the standard sigmoidal Hill functions for activation and repression, respectively:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{act}}(x;K,n) = \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}, \\quad H_{\\mathrm{rep}}(x;K,n) = \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n} = \\frac{1}{1+(x/K)^n}\n$$\nThe parameters $K$ and $n$ represent the activation/repression threshold and the Hill coefficient (steepness of the response), respectively.\n\nThe production of $C$ is controlled by both $A$ and $B$ via an AND-logic gate, mathematically implemented as the product of their individual activatory influences:\n$$\nP_C(A,B) = \\alpha_C \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(A;K_{AC},n_{AC}) \\, H_{\\mathrm{act}}(B;K_{BC},n_{BC})\n$$\nThis structure, with directed edges $A \\to B \\to C$ and $A \\to C$, defines a type-1 coherent feed-forward loop. The AND-logic requires both $A$ and $B$ to be present to strongly activate $C$. This network topology is known to function as a sign-sensitive delay element, responding to sustained input signals but filtering out short transient pulses.\n\nTo solve this system, we must perform numerical integration. The problem specifies a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method with a fixed time step $\\Delta t = 0.01$ minutes over the interval $[0, T_{\\max}=100]$. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [A(t), B(t), C(t)]^T$. The system of ODEs can be written as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y})$, where for $t \\ge 0$, $u(t)=1$ and the system is autonomous:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}) = \\begin{pmatrix} (1 - y_1) / \\tau_A \\\\ (P_B(y_1, y_2) - y_2) / \\tau_B \\\\ (P_C(y_1, y_2) - y_3) / \\tau_C \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe RK4 integration step from time $t_k$ to $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta t$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} (\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nwith increments:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}_1 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathbf{k}_1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathbf{k}_2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 &= \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}_k + \\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{k}_3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated from the initial condition $\\mathbf{y}_0 = [0, 0, 0]^T$ until $t=T_{\\max}$.\n\nUpon obtaining the time series for $C(t)$, we extract three key metrics that characterize the output dynamics:\n$1$. Half-rise time, $t_{50}$: The time required for $C(t)$ to reach $50\\%$ of its final steady-state value, $C_{\\infty}$. We estimate $C_{\\infty} \\approx C(T_{\\max})$. Then $t_{50}$ is the first time $t$ for which $C(t) \\ge 0.5 \\, C_{\\infty}$. Negative autoregulation is known to speed up the response of transcription factors, so we expect $t_{50}^{(-)} < t_{50}^{(0)}$, leading to a negative $\\Delta t_{50}$.\n$2$. Overshoot ratio, $r_{\\mathrm{ov}}$: The maximum relative overshoot above the steady-state value, defined as $r_{\\mathrm{ov}} = [\\max_t C(t) / C_{\\infty}] - 1$. An overshoot can occur in this system due to the interplay of delays in the two paths to $C$.\n$3$. Peak time, $t_{\\mathrm{peak}}$: The time at which $C(t)$ reaches its maximum value, $C_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\max_t C(t)$. This corresponds to the time of the maximum overshoot, if one exists. If no overshoot occurs, then $t_{\\mathrm{peak}} = T_{\\max}$.\n\nFor each test case, we perform this simulation and analysis twice—once for the baseline system (scenario $(0)$) and once for the system with negative autoregulation on node $B$ (scenario $(-)$)—and compute the differences $\\Delta t_{50} = t_{50}^{(-)} - t_{50}^{(0)}$, $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{ov}} = r_{\\mathrm{ov}}^{(-)} - r_{\\mathrm{ov}}^{(0)}$, and $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{peak}} = t_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{(-)} - t_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{(0)}$. This allows for a direct quantification of the functional role of negative autoregulation in this FFL context.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure. It defines helper functions for the Hill kinetics, sets up the ODE system for both scenarios, implements the RK4 integrator, and contains a loop to process each test case, calculate metrics, compute their differences, and format the final output as specified.",

This requires their real part to be zero, while their imaginary part is non-zero. The eigenvalues $\\lambda_{2}$ and $\\lambda_{3}$ form such a pair.\nThe imaginary parts are $\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}f'(x^{*})$. Since we are given $n > 1$, $f(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $x>0$, so $f'(x^{*}) < 0$. Therefore, the imaginary parts are non-zero.\nThe bifurcation condition is that the real part of this pair becomes zero:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{2,3}) = -\\frac{f'(x^{*})}{2} - \\frac{1}{\\tau} = 0\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n-f'(x^{*}) = \\frac{2}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe problem defines the dimensionless single-stage gain $g = |f'(x^{*})|\\tau$. Since we know $f'(x^{*}) < 0$, we have $|f'(x^{*})| = -f'(x^{*})$. So, the definition of $g$ is $g = -f'(x^{*})\\tau$.\nWe can rearrange this to express $-f'(x^{*})$ as $\\frac{g}{\\tau}$.\nSubstituting this into the bifurcation condition:\n$$\n\\frac{g}{\\tau} = \\frac{2}{\\tau}\n$$\nSince $\\tau > 0$, we can multiply both sides by $\\tau$ to find the critical value of $g$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2\n$$\nAt this value, the real part of the complex eigenvalues is zero, indicating the onset of sustained oscillations. The first eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = f'(x^*) - 1/\\tau$, has a real part that is always negative because $f'(x^*)<0$ and $1/\\tau > 0$, so it corresponds to a stable mode and is not involved in the bifurcation.\nThe critical value of the gain is therefore exactly $2$.",
