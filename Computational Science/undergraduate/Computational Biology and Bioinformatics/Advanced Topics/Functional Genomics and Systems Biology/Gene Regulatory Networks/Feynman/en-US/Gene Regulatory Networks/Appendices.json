One of the simplest and most widespread motifs is negative autoregulation, where a protein inhibits its own production, creating a feedback loop that stabilizes its concentration. This practice  provides a quantitative look at this homeostatic mechanism by guiding you through the process of deriving the stable, steady-state concentration of a self-repressing protein using a Hill function model.",

            "problem": "A synthetic biologist is engineering a simple genetic circuit in a bacterial host. This circuit is designed to implement negative autoregulation, where a protein, which we will call the Repressor (R), inhibits the expression of its own gene. The concentration of the Repressor protein at time $t$ is denoted by $R(t)$. The dynamics of this system are modeled by the following principles:\n\n1.  **Production:** The rate of synthesis of the Repressor protein is described by a repressive Hill function. When the concentration of R is zero, its production rate is at a maximum value of $k_p$. As the concentration $R(t)$ increases, the protein binds to its own promoter region, inhibiting synthesis. This repression is characterized by a constant $K$, defined as the concentration of R that reduces the production rate to one-half of its maximum. The binding process is non-cooperative, corresponding to a Hill coefficient of $n=1$.\n\n2.  **Degradation:** The Repressor protein is continuously removed from the cell. This removal process follows first-order kinetics, characterized by a degradation rate constant $k_d$.\n\nAll parameters $k_p$, $k_d$, and $K$ are positive real constants. After a sufficient amount of time, the system is observed to reach a stable configuration where the concentration of the Repressor protein no longer changes. Determine the concentration of the Repressor protein R in this final, stable configuration. Your answer should be an analytical expression in terms of the parameters $k_p$, $k_d$, and $K$.",

A higher Hill coefficient (a more switch-like, or ultrasensitive, response) leads to a sharper boundary (smaller $\\Delta x$).\n\nWe now substitute the given value of $\\lambda=2$ into this formula:\n$$\\Delta x_{10-90} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{n} \\ln(9) = \\frac{4}{n} \\ln(9)$$\nThe value of the natural logarithm of $9$ is approximately $\\ln(9) \\approx 2.197224577$.

            "solution": "The posed problem requests a comprehensive analysis of a symmetric two-gene toggle switch model, a canonical system in computational and synthetic biology. The analysis involves three main stages: first, identifying all equilibrium points of the system; second, determining the local asymptotic stability of each equilibrium; and third, simulating the system's response to an external stimulus to test for state-switching behavior. This entire process must be performed for several given parameter sets. The problem is scientifically well-grounded, mathematically well-posed, and provides sufficient information for a unique numerical solution. I will proceed with a detailed, principle-based solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentrations $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ are described by the following system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\left(\\frac{Y}{K}\\right)^n} \\;-\\; \\delta X\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\left(\\frac{X}{K}\\right)^n} \\;-\\; \\delta Y\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the basal production rate, $\\beta$ is the maximal regulated production rate, $\\delta$ is the degradation/dilution rate, $K$ is the repression threshold, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient measuring the cooperativity of repression.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Point Computation**\n\nEquilibrium points, or steady states $(X^\\ast, Y^\\ast)$, are solutions to the system where the time derivatives are zero. This transforms the dynamical system into a system of two coupled nonlinear algebraic equations:\n$$\n\\delta X^\\ast \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\left(\\frac{Y^\\ast}{K}\\right)^n}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta Y^\\ast \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\left(\\frac{X^\\ast}{K}\\right)^n}\n$$\nThese equations can be written as a root-finding problem $F(X^\\ast, Y^\\ast) = 0$, where $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the vector function defined by the steady-state conditions.\n\nTo solve this system numerically, we employ an iterative root-finding algorithm, specifically the `scipy.optimize.root` function, which is a robust implementation based on modifications of the Powell hybrid method. Since such algorithms require an initial guess and may only find one root at a time, we must use a systematic approach to find all physically relevant solutions. The physically meaningful concentration values are non-negative. A reasonable search domain can be established by considering the system's bounds. The minimum concentration occurs under full repression ($X \\to \\infty$ or $Y \\to \\infty$), giving a steady-state value approaching $\\alpha/\\delta$. The maximum concentration occurs with no repression ($X=0$ or $Y=0$), giving a steady-state value of $(\\alpha+\\beta)/\\delta$. Therefore, all equilibria must lie within the bounded box $[0, (\\alpha+\\beta)/\\delta] \\times [0, (\\alpha+\\beta)/\\delta]$. We will use a grid of initial guesses spanning this domain to ensure comprehensive discovery of all equilibria.\n\nNumerically-found roots that are very close to each other (within a small tolerance, e.g., $10^{-6}$, in Euclidean distance) are considered duplicates and are merged into a single representative equilibrium point.\n\n**2. Local Stability Analysis**\n\nThe local stability of an equilibrium point $(X^\\ast, Y^\\ast)$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system evaluated at that point. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of the system's vector field:\n$$\nJ(X, Y) \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}(\\frac{dX}{dt}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y}(\\frac{dX}{dt}) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}(\\frac{dY}{dt}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y}(\\frac{dY}{dt}) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor the given system, this evaluates to:\n$$\nJ(X^\\ast, Y^\\ast) \\;=\\;\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\delta & \\displaystyle -\\beta \\cdot \\frac{n}{K}\\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n-1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{Y^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} \\\\\n\\displaystyle -\\beta \\cdot \\frac{n}{K}\\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\frac{X^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n-1}}{\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{X^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} & -\\delta\n\\end{bmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{bmatrix} -\\delta & J_{12} \\\\ J_{21} & -\\delta \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAn equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of its Jacobian matrix have strictly negative real parts ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) < 0$). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(-\\delta - \\lambda)^2 - J_{12} J_{21} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda + \\delta = \\pm\\sqrt{J_{12} J_{21}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda = -\\delta \\pm\\sqrt{J_{12} J_{21}}\n$$\nSince all parameters and concentrations are non-negative, the off-diagonal terms $J_{12}$ and $J_{21}$ are non-positive. Their product $J_{12} J_{21}$ is therefore non-negative, and its square root is real. For stability, both eigenvalues must be negative:\n$$\n-\\delta + \\sqrt{J_{12} J_{21}} < 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad J_{12}(Y^\\ast) J_{21}(X^\\ast) < \\delta^2\n$$\nThis inequality provides a simple and direct test for the stability of any found equilibrium. The number of equilibria satisfying this condition, $k$, is then counted.\n\n**3. Switching Dynamics Simulation**\n\nBistability, the existence of at least two stable equilibria, is a key feature of the toggle switch. The problem asks to investigate switching from a \"$Y$-high\" state to an \"$X$-high\" state, induced by an external stimulus. This is possible if the system exhibits at least two stable equilibria: one $(X^\\ast_1, Y^\\ast_1)$ with $X^\\ast_1 > Y^\\ast_1$ and another $(X^\\ast_2, Y^\\ast_2)$ with $Y^\\ast_2 > X^\\ast_2$. If this condition is not met (e.g., the system is monostable), switching is defined as `False`.\n\nThe simulation proceeds as an initial value problem.\n1.  **Initialization**: The system is initialized at the $Y$-high stable equilibrium, $(X(0), Y(0)) = (X^\\ast_{Yh}, Y^\\ast_{Yh})$, where $Y^\\ast_{Yh} > X^\\ast_{Yh}$.\n2.  **Stimulus Phase**: For a duration $T$, a stimulus $s$ is added to the production rate of $X$. The system is integrated from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using the modified ODE:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dX}{dt} \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\left(\\frac{Y}{K}\\right)^n} \\;+\\; s \\;-\\; \\delta X\n    $$\n    The equation for $Y$ remains unchanged.\n3.  **Relaxation Phase**: At $t=T$, the stimulus is removed. The system is then integrated further, from $t=T$ to a final time $t_{final}$ (chosen to be sufficiently large for relaxation, e.g., $100$ time units), using the original ODEs.\n\nThis numerical integration is performed using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, a modern, adaptive step-size ODE solver.\n\nFinally, to determine if switching was successful, the state of the system at $t_{final}$, denoted $(X_{final}, Y_{final})$, is compared to the identified stable equilibria. Switching is deemed successful if $(X_{final}, Y_{final})$ is closer in Euclidean distance to the $X$-high stable equilibrium, $(X^\\ast_{Xh}, Y^\\ast_{Xh})$, than to the $Y$-high one. This outcome is reported as a boolean value.\n\nThe procedure is repeated for each parameter set provided in the test suite, and the results are aggregated into the specified output format.",
