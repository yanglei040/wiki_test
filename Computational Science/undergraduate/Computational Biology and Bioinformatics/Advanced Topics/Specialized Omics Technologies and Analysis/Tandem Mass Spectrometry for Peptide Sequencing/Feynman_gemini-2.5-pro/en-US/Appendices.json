            "problem": "In a proteomics laboratory, a researcher is analyzing a short peptide using tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS). The first stage of MS (MS1) suggests the peptide has the amino acid composition A, P, G. Subsequent analysis using Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) is performed to determine the precise sequence. By convention, peptide sequences are written from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. One of the primary fragments observed in the MS/MS spectrum is a $b$-ion, which is a fragment containing the N-terminus.\n\nAssuming the peptide sequence is determined to be an Alanine-Proline-Glycine tripeptide (APG), calculate the theoretical mass-to-charge ($m/z$) ratio for the $b_2$ fragment ion. The ion carries a single positive charge ($z=1$).\n\nUse the following monoisotopic masses for your calculation:\n- Residue mass of Alanine (A): 71.03711 Da\n- Residue mass of Proline (P): 97.05276 Da\n- Residue mass of Glycine (G): 57.02146 Da\n- Mass of a proton ($H^+$): 1.00728 Da\n\nExpress your final answer for the $m/z$ ratio rounded to five significant figures.",
            "solution": "A $b$-ion contains the N-terminal residues. For a peptide with residue masses given (which already exclude the mass of water), the monoisotopic mass of a $b_{n}$ ion with charge $z$ is the sum of the first $n$ residue masses plus the mass of the proton that carries the charge. Therefore, for $z=1$,\n$$\nm(b_{n})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{\\text{residue},i} + m_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{m}{z}=\\frac{m(b_{n})}{1}=m(b_{n}).\n$$\nFor APG, the $b_{2}$ ion corresponds to residues A and P, so\n$$\nm(b_{2}) = m_{\\mathrm{A}} + m_{\\mathrm{P}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given monoisotopic values,\n$$\nm(b_{2}) = 71.03711 + 97.05276 + 1.00728 = (71.03711 + 97.05276) + 1.00728,\n$$\n$$\n71.03711 + 97.05276 = 168.08987,\n$$\n$$\nm(b_{2}) = 168.08987 + 1.00728 = 169.09715.\n$$\nWith $z=1$, the $m/z$ value equals this mass.
