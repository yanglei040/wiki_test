            "introduction": "A primary goal in metagenomics is to quantify the diversity within a microbial community, a concept known as alpha diversity. Indices like the Shannon and Simpson indices are used to distill complex community structures into a single number, but they do so in different ways. This practice provides a hands-on opportunity to explore their distinct properties by computationally simulating the introduction of rare species into a community, a task directly relevant to understanding how these indices respond to changes in richness versus evenness .",

            "problem": "In metagenomic analysis of either 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) amplicon data or whole-genome shotgun data, within-sample diversity is often summarized by indices based on the empirical relative abundances of observed taxa. Consider a community represented by a finite list of nonnegative integer read counts $\\mathbf{c} = [c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_S]$ with total $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} c_i$ and corresponding relative abundances $p_i = c_i / N$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,S\\}$. Define the Shannon index (natural logarithm) as $H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln p_i$ and the Simpson concentration index as $D = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^2$. A small influx of additional rare taxa increases richness while minimally altering evenness.\n\nYou must write a program that constructs a deterministic synthetic perturbation of each provided baseline community by reallocating a specified integer number of reads $m$ from a designated existing taxon to $k$ new taxa, each new taxon receiving exactly $m/k$ reads, so that the total read count remains constant. For a given test case with parameters $(\\mathbf{c}, j, m, k)$, where $j$ is a one-based index identifying the existing taxon to be debited, the perturbed community $\\mathbf{c}'$ is obtained by:\n- Replacing $c_j$ by $c_j - m$.\n- Appending $k$ new taxa, each with count $m/k$.\n- Leaving all other counts unchanged.\n\nAssume that $m$ and $k$ are positive integers with $k$ dividing $m$, and that $c_j \\ge m$ so that all counts remain nonnegative. For each test case, compute $H$ and $D$ before and after perturbation and report the boolean value of the statement $\\lvert H' - H \\rvert > \\lvert D' - D \\rvert$, where $H'$ and $D'$ are the indices for $\\mathbf{c}'$ and $H$ and $D$ are the indices for $\\mathbf{c}$.\n\nUse the following test suite, which covers a range of realistic metagenomic compositions and perturbations:\n- Test case A (uneven amplicon-like community): $\\mathbf{c} = [7000,2000,800,150,50]$, $j = 1$, $m = 100$, $k = 10$.\n- Test case B (even community): $\\mathbf{c} = [2000,2000,2000,2000,2000]$, $j = 1$, $m = 100$, $k = 10$.\n- Test case C (highly dominated shotgun-like community): $\\mathbf{c} = [9500,500]$, $j = 1$, $m = 50$, $k = 50$.\n- Test case D (minimal single rare-taxon addition): $\\mathbf{c} = [999,1]$, $j = 1$, $m = 1$, $k = 1$.\n\nAll logarithms must be natural logarithms, and all computations are dimensionless. Your program must produce a single line of output containing the boolean results for the test cases in the order A, B, C, D as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[{\\tt True},{\\tt False},{\\tt True},{\\tt True}]$). The required final outputs are booleans, and no additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "We model a microbial community by a finite set of taxa with read counts $\\mathbf{c} = [c_1,\\dots,c_S]$ and total $N=\\sum_{i=1}^{S} c_i$. The empirical relative abundance of taxon $i$ is $p_i = c_i/N$. The Shannon index is $H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln p_i$, derived from information theory as the entropy of the categorical distribution induced by $\\{p_i\\}$. The Simpson concentration index is $D = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^2$, the probability that two independent reads drawn without replacement but approximated as independent from the relative abundance distribution belong to the same taxon; it emphasizes abundant taxa because the squaring operation increases the weight of large $p_i$.\n\nTo formalize the perturbation that increases richness, fix integers $m>0$ and $k>0$ and a one-based index $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,S\\}$ identifying the source taxon. We construct $\\mathbf{c}'$ by subtracting $m$ from $c_j$ and appending $k$ new taxa, each with count $m/k$. This preserves the total count $N' = N - m + k \\cdot (m/k) = N$. The new relative abundances are $p'_i = c'_i/N$. Because each new taxon has probability mass $f/k$ where $f = m/N$, their contributions to $H$ and $D$ are small when $f$ is small, reflecting rarity.\n\nTo compare sensitivities, define the absolute change in Shannon index as $\\Delta_H = \\lvert H' - H \\rvert$ and the absolute change in Simpson concentration as $\\Delta_D = \\lvert D' - D \\rvert$. Analytically, when a fraction $f$ of mass is moved from one taxon with probability $p_j$ to $k$ new taxa equally, a first-order approximation yields\n- $\\Delta_D \\approx 2 f p_j$ (the leading term arises from the derivative of $p_j^2$),\n- $\\Delta_H \\approx f \\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_j k}{f}\\right) + 1 \\right]$ (from the derivative of $-p \\ln p$ for the donor taxon and the entropy added by the $k$ new taxa).\nFor small $f$ and moderate $k$, the logarithmic term $\\ln(p_j k / f)$ is typically large, so $\\Delta_H$ often exceeds $\\Delta_D$, expressing that the Shannon index is more sensitive to rare taxa than the Simpson concentration index.\n\nWe now compute the quantities exactly from first principles for the specified test suite by:\n- Converting integer counts to probabilities via $p_i = c_i/N$.\n- Computing $H$ and $D$ as defined.\n- Applying the deterministic perturbation $(\\mathbf{c}, j, m, k) \\mapsto \\mathbf{c}'$ with $c'_j = c_j - m$ and $k$ appended counts equal to $m/k$.\n- Recomputing $H'$ and $D'$ and evaluating the boolean $\\Delta_H > \\Delta_D$.\n\nFor each test case:\n- Test case A uses $\\mathbf{c} = [7000,2000,800,150,50]$, $N = 7000 + 2000 + 800 + 150 + 50 = 10000$, with $j = 1$, $m = 100$, $k = 10$. Here $f = m/N = 100/10000 = 0.01$. The perturbation debits the most abundant taxon and creates $10$ rare taxa.\n- Test case B uses $\\mathbf{c} = [2000,2000,2000,2000,2000]$, $N = 10000$, $j = 1$, $m = 100$, $k = 10$, representing an even community perturbed identically.\n- Test case C uses $\\mathbf{c} = [9500,500]$, $N = 10000$, $j = 1$, $m = 50$, $k = 50$, i.e., $f = 0.005$ and many singletons are added.\n- Test case D uses $\\mathbf{c} = [999,1]$, $N = 1000$, $j = 1$, $m = 1$, $k = 1$, adding a single new rare taxon.\n\nIn all cases, the computations yield $\\Delta_H > \\Delta_D$, consistent with the principle that the Shannon index is more sensitive to changes in richness due to rare taxa than the Simpson concentration index.

Define the frequency vector $f(X) \\in [0,1]^{64}$ by\n     $$f(X) = \\frac{c(X)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{64} c_i(X)}.$$\n   - For host $h$ with host coding sequence $H_h$, and viral open reading frame (ORF) sequence $V$, compute\n     $$U_h(V) = \\cos\\!\\left(f(H_h), f(V)\\right) = \\frac{f(H_h) \\cdot f(V)}{\\|f(H_h)\\|_2 \\, \\|f(V)\\|_2}.$$\n\n3) Combined score and prediction:\n   - Given nonnegative weights $w_C$ and $w_U$ with $w_C + w_U = 1$, define\n     $$T_h(C,V) = w_C \\, E_h(C) + w_U \\, U_h(V).$$\n   - Predict the host as the index $h$ that maximizes $T_h(C,V)$. In the event of an exact tie in $T_h$, select the smallest such index.\n\nParameter values to use:\n- Number of candidate hosts: $3$, indexed as $0,1,2$.\n- Maximum mismatch threshold: $m_{\\max} = 1$.\n- Weights: $w_C = 0.7$, $w_U = 0.3$.\n- Host CRISPR spacers:\n  - Host $0$: $S_0 = \\{\\texttt{ATGCTTACGA}, \\texttt{TTTATATAAA}\\}$.\n  - Host $1$: $S_1 = \\{\\texttt{GCGCCGCGGC}, \\texttt{CCGGGCGGCC}\\}$.\n  - Host $2$: $S_2 = \\{\\}$ (no spacers).\n- Host coding DNA sequences $H_h$ are constructed by repeating the following codon patterns $30$ times (concatenate the triplets in order and then repeat the concatenated block):\n  - Host $0$ pattern: [TTT, TTA, TAT, ATA, ATT, AAA, AAT].\n  - Host $1$ pattern: [GCG, GGC, CCG, CGC, GCC, CCC, GGG].\n  - Host $2$ pattern: [CTG, GAT, ATG, ACC, TCC, GTA, GTT].\n\nTest suite:\nProvide four viral test cases. Each test case $i$ supplies a contig string $C_i$ and a viral ORF sequence $V_i$ defined by repeating a codon pattern $5$ times, built analogously to hosts.\n- Test $1$ (happy path; strong CRISPR evidence for host $0$):\n  - $C_1 =$ the string \"GGGATGCTTACGATTTACGCCGTA\".\n  - $V_1$ pattern: [TTT, TTA, TAT, ATA, ATT, AAA, AAT].\n- Test $2$ (boundary on mismatches; CRISPR evidence ties, codon usage breaks in favor of host $1$):\n  - $C_2 =$ the string \"AAAGCGCCGCGGATTGTTTTATATCAAACCC\".\n  - $V_2$ pattern: [GCG, GGC, CCG, CGC, GCC, CCC, GGG].\n- Test $3$ (no CRISPR matches; rely solely on codon usage; favors host $2$):\n  - $C_3 =$ the string \"CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\".\n  - $V_3$ pattern: [CTG, GAT, ATG, ACC, TCC, GTA, GTT].\n- Test $4$ (edge case interplay; one-mismatch CRISPR for host $0$ vs strong codon usage for host $1$; weights favor CRISPR):\n  - $C_4 =$ the string \"TTTATGCTTACGGAAA\".\n  - $V_4$ pattern: [GCG, GGC, CCG, CGC, GCC, CCC, GGG].\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program must produce a single line containing the predictions for the $4$ tests as a comma-separated list of integers in a single pair of square brackets, with no spaces.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of metagenomic analysis, specifically using CRISPR-spacer homology and codon usage bias for host-virus association. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, parameters, and data to compute a unique solution for each test case. The objective is clearly defined, and the scoring model is mathematically sound and free of ambiguity. We will proceed to construct the solution.\n\nThe core task is to determine the most likely host for a given viral contig by maximizing a composite score, $T_h$. For each candidate host $h \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, this score is a weighted average of two components: a CRISPR evidence score $E_h(C)$ and a codon usage similarity score $U_h(V)$. The total score is defined as:\n$$T_h(C,V) = w_C \\, E_h(C) + w_U \\, U_h(V)$$\nThe problem specifies the weights as $w_C = 0.7$ and $w_U = 0.3$.\n\nFirst, we address the computation of the CRISPR evidence score, $E_h(C)$. This score reflects direct physical evidence of past interactions. Its calculation involves several steps:\n$1$. For each spacer $s$ of length $L$ belonging to a host $h$, we must find its best match within the viral contig $C$. This search must account for both the forward orientation of the spacer, $s$, and its reverse complement, $\\mathrm{rc}(s)$. The reverse complement is formed by reversing the sequence string and replacing each nucleotide with its Watson-Crick pair ($\\mathrm{A} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{T}$, $\\mathrm{C} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{G}$).\n$2$. The quality of a match is inverse to the Hamming distance, $d_{\\mathrm{H}}(x,y)$, which counts the number of positions at which two strings $x$ and $y$ of equal length differ.\n$3$. For a given spacer $s$, we compute the best mismatch count, $m^*(s,C)$, by scanning all length-$L$ windows of the contig $C$ and finding the minimum Hamming distance against both $s$ and $\\mathrm{rc}(s)$.\n$$m^*(s,C) = \\min\\left\\{ \\min_{w \\in \\mathcal{W}(C, L)} d_{\\mathrm{H}}(s,w), \\; \\min_{w \\in \\mathcal{W}(C, L)} d_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{rc}(s),w) \\right\\}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{W}(C, L)$ denotes the multiset of all length-$L$ substrings of $C$.\n$4$. A significant match is defined as one where $m^*(s,C)$ is less than or equal to a specified threshold, $m_{\\max} = 1$. The contribution of such a spacer, $\\phi(s,C)$, is a normalized score reflecting the match quality:\n$$\\phi(s,C) = \\begin{cases}\n \\dfrac{L - m^*(s,C)}{L}, & \\text{if } m^*(s,C) \\le m_{\\max} \\\\\n 0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n \\end{cases}$$\nA perfect match ($m^* = 0$) contributes $1$, a $1$-mismatch match contributes $(L-1)/L$, and any match with more than $m_{\\max}$ mismatches contributes $0$.\n$5$. The final CRISPR evidence score for host $h$, $E_h(C)$, is the arithmetic mean of the contributions from all its spacers. If a host has no spacers ($n_h = 0$), its score is $0$.\n$$E_h(C) = \\begin{cases}\n \\dfrac{1}{n_h} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_h} \\phi\\!\\left(s^{(h)}_j, C\\right), & \\text{if } n_h \\ge 1 \\\\\n 0, & \\text{if } n_h = 0.\n \\end{cases}$$\n\nSecond, we implement the codon usage similarity score, $U_h(V)$. This score is based on the principle that a virus's codon usage tends to adapt to that of its host.\n$1$. We establish a fixed, ordered basis of all $64$ DNA codons (e.g., in lexicographical order from `AAA` to `TTT`).\n$2$. For any coding sequence $X$ (either a host's concatenated CDS, $H_h$, or a viral ORF, $V$), we compute a $64$-dimensional codon frequency vector, $f(X)$. This is achieved by first counting the occurrences of each of the $64$ codons in $X$ to get a count vector $c(X)$, and then normalizing this vector by the total number of codons:\n$$f(X) = \\frac{c(X)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{64} c_i(X)}$$\nWe pre-calculate these frequency vectors for the coding material of each host, $f(H_h)$, from the provided patterns.\n$3$. The similarity score $U_h(V)$ is then calculated as the cosine similarity between the host's frequency vector $f(H_h)$ and the virus's frequency vector $f(V)$:\n$$U_h(V) = \\cos\\!\\left(f(H_h), f(V)\\right) = \\frac{f(H_h) \\cdot f(V)}{\\|f(H_h)\\|_2 \\, \\|f(V)\\|_2}$$\nThis score ranges from $0$ (no shared codons) to $1$ (identical frequency distributions).\n\nFinally, for each viral test case $(C_i, V_i)$, we compute the total scores $T_0, T_1, T_2$. The predicted host is the index $h$ that yields the maximum score, $\\arg\\max_h T_h(C_i, V_i)$. In case of an exact tie, the problem specifies selecting the smallest host index, a rule naturally handled by standard `argmax` implementations. The program will execute this full procedure for all $4$ test cases and report the resulting predictions.",
