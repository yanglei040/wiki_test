            "introduction": "Our journey into building predictive models begins with a foundational task: classifying patient outcomes based on probabilistic reasoning. This exercise challenges you to construct a Naive Bayes classifier from first principles to distinguish between a \"null response\" and an \"adverse drug reaction\" . By applying Bayes' theorem, you will learn to systematically combine probabilities from different sources of evidence—including discrete genetic markers and continuous clinical measurements—to arrive at the most likely outcome. This practice is essential for developing a deep intuition for probabilistic modeling, a core skill in bioinformatics.",

Consider a binary class variable $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $Y=0$ denotes a null response and $Y=1$ denotes an adverse drug reaction (ADR). For each individual, you observe a feature vector $X=(g_{\\mathrm{HLA}}, g_T, a)$ composed of the following components: a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) risk allele indicator $g_{\\mathrm{HLA}} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, a transporter loss-of-function indicator $g_T \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and a normalized enzyme activity score $a \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.

            "solution": "The objective is to design a classifier that predicts the class $\\hat{y}$ maximizing the posterior probability $P(Y=y \\mid X=x)$. This is known as the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decision rule.\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{0, 1\\}} P(Y=y \\mid X=x)\n$$\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(Y=y \\mid X=x) = \\frac{p(X=x \\mid Y=y) P(Y=y)}{p(X=x)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $p(X=x)$, is a marginal probability (also called evidence) that acts as a normalizing constant. Since it is independent of the class $y$, it does not affect the maximization. Therefore, the decision rule is equivalent to maximizing the joint probability:\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{0, 1\\}} p(X=x \\mid Y=y) P(Y=y)\n$$\nThe problem specifies equal class priors, $P(Y=0) = P(Y=1) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Thus, the prior probability term also does not influence the maximization and can be omitted. The problem simplifies to maximizing the class-conditional likelihood $p(X=x \\mid Y=y)$:\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{0, 1\\}} p(X=x \\mid Y=y)\n$$\nUsing the conditional independence assumption for the feature vector $x=(g_{\\mathrm{HLA}}, g_T, a)$, the likelihood is:\n$$\np(x \\mid y) = P(g_{\\mathrm{HLA}} \\mid Y=y) \\cdot P(g_T \\mid Y=y) \\cdot f(a \\mid Y=y)\n$$\nTo avoid numerical underflow resulting from the multiplication of small probabilities, and for convenience, it is standard practice to work with the logarithm of the likelihood.

The genotype is specified by two haplotypes. Each haplotype is a string composed from a star-allele token and optional structural modifiers under the following grammar: a simple star allele has the form “*k”, where “k” is a standard star-allele identifier among the set {“*1”, “*2”, “*4”, “*5”, “*10”, “*17”, “*36”, “*41”}; an integer copy number is denoted by suffix “xN” applying to the entire haplotype and indicates $N$ tandem copies on the same chromosome; a tandem hybrid haplotype is denoted “A+B”, which combines two star-allele tokens $A$ and $B$ on a single chromosome segment; copy number may also apply to a tandem hybrid as “(A+B)xN” or “A+BxN”. The per-copy intrinsic activity of a simple star allele $a$ is given by the mapping $\\alpha(a)$ with values $\\alpha(\\text{“*1”})=1.0$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*2”})=1.0$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*4”})=0.0$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*5”})=0.0$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*10”})=0.25$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*17”})=0.5$, $\\alpha(\\text{“*36”})=0.0$, and $\\alpha(\\text{“*41”})=0.5$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a deterministic model to predict the rate of codeine O-demethylation to morphine, a metabolic process catalyzed by the CYP2D6 enzyme. The model is based on a specific pharmacogenomic genotype, defined by two haplotypes, and a fixed plasma concentration of codeine. The solution follows a two-part, rule-based approach: first, mapping the genotype to a numerical activity score, and second, mapping this score and the substrate concentration to a metabolic rate using classical enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe first step is to compute a total activity score, $S$, from the two given haplotype strings, $H_1$ and $H_2$. The total score is the sum of the individual contributions from each haplotype:\n$$\nS = \\mathrm{contrib}(H_1) + \\mathrm{contrib}(H_2)\n$$\nThe calculation of the contribution for a single haplotype, $\\mathrm{contrib}(H)$, depends on its structure, which is parsed from its string representation. A haplotype string specifies a base allele configuration and an optional copy number.\n\nFirst, the copy number, denoted by an integer $c$, is determined. If the string contains the suffix \"xN\", the copy number $c$ is $N$. If this suffix is absent, the copy number is taken to be $c=1$. The remainder of the string specifies the base allele configuration.\n\nThere are two types of base allele configurations:\n1.  **Simple Allele:** The base configuration is a single star-allele, such as “*1” or “*10”. Its contribution is calculated as $c \\cdot \\alpha(a)$, where $a$ is the star-allele identifier and $\\alpha(a)$ is its per-copy intrinsic activity. The problem provides the following activity mapping:\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*1”}) = 1.0$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*2”}) = 1.0$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*4”}) = 0.0$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*5”}) = 0.0$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*10”}) = 0.25$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*17”}) = 0.5$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*36”}) = 0.0$\n    -   $\\alpha(\\text{“*41”}) = 0.5$\n\n2.  **Tandem Hybrid Allele:** The base configuration is a hybrid of two star-alleles, denoted as “A+B”. Its per-copy activity is defined by a specific formula that includes a penalty:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{\\mathrm{tandem}}(A,B) = p_t \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha(A) + \\alpha(B)}{2}\n    $$\n    The tandem penalty factor is given as $p_t=0.8$. The total contribution for this haplotype is then $c \\cdot \\alpha_{\\mathrm{tandem}}(A,B)$.\n\nThe second step is to use the calculated total activity score $S$ to determine the morphine formation rate, $v$, based on the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics. The maximum reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is assumed to be directly proportional to the total enzyme activity, which is represented by the score $S$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nV_{\\max}(S) = V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\cdot \\frac{S}{S_{\\mathrm{WT}}}\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{WT}}=2.0$ is the activity score of a reference wild-type (WT) diplotype (e.g., *1/*1), and $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}=1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is the maximum velocity for this reference.\n\nThe rate of reaction $v$ is then given by the Michaelis-Menten equation, which relates the reaction velocity to the substrate concentration $C$:\n$$\nv(S,C) = V_{\\max}(S) \\cdot \\frac{C}{K_m + C}\n$$\nThe Michaelis constant is given as $K_m=0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. A special condition is defined: if either the activity score $S=0$ or the codeine concentration $C=0$, the reaction rate $v$ is $0$.\n\nThe implementation consists of a function to parse an individual haplotype string to calculate its contribution, and a main procedure to process each test case. The parsing function first isolates the copy number and the base allele string. It then checks for the presence of a hybrid structure (“+”) to decide which activity formula to apply.

After training a linear model, you will use principles from cooperative game theory, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the exact contribution of each genetic and clinical feature to a patient's predicted dose.

            "problem": "You will design and implement an interpretable pharmacogenomic genotype–phenotype prediction model that explains dose recommendations for pairs of patients who have similar genotypes but differ in clinical covariates. The scenario is grounded in the widely studied influence of cytochrome P450 and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex genes on warfarin dosing, using a simple linear model trained by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) or an equivalent additive, cooperative game-theoretic decomposition that satisfies the standard axioms. Your program must be a complete, runnable program that produces the final outputs exactly as specified.\n\nFoundational base and modeling assumptions:\n- Pharmacogenomic genotype affects drug metabolism and drug target sensitivity (Central Dogma: DNA to RNA to protein), leading to dose adjustments. We use the well-tested practice of modeling dose as a linear function of genotype features and clinical covariates when effects are approximately additive for small perturbations.\n- We will train a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (Ordinary Least Squares), a standard and well-tested method for parameter estimation in linear models.\n- We require an interpretable, local explanation of each prediction using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) or an equivalent cooperative game-theoretic additive attribution method that satisfies the standard axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy, and additivity) with a background dataset defined by the empirical feature distribution of the training data.\n\nData specification:\n- Features are ordered and indexed as follows:\n  - Index $0$: CYP2C9 activity score (values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$).\n  - Index $1$: VKORC1 $-1639$ A-count (values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$).\n  - Index $2$: Age in decades (for example, age $50$ years is encoded as $5.0$).\n  - Index $3$: Weight in tens of kilograms (for example, weight $70$ kilograms is encoded as $7.0$).\n\n- Training design matrix $X_{\\text{train}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 4}$ and target vector $y_{\\text{train}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6}$ (stable warfarin dose in mg/day) are given by:\n$$\nX_{\\text{train}}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 5.0 & 7.0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 6.0 & 6.5\\\\\n2 & 2 & 4.0 & 8.0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 7.0 & 5.0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 3.0 & 9.0\\\\\n2 & 1 & 5.5 & 7.5\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\ny_{\\text{train}}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6.3\\\\\n5.55\\\\\n5.2\\\\\n5.2\\\\\n8.3\\\\\n5.55\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nTask requirements:\n1) Fit a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared errors on $(X_{\\text{train}}, y_{\\text{train}})$, including an intercept term. Denote the fitted model as $f(\\mathbf{x})=\\hat{b}+\\sum_{i=0}^{3}\\hat{w}_i x_i$.\n\n2) Define the background dataset for explanations as the empirical distribution of $X_{\\text{train}}$. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) or an equivalent cooperative game-theoretic additive decomposition that satisfies the standard axioms and uses the specified background dataset, decompose each prediction into a baseline term and additive feature attributions. Explicitly, for any input $\\mathbf{x}$, compute an additive decomposition $f(\\mathbf{x})=\\phi_0+\\sum_{i=0}^{3}\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\phi_0$ is the baseline prediction associated with the background and $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$ is the contribution of feature $i$. You must implement an attribution method consistent with the SHAP axioms for a linear model and the stated background.\n\n3) For each test case below, compute:\n   - The predicted dose for patient A, $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})$, in mg/day.\n   - The predicted dose for patient B, $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})$, in mg/day.\n   - The difference $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})$, in mg/day.\n   - The feature index $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ that maximizes the absolute difference in attributions between B and A, i.e., $j=\\arg\\max_{i} \\left|\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})-\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})\\right|$. In the event of a tie, return the smallest such index.\n   - The signed contribution difference for that feature, $\\phi_j(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})-\\phi_j(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})$, in mg/day.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (happy path: identical genotypes, different weight):\n  - Patient A: $\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}=[2,\\,1,\\,6.0,\\,6.0]$\n  - Patient B: $\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}=[2,\\,1,\\,6.0,\\,8.0]$\n- Case $2$ (genotype difference at CYP2C9, same covariates):\n  - Patient A: $\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}=[1,\\,1,\\,5.0,\\,7.0]$\n  - Patient B: $\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}=[2,\\,1,\\,5.0,\\,7.0]$\n- Case $3$ (boundary: identical patients):\n  - Patient A: $\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}=[2,\\,1,\\,5.5,\\,7.5]$\n  - Patient B: $\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}=[2,\\,1,\\,5.5,\\,7.5]$\n\nUnits and rounding:\n- Express all predicted doses and contribution values in mg/day, rounded to three decimal places. The feature index is an integer.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to a test case and itself is a list: $\\left[f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}), f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}), f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}), j, \\phi_j(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)})-\\phi_j(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})\\right]$.\n- The final output must therefore be a single line of the form:\n  - For example, using placeholders: $[[a_1,b_1,d_1,j_1,c_1],[a_2,b_2,d_2,j_2,c_2],[a_3,b_3,d_3,j_3,c_3]]$\n- No spaces are permitted in the output line.

            "solution": "The objective is to construct a linear regression model for warfarin dose prediction and to explain the differences in predictions for pairs of patients using a game-theoretic attribution method equivalent to SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).\n\n**Step 1: Linear Regression Model Fitting**\n\nThe model to be fitted is a linear function of $p=4$ features, including an intercept term:\n$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i x_{i-1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_0 + \\beta_2 x_1 + \\beta_3 x_2 + \\beta_4 x_3$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x} = [x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3]^T$ represents the feature vector. The coefficients $\\mathbf{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4]^T$ are estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared residuals.\n\nWe are given the training data $X_{\\text{train}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 4}$ and $y_{\\text{train}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6}$. To accommodate the intercept $\\beta_0$, we augment the feature matrix $X_{\\text{train}}$ with a leading column of ones, creating the design matrix $X' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 5}$.\n$$\nX' =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 0 & 5.0 & 7.0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 6.0 & 6.5\\\\\n1 & 2 & 2 & 4.0 & 8.0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 7.0 & 5.0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 3.0 & 9.0\\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 & 5.5 & 7.5\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\ny_{\\text{train}}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6.3\\\\\n5.55\\\\\n5.2\\\\\n5.2\\\\\n8.3\\\\\n5.55\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe OLS estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}$ is the solution to the normal equations:\n$$(X'^T X') \\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}} = X'^T y_{\\text{train}}$$\nAssuming $X'^T X'$ is invertible, the solution is given by:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}} = (X'^T X')^{-1} X'^T y_{\\text{train}}$$\nSolving this linear system yields the following coefficient vector:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}} \\approx [9.92349, -1.25301, -0.65000, -0.44157, 0.11747]^T$$\nSo, the intercept is $\\hat{b} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 \\approx 9.923$ and the feature weights are $\\hat{\\mathbf{w}} = [\\hat{w}_0, \\hat{w}_1, \\hat{w}_2, \\hat{w}_3]^T \\approx [-1.253, -0.650, -0.442, 0.117]^T$.\nThe fitted model is:\n$$f(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx 9.923 - 1.253 x_0 - 0.650 x_1 - 0.442 x_2 + 0.117 x_3$$\n\n**Step 2: Attribution Method for Prediction Explanation**\n\nThe problem requires an additive feature attribution method consistent with the SHAP axioms. For a linear model $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat{b} + \\sum_{i=0}^{3} \\hat{w}_i x_i$, the SHAP value for feature $i$ at input $\\mathbf{x}$ is given by:\n$$\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat{w}_i (x_i - E[X_i])$$\nwhere $E[X_i]$ is the expected value of feature $i$ over the background data distribution, which is defined as the empirical distribution of $X_{\\text{train}}$. Thus, $E[X_i]$ is the mean of the $i$-th column of $X_{\\text{train}}$. The base value $\\phi_0$ is the model's expected output over the background:\n$$\\phi_0 = E[f(\\mathbf{X})] = \\hat{b} + \\sum_{i=0}^{3} \\hat{w}_i E[X_i]$$\nThe decomposition $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=0}^{3} \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$ satisfies the efficiency axiom.\n\nThe task is to find the feature that best explains the *difference* in predicted dose between two patients, A and B. The difference in attribution for feature $i$ is:\n$$\\Delta\\phi_i = \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}) - \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)})$$\nSubstituting the formula for $\\phi_i$:\n$$\\Delta\\phi_i = \\left[\\hat{w}_i (x_i^{(B)} - E[X_i])\\right] - \\left[\\hat{w}_i (x_i^{(A)} - E[X_i])\\right]$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta\\phi_i = \\hat{w}_i (x_i^{(B)} - x_i^{(A)})$$\nThis elegant result shows that the change in a feature's contribution is simply its weight multiplied by the change in its value. This allows us to compute the required quantities without explicitly calculating the mean feature values from the training data. The feature $j$ that explains the largest portion of the prediction difference is found by:\n$$j = \\arg\\max_{i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}} |\\Delta\\phi_i| = \\arg\\max_{i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}} |\\hat{w}_i (x_i^{(B)} - x_i^{(A)})|$$\nTies are broken by selecting the smallest index $j$.\n\n**Step 3: Test Case Evaluation**\n\nWe now apply these formulas to the three specified test cases. All results are rounded to three decimal places.\n\n**Case 1:**\n- Patient A: $\\mathbf{x}^{(A)} = [2, 1, 6.0, 6.0]$\n- Patient B: $\\mathbf{x}^{(B)} = [2, 1, 6.0, 8.0]$\n- Predicted dose for A: $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}) \\approx 9.923 - 1.253(2) - 0.650(1) - 0.442(6.0) + 0.117(6.0) \\approx 4.817$\n- Predicted dose for B: $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}) \\approx 9.923 - 1.253(2) - 0.650(1) - 0.442(6.0) + 0.117(8.0) \\approx 5.052$\n- Dose difference: $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(B)}) - f(\\mathbf{x}^{(A)}) \\approx 5.052 - 4.817 = 0.235$\n- Attribution differences:\n  - $\\Delta\\phi_0 = \\hat{w}_0(2 - 2) = 0$\n  - $\\Delta\\phi_1 = \\hat{w}_1(1 - 1) = 0$\n  - $\\Delta\\phi_2 = \\hat{w}_2(6.0 - 6.0) = 0$\n  - $\\Delta\\phi_3 = \\hat{w}_3(8.0 - 6.0) = 2 \\hat{w}_3 \\approx 0.235$\n- Feature with max attribution difference: The only non-zero difference is for feature $3$.
