            "introduction": "Before diving into complex calculations, it is crucial to understand the fundamental principle of multiple testing correction. This exercise presents a common scenario in genomics to test your understanding of the final decision rule: when faced with a raw $p$-value and an FDR-adjusted $p$-value, which one dictates your conclusion?  Mastering this concept is the first step toward correctly interpreting high-throughput biological data.",

            "problem": "In a large-scale differential gene expression study, a systems biologist uses Ribonucleic Acid sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare gene activity in cancer cells treated with a new drug versus untreated control cells. This analysis involves simultaneously testing 20,000 genes to identify which ones show a statistically significant change in expression.\n\nFor one particular gene, `GENE123`, the initial statistical test yields a raw p-value of 0.04. However, to account for the large number of simultaneous tests, the biologist applies a multiple testing correction procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). After this correction, the FDR-adjusted p-value (also known as a q-value) for `GENE123` is calculated to be 0.35.\n\nThe research team has set their significance threshold for this study at an FDR of 5% (i.e., 0.05). Based on this information, which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion regarding the differential expression of `GENE123`?\n\nA. The gene is significantly differentially expressed because its raw p-value (0.04) is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05.\n\nB. The gene is not significantly differentially expressed because its FDR-adjusted p-value (0.35) is greater than the chosen FDR threshold (0.05).\n\nC. The result is inconclusive; the raw p-value suggests significance while the adjusted p-value does not, so a new experiment is required to resolve the contradiction.\n\nD. The gene is significantly differentially expressed because an FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.35 indicates that only 35% of the discoveries are expected to be false.\n\nE. The gene is a known false positive discovery because its raw p-value was not substantially smaller than 0.05, leading to a large adjustment.",
            "solution": "We formalize the setting. Let $m=20000$ be the number of simultaneously tested hypotheses (genes), and let the target false discovery rate be $\\alpha=0.05$. For the specific gene, denote the raw p-value by $p$ and the FDR-adjusted p-value (q-value) by $\\tilde{p}$. The data provide $p=0.04$ and $\\tilde{p}=0.35$.\n\nThe decision rule under FDR control (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg or any equivalent FDR-controlling procedure) is: reject the null hypothesis for a given gene (declare it significantly differentially expressed) at level $\\alpha$ if and only if $\\tilde{p} \\leq \\alpha$. The quantity $\\tilde{p}$ is the minimal FDR level at which the gene would be called significant.\n\nApplying the rule with $\\alpha=0.05$, we compare $\\tilde{p}=0.35$ to $\\alpha=0.05$ and obtain $0.350.05$, hence we do not reject the null hypothesis for this gene. Therefore, the gene is not significantly differentially expressed at the chosen FDR level.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because it ignores multiple testing; after multiplicity adjustment, decisions must be based on $\\tilde{p}$, not on the raw $p$ alone.\n- B is correct: $\\tilde{p}=0.35\\alpha=0.05$, so the gene is not significant.\n- C is incorrect because there is no contradiction; the adjustment appropriately alters the decision threshold under multiple testing.\n- D reflects a misinterpretation: $\\tilde{p}=0.35$ means the gene would only be called significant if one were willing to control FDR at $0.35$, which exceeds the chosen $\\alpha=0.05$; thus it is not significant at the study’s threshold.\n- E is incorrect because one cannot label the gene a “known false positive”; the proper conclusion is simply that it is not significant at the specified FDR level.\n\nHence the correct choice is B.",

            "problem": "In a data-dependent acquisition immunopeptidomics experiment, peptide-spectrum matches are aggregated to the peptide level to test whether each candidate peptide is presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on the cell surface. For each of $m$ peptide-level null hypotheses of non-presentation, a $p$-value is obtained from a calibrated target-decoy competition calibrated score. Assume that under any true null hypothesis the $p$-value is stochastically dominated by the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ and that $p$-values across hypotheses are independent or satisfy positive regression dependence on a subset (PRDS), as is commonly approximated after decoy-based calibration.\n\nStarting from the definition of the False Discovery Rate (FDR), $\\operatorname{FDR}=\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{\\max(R,1)}\\right]$, where $V$ is the number of false rejections and $R$ is the total number of rejections, derive a step-up multiple-testing rule that guarantees $\\operatorname{FDR}\\leq \\alpha$ for any configuration with $m_{0}$ true nulls, with equality bounded by $\\operatorname{FDR}\\leq \\frac{m_{0}}{m}\\alpha$ under the stated dependence conditions.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin from the definition of False Discovery Rate (FDR). For $m$ hypotheses with $m_{0}$ true nulls, let $R$ denote the total number of rejected hypotheses and $V$ the number of rejected true nulls. The False Discovery Rate is $\\operatorname{FDR}=\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{\\max(R,1)}\\right]$. We assume that for each true null hypothesis the corresponding $p$-value, denoted $p_{j}$, satisfies $\\mathbb{P}(p_{j}\\leq t)\\leq t$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$ (super-uniformity), and that the vector of $p$-values is independent or satisfies positive regression dependence on a subset (PRDS).\n\nOur goal is to construct a data-dependent rejection rule that ensures $\\operatorname{FDR}\\leq \\alpha$ for a chosen target $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, with the standard Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) upper bound $\\operatorname{FDR}\\leq \\frac{m_{0}}{m}\\alpha$.\n\nWe consider a step-up rule: sort the observed $p$-values in nondecreasing order, $p_{(1)}\\leq p_{(2)}\\leq\\cdots\\leq p_{(m)}$. For a nondecreasing sequence of critical values $\\{c_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ in $[0,1]$, define the step-up index\n$$\nk=\\max\\{i\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}: p_{(i)}\\leq c_{i}\\},\n$$\nwith the convention that $k=0$ if the set is empty. Then reject all hypotheses with $p$-values at most $p_{(k)}$ (equivalently, all $p$-values at most $c_{k}$). We will choose $c_{i}=\\frac{i}{m}\\alpha$ and show the Benjamini–Hochberg guarantee.\n\nDefine indicator variables for the $m_{0}$ true nulls: for a true null indexed by $j$, let $I_{j}=\\mathbf{1}\\{p_{j}\\text{ is rejected}\\}$. Under the step-up rule with $c_{i}=\\frac{i}{m}\\alpha$, the event $\\{p_{j}\\text{ is rejected}\\}$ implies $p_{j}\\leq c_{R}=\\frac{R}{m}\\alpha$, because the rejection threshold is monotone in $R$ and the largest rejected ordered $p$-value satisfies $p_{(R)}\\leq \\frac{R}{m}\\alpha$.

The BH rejection threshold $p^{\\star}$, defined as the largest $p$-value among the rejected hypotheses (equivalently $p_{(k)}$), is\n$$\np^{\\star}=p_{(4)}=0.004.\n$$\nTherefore, all hypotheses with $p$-values at most $0.004$ are rejected, and the single numerical threshold requested is $0.004$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step for applying both multiple testing correction procedures is to sort the $m=10$ p-values in ascending order. Let $p_{(i)}$ be the $i$-th smallest p-value.\nThe given set of p-values is $\\{0.2, 0.043, 0.013, 0.028, 0.006, 0.001, 0.019, 0.037, 0.024, 0.009\\}$.\nThe sorted p-values are:\n$p_{(1)} = 0.001$\n$p_{(2)} = 0.006$\n$p_{(3)} = 0.009$\n$p_{(4)} = 0.013$\n$p_{(5)} = 0.019$\n$p_{(6)} = 0.024$\n$p_{(7)} = 0.028$\n$p_{(8)} = 0.037$\n$p_{(9)} = 0.043$\n$p_{(10)} = 0.2$\n\nFirst, we apply the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) step-up procedure to control the FDR at level $q=0.05$.\nThe procedure is to find the largest integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$.\nIf such a $k$ exists, we reject the null hypotheses corresponding to the p-values $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \\dots, p_{(k)}$. Otherwise, we reject no hypotheses.\nHere, $m=10$ and $q=0.05$. We need to find the largest $k$ for which $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{10}(0.05) = k \\times 0.005$.\nWe check this condition for each $i=1, \\dots, 10$:\n- For $i=1$: $p_{(1)} = 0.001$. Compare with $\\frac{1}{10}(0.05) = 0.005$. Since $0.001 \\le 0.005$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=2$: $p_{(2)} = 0.006$. Compare with $\\frac{2}{10}(0.05) = 0.01$. Since $0.006 \\le 0.01$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=3$: $p_{(3)} = 0.009$. Compare with $\\frac{3}{10}(0.05) = 0.015$. Since $0.009 \\le 0.015$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=4$: $p_{(4)} = 0.013$. Compare with $\\frac{4}{10}(0.05) = 0.02$. Since $0.013 \\le 0.02$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=5$: $p_{(5)} = 0.019$. Compare with $\\frac{5}{10}(0.05) = 0.025$. Since $0.019 \\le 0.025$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=6$: $p_{(6)} = 0.024$. Compare with $\\frac{6}{10}(0.05) = 0.03$. Since $0.024 \\le 0.03$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=7$: $p_{(7)} = 0.028$. Compare with $\\frac{7}{10}(0.05) = 0.035$. Since $0.028 \\le 0.035$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=8$: $p_{(8)} = 0.037$. Compare with $\\frac{8}{10}(0.05) = 0.04$. Since $0.037 \\le 0.04$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=9$: $p_{(9)} = 0.043$. Compare with $\\frac{9}{10}(0.05) = 0.045$. Since $0.043 \\le 0.045$, the condition holds.\n- For $i=10$: $p_{(10)} = 0.2$. Compare with $\\frac{10}{10}(0.05) = 0.05$. Since $0.2 \\not\\le 0.05$, the condition does not hold.\nThe largest index $k$ for which the condition $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$ is satisfied is $k=9$.\nTherefore, the BH procedure rejects the $9$ null hypotheses corresponding to the $9$ smallest p-values. The number of rejections is $N_{\\mathrm{BH}} = 9$.\n\nNext, we apply the Holm–Bonferroni step-down procedure to control the FWER at level $\\alpha=0.05$.\nThe procedure tests the sorted p-values sequentially. For each $i=1, \\dots, m$, we compare $p_{(i)}$ with the adjusted significance level $\\frac{\\alpha}{m-i+1}$. The procedure stops at the first index $k$ for which $p_{(k)}  \\frac{\\alpha}{m-k+1}$. We then reject the null hypotheses corresponding to $p_{(1)}, \\dots, p_{(k-1)}$ and fail to reject the rest.\nHere, $m=10$ and $\\alpha=0.05$. We check the condition $p_{(i)} \\le \\frac{0.05}{10-i+1}$.\n- For $i=1$: $p_{(1)} = 0.001$. The threshold is $\\frac{0.05}{10-1+1} = \\frac{0.05}{10} = 0.005$. Since $0.001 \\le 0.005$, we reject the first null hypothesis and proceed to the next step.\n- For $i=2$: $p_{(2)} = 0.006$. The threshold is $\\frac{0.05}{10-2+1} = \\frac{0.05}{9} \\approx 0.00556$. Since $0.006  \\frac{0.05}{9}$, the condition fails. The procedure stops here.\nWe reject the null hypotheses for $i  2$, which means only the hypothesis corresponding to $p_{(1)}$ is rejected. All other hypotheses (for $i=2, \\dots, 10$) are not rejected.\nTherefore, the number of rejections under the Holm–Bonferroni procedure is $N_{\\mathrm{Holm}} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required value, which is the difference between the number of rejections from the two procedures:\n$N_{\\mathrm{BH}} - N_{\\mathrm{Holm}} = 9 - 1 = 8$.\nThis demonstrates the generally higher power of the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, which controls the less stringent FDR, compared to the Holm–Bonferroni procedure, which controls the more stringent FWER.",
