            "problem": "In the field of evolutionary biology, ancestral sequence reconstruction is a computational method used to infer the protein or nucleic acid sequences of extinct ancestors. One of the simplest and most fundamental methods for this task is the principle of maximum parsimony. This principle states that the preferred evolutionary history is the one that requires the smallest number of evolutionary changes (e.g., amino acid substitutions) to explain the sequences observed in modern-day organisms.\n\nConsider a set of four homologous proteins: P1, P2, P3, and P4. Their evolutionary relationship is described by the phylogenetic tree `((P1, P2)Anc1, (P3, P4)Anc2)Anc-Root`. This notation means that P1 and P2 share a recent common ancestor, Anc1. Similarly, P3 and P4 share a recent common ancestor, Anc2. Both Anc1 and Anc2, in turn, descend from a last common ancestor for all four proteins, Anc-Root.\n\nWe are examining a single position in the alignment of these four protein sequences. For any given ancestor in the tree, a reconstruction of the amino acid at this position is considered \"unambiguous\" if a single amino acid state minimizes the total number of substitutions to its descendants. Conversely, the reconstruction is \"ambiguous\" if two or more different amino acid states are equally parsimonious, meaning they result in the same minimum number of substitutions.\n\nThe options below list the amino acids found at this specific position for the four modern proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4), using their standard single-letter codes. Which of the following scenarios results in an ambiguous reconstruction for the root ancestor, Anc-Root, while simultaneously ensuring that the reconstructions for *both* intermediate ancestors, Anc1 and Anc2, are unambiguous?\n\nA.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the posterior probability of the root state in two different scenarios. For a given rooting state $s \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and observed data $D$, Bayes' theorem gives the posterior probability as:\n$$\n\\Pr(R=s \\mid D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D \\mid R=s)\\Pr(R=s)}{\\Pr(D)}\n$$\nThe total probability of the data is $\\Pr(D) = \\sum_{s' \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\Pr(D \\mid R=s')\\Pr(R=s')$. Given the uniform prior $\\Pr(R=0) = \\Pr(R=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Pr(R=0 \\mid D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D \\mid R=0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\Pr(D \\mid R=0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\Pr(D \\mid R=1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{L(0)}{L(0) + L(1)}\n$$\nwhere $L(s) = \\Pr(D \\mid R=s)$ is the likelihood of the data given the root is in state $s$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the transition probability matrix $P(b) = \\exp(Qb)$. The generator is $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1 \\\\ 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $Q$ are given by $\\det(Q - \\lambda I) = (-1-\\lambda)^2 - 1 = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda = 0$, which yields $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The matrix exponentiation gives the transition probabilities over a branch of length $b$:\n$$\nP(b) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{00}(b)  P_{01}(b) \\\\ P_{10}(b)  P_{11}(b) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\exp(-2b)  1-\\exp(-2b) \\\\ 1-\\exp(-2b)  1+\\exp(-2b) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies $b = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln 3$. We substitute this into the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-2b) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\ln 3\\right) = \\exp(-\\ln 3) = 3^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe transition probabilities are therefore:\n$P_{00}(b) = P_{11}(b) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{4}{3}) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$P_{01}(b) = P_{10}(b) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario (i)**\nThe tree has root $R$ and leaves $A, B$. The data are $D_i = \\{A=0, B=0\\}$. The branches $(R,A)$ and $(R,B)$ both have length $b$.\nThe likelihoods are calculated as follows, using the conditional independence of the subtrees descending from $R$:\n$$\nL_i(0) = \\Pr(A=0, B=0 \\mid R=0) = \\Pr(A=0 \\mid R=0) \\Pr(B=0 \\mid R=0) = P_{00}(b) \\cdot P_{00}(b) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{9}\n$$\n$$\nL_i(1) = \\Pr(A=0, B=0 \\mid R=1) = \\Pr(A=0 \\mid R=1) \\Pr(B=0 \\mid R=1) = P_{10}(b) \\cdot P_{10}(b) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nThe posterior probability of the root being in state $0$ is:\n$$\n\\Pr(R=0 \\mid D_i) = \\frac{L_i(0)}{L_i(0) + L_i(1)} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{9}}{\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{9}}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\n\n**Analysis of Scenario (ii)**\nThe tree has root $R$ with children $X, Y$. $X$ has children $A, B$ and $Y$ has children $C, D$. The data are $D_{ii} = \\{A=0, B=0, C=1, D=1\\}$. All branches have length $b$.\nWe use Felsenstein's pruning algorithm to compute the likelihoods. Let $L_K(s)$ be the conditional likelihood of the data in the subtree rooted at node $K$, given that $K$ is in state $s$.\nThe likelihoods at the leaves are delta functions: $L_A=(1,0)$, $L_B=(1,0)$, $L_C=(0,1)$, $L_D=(0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the conditional likelihood vectors for the internal nodes $X$ and $Y$.\nFor node $X$ (with children $A=0, B=0$):\n$L_X(0) = P_{00}(b)L_A(0) \\cdot P_{00}(b)L_B(0) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{4}{9}$\n$L_X(1) = P_{10}(b)L_A(0) \\cdot P_{10}(b)L_B(0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{9}$\nSo, $L_X = (\\frac{4}{9}, \\frac{1}{9})$.\n\nFor node $Y$ (with children $C=1, D=1$):\n$L_Y(0) = P_{01}(b)L_C(1) \\cdot P_{01}(b)L_D(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{9}$\n$L_Y(1) = P_{11}(b)L_C(1) \\cdot P_{11}(b)L_D(1) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{4}{9}$\nSo, $L_Y = (\\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{4}{9})$.\n\nNext, we compute the likelihoods at the root $R$ by propagating the likelihoods from its children $X$ and $Y$.\n$$\nL_{ii}(s) = \\left( \\sum_{s_X=0}^1 P_{s,s_X}(b) L_X(s_X) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{s_Y=0}^1 P_{s,s_Y}(b) L_Y(s_Y) \\right)\n$$\nFor $R=0$:\n$$\nL_{ii}(0) = \\left( P_{00}(b)L_X(0) + P_{01}(b)L_X(1) \\right) \\left( P_{00}(b)L_Y(0) + P_{01}(b)L_Y(1) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nL_{ii}(0) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{1}{27} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2}{27} + \\frac{4}{27} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{9}{27} \\right) \\left( \\frac{6}{27} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{2}{27}\n$$\nFor $R=1$:\n$$\nL_{ii}(1) = \\left( P_{10}(b)L_X(0) + P_{11}(b)L_X(1) \\right) \\left( P_{10}(b)L_Y(0) + P_{11}(b)L_Y(1) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nL_{ii}(1) = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{2}{27} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{8}{27} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{6}{27} \\right) \\left( \\frac{9}{27} \\right) = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{27}\n$$\nThe likelihoods are equal: $L_{ii}(0) = L_{ii}(1)$.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular evolution, and provides all necessary parameters for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed with a complete, reasoned solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in applying Felsenstein's pruning algorithm, a dynamic programming approach for computing the likelihood of sequence data on a phylogenetic tree. The evolution of nucleotides at each site of the sequence is assumed to be independent and identically distributed according to a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC).\n\nThe specified model is the Jukes–Cantor model, which assumes equal rates of substitution between any two distinct nucleotides and a uniform stationary distribution $\\pi = (\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\tfrac{1}{4}, \\tfrac{1}{4}, \\tfrac{1}{4})$ over the alphabet $\\mathcal{A} = \\{\\text{A}, \\text{C}, \\text{G}, \\text{T}\\}$.

Thus, the MAP estimate is equivalent to the Maximum Likelihood estimate, and we only need to compute and maximize the likelihood $L_R(k) = P(\\text{Data} | \\text{state}_R=k)$ for each state $k$.\n\nThe pruning algorithm computes these likelihoods via a post-order traversal of the tree, from the leaves to the root. For each site in the alignment, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization at Leaves**: For each leaf node $u$, we define a conditional likelihood vector $L_u$ of size $4$. If the observed nucleotide at the current site is $c$, corresponding to integer $c_{int}$, the vector is $L_u(k) = \\delta_{k, c_{int}}$ (a vector of zeros with a $1$ at position $c_{int}$). If the data is missing ('N'), all states are considered equally possible, so $L_u$ is a vector of ones, $L_u(k) = 1$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n2.  **Recursion at Internal Nodes**: For an internal node $u$ with children $v_1, \\dots, v_m$, let the branch from $u$ to $v_j$ have length $t_j$. The likelihood vector $L_u$ is computed after the vectors for all its children are known. The likelihood of the data in the subtrees of its children, given state $k$ at node $u$, is the product of contributions from each child's subtree. The contribution from child $v_j$ is obtained by summing over all possible states $s$ at node $v_j$:\n    $$ L_u(k) = \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{s=0}^{3} P_{ks}(t_j) \\cdot L_{v_j}(s) \\right) $$\n    The sum $\\sum_{s=0}^{3} P_{ks}(t_j) \\cdot L_{v_j}(s)$ is the $k$-th element of the matrix-vector product $P(t_j) L_{v_j}$. The final vector $L_u$ is the element-wise product of these resulting vectors from all children.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation at Root**: The traversal terminates at the root node $R$. The resulting vector $L_R$ contains the likelihoods $P(\\text{Data} | \\text{state}_R=k)$ for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n4.  **MAP State Determination**: The MAP state for the site is found by identifying the index $k$ that maximizes $L_R(k)$. If there is a tie, the smallest integer index is chosen as per the problem specification.\n\nThis entire procedure is repeated for each site in the sequence alignment to construct the full ancestral sequence. The implementation will represent the tree structure, pre-calculate the transition matrices as needed, and perform the post-order traversal for each site to find the MAP root state.",
