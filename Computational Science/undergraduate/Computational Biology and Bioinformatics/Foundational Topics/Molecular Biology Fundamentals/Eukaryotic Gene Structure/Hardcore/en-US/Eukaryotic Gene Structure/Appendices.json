This exercise  challenges you to perform this fundamental task of identifying a valid Open Reading Frame (ORF) by scanning a sequence for a start codon and an in-frame stop codon.

A crucial step is identifying a valid Open Reading Frame (ORF) and ensuring it is associated with appropriate translational initiation signals.\n\nYou are given the following 45-nucleotide DNA sequence, which represents the non-template (coding) strand, written in the 5' to 3' direction:\n\n`5'-GCAATGTGAGGCACCATGGCATCAGCTGCAGCTGCACTAGCATAA-3'`\n\nFor your analysis, please use the following standard definitions:\n- The start codon is `ATG`.\n- The stop codons are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n- An Open Reading Frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon in the same reading frame.\n- The length of an ORF is defined as the number of nucleotides from, and including, the first base of the start codon up to, and including, the last base of the codon immediately preceding the stop codon.\n- A strong Kozak consensus sequence is considered present if the base at position -3 is an Adenine (A) or Guanine (G), AND the base at position +4 is a Guanine (G). Positions are relative to the A of the `ATG` codon, which is defined as position +1.\n\nIdentify the longest possible ORF in any of the three forward reading frames and determine if its corresponding start codon is preceded by a strong Kozak consensus sequence.

Its length is computed by $L = b_{\\text{end}} - b_{\\text{start}} + 1$ using the last base before the stop (base 6) and the first base of the start (base 4), giving $L = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3$ nucleotides.\n- ORF starting at 16–18 has the next in-frame stop at 43–45. The last base before the stop is position 42, so the length is $L = 42 - 16 + 1 = 27$ nucleotides.\n\nCheck frames 2 and 3 for ATG:\n- Frame 2 codons (2–4, 5–7, ...): no ATG occurs.\n- Frame 3 codons (3–5, 6–8, ...): no ATG occurs.\nTherefore, no ORFs exist in frames 2 or 3.\n\nThus, the longest ORF is the one starting at positions 16–18 with length $27$ nucleotides.\n\nEvaluate the Kozak context for this longest ORF. For the ATG at positions 16–18, define the A of ATG as position $+1$:\n- Position $-3$ corresponds to sequence position $13$, which is A (satisfies A/G criterion).\n- Position $+4$ corresponds to sequence position $19$, which is G (satisfies the required G).\nA strong Kozak consensus requires both $-3 \\in \\{\\text{A}, \\text{G}\\}$ and $+4 = \\text{G}$. Since both conditions are met, a strong Kozak sequence is present.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the longest ORF has a length of 27 nucleotides and a strong Kozak sequence is present.",

            "solution": "The 5' UTR spans nucleotides 1 through 36, and the primary ORF begins at nucleotide 37 by definition.

Starting at this AUG, translation would proceed codon by codon until the first in-frame stop codon:\nAUG (start), CCG, UAC, GGC, GCG, then UGA (stop) at nucleotides 22–24.\n\nThus, the uORF extends from AUG to the UGA stop, encoding the amino acids specified by the five sense codons before the stop. The uORF length, measured as the number of amino acids and excluding the stop codon, is therefore $5$.\n\nRegarding regulatory effect, uORFs located in the 5' UTR typically reduce translation efficiency of the downstream main ORF by capturing scanning ribosomes and causing termination before the main start codon, with reinitiation often being inefficient. Hence, the most likely regulatory effect is repression of the main ORF.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is a uORF encoding $5$ amino acids that likely represses translation of the main ORF.",

In eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing, the 3' acceptor site consists of a polypyrimidine tract followed immediately by a nearly invariant dinucleotide $AG$ at the last two nucleotides of the intron, positioned at $-2$ and $-1$ relative to the exon start. The exon typically begins at the $+1$ position, often with $G$, but this is less invariant than the $AG$.\n\nIn the given sequence:\n5'-...

Among the options:\n\n- U5C: converts a pyrimidine to another pyrimidine within the polypyrimidine tract; minimal effect.\n- A7G: changes a purine to purine in the tract; does not eliminate the critical $AG$ and is less disruptive than mutating the invariant dinucleotide.\n- G10A: converts the invariant $AG$ to $AA$ at positions 9–10, abolishing the essential $AG$ recognized by the spliceosome (including U2AF35), which is most likely to block usage of this acceptor.\n- G11C: alters the first nucleotide of the exon ($+1$ position). While $G$ at $+1$ is common, it is not invariant; the upstream $AG$ remains intact, so the site is still likely to be used.\n- C4G: introduces a purine into the polypyrimidine tract, weakening it but not as severely as destroying the invariant $AG$.\n\nTherefore, the mutation G10A (option C) most directly abolishes the invariant $AG$ at the 3' splice acceptor site and is most likely to force exon skipping by redirecting the spliceosome to the next downstream acceptor.",
