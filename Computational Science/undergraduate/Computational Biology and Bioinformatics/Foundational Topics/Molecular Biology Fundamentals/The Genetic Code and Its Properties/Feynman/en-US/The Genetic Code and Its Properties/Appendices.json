This process follows a precise set of rules, known as the genetic code, which dictates how nucleotide triplets, or codons, correspond to specific amino acids. This first exercise provides fundamental practice in applying these rules, starting from identifying the correct initiation site to reading the code in the proper frame until a termination signal is reached . Mastering this core skill is the first step toward understanding any aspect of protein synthesis, from normal gene expression to the effects of genetic mutation.",

            "introduction": "The integrity of the genetic code's reading frame is paramount for producing a functional protein. While single base substitutions can sometimes be benign, mutations that add or remove nucleotides can have far more drastic consequences. This practice explores the critical difference between an in-frame mutation (a deletion of three nucleotides) and a frameshift mutation (a deletion of a single nucleotide) .

            "problem": "A researcher is studying a gene that encodes a small, 150-amino-acid enzyme crucial for cellular metabolism. The normal function of this enzyme depends on its precise three-dimensional structure. The beginning of the coding sequence for this gene on the template strand of the DNA is:\n`3'-TAC CCG AAT GCT...-5'`\nThis corresponds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence that is translated by the ribosome:\n`5'-AUG GGC UUA CGA...-3'`\n\nTwo different mutations are introduced into separate cell cultures at this locus.\n\n*   **Mutation 1:** A deletion of the first cytosine (C) nucleotide in the second codon of the template DNA strand.\n*   **Mutation 2:** A deletion of the entire second codon, \"CCG\", from the template DNA strand.\n\nAssume that in both cases transcription and translation proceed past the mutation site and that the genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets.

Mutation 2 will have a more severe effect because deleting an entire codon is a change the cell's proofreading mechanisms cannot correct, unlike a single base deletion.\n\nE.

            "solution": "Interpretation of the provided sequences and genetic code principles:\n- The template DNA strand is given 3' to 5' as: 3'-TAC CCG AAT GCT...-5'. By standard base-pairing rules and antiparallel transcription, the mRNA is 5'-AUG GGC UUA CGA...-3', which translates as: AUG (Met), GGC (Gly), UUA (Leu), CGA (Arg), ...\n- The ribosome reads mRNA in non-overlapping triplets starting at AUG; any insertion or deletion not in multiples of three shifts the reading frame (frameshift), altering all downstream codons and typically introducing an early stop codon.\n\nAnalyze Mutation 1 (deletion of the first C in the second template codon):\n- Original template around the start: 3'-TAC CCG AAT GCT...-5'.\n- Deleting the first C of the second codon yields: 3'-TAC CGA ATG CT...-5'.\n- Transcribing from the start codon, the mRNA remains 5'-AUG at the beginning (unchanged first codon). Continuing past the deletion, the template bases after the initial TAC are now CGA ATG CT..., which transcribe to mRNA bases GCU UAC GA..., so the mutated mRNA from the start reads: 5'-AUG GCU UAC GA...-3'.\n- Grouping into codons from the AUG start: AUG | GCU | UAC | GA..., which differs from the original AUG | GGC | UUA | CGA....\n- This is a frameshift beginning at the second codon: every downstream codon is altered, and a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is likely to appear shortly thereafter, producing a truncated, misfolded, and almost certainly non-functional enzyme. Because this frameshift occurs near the start, the truncation will be early and severe.\n\nAnalyze Mutation 2 (deletion of the entire second template codon CCG):\n- Removing the template 3'-CCG-5' yields the template: 3'-TAC AAT GCT...-5'.\n- The corresponding mRNA is 5'-AUG UUA CGA...-3'.\n- Translation from the start gives AUG (Met), UUA (Leu), CGA (Arg), ...; the reading frame is preserved, and the only change is the loss of the glycine residue encoded by the deleted codon. The remainder of the protein sequence is unchanged.\n- An in-frame single–amino-acid deletion can affect function if the residue is critical, but in general it is far less disruptive than an early frameshift that scrambles the sequence and causes early termination.\n\nComparison and conclusion:\n- Mutation 1 causes a frameshift near the start, altering all downstream amino acids and likely introducing an early stop codon, producing a severely truncated, non-functional enzyme.\n- Mutation 2 removes one amino acid but preserves the reading frame; the rest of the protein sequence is maintained, so the functional impact is typically less severe than a frameshift.\n- Therefore, the most accurate statement is that Mutation 1 is likely to have a more severe effect than Mutation 2 for the reasons above.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically grounded exercise in computational biology. It asks for an evaluation of the Standard Genetic Code's robustness against single-nucleotide mutations, quantified by the change in the physico-chemical properties of the encoded amino acids. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute a cost functional for the Standard Genetic Code, $g_{\\text{std}}$, and compare it to the costs of a large ensemble of randomly generated alternative codes. The final quantity to be calculated, $q$, represents the fraction of random codes that are more \"optimal\" (i.e., have a lower cost) than the standard code under the given metric.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the provided data and definitions into a computational framework.\nThe set of nucleic acids is $\\mathcal{N} = \\{U, C, A, G\\}$. The set of all codons is $\\mathcal{C} = \\mathcal{N}^3$, so $|\\mathcal{C}|=4^3=64$. The provided Standard Genetic Code, $g_{\\text{std}}$, partitions $\\mathcal{C}$ into $21$ sets: one for each of the $20$ amino acids in the set $\\mathcal{A}$, and one for the 'Stop' signal. We are given that there are $3$ stop codons, which means the subset of sense codons, $\\mathcal{S}$, has size $|\\mathcal{S}| = 64 - 3 = 61$. The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index is a function $h: \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Both $g_{\\text{std}}$ and $h$ are provided and will be stored in dictionary data structures for efficient lookup.\n\nThe cost functional is defined as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(g;w_t,w_v) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{E}|} \\sum_{\\{c_i,c_j\\}\\in\\mathcal{E}} w(c_i,c_j)\\,\\big(h(g(c_i)) - h(g(c_j))\\big)^2\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we must first construct the adjacency set $\\mathcal{E}$. $\\mathcal{E}$ consists of all unordered pairs of distinct sense codons $\\{c_i, c_j\\}$ that differ by a Hamming distance of $1$. We will iterate through all $\\binom{61}{2}$ pairs of sense codons, check their Hamming distance, and if it is $1$, add the pair to a list representing $\\mathcal{E}$. For determinism, we establish a fixed, sorted order for the $61$ sense codons. The elements of $\\mathcal{E}$ can then be stored as pairs of indices into this ordered list.\n\nFor each pair $\\{c_i, c_j\\} \\in \\mathcal{E}$, we must also determine the mutation weight $w(c_i, c_j)$. This weight depends on whether the single nucleotide substitution is a transition or a transversion. A transition is a substitution within the same chemical class: purine $\\leftrightarrow$ purine ($\\{A,G\\}$) or pyrimidine $\\leftrightarrow$ pyrimidine ($\\{C,U\\}$). A transversion is a substitution between classes. If the mutation is a transition, $w(c_i, c_j)=w_t$; otherwise, it is a transversion and $w(c_i, c_j)=w_v$. During the construction of $\\mathcal{E}$, we identify the differing nucleotide in each pair and classify the mutation, storing this information alongside the pair of indices. This pre-computation of the codon graph and mutation types is performed once, as it is independent of the genetic code mapping $g$ and the weights $w_t, w_v$.\n\nWith these structures in place, we can implement a function `calculate_cost(g, wt, wv)` which takes a code $g$ (represented as an ordered list of amino acid assignments for the sense codons) and the weights $w_t$ and $w_v$. The function iterates through the pre-computed set $\\mathcal{E}$. For each edge $\\{c_i, c_j\\}$, it retrieves the assigned amino acids $a_i = g(c_i)$ and $a_j = g(c_j)$, finds their hydropathy values $h(a_i)$ and $h(a_j)$, determines the appropriate weight $w_t$ or $w_v$, and adds the term $w(c_i, c_j)(h(a_i) - h(a_j))^2$ to a running sum. Finally, this sum is normalized by the total number of edges, $|\\mathcal{E}|$.\n\nThe main procedure involves several steps for each test case $(M, w_t, w_v, b, \\text{seed})$:\n1. Initialize a pseudorandom number generator with the given `seed` for reproducibility. We use `numpy.random.default_rng`.\n2. Compute the reference cost, $\\operatorname{Cost}_{\\text{std}} = \\operatorname{Cost}(g_{\\text{std}}; w_t, w_v)$. This is the benchmark against which random codes will be compared.\n3. A counter for \"better\" codes is initialized to $0$.\n4. A loop runs $M$ times. In each iteration, a random code $g^{(m)}$ is generated according to the model specified by the parameter $b$.\n    - If $b=1$ (degeneracy-preserving model), we must preserve the exact number of codons assigned to each amino acid as in the standard code. This is achieved by creating a list of the $61$ amino acids assigned by $g_{\\text{std}}$ to the sense codons and then generating a random permutation of this list. This permuted list represents the amino acid assignments of the new random code $g^{(m)}$.\n    - If $b=0$ (unconstrained model), each of the $61$ sense codons is assigned an amino acid by drawing independently and uniformly with replacement from the set $\\mathcal{A}$ of $20$ amino acids.\n5. For each randomly generated code $g^{(m)}$, its cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(g^{(m)}; w_t, w_v)$ is computed.\n6. This cost is compared to $\\operatorname{Cost}_{\\text{std}}$. If $\\operatorname{Cost}(g^{(m)}) < \\operatorname{Cost}_{\\text{std}}$, the counter is incremented.\n7. After $M$ iterations, the final result $q$ is the value of the counter divided by $M$.\n\nThis entire process is encapsulated in a single program. The pre-computation steps are performed first, followed by a loop over the specified test cases, each performing the simulation and calculating the corresponding value of $q$.",
