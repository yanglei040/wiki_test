This exercise uses the familiar concept of \"making change\" to illustrate one of the most fundamental limitations of this paradigm. Framed in the context of designing a restriction digest, you will see how a series of locally optimal choices—always selecting the largest possible fragment—does not necessarily lead to the most efficient global solution . This practice is a foundational check on algorithmic intuition, training you to identify scenarios where a simple greedy approach may fall short.",

            "problem": "In an in silico planning exercise for restriction digest design in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) workflows, consider the following abstracted change-making model. You have a synthetic backbone containing standardized, tandemly repeated size modules. Each module corresponds to a fragment that can be excised by a specific restriction enzyme. An application of any enzyme excises exactly one module of a fixed size and incurs a monetary cost of $1$ unit. Enzymes can be applied any number of times, and modules may be excised in any order. The goal is to excise modules whose total length equals a target length $L$, leaving behind the desired remaining construct. The available module sizes (in kilobase pairs (kbp)) are:\n- $1$ kbp,\n- $3$ kbp,\n- $4$ kbp.\n\nLet the target length be $L = 6$ kbp. A commonly used greedy policy in this setting chooses, at each step, the largest available module size that does not exceed the remaining length to be excised.\n\nWorking from the definitions above, determine the total cost incurred by this greedy policy and the minimal possible total cost over all valid excision sequences for this instance. Report, as a single number, the difference (greedy total cost) $-$ (optimal minimal total cost). Express the final answer as an integer without units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific and logical soundness.\n\n**1. Extraction of Givens:**\n- Problem Type: An abstracted change-making model derived from a bioinformatics context (restriction digest).\n- Available Module Sizes (denominations): $\\{1, 3, 4\\}$ kilobase pairs (kbp).\n- Cost: Each excision (module selection) costs $1$ unit.\n- Target Length ($L$): $L = 6$ kbp.\n- Greedy Policy Definition: At each step, select the largest available module size that does not exceed the remaining length to be excised.\n- Objective: Calculate the difference between the total cost incurred by the greedy policy and the minimal possible total cost (optimal solution).\n\n**2. Validation:**\n- Scientific Grounding: The problem is a computational abstraction of restriction mapping, a valid concept in molecular biology. It is mathematically equivalent to the classic change-making problem, which is a fundamental topic in computer science and algorithms. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- Well-Posedness and Objectivity: The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters ($L$, module sizes, cost function, and greedy algorithm definition) explicitly stated. The terminology is precise and objective. A unique greedy solution and at least one optimal solution exist.\n- Verdict: The problem is valid. It is a standard exercise in algorithm analysis.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the cost of a specific greedy algorithm and the cost of an optimal solution for making change for a target value $L$ using a given set of denominations. The cost is defined as the number of items (modules) used.\n\nLet the set of available module sizes be $S = \\{1, 3, 4\\}$. The target length is $L = 6$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Greedy Policy Cost**\nThe greedy policy dictates that at each step, we must choose the largest module size from $S$ that is less than or equal to the remaining length.\n\nLet $L_{rem}$ be the remaining length to be excised. Initially, $L_{rem} = 6$.\n\n- **Step 1:** The current remaining length is $L_{rem} = 6$. The available module sizes are $\\{1, 3, 4\\}$. The largest module size less than or equal to $6$ is $4$.\n  - We excise a module of size $4$ kbp.\n  - The new remaining length is $L_{rem} = 6 - 4 = 2$.\n  - The cost incurred so far is $1$.\n\n- **Step 2:** The current remaining length is $L_{rem} = 2$. The available module sizes are $\\{1, 3, 4\\}$. The largest module size less than or equal to $2$ is $1$.\n  - We excise a module of size $1$ kbp.\n  - The new remaining length is $L_{rem} = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n  - The total cost is now $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n- **Step 3:** The current remaining length is $L_{rem} = 1$. The available module sizes are $\\{1, 3, 4\\}$. The largest module size less than or equal to $1$ is $1$.\n  - We excise a module of size $1$ kbp.\n  - The new remaining length is $L_{rem} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n  - The total cost is now $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe process terminates as the remaining length is $0$. The sequence of excised modules according to the greedy policy is $(4, 1, 1)$. The total cost, which is the number of modules excised, is $3$. Let this be $C_{greedy}$.\n$$C_{greedy} = 3$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Optimal (Minimal) Cost**\nThe optimal solution corresponds to finding a linear combination of the module sizes that sums to $L$ while minimizing the number of terms. We are looking for non-negative integers $n_1, n_3, n_4$ such that:\n$$1 \\cdot n_1 + 3 \\cdot n_3 + 4 \\cdot n_4 = 6$$\nand the total cost, $C = n_1 + n_3 + n_4$, is minimized.\n\nWe can find the optimal solution by systematically examining combinations of the available module sizes that sum to $6$.\n- **Combination 1:** Use two modules of size $3$ kbp.\n  - Total length: $3 + 3 = 6$.\n  - Total cost (number of modules): $2$. This is a valid solution.\n- **Combination 2:** Use one module of size $4$ kbp.\n  - Remaining length to be covered: $6 - 4 = 2$.\n  - The only way to form a length of $2$ is by using two modules of size $1$ kbp.\n  - The full combination is $(4, 1, 1)$.\n  - Total length: $4 + 1 + 1 = 6$.\n  - Total cost: $3$. This is the greedy solution found previously.\n- **Combination 3:** Use only modules of size $1$ kbp.\n  - The combination is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$.\n  - Total cost: $6$.\n- **Combination 4:** Use one module of size $3$ kbp.\n  - Remaining length: $6 - 3 = 3$.\n  - This can be filled with one more module of size $3$ kbp (which is Combination 1) or three modules of size $1$ kbp.\n  - The latter combination is $(3, 1, 1, 1)$.\n  - Total cost: $4$.\n\nBy comparing the costs of all valid combinations, we have:\n- Cost of $(3, 3)$ is $2$.\n- Cost of $(4, 1, 1)$ is $3$.\n- Cost of $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ is $6$.\n- Cost of $(3, 1, 1, 1)$ is $4$.\n\nThe minimum cost is $2$. Let this be $C_{optimal}$.\n$$C_{optimal} = 2$$\nThis demonstrates the well-known property that a greedy algorithm is not always optimal for the general change-making problem.\n\n**Part 3: Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the difference between the greedy cost and the optimal cost.\n$$\\text{Difference} = C_{greedy} - C_{optimal} = 3 - 2 = 1$$\nThe difference is $1$.",

The greedy walk starting at $S=p_{0,1}$ terminates at the wrong target $W=p_{2,0}$.\n2. The correct target $C=p_{2,2}$ is the unique global maximizer of the potential $U$ on the vertex set $V$.\n\nWe will analyze each of the four candidate maps.

The neighbors are $p_{0,0}$, $p_{1,1}$, and $p_{0,2}$.\n  - $U(p_{0,0})=3$, so $\\Delta U = 3-0=3$.\n  - $U(p_{1,1})=1$, so $\\Delta U = 1-0=1$.\n  - $U(p_{0,2})=2$, so $\\Delta U = 2-0=2$.\n  The maximum increase is $\\Delta U = 3$, corresponding to the move to $p_{0,0}$.

With four taxa, after identifying the first pair $\\{i,j\\}$, the remaining two taxa $\\{k,l\\}$ are the only ones not yet in a cluster. The heuristic rule \"select the pair of distinct taxa that have not yet been merged\" forces the pairing of $\\{k,l\\}$.\n4.  Thus, two clusters $(i,j)$ and $(k,l)$ are formed. These are then connected.\n5.  The resulting topology is invariably of the form $((i,j),(k,l))$, determined solely by the smallest entry in the original distance matrix.\n\nWe will now analyze each provided distance matrix. Let the taxa $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ correspond to indices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\n### Option A Analysis\nThe distance matrix is:\n$$ D_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 & 9\\\\ 2 & 0 & 3 & 9\\\\ 3 & 3 & 0 & 5\\\\ 9 & 9 & 5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe pairwise distances are $d(A,B)=2$, $d(A,C)=3$, $d(B,C)=3$, $d(C,D)=5$, $d(A,D)=9$, $d(B,D)=9$.\n\n**GH Topology for A:**\nThe minimum distance in the matrix $D_A$ is $d(A,B)=2$. Following the GH procedure, taxa $A$ and $B$ are clustered together. The remaining taxa, $C$ and $D$, form the second cluster. The resulting topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**UPGMA Topology for A:**\n- **Step 1:** The initial clusters are $\\{A\\}, \\{B\\}, \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}$. The minimum distance is $d(A,B)=2$. We merge $A$ and $B$ to form cluster $(A,B)$. The current clusters are $\\{(A,B), \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}\\}$.\n- **Step 2:** We compute the new distance matrix for these clusters. The distance $d(C,D)=5$ is retained. The new distances involving the cluster $(A,B)$ are:\n  $$ d((A,B),C) = \\frac{d(A,C) + d(B,C)}{2} = \\frac{3+3}{2} = 3 $$\n  $$ d((A,B),D) = \\frac{d(A,D) + d(B,D)}{2} = \\frac{9+9}{2} = 9 $$\n- **Step 3:** The distances between the current clusters are $d((A,B),C)=3$, $d((A,B),D)=9$, and $d(C,D)=5$. The minimum among these is $3$.\n- **Step 4:** UPGMA therefore merges the cluster $(A,B)$ with the cluster $\\{C\\}$, forming a new cluster $((A,B),C)$. The final step merges this with $\\{D\\}$.\nThe sequence of merges is $(A,B)$, then $((A,B),C)$, then $(((A,B),C),D)$. This corresponds to the rooted topology $(((A,B),C),D)$, where $D$ is the outgroup to the $(A,B,C)$ clade.\n\n**Conclusion for A:**\nThe GH topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$. The UPGMA topology is $(((A,B),C),D)$. These are different topologies. Therefore, matrix A yields different results for the two procedures.\n\nVerdict for Option A: **Correct**.\n\n### Option B Analysis\nThe distance matrix is:\n$$ D_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & 8 & 8\\\\ 2 & 0 & 8 & 8\\\\ 8 & 8 & 0 & 3\\\\ 8 & 8 & 3 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe pairwise distances are $d(A,B)=2$, $d(C,D)=3$, and all others are $8$.\n\n**GH Topology for B:**\nThe minimum distance in $D_B$ is $d(A,B)=2$. The GH procedure clusters $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$. The topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**UPGMA Topology for B:**\n- **Step 1:** The minimum distance is $d(A,B)=2$. Merge $A$ and $B$. Current clusters: $\\{(A,B), \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}\\}$.\n- **Step 2:** Compute new distances:\n  $$ d((A,B),C) = \\frac{d(A,C) + d(B,C)}{2} = \\frac{8+8}{2} = 8 $$\n  $$ d((A,B),D) = \\frac{d(A,D) + d(B,D)}{2} = \\frac{8+8}{2} = 8 $$\n- **Step 3:** The distances between current clusters are $d((A,B),C)=8$, $d((A,B),D)=8$, and $d(C,D)=3$. The minimum is $d(C,D)=3$.\n- **Step 4:** UPGMA merges $C$ and $D$. The two resulting clusters are $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$. The final step merges these two.\nThe topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**Conclusion for B:**\nBoth GH and UPGMA yield the topology $((A,B),(C,D))$. The topologies are identical.\n\nVerdict for Option B: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option C Analysis\nThe distance matrix is:\n$$ D_C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 4 & 7\\\\ 1 & 0 & 5 & 8\\\\ 4 & 5 & 0 & 2\\\\ 7 & 8 & 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe pairwise distances are $d(A,B)=1$, $d(C,D)=2$, $d(A,C)=4$, $d(B,C)=5$, $d(A,D)=7$, $d(B,D)=8$.\n\n**GH Topology for C:**\nThe minimum distance in $D_C$ is $d(A,B)=1$. The GH procedure clusters $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$. The topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**UPGMA Topology for C:**\n- **Step 1:** The minimum distance is $d(A,B)=1$. Merge $A$ and $B$. Current clusters: $\\{(A,B), \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}\\}$.\n- **Step 2:** Compute new distances:\n  $$ d((A,B),C) = \\frac{d(A,C) + d(B,C)}{2} = \\frac{4+5}{2} = 4.5 $$\n  $$ d((A,B),D) = \\frac{d(A,D) + d(B,D)}{2} = \\frac{7+8}{2} = 7.5 $$\n- **Step 3:** The distances between current clusters are $d((A,B),C)=4.5$, $d((A,B),D)=7.5$, and $d(C,D)=2$. The minimum is $d(C,D)=2$.\n- **Step 4:** UPGMA merges $C$ and $D$. The two resulting clusters are $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$. The final step merges these two.\nThe topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**Conclusion for C:**\nBoth GH and UPGMA yield the topology $((A,B),(C,D))$. The topologies are identical.\n\nVerdict for Option C: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option D Analysis\nThe distance matrix is:\n$$ D_D = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 6 & 6\\\\ 3 & 0 & 6 & 6\\\\ 6 & 6 & 0 & 2\\\\ 6 & 6 & 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe pairwise distances are $d(C,D)=2$, $d(A,B)=3$, and all others are $6$.\n\n**GH Topology for D:**\nThe minimum distance in $D_D$ is $d(C,D)=2$. The GH procedure clusters $(C,D)$ and $(A,B)$. The topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**UPGMA Topology for D:**\n- **Step 1:** The minimum distance is $d(C,D)=2$. Merge $C$ and $D$.

The minimum is $d(A,B)=3$.\n- **Step 4:** UPGMA merges $A$ and $B$. The two resulting clusters are $(C,D)$ and $(A,B)$. The final step merges these two.\nThe topology is $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\n**Conclusion for D:**\nBoth GH and UPGMA yield the topology $((A,B),(C,D))$. The topologies are identical.\n\nVerdict for Option D: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only matrix for which the Greedy Taxon-Pair Heuristic and UPGMA produce different rooted tree topologies is matrix A. The discrepancy arises because UPGMA's distance averaging step can alter the relative closeness of clusters, changing the merge order compared to a simple heuristic that only considers the original pairwise distances. In case A, the averaged distance $d((A,B),C)=3$ becomes smaller than the original distance $d(C,D)=5$, leading UPGMA to group $C$ with $(A,B)$ before $D$ is considered, resulting in an asymmetric topology. For options B, C, and D, this reordering does not occur.",
