            "solution": "The problem posed is well-defined and grounded in the principles of computational biology. We shall proceed with its solution directly.\n\nThe Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for a coding sequence of length $L$ codons is defined as the geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness weights $w_{c_i}$ of its constituent codons:\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI} = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{L} w_{c_i}\\right)^{1/L} $$\nThe given DNA sequence is $\\mathrm{ATGGCNCGNTTNCCN}$. With the reading frame starting at the first base, the sequence is partitioned into $L=5$ codons:\n$c_1 = \\mathrm{ATG}$, $c_2 = \\mathrm{GCN}$, $c_3 = \\mathrm{CGN}$, $c_4 = \\mathrm{TTN}$, $c_5 = \\mathrm{CCN}$.\n\nThe weight of the first codon is given as $w(\\mathrm{ATG})=1$. This is a constant factor. The subsequent codons contain the ambiguous nucleotide $\\mathrm{N}$, which can be any of $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{G}$, or $\\mathrm{T}$. The choices for $\\mathrm{N}$ at each ambiguous position are independent.\nThe expression for the CAI is therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI} = \\left( w(\\mathrm{ATG}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{GCN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{CGN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{TTN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{CCN}) \\right)^{1/5} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI} = \\left( 1 \\cdot w(\\mathrm{GCN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{CGN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{TTN}) \\cdot w(\\mathrm{CCN}) \\right)^{1/5} $$\nThe function $f(x) = x^{1/5}$ is a strictly increasing function for positive arguments $x$. Since all given weights $w_c$ are in the interval $(0, 1]$, their product will also be a positive number. Consequently, to find the minimum and maximum possible values of the CAI, we must find the minimum and maximum of the product of the weights $\\prod_{i=1}^{5} w_{c_i}$.\nDue to the independence of the nucleotide choice for each `N`, the total product is maximized by choosing the sequence of codons that maximizes each individual weight, and minimized by choosing the sequence that minimizes each individual weight.\n\nFirst, let us determine the maximum possible CAI. This requires us to select the nucleotide for each `N` such that the corresponding codon weight is maximal. We examine the weights provided for each ambiguous codon family:\n- For $c_2 = \\mathrm{GCN}$: The available weights are $w(\\mathrm{GCA})=0.2$, $w(\\mathrm{GCC})=1$, $w(\\mathrm{GCG})=0.7$, and $w(\\mathrm{GCT})=0.4$. The maximum weight is $w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{GCN}) = 1$.\n- For $c_3 = \\mathrm{CGN}$: The available weights are $w(\\mathrm{CGA})=0.1$, $w(\\mathrm{CGC})=1$, $w(\\mathrm{CGG})=0.8$, and $w(\\mathrm{CGT})=0.6$. The maximum weight is $w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{CGN}) = 1$.\n- For $c_4 = \\mathrm{TTN}$: The available weights are $w(\\mathrm{TTA})=0.05$, $w(\\mathrm{TTC})=1$, $w(\\mathrm{TTG})=0.1$, and $w(\\mathrm{TTT})=0.5$. The maximum weight is $w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{TTN}) = 1$.\n- For $c_5 = \\mathrm{CCN}$: The available weights are $w(\\mathrm{CCA})=0.3$, $w(\\mathrm{CCC})=1$, $w(\\mathrm{CCG})=0.9$, and $w(\\mathrm{CCT})=0.6$. The maximum weight is $w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{CCN}) = 1$.\n\nThe product of the maximum possible weights is:\n$$ P_{\\max} = w(\\mathrm{ATG}) \\cdot w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{GCN}) \\cdot w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{CGN}) \\cdot w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{TTN}) \\cdot w_{\\max}(\\mathrm{CCN}) $$\n$$ P_{\\max} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 $$\nThe maximum CAI is the fifth root of this product:\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI}_{\\max} = (1)^{1/5} = 1 $$\nAs the problem requires rounding to four significant figures, the maximum value is $1.000$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum possible CAI. This requires selecting the nucleotide for each `N` that results in the minimum codon weight.\n- For $c_2 = \\mathrm{GCN}$: The minimum weight is $w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{GCN}) = \\min\\{0.2, 1, 0.7, 0.4\\} = 0.2$.\n- For $c_3 = \\mathrm{CGN}$: The minimum weight is $w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{CGN}) = \\min\\{0.1, 1, 0.8, 0.6\\} = 0.1$.\n- For $c_4 = \\mathrm{TTN}$: The minimum weight is $w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{TTN}) = \\min\\{0.05, 1, 0.1, 0.5\\} = 0.05$.\n- For $c_5 = \\mathrm{CCN}$: The minimum weight is $w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{CCN}) = \\min\\{0.3, 1, 0.9, 0.6\\} = 0.3$.\n\nThe product of the minimum possible weights is:\n$$ P_{\\min} = w(\\mathrm{ATG}) \\cdot w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{GCN}) \\cdot w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{CGN}) \\cdot w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{TTN}) \\cdot w_{\\min}(\\mathrm{CCN}) $$\n$$ P_{\\min} = 1 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.3 $$\n$$ P_{\\min} = 0.02 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.3 = 0.001 \\cdot 0.3 = 0.0003 $$\nThe minimum CAI is the fifth root of this product:\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI}_{\\min} = (0.0003)^{1/5} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we compute:\n$$ \\mathrm{CAI}_{\\min} = (3 \\times 10^{-4})^{1/5} \\approx 0.19743286 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimum value is $0.1974$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair of (minimum, maximum) CAI values.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the difference in Shannon entropy, $D = H(Q) - H(P)$, between a genome-wide codon frequency distribution, $Q$, and a gene-specific codon frequency distribution, $P$. This quantity is a fundamental concept in bioinformatics for analyzing codon usage bias. A high entropy value signifies a uniform, or unbiased, usage of codons, whereas a low entropy value indicates a skewed distribution, where certain codons are strongly preferred. A positive value for $D$ suggests that the gene's codon usage ($P$) is more biased (has lower entropy) than the genomic average ($Q$), a common feature of highly expressed genes.\n\nThe Shannon entropy of a discrete probability distribution $R = (r_i)_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}}$ is given in bits by the formula:\n$$\nH(R) = - \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}} r_i \\log_2 r_i\n$$\nwhere the summation is over all $61$ sense codons in the set $\\mathcal{A}$. By convention, $0 \\log_2 0 = 0$.\n\nWe will now solve each of the three test cases methodically.\n\nFirst, we establish the set of sense codons, $\\mathcal{A}$. The genetic code consists of $4^3 = 64$ possible codons. The three stop codons are $\\text{TAA}$, $\\text{TAG}$, and $\\text{TGA}$.

Let this subset of codons be $\\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$. There are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible codons ending in 'C' and $16$ ending in 'G'. None of the three stop codons end in 'C'. One stop codon, $\\text{TAG}$, is in the set of codons ending in 'G'. Thus, there are $16$ sense codons ending in 'C' and $16 - 1 = 15$ sense codons ending in 'G'. The total size of $\\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$ is $|\\mathcal{A}_{GC3}| = 16 + 15 = 31$.\n    The sequence $S_1$ is formed by concatenating these $31$ codons, repeated twice. The total number of codons in the sequence is $N_1 = 31 \\times 2 = 62$. Each codon $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$ appears twice, so its empirical probability is $p_i = 2/62 = 1/31$. Codons not in $\\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$ have a probability of $0$. This constitutes a uniform distribution over the $31$ codons in $\\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$.\n    The entropy of this distribution is:\n    $$\n    H(P_1) = - \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{GC3}} \\frac{1}{31} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{31}\\right) = -31 \\left(\\frac{1}{31} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{31}\\right)\\right) = -\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{31}\\right) = \\log_2(31)\n    $$\n\n-   **Genome Distribution $Q_1$**:\n    For each codon $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{GC3}$ (size $31$), the weight is $w_i = 2$.

All weights provided below are strictly positive, and you must only use the listed codons for each amino acid.\n\nRelative adaptiveness weights $w(c)$ for codons (DNA alphabet) are specified for the amino acids that appear in the test suite:\n- Alanine ($\\mathrm{A}$): GCT ($0.35$), GCC ($1.0$), GCA ($0.25$), GCG ($0.5$).\n- Glycine ($\\mathrm{G}$): GGT ($0.3$), GGC ($1.0$), GGA ($0.2$), GGG ($0.5$).\n- Leucine ($\\mathrm{L}$): TTA ($0.2$), TTG ($0.3$), CTT ($0.25$), CTC ($0.5$), CTA ($0.1$), CTG ($1.0$).\n- Serine ($\\mathrm{S}$): TCT ($0.4$), TCC ($0.6$), TCA ($0.3$), TCG ($1.0$), AGT ($0.2$), AGC ($0.8$).\n- Threonine ($\\mathrm{T}$): ACT ($0.4$), ACC ($1.0$), ACA ($0.3$), ACG ($0.7$).\n- Lysine ($\\mathrm{K}$): AAA ($0.6$), AAG ($1.0$).\n- Isoleucine ($\\mathrm{I}$): ATT ($0.85$), ATC ($1.0$), ATA ($0.1$).\n- Arginine ($\\mathrm{R}$): CGT ($0.7$), CGC ($1.0$), CGA ($0.1$), CGG ($0.2$), AGA ($0.05$), AGG ($0.05$).\n- Methionine ($\\mathrm{M}$): ATG ($1.0$).\n- Tryptophan ($\\mathrm{W}$): TGG ($1.0$).\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: amino acid sequence \"MKT\".\n- Case $2$: amino acid sequence \"GAS\".\n- Case $3$: amino acid sequence \"ILRW\".\n- Case $4$: amino acid sequence \"MWM\".\n\nFor each case, report only the CAI value of your selected optimal coding sequence, rounded to exactly $6$ digits after the decimal point as a decimal number. Use the fixed target $v=0.7$ for all cases. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results in order for Cases $1$ through $4$, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example: \"[r1,r2,r3,r4]\".",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology, specifically codon usage bias, and is mathematically well-posed. All necessary data and constraints are provided, and no contradictions exist. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to find a DNA coding sequence $S$ for a given amino acid sequence of length $L$, such that the Codon Adaptation Index, $\\mathrm{CAI}(S)$, is as close as possible to a target value $v=0.7$. The $\\mathrm{CAI}$ is defined as the geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness weights $w(c_i)$ of the constituent codons $c_i$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CAI}(S) = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{L} w(c_i) \\right)^{1/L}\n$$\nThe primary objective is to minimize the absolute difference $|\\mathrm{CAI}(S) - v|$. A set of tie-breaking rules is specified for cases where multiple sequences yield the same minimal difference.\n\nThis is a combinatorial optimization problem. For an amino acid sequence $a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_L$, let the number of synonymous codons for each amino acid $a_i$ be $n_i$. The total number of possible DNA sequences that encode the given protein fragment is the product $\\prod_{i=1}^L n_i$. We must search this discrete space for an optimal solution.\n\nLet us evaluate the size of the search space for each test case to determine the feasibility of a brute-force approach.\n- Case $1$ (\"MKT\", $L=3$): The number of choices are $1$ for Methionine (M), $2$ for Lysine (K), and $4$ for Threonine (T). The total number of sequences is $1 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n- Case $2$ (\"GAS\", $L=3$): The number of choices are $4$ for Glycine (G), $4$ for Alanine (A), and $6$ for Serine (S). The total is $4 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 96$.\n- Case $3$ (\"ILRW\", $L=4$): The choices are $3$ for Isoleucine (I), $6$ for Leucine (L), $6$ for Arginine (R), and $1$ for Tryptophan (W). The total is $3 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 108$.\n- Case $4$ (\"MWM\", $L=3$): The choices are $1$ for M, $1$ for W, and $1$ for M. There is only $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$ possible sequence.\n\nThe number of candidate sequences is small in all cases, making a brute-force enumeration computationally trivial and algorithmically sound. The method is as follows:\n1.  Generate all possible DNA coding sequences for the given amino acid sequence. This is done by taking the Cartesian product of the sets of available codons for each position in the amino acid sequence.\n2.  For each generated sequence $S = c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_L$, calculate its $\\mathrm{CAI}(S)$. This involves computing the product of weights $P = \\prod_{i=1}^L w(c_i)$ and then taking the $L$-th root, $\\mathrm{CAI}(S) = P^{1/L}$.\n3.  Identify the optimal sequence by applying the specified criteria in hierarchical order.\n\nThe selection criteria are:\n1.  Minimize $|\\mathrm{CAI}(S) - v|$, where $v=0.7$.\n2.  If a tie exists in criterion $1$, prefer sequences where $\\mathrm{CAI}(S) \\le v$.\n3.  If a tie still persists, choose the lexicographically smallest DNA sequence $S$.\n\nA robust method to implement this multi-level optimization is to sort all candidate solutions. For each candidate solution, represented by its DNA sequence $S$ and its calculated $\\mathrm{CAI}$ value, we can construct a composite sort key. A suitable key is the tuple:\n$$\n\\left( |\\mathrm{CAI}(S) - v|, (\\mathrm{CAI}(S) > v), S \\right)\n$$\nSorting a list of these tuples in ascending order will place the optimal solution at the very beginning. The logic is as follows:\n- The primary sorting is on $|\\mathrm{CAI}(S) - v|$, which addresses the main objective.\n- For ties in the first element, the second element, a Boolean $(\\mathrm{CAI}(S) > v)$, is used. In computation, `False` is treated as $0$ and `True` as $1$. Therefore, a solution with $\\mathrm{CAI}(S) \\le v$ (evaluating to `False`) will be ranked before a solution with $\\mathrm{CAI}(S) > v$ (evaluating to `True`), satisfying the second criterion.\n- If both of the first two elements are identical for two solutions, the third element, the sequence string $S$ itself, is used for comparison. Standard lexicographical string comparison will identify the alphabetically smallest sequence, satisfying the third criterion.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is therefore:\nFor each amino acid sequence:\n1.  Construct a list of all possible coding sequences and their corresponding $\\mathrm{CAI}$ values.\n2.  Sort this list using the composite key defined above.\n3.  The first element of the sorted list is the optimal solution.\n4.  Extract the $\\mathrm{CAI}$ value of this optimal solution, round it to the required precision ($6$ decimal places), and report it.\n\nThis procedure guarantees finding the unique optimal solution according to the problem's rules. For the specific case of Arginine (R) which has two codons (AGA, AGG) with the same weight $w=0.05$, the lexicographical tie-breaker on $S$ ensures a unique choice is made if they are part of otherwise identical optimal candidates.",
