Under a linear resource-allocation burden model, the fitness reduction due to protein expression is proportional to the proteome fraction invested, with proportionality coefficient $k = 1.5$ in units of fitness reduction per unit proteome fraction.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics and molecular evolution, specifically regarding gene duplication, fitness costs, and the interplay between selection and genetic drift. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and provides all necessary information and definitions to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the minimum selective advantage, denoted $s_{\\min}$, that a newly duplicated gene must confer to be retained by selection. The problem provides a specific criterion for this retention.\n\nFirst, we must quantify the initial fitness cost associated with the duplication event. The problem states that the duplicate gene imposes a burden due to the cost of its expression. This cost, $C$, is proportional to the proteome mass fraction, $f_{d}$, that the duplicate's protein product occupies. The constant of proportionality is given as $k$.\n\nThe fitness reduction is therefore $k \\times f_{d}$. The initial selection coefficient due purely to this burden is given as $-C$. Thus, the cost $C$ is:\n$$\nC = k \\cdot f_{d}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Proportionality coefficient, $k = 1.5$.\n- Proteome mass fraction of the duplicate, $f_{d} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we calculate the expression cost $C$:\n$$\nC = 1.5 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, representing the selection coefficient against the duplicate gene due to its expression burden alone.\n\nNext, the problem posits that the duplicate gene acquires a novel function that provides a beneficial selection coefficient, $s$. The net selection coefficient of the duplicate, $s_{\\text{net}}$, which accounts for both the new benefit and the existing cost, is defined as:\n$$\ns_{\\text{net}} = s - C\n$$\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition provided for \"retention by selection.\" This condition is met if the duplicate's net selection coefficient, $s_{\\text{net}}$, exceeds the magnitude of the genetic drift barrier. The drift barrier represents the threshold below which selection is ineffective compared to the stochastic effects of genetic drift. The problem specifies this barrier's magnitude for a new mutation in a Wright–Fisher population as $\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}$, where $N_{e}$ is the effective population size.\n\nThe effective population size is given as $N_{e} = 10^{7}$.\n\nThe condition for retention by selection is therefore expressed as the following inequality:\n$$\ns_{\\text{net}} > \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_{\\text{net}}$, we get:\n$$\ns - C > \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the minimum selective advantage, $s_{\\min}$, required for retention. This minimum value corresponds to the boundary condition of the inequality. That is, $s_{\\min}$ is the value of $s$ for which the net selective advantage is exactly equal to the drift barrier magnitude. Any value of $s$ greater than this $s_{\\min}$ will satisfy the condition for retention.\n$$\ns_{\\min} - C = \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nSolving for $s_{\\min}$, we obtain:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = C + \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the known values for $C$ and $N_{e}$ into this equation.\n$$\ns_{\\min} = (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{7}}\n$$\nLet's evaluate the drift barrier term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{7}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-7} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the value of $s_{\\min}$:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = 0.0075 + 0.00000005 = 0.00750005\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.00750005$ are $7$, $5$, $0$, and $0$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $0$, so we round down (i.e., truncate at that position).\nThe value of $s_{\\min}$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.007500$.\n\nThis result indicates that for the duplicate gene to overcome its significant expression cost of $C=0.0075$ and also overcome the drift barrier in this large population, the new beneficial function it acquires must provide a selective advantage of at least $s_{\\min} \\approx 0.007500$. The contribution from the drift barrier ($5.0 \\times 10^{-8}$) is several orders of magnitude smaller than the expression cost, meaning the primary challenge for the gene's retention is overcoming the burden it imposes on the cell.",

This setup allows for a deductive analysis based on established biological principles to determine the likely outcomes. The question asks for outcomes \"most consistent with\" these principles, which implies a qualitative but rigorous analysis is required.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. It describes a biological system and a series of events without resorting to subjective or speculative claims. The assumptions provided are explicit and serve to constrain the problem to a solvable scope.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete for the purpose of the question, and objectively stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe problem describes the divergence of two paralogs derived from an ancestral gene with alternative polyadenylation. Let us denote the unchanged paralog as $P_{anc}$ and the mutated paralog with the deleted distal poly(A) site as $P_{mut}$.\n\n- $P_{anc}$ is identical to the ancestral gene. It can produce two transcript isoforms: one with a short $3^{\\prime}$ UTR and one with a long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR. In the specified cell type, it predominantly produces the long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR isoform.\n- $P_{mut}$ has lost its distal poly(A) site. It can only produce the transcript isoform with the short $3^{\\prime}$ UTR.\n\nAssumptions state that the rate of transcription initiation, let's call it $\\alpha$, is identical for both $P_{anc}$ and $P_{mut}$. The steady-state abundance of an mRNA species is given by the ratio of its production rate to its degradation rate. Let the degradation rate of the short UTR isoform be $\\delta_S$ and the long UTR isoform be $\\delta_L$.\n\nFrom $P_{anc}$, the production rate of long UTR mRNA is high, and short UTR mRNA is low.\nFrom $P_{mut}$, the production rate of short UTR mRNA is $\\alpha$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on established principles of post-transcriptional regulation.\n\n**A. Relative to the unchanged paralog in the same cell type, the paralog with the shortened $3^{\\prime}$ UTR will typically exhibit higher steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundance due to loss of microRNA (miRNA) recognition elements and destabilizing RNA-binding protein (RBP) sites in the distal $3^{\\prime}$ UTR.**\n\nThis statement posits that the long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR contains regulatory elements that decrease mRNA stability. The distal portion of a $3^{\\prime}$ UTR, which is present only in the long isoform, provides additional sequence that can harbor binding sites for regulatory molecules. It is a general and widely-supported principle that longer $3^{\\prime}$ UTRs tend to contain more miRNA recognition elements and binding sites for destabilizing RBPs (e.g., those containing AU-rich elements). The loss of these elements in $P_{mut}$ means its transcripts (short UTR only) will lack these destabilizing signals.\n\nConsequently, the degradation rate of the long UTR mRNA from $P_{anc}$ ($\\delta_L$) is expected to be greater than the degradation rate of the short UTR mRNA from $P_{mut}$ ($\\delta_S$), i.e., $\\delta_L > \\delta_S$.\nThe steady-state mRNA level for $P_{mut}$ is approximately $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_S}$. The steady-state mRNA level for $P_{anc}$ is dominated by the long isoform, approximately $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_L}$. Since $\\delta_L > \\delta_S$, it follows that $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_S} > \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_L}$.\nTherefore, $P_{mut}$ is expected to have a higher steady-state mRNA abundance. Assuming translational efficiency is not drastically lower for the short UTR isoform, higher mRNA abundance will lead to higher protein abundance. This mechanism, known as \"escape from post-transcriptional repression,\" is a key consequence of APA and a plausible route for the neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization of paralogs.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Shortening the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR will introduce a premature termination codon that activates nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), causing a decrease in mRNA abundance.**\n\nNonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that targets mRNAs containing a premature termination codon (PTC). A PTC is defined as a stop codon located upstream of an exon-exon junction. The problem states that the deletion occurs in the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR, which is, by definition, the region *downstream* of the authentic termination codon. A deletion within this region does not affect the protein-coding sequence and cannot introduce a PTC. Therefore, NMD will not be activated by this mutation. This statement is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the NMD mechanism.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Shortening the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR will generally increase sensitivity to miRNA-mediated repression because miRNAs preferentially repress short $3^{\\prime}$ UTRs by binding near the stop codon.**\n\nThis statement makes a factually incorrect claim. While some miRNA binding sites may be located proximally to the stop codon, the overall potential for miRNA regulation is directly related to the length of the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR. Longer $3^{\\prime}$ UTRs provide more sequence \"real estate\" and therefore can accommodate a larger number and variety of miRNA binding sites. Shortening a $3^{\\prime}$ UTR, especially by deleting the entire distal portion, will almost invariably lead to a *loss* of miRNA binding sites, thereby *decreasing* the sensitivity to miRNA-mediated repression. The assertion that miRNAs \"preferentially repress short $3^{\\prime}$ UTRs\" is contrary to extensive evidence.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Loss of the distal $3^{\\prime}$ UTR can remove cis-acting elements that control mRNA localization and context-dependent translational regulation, potentially altering subcellular mRNA localization and co-translational protein targeting without changing the amino acid sequence.**\n\n$3^{\\prime}$ UTRs are critical hubs for the control of mRNA fate beyond stability. They frequently contain sequence motifs, sometimes called \"zip codes,\" that are recognized by specific RBPs. These RBP-mRNA complexes can then be transported along the cytoskeleton to specific subcellular locations, such as neuronal dendrites, the leading edge of migrating cells, or the pole of an embryo. This localization allows for spatially restricted protein synthesis. Deleting the distal part of the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR, as in $P_{mut}$, can remove such localization elements. This would result in the delocalization of the mRNA and, consequently, the protein product. Additionally, RBPs binding to the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR can modulate the efficiency of translation in response to cellular signals or environmental context. Loss of these binding sites would abrogate such context-dependent control. Co-translational targeting of proteins to organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum is primarily driven by N-terminal signal peptides, but precise mRNA localization near the target organelle can enhance the efficiency of this process. Thus, altering mRNA localization can indirectly affect protein targeting. All these changes occur without altering the primary amino acid sequence of the encoded protein.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Because $3^{\\prime}$ UTRs are not translated, their length has no effect on protein abundance or function.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally false. As demonstrated in the analysis of options A and D, the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR is a major regulatory region. Its sequence and length are critical determinants of post-transcriptional gene regulation, including mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and subcellular localization. These processes directly control the quantity (abundance) and the spatio-temporal distribution of the protein product, which are crucial aspects of its overall biological function. To claim the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR has no effect on protein abundance or function is to ignore a vast and central field of molecular biology.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

We will calculate these two quantities independently and then find their ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time since the duplication event, $t_{\\text{dup}}$. The problem provides a relationship based on the molecular clock hypothesis for synonymous substitutions:\n$$K_{s} = 2 \\mu_{s} t_{\\text{dup}}$$\nHere, $K_{s}$ is the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site between the two paralogs, $\\mu_{s}$ is the neutral synonymous substitution rate per site per million years (Myr), and the factor of $2$ accounts for the divergence of both gene copies from their common ancestor at the time of duplication.

These have accumulated over the time interval $t_{d}$, during which the gene has been evolving neutrally.\n\nThe rate of this Poisson process, $\\lambda$, is the expected number of new premature stop codons appearing per unit time across the entire coding sequence. This rate can be calculated as the product of the total number of coding nucleotides, the neutral substitution rate per nucleotide, and the probability that a random substitution results in a nonsense codon.\nThe given parameters are:\n-   The length of the coding sequence in nucleotides, $L_{\\text{nt}} = 2340$.\n-   The neutral single-nucleotide substitution rate, $\\mu_{n} = 1.9 \\times 10^{-3}$ per site per Myr.\n-   The probability that a new substitution creates a premature stop codon, $p_{n} = 0.037$.\n\nThe rate $\\lambda$ is therefore:\n$$\\lambda = L_{\\text{nt}} \\times \\mu_{n} \\times p_{n}$$\nThe expected number of stop codons, $E[k]$, that would accumulate over a time period $t_{d}$ is given by the product of the rate and the time:\n$$E[k] = \\Lambda = \\lambda \\times t_{d} = (L_{\\text{nt}} \\mu_{n} p_{n}) t_{d}$$\nIn a Poisson framework, the maximum likelihood estimate for the expected number of events, $\\Lambda$, is simply the observed number of events, $k$.
