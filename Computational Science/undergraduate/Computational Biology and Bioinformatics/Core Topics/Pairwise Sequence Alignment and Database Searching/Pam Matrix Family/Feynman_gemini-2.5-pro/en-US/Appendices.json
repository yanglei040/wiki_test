            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in computational biology, based on the established principles of continuous-time Markov models for sequence evolution. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and they are internally consistent. The task is to implement the specified mathematical procedure.\n\nThe solution proceeds through the following sequence of computations.\n\n1.  **Construction of the Instantaneous Rate Matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$**:\n    The elements of the rate matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ are determined from the symmetric exchangeability matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ and the background frequencies $\\mathbf{p} = [p_A, p_R, p_N, p_D, p_C]^T = [0.30, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10]^T$. The off-diagonal elements are given by $q_{ij} = R_{ij} p_j$ for $i \\neq j$. The diagonal elements are set to enforce that the sum of each row is zero: $q_{ii} = -\\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}$. With the provided $\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{p}$ for the alphabet $\\Sigma = [A, R, N, D, C]$, this yields the matrix:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{Q} =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -0.445 & 0.200 & 0.140 & 0.100 & 0.005 \\\\\n     0.300 & -0.545 & 0.160 & 0.080 & 0.005 \\\\\n     0.210 & 0.160 & -0.615 & 0.240 & 0.005 \\\\\n     0.150 & 0.080 & 0.240 & -0.472 & 0.002 \\\\\n     0.015 & 0.010 & 0.010 & 0.004 & -0.039\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n    This matrix satisfies the detailed balance condition $p_i q_{ij} = p_j q_{ji}$, which confirms that $\\mathbf{p}$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov process described by $\\mathbf{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Calibration to the PAM Time Unit**:\n    The matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ must be scaled to conform to the Percent Accepted Mutation (PAM) distance definition, where $1$ PAM unit corresponds to an expected $0.01$ substitutions per site. The average rate of substitution for the process governed by $\\mathbf{Q}$ is calculated as $\\rho = -\\sum_{i} p_i q_{ii}$.\n    Using the given values:\n    $$ \\rho = - (0.30(-0.445) + 0.20(-0.545) + 0.20(-0.615) + 0.20(-0.472) + 0.10(-0.039)) $$\n    $$ \\rho = -(-0.1335 - 0.1090 - 0.1230 - 0.0944 - 0.0039) = 0.4638 $$\n    The calibrated rate matrix $\\tilde{\\mathbf{Q}}$ is then obtained by scaling $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that the average substitution rate is $0.01$:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{Q}} = \\frac{0.01}{\\rho} \\mathbf{Q} = \\frac{0.01}{0.4638} \\mathbf{Q} \\approx 0.02156101768... \\times \\mathbf{Q} $$\n\n3.  **Computation of the Substitution Probability Matrix $\\mathbf{P}(d)$**:\n    For a given PAM distance $d > 0$, the matrix of substitution probabilities $\\mathbf{P}(d)$ is found by computing the matrix exponential of the scaled rate matrix multiplied by the distance:\n    $$ \\mathbf{P}(d) = \\exp(\\tilde{\\mathbf{Q}} d) $$\n    This computation is performed using standard numerical library functions, specifically `scipy.linalg.expm` for the matrix exponential.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Log-Odds Scores $S_{ij}(d)$**:\n    Finally, the log-odds score for an alignment of amino acid $i$ with amino acid $j$ is calculated. The score, in bits, quantifies the likelihood of the observed substitution $P_{ij}(d)$ relative to the background probability of observing amino acid $j$ by chance, $p_j$.\n    $$ S_{ij}(d) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P_{ij}(d)}{p_j} \\right) $$\n\nThis procedure is implemented and applied to the five specified test cases. The indices for the amino acids $[A, R, N, D, C]$ are $[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]$, respectively. The required values $S_{ij}(d)$ are computed for each test case and formatted as required by the problem statement.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of Markov chains applied to molecular evolution, is mathematically well-posed, and all its terms and conditions are specified objectively and without contradiction.\n\nThe core of the problem is the computation of the matrix power $M^N$ for a given $4 \\times 4$ transition probability matrix $M$ and several integer exponents $N$. The task is to find the top-left element of the resulting matrix, $(M^N)_{11}$. A naive approach of iteratively multiplying $M$ by itself $N-1$ times is computationally inefficient for large $N$ (e.g., $N=500$) and can lead to the accumulation of floating-point errors. The call for a \"numerically stable manner\" indicates that a more sophisticated and robust method is required.

For a symmetric matrix, there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $M = PDP^T$. The columns of $P$ are the orthonormal eigenvectors of $M$, and the diagonal entries of $D$ are the corresponding eigenvalues. The matrix power $M^N$ can then be computed efficiently as\n$$\nM^N = (PDP^T)^N = PD(P^T P)D(P^T P) \\dots D P^T = PD^N P^T.\n$$\nSince $D$ is diagonal, $D^N$ is found by simply raising its diagonal entries (the eigenvalues) to the power of $N$.\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $M$. Let the matrix be represented as\n$$\nM =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c & c\\\\\nb & a & c & c\\\\\nc & c & a & b\\\\\nc & c & b & a\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwith $a = 0.99$, $b = 0.002$, and $c = 0.004$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(M - \\lambda I)=0$. Due to the matrix's structure, we can identify eigenvectors by inspection.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and a corresponding orthogonal basis of eigenvectors $v_i$ are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item For $\\lambda_1 = a+b+2c = 0.99 + 0.002 + 2(0.004) = 1$, the eigenvector is $v_1 = [1, 1, 1, 1]^T$.\n    \\item For the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = a-b = 0.99 - 0.002 = 0.988$ (with multiplicity 2), the eigenspace is spanned by the orthogonal vectors $v_2 = [1, -1, 0, 0]^T$ and $v_3 = [0, 0, 1, -1]^T$.\n    \\item For $\\lambda_4 = a+b-2c = 0.99 + 0.002 - 2(0.004) = 0.984$, the eigenvector is $v_4 = [1, 1, -1, -1]^T$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nNormalizing these eigenvectors yields an orthonormal basis $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{1}{2}[1, 1, 1, 1]^T$\n$u_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1, -1, 0, 0]^T$\n$u_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[0, 0, 1, -1]^T$\n$u_4 = \\frac{1}{2}[1, 1, -1, -1]^T$\n\nThe spectral decomposition of $M^N$ is given by\n$$\nM^N = \\lambda_1^N P_1 + \\lambda_2^N P_2 + \\lambda_4^N P_4\n$$\nwhere $P_i$ are the projection matrices onto the eigenspaces.\nFor the non-degenerate eigenvalues $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_4=0.984$, the projectors are $P_1 = u_1 u_1^T$ and $P_4 = u_4 u_4^T$.\nFor the degenerate eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=0.988$, the projector is $P_2 = u_2 u_2^T + u_3 u_3^T$.\n\nWe require the element $(M^N)_{11}$, which is the dot product of the first standard basis vector $e_1=[1,0,0,0]^T$ with $M^N e_1$.\n$$\n(M^N)_{11} = e_1^T M^N e_1 = \\lambda_1^N (e_1^T u_1 u_1^T e_1) + \\lambda_2^N (e_1^T (u_2 u_2^T + u_3 u_3^T) e_1) + \\lambda_4^N (e_1^T u_4 u_4^T e_1).\n$$\nThis simplifies to\n$$\n(M^N)_{11} = \\lambda_1^N (u_{1,1})^2 + \\lambda_2^N ((u_{2,1})^2 + (u_{3,1})^2) + \\lambda_4^N (u_{4,1})^2,\n$$\nwhere $u_{i,1}$ is the first component of eigenvector $u_i$.\nSubstituting the components:\n$u_{1,1} = 1/2$\n$u_{2,1} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n$u_{3,1} = 0$\n$u_{4,1} = 1/2$\n\nThus, we obtain the analytical expression:\n$$\n(M^N)_{11} = (1)^N \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + (0.988)^N \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + 0^2 \\right) + (0.984)^N \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n(M^N)_{11} = 0.25 \\cdot (1)^N + 0.5 \\cdot (0.988)^N + 0.25 \\cdot (0.984)^N\n$$\nThis formula provides a direct, efficient, and numerically stable way to compute the required value for any $N$.

Using equal weighting over unordered pairs, define the mean scores\n$$\\mu_{\\mathcal{R}}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{R}|}\\sum_{(a,b)\\in\\mathcal{R}} S(a,b), \\quad \\mu_{\\mathcal{N}}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|}\\sum_{(a,b)\\in\\mathcal{N}} S(a,b).$$\nCompute the difference\n$$\\Delta=\\mu_{\\mathcal{R}}-\\mu_{\\mathcal{N}}.$$\n\nReport the value of $\\Delta$ rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to partition the set of all unordered pairs of the amino acids $\\{\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{F}\\}$ into two disjoint subsets: $\\mathcal{R}$, containing pairs where the amino acids are single-nucleotide reachable, and $\\mathcal{N}$, containing pairs that are not. Subsequently, we must compute the difference between the mean log-odds scores for these two sets.\n\nFirst, we must identify which pairs are single-nucleotide reachable. The definition states that two amino acids are single-nucleotide reachable if there exists at least one codon for each that differ by a Hamming distance of exactly $1$. The given amino acids and their codons in the standard DNA genetic code are:\n- Tryptophan ($\\mathrm{W}$): $\\mathrm{TGG}$\n- Cysteine ($\\mathrm{C}$): $\\mathrm{TGT}$, $\\mathrm{TGC}$\n- Lysine ($\\mathrm{K}$): $\\mathrm{AAA}$, $\\mathrm{AAG}$\n- Phenylalanine ($\\mathrm{F}$): $\\mathrm{TTT}$, $\\mathrm{TTC}$\n\nWe examine each of the $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ unordered pairs:\n\n1.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{C}$):**\n    - Codon for $\\mathrm{W}$: $\\mathrm{TGG}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{C}$: $\\mathrm{TGT}$, $\\mathrm{TGC}$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGG}$ and $\\mathrm{TGT}$, the Hamming distance is $1$ (difference in the $3^{rd}$ position).\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{W, C})$ is single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{W, C}) \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\n2.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{K}$):**\n    - Codon for $\\mathrm{W}$: $\\mathrm{TGG}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{K}$: $\\mathrm{AAA}$, $\\mathrm{AAG}$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGG}$ and $\\mathrm{AAA}$, the Hamming distance is $3$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGG}$ and $\\mathrm{AAG}$, the Hamming distance is $2$.\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{W, K})$ is not single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{W, K}) \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\n\n3.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{F}$):**\n    - Codon for $\\mathrm{W}$: $\\mathrm{TGG}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{F}$: $\\mathrm{TTT}$, $\\mathrm{TTC}$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGG}$ and $\\mathrm{TTT}$, the Hamming distance is $2$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGG}$ and $\\mathrm{TTC}$, the Hamming distance is $2$.\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{W, F})$ is not single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{W, F}) \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\n\n4.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{K}$):**\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{C}$: $\\mathrm{TGT}$, $\\mathrm{TGC}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{K}$: $\\mathrm{AAA}$, $\\mathrm{AAG}$.\n    - All codon comparisons result in a Hamming distance of $2$ or $3$. For example, $\\mathrm{TGT}$ vs. $\\mathrm{AAG}$ has distance $2$.\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{C, K})$ is not single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{C, K}) \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\n\n5.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{F}$):**\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{C}$: $\\mathrm{TGT}$, $\\mathrm{TGC}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{F}$: $\\mathrm{TTT}$, $\\mathrm{TTC}$.\n    - Comparing $\\mathrm{TGT}$ and $\\mathrm{TTT}$, the Hamming distance is $1$ (difference in the $2^{nd}$ position).\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{C, F})$ is single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{C, F}) \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\n6.  **Pair ($\\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{F}$):**\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{K}$: $\\mathrm{AAA}$, $\\mathrm{AAG}$.\n    - Codons for $\\mathrm{F}$: $\\mathrm{TTT}$, $\\mathrm{TTC}$.\n    - All codon comparisons result in a Hamming distance of $2$ or $3$. For example, $\\mathrm{AAG}$ vs. $\\mathrm{TTC}$ has distance $2$.\n    - Thus, the pair $(\\mathrm{K, F})$ is not single-nucleotide reachable. $(\\mathrm{K, F}) \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the partitions are:\n- $\\mathcal{R} = \\{(\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{C}), (\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{F})\\}$, so $|\\mathcal{R}| = 2$.\n- $\\mathcal{N} = \\{(\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{K}), (\\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{F}), (\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{K}), (\\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{F})\\}$, so $|\\mathcal{N}| = 4$.\n\nNext, we calculate the mean scores $\\mu_{\\mathcal{R}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathcal{N}}$ using the provided score matrix $S$.\nThe scores for the reachable pairs in $\\mathcal{R}$ are $S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{C}) = -0.3$ and $S(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{F}) = 0.2$.\nThe mean score for $\\mathcal{R}$ is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathcal{R}} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{R}|} \\sum_{(a,b)\\in\\mathcal{R}} S(a,b) = \\frac{1}{2} (S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{C}) + S(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{F})) = \\frac{1}{2} (-0.3 + 0.2) = \\frac{-0.1}{2} = -0.05 $$\n\nThe scores for the non-reachable pairs in $\\mathcal{N}$ are $S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{K}) = -1.4$, $S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{F}) = -0.8$, $S(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{K}) = -1.0$, and $S(\\mathrm{K},\\mathrm{F}) = -0.7$.\nThe mean score for $\\mathcal{N}$ is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{(a,b)\\in\\mathcal{N}} S(a,b) = \\frac{1}{4} (S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{K}) + S(\\mathrm{W},\\mathrm{F}) + S(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{K}) + S(\\mathrm{K},\\mathrm{F})) $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\frac{1}{4} (-1.4 - 0.8 - 1.0 - 0.7) = \\frac{1}{4} (-3.9) = -0.975 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta = \\mu_{\\mathcal{R}} - \\mu_{\\mathcal{N}}$:\n$$ \\Delta = (-0.05) - (-0.975) = -0.05 + 0.975 = 0.925 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.925$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 0.9250 $$\nThis result indicates that, on average, amino acid pairs reachable by a single nucleotide mutation have a significantly higher log-odds score in this dataset than pairs which are not, consistent with evolutionary principles where single-step mutations are more probable than multi-step ones.",
