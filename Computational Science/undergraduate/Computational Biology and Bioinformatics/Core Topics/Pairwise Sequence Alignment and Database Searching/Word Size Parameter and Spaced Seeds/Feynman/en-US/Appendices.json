The alphabet size is $|\\Sigma|=4$, and sites evolve independently under a time-homogeneous, symmetric substitution process so that the average per-site divergence between the two species is $d$, meaning the per-site match probability is $p=1-d$. A seed is defined by a binary pattern of span $s$ and weight $W$, where $W$ positions (the ones) must match and the remaining $s-W$ positions (the zeros) are ignored; such a seed is called a spaced seed of weight $W$.

It formalizes a standard trade-off in sequence alignment heuristic design, specifically balancing sensitivity and specificity. The modeling assumptions, such as independent sites and independent seed placements, are common and necessary simplifications in bioinformatics to make the analysis tractable. All necessary parameters and relationships ($p$, $d$, $t$, $\\tau$, and the probability formulas) are provided. The problem is not contradictory, incomplete, or ambiguous. It represents a valid optimization problem within computational biology.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem is to find the optimal seed weight $W^{\\star}$ that minimizes the false-positive probability while satisfying a minimum sensitivity requirement. We shall formalize these quantities based on the provided model.\n\nLet $S(W)$ be the sensitivity, which is the probability of at least one seed hit between the two homologous DNA segments. The per-placement probability of a hit is given as $q_{true} = p^W$. With $t$ independent placements, the total probability of at least one hit is:\n$$S(W) = 1 - (1 - p^W)^t$$\nThe sensitivity constraint requires that $S(W) \\ge \\tau$.\n\nLet $FP(W)$ be the false-positive probability, which is the probability of at least one seed hit when comparing unrelated sequences. The per-placement probability of a hit against a random background is given as $q_{false} = 4^{-W}$. With $t$ independent placements, the false-positive probability is:\n$$FP(W) = 1 - (1 - 4^{-W})^t$$\nThe objective is to minimize $FP(W)$.\n\nTo minimize $FP(W) = 1 - (1 - 4^{-W})^t$, we must maximize the term $(1 - 4^{-W})^t$. Since $t$ is a positive parameter, this is equivalent to maximizing the base, $1 - 4^{-W}$. Maximizing $1 - 4^{-W}$ is equivalent to minimizing $4^{-W}$. The function $f(x) = 4^{-x}$ is a decreasing function of $x$. Therefore, minimizing $4^{-W}$ is equivalent to maximizing the seed weight $W$.\n\nThe problem is thus transformed into finding the maximum possible value of $W$ that satisfies the sensitivity constraint:\n$$S(W) \\ge \\tau$$\n$$1 - (1 - p^W)^t \\ge \\tau$$\nWe proceed to solve this inequality for $W$.\n$$(1 - p^W)^t \\le 1 - \\tau$$\nSince $\\tau \\in (0,1)$ and $t$ is positive, we can take the $t$-th root of both sides without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$1 - p^W \\le (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $p^W$:\n$$p^W \\ge 1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}$$\nTo solve for $W$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. The per-site divergence $d$ is typically non-zero, so $d > 0$, which implies $p = 1-d < 1$. Consequently, $\\ln(p)$ is a negative number. When we apply the logarithm, we must be prepared to reverse the inequality upon division by $\\ln(p)$.\n$$\\ln(p^W) \\ge \\ln\\left(1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}\\right)$$\n$$W \\ln(p) \\ge \\ln\\left(1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}\\right)$$\nDividing by $\\ln(p)$ and reversing the inequality sign yields:\n$$W \\le \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}\\right)}{\\ln(p)}$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound on the seed weight $W$. Since our objective is to maximize $W$, the optimal value $W^{\\star}$ is the maximum value allowed by the constraint, which is the upper bound itself.\n$$W^{\\star} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}\\right)}{\\ln(p)}$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition $p = 1-d$ into the expression for $W^{\\star}$:\n$$W^{\\star} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - (1 - \\tau)^{1/t}\\right)}{\\ln(1-d)}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the optimal seed weight, treated as a continuous variable, which minimizes the false-positive probability under the specified sensitivity constraint. The numerator is negative because $1 - (1-\\tau)^{1/t} < 1$, and the denominator is negative because $1-d < 1$, so $W^{\\star}$ is positive, as expected for a weight.",

A spaced seed is specified by a pattern of length (span) $S$ consisting of required-match symbols and wildcard symbols; a seed hits a window if all positions marked as required-match in its pattern match exactly.

There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Feasibility**: The parameters are realistic for spaced seed design.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Principle**\n\nLet $H_1$ be the event that seed $S_1$ hits a homologous window, and $H_2$ be the event that seed $S_2$ hits the same window. The problem requires us to improve sensitivity by designing $S_2$ to be complementary to $S_1$. This is mathematically interpreted as maximizing the probability that at least one seed hits, $P(H_1 \\cup H_2)$.\n\nLet $R_1$ and $R_2$ be the sets of required-match positions for $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. According to the problem statement, we have $|R_1| = W = 5$ and $|R_2| = W = 5$.\nUnder the assumption of independent matches, the probability of a hit for a single seed with weight $W$ is:\n$$ P(H_1) = \\pi^{|R_1|} = \\pi^W $$\n$$ P(H_2) = \\pi^{|R_2|} = \\pi^W $$\n\nThe probability of both seeds hitting is the probability of matches at all positions in the union of their required-match sets, $R_1 \\cup R_2$:\n$$ P(H_1 \\cap H_2) = \\pi^{|R_1 \\cup R_2|} $$\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for set sizes, we have $|R_1 \\cup R_2| = |R_1| + |R_2| - |R_1 \\cap R_2| = 2W - |R_1 \\cap R_2|$.\nTherefore, $P(H_1 \\cap H_2) = \\pi^{2W - |R_1 \\cap R_2|}$.\n\nThe overall sensitivity, or the probability of at least one hit, is given by:\n$$ P(H_1 \\cup H_2) = P(H_1) + P(H_2) - P(H_1 \\cap H_2) $$\n$$ P(H_1 \\cup H_2) = \\pi^W + \\pi^W - \\pi^{2W - |R_1 \\cap R_2|} = 2\\pi^W - \\pi^{2W - |R_1 \\cap R_2|} $$\nTo maximize this sensitivity, we must maximize the function $f(x) = 2\\pi^W - \\pi^{2W - x}$, where $x = |R_1 \\cap R_2|$ is the number of overlapping required positions between the two seeds.\nSince $2\\pi^W$ is a constant with respect to the design of $S_2$, we need to maximize $-\\pi^{2W - x}$, which is equivalent to minimizing the term $\\pi^{2W - x}$.\nGiven that the base of the exponentiation is $\\pi \\in (0, 1)$, the function $y=\\pi^z$ is a strictly decreasing function of $z$. Thus, to minimize $\\pi^{2W - x}$, we must maximize its exponent, $2W - x$.\nMaximizing $2W - x$ is equivalent to minimizing $x$, which is the overlap $|R_1 \\cap R_2|$.\n\nThe optimal strategy is therefore to design $S_2$ such that the number of shared required-match positions with $S_1$ is minimized. The minimum possible overlap is $|R_1 \\cap R_2| = 0$, which occurs when the sets of required positions are disjoint, i.e., $R_1 \\cap R_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nWe are given $R_1 = \\{1, 3, 5, 8, 11\\}$. The set of positions within the span $S=11$ is $\\{1, 2, ..., 11\\}$.\nThe positions not required by $S_1$ (wildcard positions) are $\\{1, 2, ..., 11\\} \\setminus R_1 = \\{2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10\\}$. This set contains $6$ positions.\nTo achieve minimum overlap $|R_1 \\cap R_2| = 0$, the $5$ required positions for $S_2$ must be chosen from this set of $6$ wildcard positions. This is a feasible task.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Place the required-match positions of $S_{2}$ entirely within the wildcard positions of $S_{1}$, i.e., choose an index set $R_{2} \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, 11\\} \\setminus R_{1}$ with $|R_{2}| = 5$, spreading them across the span as needed.**\nThis strategy proposes to choose $R_2$ from the set $\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10\\}$. Since we need $|R_2| = 5$, we can, for example, choose $R_2 = \\{2, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$. With this choice, $R_1 \\cap R_2 = \\emptyset$, so the overlap $|R_1 \\cap R_2| = 0$. This achieves the theoretical minimum for overlap, thereby maximizing sensitivity according to our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. **Make $S_{2}$ identical to $S_{1}$ but shifted by $1$ position to the right within the span (wrapping as necessary), so that most required positions overlap but not perfectly.**\nThe initial set of positions is $R_1 = \\{1, 3, 5, 8, 11\\}$. Shifting each position by $+1$ and wrapping the position $12$ back to $1$ gives the new set $R_2 = \\{2, 4, 6, 9, 1\\}$. The overlap with $R_1$ is $R_1 \\cap R_2 = \\{1\\}$. Thus, $|R_1 \\cap R_2| = 1$. Since $1 > 0$, this strategy is suboptimal compared to the strategy in option A. A non-zero overlap reduces complementarity and overall sensitivity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **Increase the weight of $S_{2}$ to $W = 7$ at the same span $S = 11$ to reduce false positives, accepting fewer matches per seed.**\nThis strategy violates a constraint of the problem, which is to design a second seed $S_2$ keeping the weight $W$ unchanged (i.e., $W=5$). Furthermore, increasing the weight to $W=7$ would make $S_2$ less sensitive ($P(H_2) = \\pi^7 < \\pi^5 = P(H_1)$), which contradicts the goal of improving overall sensitivity by capturing hits missed by $S_1$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **Use a contiguous word seed for $S_{2}$ with $W = 5$ (i.e., five consecutive required-match positions anywhere within the span), keeping the same span $S = 11$.**\nA contiguous seed would have required positions like $R_2 = \\{i, i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4\\}$ for some starting position $i$. We must check if any such seed can achieve zero overlap. The wildcard regions of $S_1$ are at indices $\\{2\\}$, $\\{4\\}$, $\\{6, 7\\}$, and $\\{9, 10\\}$. The largest contiguous block of wildcards has length $2$. It is impossible to place $5$ consecutive required-match positions without overlapping with at least one position from $R_1 = \\{1, 3, 5, 8, 11\\}$. For example, placing the contiguous seed at positions $R_2 = \\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ results in an overlap of $|R_1 \\cap R_2| = |\\{8\\}| = 1$. This is the minimum achievable overlap for a contiguous seed in this case. Since an overlap of $1$ is greater than the achievable overlap of $0$ from option A, this strategy is suboptimal.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
