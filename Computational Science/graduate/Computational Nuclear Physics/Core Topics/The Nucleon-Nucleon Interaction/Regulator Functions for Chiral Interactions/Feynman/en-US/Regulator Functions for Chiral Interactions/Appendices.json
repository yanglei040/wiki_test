The tasks are unambiguous and a unique solution can be determined from the given information.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of subjective claims or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations and calculations based on the provided regulator function. We will address each part systematically.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the symmetric suppression factor $f_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda)$. The term \"symmetric\" here refers to the case where the incoming and outgoing momenta are equal, i.e., $p=p'=k$. In our case, the momentum is expressed as a multiple of the cutoff scale, $p=p'=\\alpha\\Lambda$, where $\\alpha > 0$ is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n\nWe begin with the definition of the regulator function:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(p,p')=\\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{p}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}-\\left(\\frac{p'}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting $p = \\alpha\\Lambda$ and $p' = \\alpha\\Lambda$ into this expression, we get:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nThe cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ cancels in both terms inside the exponent:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-(\\alpha)^{2n}-(\\alpha)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nCombining the two identical terms in the exponent gives the general expression for the symmetric suppression factor:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nThis expression gives the value of the regulator on the \"diagonal\" in momentum space, $p=p'$, as a function of the momentum scaling factor $\\alpha$ and the integer $n$.\n\nNext, we specialize this result to the case where $n=2$. Substituting $n=2$ into our derived general expression, we have:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{4}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe are now tasked with computing the specific suppression factors for $n=2$ at two different momentum pairs.\n\nCase 1: $(p,p')=(\\Lambda,\\Lambda)$.\nThis corresponds to a momentum of $p=1\\cdot\\Lambda$ and $p'=1\\cdot\\Lambda$. In terms of our symmetric scaling, this means $\\alpha=1$. We can substitute $\\alpha=1$ into our specialized formula for $n=2$:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\Lambda,\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(1)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-2)\n$$\nAlternatively, one could substitute $p=\\Lambda$, $p'=\\Lambda$, and $n=2$ directly into the original definition:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\Lambda,\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}-\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-(1)^{4}-(1)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-1-1) = \\exp(-2)\n$$\nThe first required value is $\\exp(-2)$.\n\nCase 2: $(p,p')=(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda)$.\nThis corresponds to a momentum of $p=2\\cdot\\Lambda$ and $p'=2\\cdot\\Lambda$. In terms of our symmetric scaling, this means $\\alpha=2$. We substitute $\\alpha=2$ into our specialized formula for $n=2$:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(2)^{4}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(16)\\right] = \\exp(-32)\n$$\nAgain, verifying with the original definition:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{2\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}-\\left(\\frac{2\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-(2)^{4}-(2)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-16-16) = \\exp(-32)\n$$\nThe second required value is $\\exp(-32)$.\n\nFinally, we must justify how the choice of the integer $n$ controls the tail of high-momentum contributions. High momentum corresponds to large values of $p$ and $p'$, which in our symmetric scaling formulation means $\\alpha \\gg 1$. The \"tail\" refers to the behavior of the function at these large momentum values. We are asked to examine the scaling of $\\ln f_{\\Lambda}$ with $\\alpha$.\n\nLet's use our general expression for the symmetric factor, $f_{symm}(\\alpha) = f_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})$. Taking the natural logarithm of this function gives:\n$$\n\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha)) = \\ln(\\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})) = -2\\alpha^{2n}\n$$\nThe suppression factor $f_{symm}(\\alpha)$ must rapidly approach zero for $\\alpha \\gg 1$ to effectively remove high-momentum contributions. The rate of this suppression is governed by how quickly $\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha))$ approaches $-\\infty$. From the expression $\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha)) = -2\\alpha^{2n}$, we can see that for large $\\alpha$, the behavior is dominated by the term $\\alpha^{2n}$. The exponent of $\\alpha$ is $2n$.\n\nA larger value of the positive integer $n$ results in a larger exponent for $\\alpha$. The function $\\alpha^{2n}$ grows more rapidly for larger $n$ when $\\alpha > 1$. Consequently, $-2\\alpha^{2n}$ becomes negative more rapidly for larger $n$. This means that the suppression factor $f_{symm}(\\alpha) = \\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})$ falls off to zero much more quickly for larger values of $n$.\n\nFor instance, comparing $n=1$ (where the falloff is $\\sim\\exp(-\\alpha^2)$) with $n=3$ (where the falloff is $\\sim\\exp(-\\alpha^6)$), the latter provides a much \"sharper\" or \"harder\" cutoff, eliminating high-momentum components above the scale $\\Lambda$ more decisively. A smaller $n$ corresponds to a \"softer\" cutoff with a more gradual suppression (a longer tail). Therefore, the parameter $n$ directly controls the sharpness of the ultraviolet cutoff and the suppression of the high-momentum tail in momentum-space integrals.",

I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n***\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to establish a general inverse relationship between a coordinate-space cutoff $R_0$ and a momentum-space cutoff $\\Lambda$; and second, to calculate the proportionality constant $c$ in this relationship, $R_0 = c/\\Lambda$, for the specific case of Gaussian regulators.\n\nThe connection between a function in coordinate space, $f(\\mathbf{r})$, and its counterpart in momentum space, $\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k})$, is given by the three-dimensional Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int d^3r \\, e^{-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} f(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the regulators $f_R(r)$ and $f_\\Lambda(k)$ are spherically symmetric. For a spherically symmetric function $f(r)$ where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$, its Fourier transform $\\tilde{f}(k)$ where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ is also spherically symmetric and can be calculated via a simplified one-dimensional integral:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(k) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k} \\int_0^\\infty dr \\, r f(r) \\sin(kr)\n$$\nThe function $f_R(r)$ is significant for $r \\lesssim R_0$ and suppressed for $r \\gtrsim R_0$. The integral for $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ involves the term $\\sin(kr)$, which oscillates. For large values of $k$, these oscillations are very rapid. The integral receives its main contribution from the region where $f_R(r)$ is non-negligible, i.e., $r \\in [0, R_0]$. When $k R_0 \\gg 1$, the function $\\sin(kr)$ undergoes many cycles of oscillation within the integration domain, leading to significant cancellation and a small value for the integral. Therefore, the resulting function $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ is suppressed for momenta $k$ such that $k \\gtrsim 1/R_0$. This establishes the general inverse relationship. If we define the momentum-space cutoff $\\Lambda$ as the scale where $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ becomes small, we have $\\Lambda \\propto 1/R_0$, which can be written as $\\Lambda R_0 \\approx c$, or $R_0 \\approx c/\\Lambda$. This dimensional argument satisfies the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we proceed to estimate the specific value of the constant $c$ for the given Gaussian regulators. The coordinate-space regulator is:\n$$\nf_R(r) = \\exp\\left( - \\left(\\frac{r}{R_0}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{r^2}{R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic length scale of this regulator is $R_0$, which is the distance at which the function's value drops to $e^{-1}$ of its maximum. We need to find its three-dimensional Fourier transform, which we denote $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, to see what suppression scale it induces in momentum space. The 3D Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. The transform is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int d^3r \\, e^{-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{|\\mathbf{r}|^2}{R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis integral can be separated into a product of three one-dimensional Gaussian integrals in Cartesian coordinates $(\\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z), \\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z))$:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, e^{-ik_x x} e^{-x^2/R_0^2} \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dy \\, e^{-ik_y y} e^{-y^2/R_0^2} \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dz \\, e^{-ik_z z} e^{-z^2/R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe general form of a one-dimensional Gaussian Fourier transform is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, e^{-ipx} e^{-ax^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p^2}{4a}\\right)$. In our case, $a = 1/R_0^2$ and the momentum variable is $k_i$. Each integral therefore evaluates to:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/R_0^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_i^2}{4(1/R_0^2)}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\pi R_0^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_i^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying the results for the three dimensions, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = (\\pi R_0^2)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2) R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that $k^2 = |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2$, the resulting momentum-space function is:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(k) = \\pi^{3/2} R_0^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that we must match the dominant suppression scale of this induced regulator, $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, with that of the prescribed momentum-space regulator, $f_\\Lambda(k) = \\exp(-(k/\\Lambda)^2)$.\n\nThe dominant suppression scale is the characteristic value of the variable at which the function decays significantly, typically defined by the argument of the exponential.\nFor the prescribed momentum-space regulator, $f_\\Lambda(k) = \\exp(-k^2/\\Lambda^2)$, the suppression scale is clearly $\\Lambda$. At $k = \\Lambda$, the function value is $e^{-1}$.\n\nFor the induced momentum-space regulator, $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, the momentum dependence is given by the term $\\exp(-k^2 R_0^2/4)$. To identify its suppression scale, we rewrite it in the same form as $f_\\Lambda(k)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{(2/R_0)^2}\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this to the form $\\exp(-k^2/\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}}^2)$, we can identify the effective momentum-space cutoff scale, $\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}}$, that is induced by the coordinate-space cutoff $R_0$:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{2}{R_0}\n$$\nThe problem requires that this induced scale matches the intended scale $\\Lambda$. Therefore, we set $\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}} = \\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{2}{R_0}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to express $R_0$ in terms of $\\Lambda$, we get:\n$$\nR_0 \\Lambda = 2 \\implies R_0 = \\frac{2}{\\Lambda}\n$$\nComparing this result with the general relation $R_0 = c/\\Lambda$, we find that the constant $c$ is:\n$$\nc = 2\n$$",

Using the N2LO expectation $\\nu_{\\text{omit}} = 4$, test whether $|\\nu_{\\text{fit}} - \\nu_{\\text{omit}}| \\leq \\epsilon$ with tolerance $\\epsilon = 0.5$, and mark the channel as a boolean result: $\\text{True}$ if the test passes, $\\text{False}$ otherwise.\n\nAngle units: All phase shifts are given in radians. The output is dimensionless booleans.\n\nTest suite and coverage:\n- The $^1S_0$, $^3S_1$, and $^3P_0$ channels are typical \"happy path\" cases expected to follow $\\nu_{\\text{omit}}=4$ scaling.\n- The $^3D_1$ channel is designed as an outlier whose spread scales approximately as a lower power of $Q$, thereby failing the test.\n- The $^1P_1$ channel has very small spread values that still follow the expected scaling, exercising numerical stability at near-boundary magnitudes.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of booleans enclosed in square brackets, in the channel order $[\\,^1S_0,\\,^3S_1,\\,^3P_0,\\,^3D_1,\\,^1P_1\\,]$. For example, a valid output line is $[\\text{True},\\text{False},\\text{True},\\text{True},\\text{True}]$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded computational problem in nuclear physics that is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. All necessary data, constants, and procedural steps are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to validate the theoretical scaling of residual cutoff dependence in nucleon-nucleon phase shifts calculated using Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\\chi$EFT). The theoretical framework posits that for a calculation truncated at a given order, the error due to this truncation is dominated by the first omitted order in the expansion. In this case, the phase shifts $\\delta$ are computed at Next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO), so the first omitted order is Next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO).\n\nAccording to Weinberg power counting, the contribution of terms at order $\\nu$ scales as $Q^{\\nu}$, where $Q$ is a characteristic low-momentum scale. The order of N3LO corresponds to $\\nu_{\\text{omit}} = 4$. Therefore, the residual error is expected to scale as $Q^4$. The problem operationalizes this residual error as the spread $S(E_{\\text{lab}})$ in the calculated phase shifts across a range of ultraviolet cutoff values $\\Lambda$. The hypothesis to be tested is thus $S(E_{\\text{lab}}) \\propto Q(E_{\\text{lab}})^4$.\n\nThe analytical procedure for each partial-wave channel is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Soft Scale $Q(E_{\\text{lab}})$**: The low-momentum scale $Q$ is related to the laboratory energy $E_{\\text{lab}}$. First, the center-of-mass momentum $p$ is calculated from the laboratory energy $E_{\\text{lab}}$ using the provided non-relativistic approximation for two equal masses, one initially at rest:\n    $$\n    p(E_{\\text{lab}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_N\\,E_{\\text{lab}}}{2}}\n    $$\n    where the nucleon mass is $m_N = 938.919 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$. The resulting momentum $p$ has units of $\\text{MeV}/c$. This momentum is then converted into a dimensionally consistent scale $Q$ in units of $\\text{fm}^{-1}$ using the conversion constant $\\hbar c = 197.3269804 \\, \\text{MeV fm}$:\n    $$\n    Q(E_{\\text{lab}}) = \\frac{p(E_{\\text{lab}})}{\\hbar c}\n    $$\n    This calculation is performed for each of the three given laboratory energies, $E_{\\text{lab}} \\in \\{10, 50, 100\\}\\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Spread $S(E_{\\text{lab}})$**: For each of the three laboratory energies, the spread of the phase shifts over the five given cutoff values $\\Lambda \\in \\{450, 500, 550, 600, 650\\}\\, \\text{MeV}$ is computed. The spread $S(E_{\\text{lab}})$ is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum phase shift values at a fixed energy:\n    $$\n    S(E_{\\text{lab}}) = \\max_{\\Lambda}\\,\\delta(E_{\\text{lab}},\\Lambda) - \\min_{\\Lambda}\\,\\delta(E_{\\text{lab}},\\Lambda)\n    $$\n    This yields three values of the spread $S$, one for each energy $E_{\\text{lab}}$.\n\n3.  **Perform Power-Law Fit**: To determine the empirical scaling exponent, we fit the relationship $S(E_{\\text{lab}}) = A \\cdot Q(E_{\\text{lab}})^{\\nu_{\\text{fit}}}$, where $A$ is a proportionality constant and $\\nu_{\\text{fit}}$ is the exponent to be extracted. This power-law relationship is transformed into a linear equation by taking the logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\n    \\log S(E_{\\text{lab}}) = \\log A + \\nu_{\\text{fit}} \\log Q(E_{\\text{lab}})\n    $$\n    This equation is of the form $y = m x + c$, where $y = \\log S$, $x = \\log Q$, the slope is $m = \\nu_{\\text{fit}}$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\log A$. We perform a linear regression on the three data points $(\\log Q(E_i), \\log S(E_i))$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ to find the best-fit slope, which corresponds to the exponent $\\nu_{\\text{fit}}$. The base of the logarithm does not affect the value of the slope.\n\n4.  **Validate the Scaling Exponent**: The final step is to compare the fitted exponent $\\nu_{\\text{fit}}$ with the theoretically expected exponent $\\nu_{\\text{omit}} = 4$. A channel is considered to follow the expected scaling if the absolute difference between the fitted and theoretical exponents is within a specified tolerance $\\epsilon = 0.5$. The test is:\n    $$\n    |\\nu_{\\text{fit}} - \\nu_{\\text{omit}}| \\leq \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad |\\nu_{\\text{fit}} - 4| \\leq 0.5\n    $$\n    A boolean result, $\\text{True}$ or $\\text{False}$, is determined for each channel based on the outcome of this test.\n\nThis entire procedure is systematically applied to the phase shift data for the five specified channels: $^1S_0$, $^3S_1$, $^3P_0$, $^3D_1$, and $^1P_1$. The final output is a list of these boolean results.",
