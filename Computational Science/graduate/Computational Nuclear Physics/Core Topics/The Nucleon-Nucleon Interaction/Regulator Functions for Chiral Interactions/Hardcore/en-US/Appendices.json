A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations and calculations based on the provided regulator function. We will address each part systematically.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the symmetric suppression factor $f_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda)$. The term \"symmetric\" here refers to the case where the incoming and outgoing momenta are equal, i.e., $p=p'=k$. In our case, the momentum is expressed as a multiple of the cutoff scale, $p=p'=\\alpha\\Lambda$, where $\\alpha > 0$ is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n\nWe begin with the definition of the regulator function:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(p,p')=\\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{p}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}-\\left(\\frac{p'}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting $p = \\alpha\\Lambda$ and $p' = \\alpha\\Lambda$ into this expression, we get:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nThe cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ cancels in both terms inside the exponent:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-(\\alpha)^{2n}-(\\alpha)^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nCombining the two identical terms in the exponent gives the general expression for the symmetric suppression factor:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{2n}\\right]\n$$\nThis expression gives the value of the regulator on the \"diagonal\" in momentum space, $p=p'$, as a function of the momentum scaling factor $\\alpha$ and the integer $n$.\n\nNext, we specialize this result to the case where $n=2$. Substituting $n=2$ into our derived general expression, we have:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-2\\alpha^{4}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe are now tasked with computing the specific suppression factors for $n=2$ at two different momentum pairs.\n\nCase 1: $(p,p')=(\\Lambda,\\Lambda)$.\nThis corresponds to a momentum of $p=1\\cdot\\Lambda$ and $p'=1\\cdot\\Lambda$. In terms of our symmetric scaling, this means $\\alpha=1$. We can substitute $\\alpha=1$ into our specialized formula for $n=2$:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\Lambda,\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(1)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-2)\n$$\nAlternatively, one could substitute $p=\\Lambda$, $p'=\\Lambda$, and $n=2$ directly into the original definition:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(\\Lambda,\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}-\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-(1)^{4}-(1)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-1-1) = \\exp(-2)\n$$\nThe first required value is $\\exp(-2)$.\n\nCase 2: $(p,p')=(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda)$.\nThis corresponds to a momentum of $p=2\\cdot\\Lambda$ and $p'=2\\cdot\\Lambda$. In terms of our symmetric scaling, this means $\\alpha=2$. We substitute $\\alpha=2$ into our specialized formula for $n=2$:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(2)^{4}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-2(16)\\right] = \\exp(-32)\n$$\nAgain, verifying with the original definition:\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(2\\Lambda,2\\Lambda) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\frac{2\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}-\\left(\\frac{2\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2(2)}\\right] = \\exp\\!\\left[-(2)^{4}-(2)^{4}\\right] = \\exp(-16-16) = \\exp(-32)\n$$\nThe second required value is $\\exp(-32)$.\n\nFinally, we must justify how the choice of the integer $n$ controls the tail of high-momentum contributions. High momentum corresponds to large values of $p$ and $p'$, which in our symmetric scaling formulation means $\\alpha \\gg 1$. The \"tail\" refers to the behavior of the function at these large momentum values. We are asked to examine the scaling of $\\ln f_{\\Lambda}$ with $\\alpha$.\n\nLet's use our general expression for the symmetric factor, $f_{symm}(\\alpha) = f_{\\Lambda}(\\alpha\\Lambda,\\alpha\\Lambda) = \\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})$. Taking the natural logarithm of this function gives:\n$$\n\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha)) = \\ln(\\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})) = -2\\alpha^{2n}\n$$\nThe suppression factor $f_{symm}(\\alpha)$ must rapidly approach zero for $\\alpha \\gg 1$ to effectively remove high-momentum contributions. The rate of this suppression is governed by how quickly $\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha))$ approaches $-\\infty$. From the expression $\\ln(f_{symm}(\\alpha)) = -2\\alpha^{2n}$, we can see that for large $\\alpha$, the behavior is dominated by the term $\\alpha^{2n}$. The exponent of $\\alpha$ is $2n$.\n\nA larger value of the positive integer $n$ results in a larger exponent for $\\alpha$. The function $\\alpha^{2n}$ grows more rapidly for larger $n$ when $\\alpha > 1$. Consequently, $-2\\alpha^{2n}$ becomes negative more rapidly for larger $n$. This means that the suppression factor $f_{symm}(\\alpha) = \\exp(-2\\alpha^{2n})$ falls off to zero much more quickly for larger values of $n$.\n\nFor instance, comparing $n=1$ (where the falloff is $\\sim\\exp(-\\alpha^2)$) with $n=3$ (where the falloff is $\\sim\\exp(-\\alpha^6)$), the latter provides a much \"sharper\" or \"harder\" cutoff, eliminating high-momentum components above the scale $\\Lambda$ more decisively. A smaller $n$ corresponds to a \"softer\" cutoff with a more gradual suppression (a longer tail). Therefore, the parameter $n$ directly controls the sharpness of the ultraviolet cutoff and the suppression of the high-momentum tail in momentum-space integrals.",

I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n***\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to establish a general inverse relationship between a coordinate-space cutoff $R_0$ and a momentum-space cutoff $\\Lambda$; and second, to calculate the proportionality constant $c$ in this relationship, $R_0 = c/\\Lambda$, for the specific case of Gaussian regulators.\n\nThe connection between a function in coordinate space, $f(\\mathbf{r})$, and its counterpart in momentum space, $\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k})$, is given by the three-dimensional Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int d^3r \\, e^{-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} f(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the regulators $f_R(r)$ and $f_\\Lambda(k)$ are spherically symmetric. For a spherically symmetric function $f(r)$ where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$, its Fourier transform $\\tilde{f}(k)$ where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ is also spherically symmetric and can be calculated via a simplified one-dimensional integral:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(k) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k} \\int_0^\\infty dr \\, r f(r) \\sin(kr)\n$$\nThe function $f_R(r)$ is significant for $r \\lesssim R_0$ and suppressed for $r \\gtrsim R_0$. The integral for $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ involves the term $\\sin(kr)$, which oscillates. For large values of $k$, these oscillations are very rapid. The integral receives its main contribution from the region where $f_R(r)$ is non-negligible, i.e., $r \\in [0, R_0]$. When $k R_0 \\gg 1$, the function $\\sin(kr)$ undergoes many cycles of oscillation within the integration domain, leading to significant cancellation and a small value for the integral. Therefore, the resulting function $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ is suppressed for momenta $k$ such that $k \\gtrsim 1/R_0$. This establishes the general inverse relationship. If we define the momentum-space cutoff $\\Lambda$ as the scale where $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$ becomes small, we have $\\Lambda \\propto 1/R_0$, which can be written as $\\Lambda R_0 \\approx c$, or $R_0 \\approx c/\\Lambda$. This dimensional argument satisfies the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we proceed to estimate the specific value of the constant $c$ for the given Gaussian regulators. The coordinate-space regulator is:\n$$\nf_R(r) = \\exp\\left( - \\left(\\frac{r}{R_0}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{r^2}{R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic length scale of this regulator is $R_0$, which is the distance at which the function's value drops to $e^{-1}$ of its maximum. We need to find its three-dimensional Fourier transform, which we denote $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, to see what suppression scale it induces in momentum space. The 3D Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. The transform is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int d^3r \\, e^{-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{|\\mathbf{r}|^2}{R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis integral can be separated into a product of three one-dimensional Gaussian integrals in Cartesian coordinates $(\\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z), \\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z))$:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, e^{-ik_x x} e^{-x^2/R_0^2} \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dy \\, e^{-ik_y y} e^{-y^2/R_0^2} \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dz \\, e^{-ik_z z} e^{-z^2/R_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe general form of a one-dimensional Gaussian Fourier transform is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, e^{-ipx} e^{-ax^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p^2}{4a}\\right)$. In our case, $a = 1/R_0^2$ and the momentum variable is $k_i$. Each integral therefore evaluates to:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/R_0^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_i^2}{4(1/R_0^2)}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\pi R_0^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_i^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying the results for the three dimensions, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(\\mathbf{k}) = (\\pi R_0^2)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2) R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that $k^2 = |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2$, the resulting momentum-space function is:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_R(k) = \\pi^{3/2} R_0^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that we must match the dominant suppression scale of this induced regulator, $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, with that of the prescribed momentum-space regulator, $f_\\Lambda(k) = \\exp(-(k/\\Lambda)^2)$.\n\nThe dominant suppression scale is the characteristic value of the variable at which the function decays significantly, typically defined by the argument of the exponential.\nFor the prescribed momentum-space regulator, $f_\\Lambda(k) = \\exp(-k^2/\\Lambda^2)$, the suppression scale is clearly $\\Lambda$. At $k = \\Lambda$, the function value is $e^{-1}$.\n\nFor the induced momentum-space regulator, $\\tilde{f}_R(k)$, the momentum dependence is given by the term $\\exp(-k^2 R_0^2/4)$. To identify its suppression scale, we rewrite it in the same form as $f_\\Lambda(k)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 R_0^2}{4}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{(2/R_0)^2}\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this to the form $\\exp(-k^2/\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}}^2)$, we can identify the effective momentum-space cutoff scale, $\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}}$, that is induced by the coordinate-space cutoff $R_0$:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{2}{R_0}\n$$\nThe problem requires that this induced scale matches the intended scale $\\Lambda$. Therefore, we set $\\Lambda_{\\text{eff}} = \\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{2}{R_0}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to express $R_0$ in terms of $\\Lambda$, we get:\n$$\nR_0 \\Lambda = 2 \\implies R_0 = \\frac{2}{\\Lambda}\n$$\nComparing this result with the general relation $R_0 = c/\\Lambda$, we find that the constant $c$ is:\n$$\nc = 2\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously validated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Chiral Effective Field Theory as applied to nuclear forces, is well-posed with all necessary constants and functions defined, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The computational task is a standard exercise in studying the renormalization of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, specifically the cutoff dependence of the ${}^3S_1\\text{--}{}^3D_1$ mixing.\n\nThe objective is to compute and compare the cutoff dependence of a proxy for the ${}^3S_1\\text{--}{}^3D_1$ mixing parameter, $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}$. This is done in two scenarios: a naive calculation using only a regulated one-pion-exchange potential, and a calculation including a short-distance counterterm whose strength is fitted to an observable at a low-energy reference point. The comparison of the residual cutoff dependence in the two scenarios demonstrates the role of counterterms in achieving renormalization.\n\nThe proxy for the mixing angle is taken as the on-shell, off-diagonal $K$-matrix element in the first Born approximation:\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}(k;\\Lambda) \\equiv K_{02}(k;\\Lambda) = -2\\mu \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dr\\, r^{2}\\, j_{0}(k r)\\, V_{02}^{\\mathrm{total}}(r;\\Lambda)\\, j_{2}(k r)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the on-shell momentum, $\\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet cutoff, $\\mu=3.35$ is the reduced mass in units of the pion mass $m_{\\pi}$, and $j_{\\ell}(x)$ are spherical Bessel functions. All quantities are dimensionless, following the problem's convention.\n\nThe total potential, $V_{02}^{\\mathrm{total}}(r;\\Lambda)$, is a sum of the one-pion-exchange (OPE) potential and a contact term. In the \"naive\" scenario, only the OPE part is included.\n\nThe regulated OPE potential for the ${}^3S_1 \\to {}^3D_1$ transition is given by:\n$$\nV_{02}(r;\\Lambda) = \\left(2\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\,\\left(-3\\right)\\,C_{T}\\,y_{2}(r)\\,f_{\\Lambda}(r)\n$$\nwhere the constant numerical factors arise from spin and isospin matrix elements, $C_{T}=1$ is the tensor coupling strength, $y_{2}(r)$ is the radial form of the OPE tensor potential, and $f_{\\Lambda}(r)$ is a short-distance regulator function. Their explicit forms are:\n$$\ny_{2}(r) = \\frac{e^{-r}}{r^{3}}\\left(1+\\frac{3}{r}+\\frac{3}{r^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\Lambda}(r) = 1-\\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(\\Lambda r\\right)^{n}\\right] \\quad \\text{with } n=4\n$$\nThe regulator $f_{\\Lambda}(r)$ tames the strong singularity of $y_{2}(r) \\sim 3/r^5$ as $r \\to 0$. The integrand for $K_{02}$, which includes a measure $r^2$ and partial waves $j_0(kr) \\sim 1$ and $j_2(kr) \\sim (kr)^2$, behaves as $r^3$ near the origin, ensuring the integral is well-defined.\n\nThe \"naive\" proxy for the mixing angle is therefore:\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k;\\Lambda) = -2\\mu \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dr\\, r^{2}\\, j_{0}(k r)\\, V_{02}(r;\\Lambda)\\, j_{2}(k r)\n$$\n\nTo improve the description and absorb cutoff dependence, a local short-distance counterterm is introduced:\n$$\nV_{02}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(r;\\Lambda) = C_{SD}(\\Lambda)\\, g_{\\Lambda}(r)\n$$\nwhere $C_{SD}(\\Lambda)$ is a low-energy constant (LEC) that depends on the cutoff, and $g_{\\Lambda}(r)$ is a regulated representation of a delta function derivative coupling. Its form is specified as:\n$$\ng_{\\Lambda}(r) = \\Lambda^{5} r^{2}\\, e^{-(\\Lambda r)^{2}}\n$$\nThis counterterm adds a piece to the $K$-matrix, which we can write as:\n$$\nK_{02}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(k;\\Lambda) = C_{SD}(\\Lambda) \\mathcal{I}(k;\\Lambda)\n$$\nwhere the integral $\\mathcal{I}(k;\\Lambda)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}(k;\\Lambda) = -2\\mu \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dr\\, r^{2}\\, j_{0}(k r)\\, g_{\\Lambda}(r)\\, j_{2}(k r)\n$$\nThe full proxy in the \"promoted-counterterm\" scenario is $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(k;\\Lambda) = \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k;\\Lambda) + K_{02}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(k;\\Lambda)$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each cutoff $\\Lambda$ in the set $\\{3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0\\}$, the naive proxy $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k;\\Lambda)$ and the counterterm integral $\\mathcal{I}(k;\\Lambda)$ are computed via numerical quadrature for two momenta, $k_{\\mathrm{ref}}=0.2$ and $k_{2}=0.4$. The integrals are over $[0, \\infty)$ and are handled by the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is well-suited for such problems, especially given the exponential decay of the integrands at large $r$.\n\n2.  A reference value for the mixing proxy is defined at the reference momentum $k_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and a specific intermediate cutoff $\\Lambda_{0}=7.0$:\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}}; \\Lambda_{0}=7.0)\n$$\n\n3.  The LEC $C_{SD}(\\Lambda)$ is determined for each cutoff $\\Lambda$ by enforcing that the full proxy $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ct}}$ reproduces this reference value at $k_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. This yields the condition:\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}};\\Lambda) + C_{SD}(\\Lambda)\\, \\mathcal{I}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}};\\Lambda) = \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nFrom which we solve for the LEC:\n$$\nC_{SD}(\\Lambda) = \\frac{\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}};\\Lambda)}{\\mathcal{I}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}};\\Lambda)}\n$$\n\n4.  With the determined $C_{SD}(\\Lambda)$ values, the prediction for the mixing proxy at the higher momentum $k_2=0.4$ is calculated:\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(k_{2};\\Lambda) = \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{2};\\Lambda) + C_{SD}(\\Lambda)\\, \\mathcal{I}(k_{2};\\Lambda)\n$$\n\n5.  Finally, three diagnostic quantities are computed to quantify the residual cutoff dependence across the range of $\\Lambda$ values. These are the ranges (maximum minus minimum value) of the sets of computed proxies:\n    a. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}})$: Range of $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{\\mathrm{ref}};\\Lambda)$ over $\\Lambda$.\n    b. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{2})$: Range of $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{2};\\Lambda)$ over $\\Lambda$.\n    c. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ct}}(k_{2})$: Range of $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{1}^{\\mathrm{ct}}(k_{2};\\Lambda)$ over $\\Lambda$.\n\nThis procedure systematically evaluates the degree to which a leading-order counterterm can absorb the cutoff artifacts, a key test of the validity of the effective field theory approach. A smaller value for $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ct}}(k_{2})$ compared to $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{naive}}(k_{2})$ would indicate a successful reduction in cutoff dependence.",
