Consider a Slater determinant basis state for a valence space spanned by the orbitals labeled by principal quantum number $n$, orbital angular momentum $l$, and total angular momentum $j$.

Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final energy in MeV.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to identify the allowed two-neutron configurations that can form a total angular momentum and parity state of $J^{\\pi}=0^{+}$ within the $sd$ valence space, and then to determine the interaction energy of the most energetically favorable of these configurations. The analysis rests on two fundamental principles: the Pauli exclusion principle for identical fermions and the rules of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we must determine which pairs of single-particle orbits $(a,b)$ can form a two-particle state with total angular momentum $J=0$. The single-particle orbits in the $sd$ valence space are $d_{5/2}$ (with single-particle angular momentum $j=5/2$), $s_{1/2}$ ($j=1/2$), and $d_{3/2}$ ($j=3/2$). The rule for the addition of two angular momenta, $j_a$ and $j_b$, to form a total angular momentum $J$ is given by the triangle inequality:\n$$|j_a - j_b| \\le J \\le j_a + j_b$$\nFor the specific case where the total angular momentum is $J=0$, this inequality can only be satisfied if $j_a = j_b$. This means that the two neutrons must occupy the same single-particle orbit. Such a configuration is denoted by $(j^2)$. Therefore, the only possible pairs of orbits are $(d_{5/2}, d_{5/2})$, $(s_{1/2}, s_{1/2})$, and $(d_{3/2}, d_{3/2})$.\n\nSecond, we must consider the constraints imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which demands that the total state of two identical fermions (in this case, two neutrons) must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. In the $jj$-coupling scheme, the total state of two nucleons is characterized by the total angular momentum $J$ and the total isospin $T$. A general rule states that for two identical nucleons in the same orbit $j$, the sum $J+T$ must be an odd integer.\nFor a system of two neutrons, their individual isospin projections are $t_z = -1/2$. The total isospin projection is $M_T = (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1$. The total isospin $T$ must be at least $|M_T|$, so $T \\ge 1$. For a two-nucleon system, the possible values for total isospin are $T=0$ or $T=1$. Since $M_T = -1$, the total isospin must be $T=1$.\nWith $T=1$, the antisymmetry condition $J+T = \\text{odd}$ becomes $J+1 = \\text{odd}$, which implies that $J$ must be an even integer.\n\nOur target state is $J^{\\pi}=0^{+}$. We require $J=0$. Since $0$ is an even number, this value is allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle for two neutrons in the same orbit $j$.\n\nThird, we examine the parity $\\pi$. The parity of a single-particle state is given by $(-1)^l$, where $l$ is the orbital angular momentum.\n- For the $d_{5/2}$ orbit, $l=2$, so $\\pi = (-1)^2 = +1$.\n- For the $s_{1/2}$ orbit, $l=0$, so $\\pi = (-1)^0 = +1$.\n- For the $d_{3/2}$ orbit, $l=2$, so $\\pi = (-1)^2 = +1$.\nAll single-particle orbits in the $sd$ space have positive parity. The parity of a two-particle state is the product of the parities of the individual particles, $\\pi_{\\text{total}} = \\pi_a \\pi_b$. In this case, for any pair of orbits, the total parity is $(+1)(+1) = +1$. Thus, any $J=0$ state formed in this space automatically has positive parity, satisfying the $J^{\\pi}=0^{+}$ requirement.\n\nCombining these results, the allowed configurations for a two-neutron $J^{\\pi}=0^{+}$ state are those where the two neutrons occupy the same single-particle orbit. The possible configurations are:\n1. Two neutrons in the $d_{5/2}$ orbit, forming the state $|(d_{5/2})^2, J=0, T=1\\rangle$.\n2. Two neutrons in the $s_{1/2}$ orbit, forming the state $|(s_{1/2})^2, J=0, T=1\\rangle$.\n3. Two neutrons in the $d_{3/2}$ orbit, forming the state $|(d_{3/2})^2, J=0, T=1\\rangle$.\n\nThe problem states that we are to neglect single-particle energies and off-diagonal two-body couplings. The energy of each configuration is therefore given by the corresponding diagonal two-body matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian, $V_{JT}(ab,ab)$. The problem provides these values for the three allowed configurations ($a=b$, $J=0$, $T=1$):\n- Energy of configuration 1: $E_1 = V_{J=0,T=1}(d_{5/2}d_{5/2},d_{5/2}d_{5/2}) = -3.156~\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n- Energy of configuration 2: $E_2 = V_{J=0,T=1}(s_{1/2}s_{1/2},s_{1/2}s_{1/2}) = -2.487~\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n- Energy of configuration 3: $E_3 = V_{J=0,T=1}(d_{3/2}d_{3/2},d_{3/2}d_{3/2}) = -1.934~\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nThe \"energetically most favorable\" configuration is the one with the lowest (most negative) energy. We compare the three energies:\n$$E_1 = -3.156~\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n$$E_2 = -2.487~\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n$$E_3 = -1.934~\\mathrm{MeV}$$\nThe minimum energy is $E_{\\min} = -3.156~\\mathrm{MeV}$, which corresponds to the configuration where the two neutrons occupy the $d_{5/2}$ orbit.\n\nThe problem asks for this energy rounded to four significant figures. The value $-3.156$ already has four significant figures.",

A fundamental consequence of rotational invariance is the conservation of total angular momentum. This implies that the Hamiltonian commutes with the operator for the $z$-component of total angular momentum, $\\hat{J}_z$.
