This separation is made exact when using a complete harmonic oscillator basis. This exercise provides a foundational, hands-on calculation to demonstrate how a two-nucleon state, described in terms of individual particle coordinates, can be re-expressed in the basis of relative and CM coordinates using Moshinsky brackets . Mastering this transformation is the first step toward understanding how and why spurious CM excitations can be identified and removed.",

Let $a_{1}^{\\dagger}$ and $a_{2}^{\\dagger}$ denote the single-particle HO creation operators for nucleon $1$ and nucleon $2$, respectively, acting on the one-dimensional HO vacuum $|0\\rangle$ with the canonical commutation relations $[a_{i},a_{j}^{\\dagger}]=\\delta_{ij}$ and all other commutators vanishing.

It is a standard, valid problem.\n\n**3. Solution**\nThe problem is valid and can be solved. The solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Moshinsky Bracket**\n\nThe Moshinsky bracket is the coefficient of transformation between the two-particle single-particle basis and the relative-center-of-mass basis. We are asked to compute the specific bracket $\\langle q=0, p=1 | n_1=1, n_2=0 \\rangle$.\n\nLet the two-particle vacuum state be denoted by $|00\\rangle$, which is the tensor product of the single-particle vacua: $|00\\rangle \\equiv |0\\rangle_1 \\otimes |0\\rangle_2$. This state is annihilated by all single-particle annihilation operators: $a_1 |00\\rangle = 0$ and $a_2 |00\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe single-particle basis state $|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle$ is constructed by applying the creation operator $a_1^{\\dagger}$ to the vacuum state:\n$$\n|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle = \\frac{(a_1^{\\dagger})^1}{\\sqrt{1!}} \\frac{(a_2^{\\dagger})^0}{\\sqrt{0!}} |00\\rangle = a_1^{\\dagger} |00\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe CM and relative annihilation operators, $a_R$ and $a_r$, also annihilate the vacuum $|00\\rangle$:\n$$\na_R |00\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_1+a_2)|00\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_1|00\\rangle + a_2|00\\rangle) = 0\n$$\n$$\na_r |00\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_1-a_2)|00\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_1|00\\rangle - a_2|00\\rangle) = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that the vacuum of the single-particle basis, $|00\\rangle$, is also the vacuum of the CM/relative basis, $|q=0, p=0\\rangle$.\n\nThe CM/relative basis state $|q=0, p=1\\rangle$ is constructed by applying the relative creation operator $a_r^{\\dagger}$ to this common vacuum:\n$$\n|q=0, p=1\\rangle = \\frac{(a_R^{\\dagger})^0}{\\sqrt{0!}} \\frac{(a_r^{\\dagger})^1}{\\sqrt{1!}} |00\\rangle = a_r^{\\dagger} |00\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe Moshinsky bracket is the scalar product of these two states:\n$$\n\\langle q=0, p=1 | n_1=1, n_2=0 \\rangle = \\langle a_r^{\\dagger} 00 | a_1^{\\dagger} 00 \\rangle = \\langle 00 | a_r (a_1^{\\dagger} |00\\rangle)\n$$\n\nTo simplify this calculation, we can express the single-particle creation operator $a_1^{\\dagger}$ in terms of the CM and relative creation operators. The defining relations are:\n$$\na_{R}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_{1}^{\\dagger}+a_{2}^{\\dagger})\n$$\n$$\na_{r}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_{1}^{\\dagger}-a_{2}^{\\dagger})\n$$\nThis is an orthogonal transformation. To find the inverse, we can solve for $a_1^{\\dagger}$ and $a_2^{\\dagger}$. Adding the two equations gives:\n$$\na_{R}^{\\dagger} + a_{r}^{\\dagger} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_{1}^{\\dagger}+a_{2}^{\\dagger} + a_{1}^{\\dagger}-a_{2}^{\\dagger}) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}a_{1}^{\\dagger} = \\sqrt{2}a_{1}^{\\dagger}\n$$\nThus,\n$$\na_{1}^{\\dagger} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_{R}^{\\dagger} + a_{r}^{\\dagger})\n$$\nNow, we can express the state $|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle$ in the CM/relative basis:\n$$\n|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle = a_1^{\\dagger} |00\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a_{R}^{\\dagger} + a_{r}^{\\dagger})|00\\rangle\n$$\nDistributing the operators onto the vacuum state:\n$$\n|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}a_{R}^{\\dagger}|00\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}a_{r}^{\\dagger}|00\\rangle\n$$\nBy definition, $a_{R}^{\\dagger}|00\\rangle$ creates one quantum of CM excitation and zero quanta of relative excitation, which is the state $|q=1, p=0\\rangle$. Similarly, $a_{r}^{\\dagger}|00\\rangle$ creates the state $|q=0, p=1\\rangle$. Therefore, the expansion of the state $|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle$ is:\n$$\n|n_1=1, n_2=0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|q=1, p=0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|q=0, p=1\\rangle\n$$\nThe Moshinsky bracket $\\langle q=0, p=1 | n_1=1, n_2=0 \\rangle$ is the coefficient of the state $|q=0, p=1\\rangle$ in this expansion. By taking the inner product of the above equation with $\\langle q=0, p=1 |$, and using the orthonormality of the basis states ($\\langle q',p'|q,p\\rangle = \\delta_{q'q}\\delta_{p'p}$), we find:\n$$\n\\langle q=0, p=1 | n_1=1, n_2=0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\langle q=0, p=1 | q=1, p=0 \\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\langle q=0, p=1 | q=0, p=1 \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe value of the specified Moshinsky bracket is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Translational Invariance of the Two-Body Potential**\n\nThe generator of spatial translations for a system of particles is the total momentum operator, $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{tot}}$. For a two-body system, this is $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{tot}} = \\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_2$. An operator, such as the potential $V$, is translationally invariant if and only if it commutes with the generator of translations:\n$$\n[V, \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{tot}}] = 0\n$$\nLet's consider the potential $V$ to be a function of the particle positions, $V(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$. The momentum operators are given by $\\mathbf{p}_k = -i\\hbar\\nabla_k$. The commutation relation becomes:\n$$\n[V(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2), \\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_2] = [V, \\mathbf{p}_1] + [V, \\mathbf{p}_2] = 0\n$$\nUsing the canonical commutation relation $[f(\\mathbf{r}), \\mathbf{p}] = i\\hbar\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}}f(\\mathbf{r})$, we have:\n$$\n(-i\\hbar)(\\nabla_1 V) + (-i\\hbar)(\\nabla_2 V) = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to the condition:\n$$\n(\\nabla_1 + \\nabla_2)V(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = 0\n$$\nThis first-order partial differential equation implies that $V$ must be a function of the coordinate difference $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$. To verify, let $V = V(\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2)$. Using the chain rule for vector derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla_1 V(\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla_2 V(\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the gradient with respect to the relative coordinate $\\mathbf{r}$. Substituting these into the condition gives $(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V) - (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V) = 0$, which is satisfied. Thus, any translationally invariant potential must depend only on the relative coordinate $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$. The form $V(|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|)$ given in the problem is a special case which is also rotationally invariant (isotropic).\n\nNow we show that such a potential does not couple to the center-of-mass (CM) coordinate, $\\mathbf{R} = (m_1\\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\\mathbf{r}_2)/(m_1+m_2)$. In this problem, masses are equal, so $\\mathbf{R} = (\\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{r}_2)/2$.\n\nSince $V$ is a function of $\\mathbf{r}$ only, the operator $\\hat{V}$ acts exclusively on the relative part of the system's wavefunction. A general two-body wavefunction can be separated into a product of a CM part and a relative part: $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\psi_{\\text{CM}}(\\mathbf{R})\\phi_{\\text{rel}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nConsider a matrix element of the potential $V$ between an initial state $\\Psi_i = \\psi_{\\text{CM},i}(\\mathbf{R})\\phi_{\\text{rel},i}(\\mathbf{r})$ and a final state $\\Psi_f = \\psi_{\\text{CM},f}(\\mathbf{R})\\phi_{\\text{rel},f}(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_f | V | \\Psi_i \\rangle = \\iint \\Psi_f^*(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r}) V(\\mathbf{r}) \\Psi_i(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r}) \\,d^3\\mathbf{R}\\,d^3\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nSubstituting the factored wavefunctions:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_f | V | \\Psi_i \\rangle = \\iint \\psi_{\\text{CM},f}^*(\\mathbf{R})\\phi_{\\text{rel},f}^*(\\mathbf{r}) V(\\mathbf{r}) \\psi_{\\text{CM},i}(\\mathbf{R})\\phi_{\\text{rel},i}(\\mathbf{r}) \\,d^3\\mathbf{R}\\,d^3\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nSince $V(\\mathbf{r})$ does not depend on $\\mathbf{R}$, we can separate the integrals over the CM and relative coordinates:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_f | V | \\Psi_i \\rangle = \\left( \\int \\psi_{\\text{CM},f}^*(\\mathbf{R}) \\psi_{\\text{CM},i}(\\mathbf{R}) \\,d^3\\mathbf{R} \\right) \\left( \\int \\phi_{\\text{rel},f}^*(\\mathbf{r}) V(\\mathbf{r}) \\phi_{\\text{rel},i}(\\mathbf{r}) \\,d^3\\mathbf{r} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written compactly using bra-ket notation for the separated Hilbert spaces:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_f | V | \\Psi_i \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_{\\text{CM},f} | \\psi_{\\text{CM},i} \\rangle \\langle \\phi_{\\text{rel},f} | V | \\phi_{\\text{rel},i} \\rangle\n$$\nDue to the orthogonality of the CM basis states (e.g., HO eigenstates), the overlap integral $\\langle \\psi_{\\text{CM},f} | \\psi_{\\text{CM},i} \\rangle$ is non-zero only if the initial and final CM states are identical. This means the interaction $V$ cannot induce transitions between different CM states; its matrix elements are diagonal in the CM quantum numbers. This demonstrates that the potential does not couple to the CM motion, thereby preventing spurious CM excitations (center-of-mass contamination) in shell-model calculations employing such an interaction.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It addresses a fundamental issue in nuclear shell-model calculations. We can proceed with a full solution.\n\n**1. Criterion for Translational Invariance**\n\nAn operator $\\hat{O}$ is translationally invariant if it is unchanged by a spatial translation. The unitary operator for a translation by a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is given as $U(\\mathbf{a}) \\equiv \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\,\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}\\right)$. Under this transformation, an operator $\\hat{O}$ transforms to $\\hat{O}' = U(\\mathbf{a})^\\dagger \\hat{O} U(\\mathbf{a})$. The condition for invariance is $\\hat{O}' = \\hat{O}$, which implies $U(\\mathbf{a})^\\dagger \\hat{O} U(\\mathbf{a}) = \\hat{O}$. As $U(\\mathbf{a})$ is unitary, this is equivalent to the condition that $\\hat{O}$ commutes with $U(\\mathbf{a})$, i.e., $[\\hat{O}, U(\\mathbf{a})] = 0$.\n\nTo find a more fundamental criterion, we consider the transformation using the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for an operator similarity transformation, $e^X Y e^{-X} = Y + [X,Y] + \\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]] + \\dots$.\nIn our case, the transformation is $U(\\mathbf{a})^\\dagger \\hat{O} U(\\mathbf{a}) = e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}} \\hat{O} e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}}$.\nLet $X = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}$ and $Y = \\hat{O}$. The transformed operator is:\n$$ \\hat{O}' = \\hat{O} + \\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}, \\hat{O}\\right] + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}, \\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}, \\hat{O}\\right]\\right] + \\dots $$\n$$ \\hat{O}' = \\hat{O} - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{O}, \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}] - \\frac{1}{2\\hbar^2}[\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}, [\\hat{O}, \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}]] + \\dots $$\nFor $\\hat{O}$ to be translationally invariant, we must have $\\hat{O}'=\\hat{O}$ for any arbitrary translation vector $\\mathbf{a}$. This requires all terms beyond the first in the expansion to vanish. The vanishing of the first-order term is a sufficient condition for all higher-order terms to vanish as well.\nThe first-order term is $[\\hat{O}, \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{P}] = \\left[\\hat{O}, \\sum_{\\gamma} a_\\gamma P_\\gamma\\right] = \\sum_{\\gamma} a_\\gamma [\\hat{O}, P_\\gamma]$.\nFor this to be zero for any arbitrary vector $\\mathbf{a}$, the coefficient of each component $a_\\gamma$ must be zero. This leads to the necessary and sufficient condition:\n$$ [\\hat{O}, P_\\gamma] = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\gamma \\in \\{x,y,z\\}. $$\nIn vector notation, the criterion is $[\\hat{O}, \\mathbf{P}] = 0$.\n\n**2. Commutator for the E2 Operator**\n\nThe electric quadrupole operator is given by $Q_{\\alpha\\beta} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{A} e_{i}\\left(3\\,r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta} - r_{i}^{2}\\,\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)$, and the total momentum is $P_{\\gamma} = \\sum_{j=1}^{A} p_{j,\\gamma}$. We compute the commutator $[Q_{\\alpha\\beta},P_{\\gamma}]$.\n$$ [Q_{\\alpha\\beta}, P_{\\gamma}] = \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{A} e_{i}\\left(3\\,r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta} - r_{i}^{2}\\,\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right), \\sum_{j=1}^{A} p_{j,\\gamma}\\right] $$\nUsing the linearity of the commutator and the fact that operators for different particles commute if they are of the same type (r-r or p-p), the commutator simplifies:\n$$ [Q_{\\alpha\\beta}, P_{\\gamma}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sum_{j=1}^{A} e_i [3r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta} - r_{i}^{2}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}, p_{j,\\gamma}] $$\nWe use the fundamental commutation relation $[r_{k,\\mu}, p_{l,\\nu}] = i\\hbar \\delta_{kl}\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}$ and the identity $[AB, C] = A[B,C] + [A,C]B$.\nFirst, we find the commutator of the term $r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta}$ with $p_{j,\\gamma}$:\n$$ [r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta}, p_{j,\\gamma}] = r_{i,\\alpha}[r_{i,\\beta}, p_{j,\\gamma}] + [r_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\gamma}]r_{i,\\beta} = r_{i,\\alpha}(i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma}) + (i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma})r_{i,\\beta} = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}(r_{i,\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} + r_{i,\\beta}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}) $$\nNext, for the term $r_i^2 = \\sum_{\\mu} r_{i,\\mu}r_{i,\\mu}$:\n$$ [r_i^2, p_{j,\\gamma}] = \\sum_{\\mu} [r_{i,\\mu}r_{i,\\mu}, p_{j,\\gamma}] = \\sum_{\\mu} (r_{i,\\mu}[r_{i,\\mu}, p_{j,\\gamma}] + [r_{i,\\mu}, p_{j,\\gamma}]r_{i,\\mu}) $$\n$$ = \\sum_{\\mu} (r_{i,\\mu}(i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\mu\\gamma}) + (i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\mu\\gamma})r_{i,\\mu}) = 2i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\sum_{\\mu} r_{i,\\mu}\\delta_{\\mu\\gamma} = 2i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}r_{i,\\gamma} $$\nCombining these results:\n$$ [3r_{i,\\alpha}r_{i,\\beta} - r_{i}^{2}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}, p_{j,\\gamma}] = 3 i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}(r_{i,\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} + r_{i,\\beta}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}) - (2i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}r_{i,\\gamma})\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} $$\n$$ = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}[3(r_{i,\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} + r_{i,\\beta}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}) - 2\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}r_{i,\\gamma}] $$\nSubstituting this back into the full commutator and summing over $i$ and $j$, the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ collapses the sum over $j$:\n$$ [Q_{\\alpha\\beta}, P_{\\gamma}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{A} e_i \\left( i\\hbar [3(r_{i,\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} + r_{i,\\beta}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}) - 2\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}r_{i,\\gamma}] \\right) $$\n$$ [Q_{\\alpha\\beta}, P_{\\gamma}] = i\\hbar \\sum_{i=1}^{A} e_i (3(r_{i,\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} + r_{i,\\beta}\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}) - 2r_{i,\\gamma}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}) $$\nSince this commutator is non-zero, the operator $Q_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is not translationally invariant.\n\n**3. Commutator for the M1 Operator**\n\nThe magnetic dipole operator is $\\mathbf{T}(M1) \\equiv \\mu_{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{A}\\left(g_{\\ell}^{(i)}\\,\\mathbf{\\ell}_{i} + g_{s}^{(i)}\\,\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)$. We compute the commutator of its $\\alpha$-component with the $\\delta$-component of the total momentum, $[T(M1)_{\\alpha}, P_{\\delta}]$.\n$$ [T(M1)_{\\alpha}, P_{\\delta}] = \\mu_N \\sum_{i=1}^A \\sum_{j=1}^A [g_{\\ell}^{(i)}\\ell_{i,\\alpha} + g_s^{(i)}s_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] $$\nWe can analyze the orbital and spin parts separately.\nFor the spin part, we are given that spin operators commute with all spatial and momentum operators, i.e., $[s_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] = 0$. Consequently, the commutator involving the spin g-factor terms is zero:\n$$ \\mu_N \\sum_{i,j} g_s^{(i)} [s_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] = 0 $$\nThus, the spin part of the $M1$ operator is translationally invariant.\nFor the orbital part, we need to compute $[\\ell_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}]$. The orbital angular momentum component is $\\ell_{i,\\alpha} = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu} r_{i,\\mu} p_{i,\\nu}$.\n$$ [\\ell_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu} [r_{i,\\mu} p_{i,\\nu}, p_{j,\\delta}] = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu} (r_{i,\\mu}[p_{i,\\nu}, p_{j,\\delta}] + [r_{i,\\mu}, p_{j,\\delta}]p_{i,\\nu}) $$\nThe first term vanishes because momentum operators commute, $[p_{i,\\nu}, p_{j,\\delta}] = 0$.\n$$ [\\ell_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu} (i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\mu\\delta}) p_{i,\\nu} = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu}\\delta_{\\mu\\delta}p_{i,\\nu} = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\sum_{\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\delta\\nu} p_{i,\\nu} $$\nNow, we compute the full commutator for the orbital part:\n$$ \\mu_N \\sum_{i,j} g_{\\ell}^{(i)} [\\ell_{i,\\alpha}, p_{j,\\delta}] = \\mu_N \\sum_{i,j} g_{\\ell}^{(i)} \\left( i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\sum_{\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\delta\\nu} p_{i,\\nu} \\right) $$\nSumming over $j$ using $\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$ = i\\hbar\\mu_N \\sum_{i=1}^A g_{\\ell}^{(i)} \\sum_{\\nu}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\delta\\nu} p_{i,\\nu} $$\nLetting the dummy index be $\\sigma$, the final commutator is:\n$$ [T(M1)_{\\alpha}, P_{\\delta}] = i\\hbar\\mu_N \\sum_{i=1}^{A} g_{\\ell}^{(i)} \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\delta\\sigma} p_{i,\\sigma} $$\nThe orbital part of the $M1$ operator is generally not translationally invariant.\n\n**4. Intrinsic Coordinates and Momenta**\n\nSpurious center-of-mass contamination can be removed by constructing operators from intrinsic coordinates $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_i \\equiv \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ and intrinsic momenta $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i \\equiv \\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{P}/A$. According to the criterion from part 1, an operator is translationally invariant if it commutes with the total momentum $\\mathbf{P}$. If we can show that the building blocks $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i$ commute with $\\mathbf{P}$, then any operator constructed purely from these intrinsic variables will also commute with $\\mathbf{P}$ and thus be free of CM contamination.\n\nLet's compute the commutator $[\\xi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta]$:\n$$ [\\xi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta] = \\left[r_{i,\\alpha} - \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A r_{j,\\alpha}, \\sum_{k=1}^A p_{k,\\beta}\\right] $$\n$$ = \\sum_{k=1}^A [r_{i,\\alpha}, p_{k,\\beta}] - \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A\\sum_{k=1}^A [r_{j,\\alpha}, p_{k,\\beta}] $$\n$$ = \\sum_{k=1}^A i\\hbar\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A\\sum_{k=1}^A i\\hbar\\delta_{jk}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} $$\n$$ = i\\hbar\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{i\\hbar\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A 1 = i\\hbar\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{i\\hbar\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}}{A}A = 0 $$\nSo, $[\\xi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta] = 0$.\n\nNext, let's compute the commutator $[\\pi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta]$:\n$$ [\\pi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta] = \\left[p_{i,\\alpha} - \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A p_{j,\\alpha}, \\sum_{k=1}^A p_{k,\\beta}\\right] $$\n$$ = \\sum_{k=1}^A [p_{i,\\alpha}, p_{k,\\beta}] - \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{j=1}^A\\sum_{k=1}^A [p_{j,\\alpha}, p_{k,\\beta}] $$\nSince momentum operators commute with each other, $[p_{\\mu}, p_{\\nu}] = 0$, both terms are zero.\n$$ [\\pi_{i,\\alpha}, P_\\beta] = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\nSince both $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i$ commute with the total momentum $\\mathbf{P}$, any operator constructed from them (e.g., an intrinsic quadrupole operator $\\sum_i e_i (3\\xi_{i,\\alpha}\\xi_{i,\\beta} - \\xi_i^2\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta})$ or an intrinsic angular momentum $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i$) will also commute with $\\mathbf{P}$. This guarantees that such operators are translationally invariant and do not induce spurious transitions involving the center-of-mass motion.",

            "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a computational stability test for the removal of center-of-mass (CM) contamination in a truncated harmonic-oscillator shell-model space using a two-level surrogate. The test must vary the harmonic-oscillator frequency parameter and the Lawson penalty independently, and quantify the residual CM excitation in the computed ground state. Your program should output a numerical diagnostic for a given test suite of parameter triples.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base. For a translationally invariant system of identical nucleons, the total Hamiltonian can be separated into intrinsic and center-of-mass parts. In a harmonic-oscillator basis of frequency parameter $\\,\\hbar\\Omega\\,$, the center-of-mass Hamiltonian has eigenvalues\n$$\nE_{\\text{cm}}(n) \\;=\\; \\left(n + \\tfrac{3}{2}\\right)\\,\\hbar\\Omega,\\quad n\\in\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}.\n$$\nIn truncated many-body spaces, residual coupling between intrinsic and center-of-mass sectors can contaminate the low-lying spectrum.
