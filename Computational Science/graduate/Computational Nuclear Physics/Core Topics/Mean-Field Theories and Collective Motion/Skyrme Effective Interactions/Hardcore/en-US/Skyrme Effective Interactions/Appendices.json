            "solution": "The problem presents a simplified model of a nucleus within the Hartree-Fock (HF) framework, using a zero-range Skyrme interaction term. It asks for two distinct tasks: first, to derive the mean-field potential corresponding to a given Gaussian density profile, and second, to verify a self-consistency condition related to the stationarity of an auxiliary functional. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary components for its solution are provided.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Mean-Field Potential $U_{t_{0}}(r)$**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the single-particle mean-field potential, $U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r})$, as the functional derivative of the energy functional, $E_{t_{0}}[\\rho]$, with respect to the local particle density, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThe given energy functional is:\n$$\nE_{t_{0}}[\\rho] = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThe mean-field potential is thus:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\delta E_{t_{0}}}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nThe energy functional $E_{t_{0}}[\\rho]$ is an integral of a function that depends only on the local value of the density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. Such a functional is called a local or ultralocal functional. For any local functional of the form $E[\\rho] = \\int \\mathcal{E}(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})) d^3\\mathbf{r}$, its functional derivative is simply the partial derivative of the integrand $\\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $\\rho$, evaluated at the local density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.\nIn our case, the energy density (the integrand) is $\\mathcal{E}_{t_{0}}(\\rho) = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2}$.\nThe functional derivative is therefore:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_{t_{0}}}{\\partial \\rho}\\bigg|_{\\rho=\\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2} \\right) \\bigg|_{\\rho=\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nPerforming the partial differentiation with respect to $\\rho$ as a variable gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2} \\right) = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} (2\\rho) = t_{0}\\rho\n$$\nEvaluating this result at the local density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ yields the general expression for the mean-field potential for any density profile:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = t_{0} \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that at a particular iteration, the density has a spherically symmetric Gaussian form:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. Substituting this specific density profile into the general expression for the potential, we obtain the explicit form of $U_{t_{0}}(r)$:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(r) = t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the local mean-field potential generated by the $t_{0}$ term for the given Gaussian density.\n\n**Task 2: Verification of the Euler-Lagrange Condition**\n\nThe second task is to verify the stationarity condition $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$ at the self-consistent fixed point for the auxiliary functional:\n$$\nF[\\rho] = E_{t_{0}}[\\rho] - \\int U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}') \\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\nIn the context of a self-consistent solution, the potential $U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}')$ appearing in the second term is the one generated by the self-consistent density itself. It is therefore treated as a fixed external field for the purpose of the variation of $F[\\rho]$. We use the expression for $U_{t_{0}}(r)$ derived in the first task. The auxiliary functional, as a functional of a variable density field $\\rho$, is:\n$$\nF[\\rho] = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r'})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} - \\int \\left[ t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r'^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'}\n$$\nWe now compute the functional derivative of $F[\\rho]$ with respect to $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r'})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} \\right) - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\left( \\int \\left[ t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r'^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} \\right)\n$$\nThe first term is the functional derivative we calculated in Task 1, which is $t_{0}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. The second term is the functional derivative of a linear functional of the form $\\int f(\\mathbf{r}')\\rho(\\mathbf{r}')d^3\\mathbf{r'}$, which is simply the coefficient function $f(\\mathbf{r})$. In our case, the coefficient function is the fixed self-consistent potential $U_{t_0}(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = t_{0}\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) - t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe stationarity condition must be checked *at* the self-consistent fixed point, which means we must evaluate this derivative by setting the variable density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ equal to the self-consistent density $\\rho(r) = \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\bigg|_{\\rho(r)=\\rho_0 \\exp(-r^2/b^2)} = t_{0}\\left[ \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] - t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis result is identically zero for all $\\mathbf{r}$. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange condition $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$ is explicitly verified for the given density and the potential it generates, confirming the self-consistency of the solution.\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $U_{t_0}(r)$.",

For each QMC data point $(\\rho_i, E_i)$, we have:\n$$ E_i - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{PNM}}(\\rho_i) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} t_0 \\rho_i\\right) c_0 + \\left(\\frac{1}{24} t_3 \\rho_i^{\\alpha+1}\\right) c_3 $$\nThis is a linear system of the form $A\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_3]^T$. The matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ are constructed from the QMC data points. The system is solved for $\\mathbf{c}$ using a standard linear least-squares algorithm. From the solution, we find $x_0 = 1-c_0$ and $x_3 = 1-c_3$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Slope Parameter $L$\n\nThe final step is to compute $L$ using the formula provided, which is derived from the standard definition $L = 3\\rho_0 \\frac{dS(\\rho)}{d\\rho}\\big|_{\\rho_0}$:\n$$ L \\;=\\; 2\\,S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho_0) \\;-\\; 3\\,\\rho_0\\,\\frac{(1+2x_0)\\,t_0}{8} \\;-\\; 3\\,\\rho_0\\,\\frac{(1+2x_3)\\,t_3}{48}\\,(\\alpha+1)\\,\\rho_0^{\\alpha} $$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho_0)$ is the kinetic part of the symmetry energy at saturation density:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho_0) = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{PNM}}(\\rho_0) - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{SNM}}(\\rho_0) $$\nThe kinetic energies for PNM and SNM at $\\rho_0$ are given by:\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{SNM}}(\\rho_0) = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi^2\\rho_0}{2}\\right)^{2/3} $$\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{PNM}}(\\rho_0) = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\left(3\\pi^2\\rho_0\\right)^{2/3} $$\nBy substituting the values of $t_0, t_3, x_0, x_3$ obtained in the previous steps, we can calculate $L$ for each test case.\n\nThe computational implementation will follow these three steps for each case specified in the test suite. The results for $L$ from each case are collected and printed in the required format.",
