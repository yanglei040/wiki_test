Its derivative is $\\frac{\\partial g_\\omega}{\\partial \\rho_B} \\sim C p \\rho_B^{p-1}$.\nSubstituting these forms into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu \\approx k_F + \\frac{(C\\rho_B^p)^2}{m_\\omega^2}\\rho_B + (Cp\\rho_B^{p-1})\\frac{C\\rho_B^p}{m_\\omega^2}\\rho_B^2 = k_F + \\frac{C^2}{m_\\omega^2}\\rho_B^{2p+1} + \\frac{p C^2}{m_\\omega^2}\\rho_B^{2p+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu \\approx k_F + (1+p) \\frac{C^2}{m_\\omega^2}\\rho_B^{2p+1}\n$$\nNow, substituting $k_F = A \\rho_B^{1/3}$ (where $A$ is a constant):\n$$\n\\mu(\\rho_B) \\approx A \\rho_B^{1/3} + B(1+p)\\rho_B^{2p+1}\n$$\nwhere $B=C^2/m_\\omega^2$ is a positive constant. To find the asymptotic behavior of $c_s^2$, we must compare the powers of $\\rho_B$ in the kinetic term ($1/3$) and the vector interaction term ($2p+1$).\n\n**Case 1: Vector term dominates ($2p+1 > 1/3 \\implies p > -1/3$)**\nIn this case, the chemical potential is dominated by the vector interaction at high density:\n$$\n\\mu \\approx B(1+p)\\rho_B^{2p+1}\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx B(1+p)(2p+1)\\rho_B^{2p}\n$$\nThe squared speed of sound becomes:\n$$\nc_s^2 = \\frac{\\rho_B}{\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_B}{B(1+p)\\rho_B^{2p+1}} \\left( B(1+p)(2p+1)\\rho_B^{2p} \\right) = 2p+1\n$$\nThe causality condition $c_s^2 \\le 1$ implies $2p+1 \\le 1$, which gives $2p \\le 0 \\implies p \\le 0$.\nSo, for this case, the allowed range is $-1/3  p \\le 0$.\n\n**Case 2: Kinetic term dominates ($2p+1  1/3 \\implies p  -1/3$)**\nIn this case, the chemical potential is dominated by the kinetic term:\n$$\n\\mu \\approx A \\rho_B^{1/3}\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx \\frac{1}{3}A\\rho_B^{-2/3}\n$$\nThe squared speed of sound becomes:\n$$\nc_s^2 = \\frac{\\rho_B}{\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_B}{A\\rho_B^{1/3}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}A\\rho_B^{-2/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nSince $1/3 \\le 1$, the causality condition is always satisfied. Thus, all $p  -1/3$ are allowed.\n\n**Case 3: Kinetic and vector terms have the same power ($2p+1 = 1/3 \\implies p = -1/3$)**\nBoth terms contribute with the same power law.\n$$\n\\mu \\approx \\left(A + B(1-1/3)\\right)\\rho_B^{1/3} = \\left(A + \\frac{2}{3}B\\right)\\rho_B^{1/3}\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx \\frac{1}{3}\\left(A + \\frac{2}{3}B\\right)\\rho_B^{-2/3}\n$$\nThe squared speed of sound is again:\n$$\nc_s^2 = \\frac{\\rho_B}{\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\rho_B} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_B}{(A + \\frac{2}{3}B)\\rho_B^{1/3}} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}(A + \\frac{2}{3}B)\\rho_B^{-2/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis also satisfies causality, so $p = -1/3$ is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining the results from all cases, the causality condition $c_s \\le 1$ in the high-density limit is satisfied for any exponent $p \\le 0$. The question asks for the **maximum allowed value** of $p$. From the set of allowed values $(-\\infty, 0]$, the maximum value is $0$.",
