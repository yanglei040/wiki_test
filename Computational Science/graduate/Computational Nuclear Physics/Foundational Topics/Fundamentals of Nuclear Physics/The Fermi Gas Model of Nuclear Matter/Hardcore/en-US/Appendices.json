Let the single-particle energy be $\\varepsilon = p^{2}/(2m)$, and assume the system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, with chemical potential $\\mu(T)$ determined by fixed particle number density. The occupation probability of a single-particle state is given by the Fermi–Dirac distribution (FD), defined as $f(\\varepsilon;\\mu,T) = \\left(1 + \\exp\\left((\\varepsilon - \\mu)/(k_{B}T)\\right)\\right)^{-1}$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The density of states per unit volume for a non-relativistic particle in three dimensions scales as a constant times $\\varepsilon^{1/2}$; proportionality constants cancel in all ratios considered below.

Analytical Derivations**\n\nLet the single-particle density of states per unit volume be $g(\\varepsilon) = C \\varepsilon^{1/2}$, where $C$ is a constant incorporating spin degeneracy and fundamental constants.\n\n**Fixed-Density Constraint:**\nThe particle number density $n = A/V$ is given by integrating the product of the density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution over all energies:\n$$n = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(\\varepsilon) f(\\varepsilon; \\mu, T) d\\varepsilon = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varepsilon^{1/2}}{1 + \\exp((\\varepsilon - \\mu)/(k_{B}T))} d\\varepsilon$$\nAt absolute zero ($T=0$), the FD distribution is a step function ($f=1$ for $\\varepsilon  \\varepsilon_{F}$ and $f=0$ for $\\varepsilon  \\varepsilon_{F}$), where $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is the Fermi energy. The density $n$ is thus:\n$$n = C \\int_{0}^{\\varepsilon_{F}} \\varepsilon^{1/2} d\\varepsilon = C \\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon_{F}^{3/2}$$\nSince the particle density $n$ is fixed, the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is a constant for the system.\n\nAt a finite temperature $T  0$, we introduce the dimensionless variable $x = \\varepsilon/(k_{B}T)$ and the reduced chemical potential $\\eta = \\mu/(k_{B}T)$. The integral for $n$ becomes:\n$$n = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x k_{B} T)^{1/2}}{1 + \\exp(x - \\eta)} (k_{B}T \\, dx) = C (k_{B}T)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{1/2}}{1 + \\exp(x - \\eta)} dx = C (k_{B}T)^{3/2} I_{1/2}(\\eta)$$\nEquating the expressions for the fixed density $n$ at $T=0$ and $T0$:\n$$C \\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon_{F}^{3/2} = C (k_{B}T)^{3/2} I_{1/2}(\\eta)$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels. Using the definitions $k_B T_F = \\varepsilon_F$ and $\\theta = T/T_F$:\n$$\\frac{2}{3} (k_B T_F)^{3/2} = (k_B T_F \\theta)^{3/2} I_{1/2}(\\eta)$$\n$$\\frac{2}{3} = \\theta^{3/2} I_{1/2}(\\eta)$$\nThis is the fixed-density constraint. It implicitly defines the reduced chemical potential $\\eta$ as a function of the degeneracy parameter $\\theta$. For any given $\\theta$, this equation must be solved to find the corresponding $\\eta$.\n\n**Internal Energy per Particle:**\nThe internal energy density $E/V$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{E}{V} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon g(\\varepsilon) f(\\varepsilon; \\mu, T) d\\varepsilon = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varepsilon^{3/2}}{1 + \\exp((\\varepsilon - \\mu)/(k_{B}T))} d\\varepsilon $$\nIn terms of the dimensionless variable $x$:\n$$ \\frac{E}{V} = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x k_{B} T)^{3/2}}{1 + \\exp(x - \\eta)} (k_{B}T \\, dx) = C (k_{B}T)^{5/2} I_{3/2}(\\eta) $$\nThe internal energy per particle, $E/A$, is the ratio of the energy density to the particle density:\n$$ \\frac{E}{A} = \\frac{E/V}{n} = \\frac{C (k_{B}T)^{5/2} I_{3/2}(\\eta)}{C (k_{B}T)^{3/2} I_{1/2}(\\eta)} = k_{B}T \\frac{I_{3/2}(\\eta)}{I_{1/2}(\\eta)} $$\n\n**2. Computational Method**\n\n**Heat Capacity $(C_V/A)/k_B$:**\nThe heat capacity at constant volume per particle is defined as $C_V/A = \\frac{1}{A}(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial T})_V = \\frac{\\partial (E/A)}{\\partial T}$. We are asked to compute its dimensionless value $(C_V/A)/k_B$.\n$$ \\frac{C_V/A}{k_B} = \\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(k_B T \\frac{I_{3/2}(\\eta)}{I_{1/2}(\\eta)}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(T \\frac{I_{3/2}(\\eta)}{I_{1/2}(\\eta)}\\right) $$\nTo evaluate this numerically, we use a central difference approximation for the derivative. Let $U(T) = (E/A)/k_B = T \\frac{I_{3/2}(\\eta(T))}{I_{1/2}(\\eta(T))}$. Note that $T_F$ is a constant, so we can set it to $1$ without loss of generality, making $T = \\theta$.\n$$ \\frac{C_V/A}{k_B} \\approx \\frac{U(\\theta + h) - U(\\theta - h)}{2h} $$\nwhere $h$ is a small step in $\\theta$. The computational procedure for a given $\\theta$ is:\n1.  Choose a small step $h$ (e.g., $h = 10^{-6}\\theta$).\n2.  Define $\\theta_1 = \\theta - h$ and $\\theta_2 = \\theta + h$.\n3.  For $\\theta_1$, numerically solve the constraint equation $I_{1/2}(\\eta_1) = \\frac{2}{3}\\theta_1^{-3/2}$ for $\\eta_1$. This requires a root-finding algorithm operating on a numerical integration routine for $I_{1/2}$.\n4.  Compute $U(\\theta_1)$ using $\\eta_1$: $U(\\theta_1) = \\theta_1 \\frac{I_{3/2}(\\eta_1)}{I_{1/2}(\\eta_1)}$, where $I_{3/2}(\\eta_1)$ is also computed via numerical integration.\n5.  Repeat steps 3-4 for $\\theta_2$ to find $\\eta_2$ and $U(\\theta_2)$.\n6.  Calculate the heat capacity as $(C_V/A)/k_B = (U(\\theta_2) - U(\\theta_1))/(2h)$.\n\n**Sommerfeld Low-Temperature Approximation:**\nFor low temperatures ($\\theta \\ll 1$), the heat capacity can be approximated by the leading term of the Sommerfeld expansion, which is linear in temperature:\n$$ \\frac{C_V}{A k_B} \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\frac{k_B T}{\\varepsilon_F} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\frac{T}{T_F} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\theta $$\n\n**Normalized Deviation:**\nThe relative difference between the numerically computed value and the low-temperature approximation is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{deviation} = \\frac{(C_V/A)_{numerical} - (C_V/A)_{Sommerfeld}}{(C_V/A)_{Sommerfeld}} $$\n\nThe implementation will utilize `scipy.integrate.quad` for the Fermi-Dirac integrals and `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` to solve for the reduced chemical potential $\\eta$.",

The relative proportions of neutrons and protons are given by the isospin asymmetry $\\delta = (\\rho_n - \\rho_p)/\\rho$, which implies $\\rho_n = \\rho(1+\\delta)/2$ and $\\rho_p = \\rho(1-\\delta)/2$.\n\nThe single-particle kinetic energy for a nucleon with wave number $k$ is non-relativistic:\n$$E(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$$\nwhere we use the constant $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} = \\frac{(\\hbar c)^2}{2mc^2}$. Given $\\hbar c = 197.3269804\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\cdot\\mathrm{fm}$ and $m \\equiv mc^2 = 939.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, this constant is approximately $20.7337\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\cdot\\mathrm{fm}^2$.\n\nThe particles obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which gives the probability of a state with energy $E$ being occupied:\n$$f(E, \\mu, T) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{T}\\right)}$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential of the particle species and $T$ is the temperature in units of $\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nThe number density $\\rho_i$ and kinetic energy density $\\varepsilon_i$ for each species $i \\in \\{n,p\\}$ are found by integrating over all momentum states, with a spin degeneracy factor of $g=2$:\n$$ \\rho_i(\\mu_i, T) = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^{\\infty} k^2 f(E(k), \\mu_i, T) dk $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_i(\\mu_i, T) = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^{\\infty} k^2 E(k) f(E(k), \\mu_i, T) dk $$\nThe total kinetic energy per particle, $E/A$, is the sum of the kinetic energy densities divided by the total number density:\n$$ E/A(\\delta) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_n + \\varepsilon_p}{\\rho} $$\n\n**2. Zero-Temperature Case ($T=0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$)**\n\nAt zero temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution becomes a Heaviside step function, $f(E,\\mu,0) = \\Theta(\\mu - E)$, where the chemical potential $\\mu(T=0)$ is the Fermi energy $E_{F_i}$. The integrals are sharply cut off at the Fermi wave number $k_{F_i}$, where $E(k_{F_i}) = E_{F_i}$.\n\nThe number density integral becomes:\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^{k_{F_i}} k^2 dk = \\frac{g}{6\\pi^2} k_{F_i}^3 $$\nWith $g=2$, we have $\\rho_i = k_{F_i}^3 / (3\\pi^2)$, which gives the Fermi wave number as $k_{F_i} = (3\\pi^2 \\rho_i)^{1/3}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy density integral becomes:\n$$ \\varepsilon_i = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^{k_{F_i}} k^2 \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}\\right) dk = \\frac{g\\hbar^2}{4\\pi^2 m} \\frac{k_{F_i}^5}{5} $$\nSubstituting $k_{F_i}$ and $g=2$, we can express $\\varepsilon_i$ in terms of $\\rho_i$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_i = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{10\\pi^2 m} (3\\pi^2 \\rho_i)^{5/3} = \\frac{3\\hbar^2(3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{10m} \\rho_i^{5/3} $$\nThe total kinetic energy per particle is then:\n$$ E/A(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( \\varepsilon_n + \\varepsilon_p \\right) = \\frac{3\\hbar^2(3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{10m\\rho} \\left[ \\rho_n^{5/3} + \\rho_p^{5/3} \\right] $$\nSubstituting $\\rho_n = \\rho(1+\\delta)/2$ and $\\rho_p = \\rho(1-\\delta)/2$:\n$$ E/A(\\delta) = \\frac{3\\hbar^2(3\\pi^2\\rho)^{2/3}}{10m \\cdot 2^{5/3}} \\left[ (1+\\delta)^{5/3} + (1-\\delta)^{5/3} \\right] $$\n\nThe kinetic symmetry energy $S_{\\mathrm{kin}}$ is the coefficient of $\\delta^2$ in the Taylor expansion of $E/A(\\delta)$ around $\\delta=0$. We expand the term in brackets: $(1+x)^p \\approx 1 + px + \\frac{p(p-1)}{2}x^2 + \\dots$. For $x=\\pm\\delta$ and $p=5/3$:\n$$ (1+\\delta)^{5/3} + (1-\\delta)^{5/3} \\approx \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{3}\\delta + \\frac{10}{9}\\delta^2\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{3}\\delta + \\frac{10}{9}\\delta^2\\right) = 2 + \\frac{20}{9}\\delta^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta^4) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E/A(\\delta)$ yields:\n$$ E/A(\\delta) = E/A(0) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{9}\\delta^2 + \\dots\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad E/A(0) = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m} = \\frac{3}{5} E_F(\\rho) $$\nHere $k_F = (3\\pi^2\\rho/2)^{1/3}$ is the Fermi wave number for symmetric ($\\delta=0$) matter. Thus, the expansion is:\n$$ E/A(\\delta) = \\frac{3}{5}E_F(\\rho) + \\frac{1}{3}E_F(\\rho)\\delta^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta^4) $$\nThe analytical expression for the kinetic symmetry energy at $T=0$ is therefore:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho, T=0) = \\frac{1}{3} E_F(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(\\frac{3\\pi^2\\rho}{2}\\right)^{2/3} $$\nThis formula is used to verify the numerically fitted value.\n\n**3. Finite-Temperature Case ($T0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$)**\n\nAt finite temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution is a smooth function and the integrals must be computed numerically. The procedure for calculating $E/A(\\delta)$ for a given $(\\rho, \\delta, T)$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $\\rho_n = \\rho(1+\\delta)/2$ and $\\rho_p = \\rho(1-\\delta)/2$.\n2.  For each species $i \\in \\{n, p\\}$, if $\\rho_i  0$, determine the chemical potential $\\mu_i$ by numerically solving the non-linear equation $\\rho_i = \\rho_i(\\mu_i, T)$. This is a root-finding problem for $\\mu_i$. Since $\\rho_i(\\mu_i, T)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\mu_i$, a robust root-bracketing method like Brent's method is suitable. The integral for $\\rho_i(\\mu_i,T)$ is computed using a numerical quadrature routine.\n3.  Once $\\mu_i$ is known, the kinetic energy density $\\varepsilon_i = \\varepsilon_i(\\mu_i, T)$ is calculated by numerically integrating its defining expression.\n4.  The total kinetic energy per particle is then computed as $E/A(\\delta) = (\\varepsilon_n+\\varepsilon_p)/\\rho$.\n\n**4. Numerical Extraction of the Symmetry Energy**\n\nThe problem asks to determine $S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho,T)$ from the expansion $E/A(\\delta) \\approx E/A(0) + S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho,T)\\delta^2$. This is a quadratic fit in $\\delta$, or equivalently, a linear fit in $\\delta^2$.\n1.  For a given $(\\rho, T)$, the quantity $E/A(\\delta_j)$ is computed for each $\\delta_j$ in the specified grid $\\{-0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4\\}$.\n2.  We perform a linear least-squares fit to the model $y_j = c_0 + c_1 x_j$, where the independent variable is $x_j = \\delta_j^2$ and the dependent variable is $y_j = E/A(\\delta_j)$.\n3.  This corresponds to solving the linear system $A\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ in the least-squares sense, where $\\mathbf{b}$ is the vector of computed $E/A(\\delta_j)$ values, $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1]^T$ is the vector of coefficients to be found, and $A$ is the design matrix:\n    $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\delta_1^2 \\\\ 1  \\delta_2^2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  \\delta_5^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0.16 \\\\ 1  0.04 \\\\ 1  0.00 \\\\ 1  0.04 \\\\ 1  0.16 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n4.  The fitted coefficient $c_1$ is the numerical estimate for the kinetic symmetry energy, $S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho,T)$.\n\nThis comprehensive approach combines analytical derivations for the $T=0$ case with a robust numerical strategy for the $T0$ case, culminating in a well-defined procedure to extract the kinetic symmetry energy.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical analysis of a homogeneous, non-interacting Fermi gas of nucleons, a foundational model in nuclear physics. The primary goal is to compute the pair correlation function, $g(r)$, at finite temperature $T$ and compare it with the known analytic result at zero temperature. This involves several computational steps: determining the chemical potential $\\mu$ that corresponds to a given nucleon density $\\rho$, followed by the numerical evaluation of integrals defining the one-body density matrix $\\rho_1(r)$, from which $g(r)$ is constructed.\n\nFirst, we establish the physical and numerical constants. The single-particle energy is given by the nonrelativistic dispersion relation $\\varepsilon_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, where $k$ is the wave number and $m$ is the nucleon mass. Using the provided constants $\\hbar c = 197.3269804\\,\\mathrm{MeV\\,fm}$ and $m = 939.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, and working in units where $c=1$, the kinetic energy coefficient is calculated as $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} = \\frac{(\\hbar c)^2}{2m} \\approx 20.7337\\,\\mathrm{MeV\\,fm}^2$. The analysis is performed for a fixed nucleon density of $\\rho = 0.16\\,\\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and a total degeneracy of $\\nu = 4$, corresponding to symmetric nuclear matter. From these, we define the zero-temperature Fermi wave number $k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} = \\left(\\frac{6 \\pi^2 \\rho}{\\nu}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 1.3327\\,\\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. A characteristic length scale used in one of the tests is $r_\\star = \\frac{\\pi}{k_{\\mathrm{F,0}}}$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the following set of definitions:\nThe momentum distribution is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, $n(k; \\mu, T) = \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_k - \\mu}{T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$.\nThe number density $\\rho$ is related to the chemical potential $\\mu$ and temperature $T$ via the integral equation:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm{d}k \\, k^2 \\, n(k; \\mu, T)\n$$\nThe one-body density matrix $\\rho_1(r)$ is the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution:\n$$\n\\rho_1(r) = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm{d}k \\, k^2 \\, n(k; \\mu, T) \\, \\frac{\\sin(k r)}{k r}\n$$\nThe normalized one-body density matrix is $n(r) = \\rho_1(r)/\\rho$, and the spin-isospin summed pair correlation function is given by:\n$$\ng(r) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\nu}\\, |n(r)|^2\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure begins with determining the chemical potential $\\mu$ for a given pair of $(\\rho, T)$. The equation for $\\rho$ is a transcendental equation for $\\mu$. We define a function $f(\\mu; T) = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm{d}k \\, k^2 \\, n(k; \\mu, T)\\right) - \\rho$. The desired $\\mu$ is the root of $f(\\mu; T) = 0$. Since the integrated density is a monotonically increasing function of $\\mu$, a unique root exists. This root is found numerically using a robust algorithm such as Brent's method, which requires finding an interval $[\\mu_a, \\mu_b]$ where $f(\\mu_a)$ and $f(\\mu_b)$ have opposite signs. The integral within $f(\\mu; T)$ is evaluated using numerical quadrature.\n\nOnce $\\mu$ is determined, we can compute $\\rho_1(r)$ for any radial distance $r \\ge 0$. The integral defining $\\rho_1(r)$ is also evaluated using numerical quadrature. The term $\\frac{\\sin(kr)}{kr}$ is well-behaved, approaching $1$ as $r \\to 0$. This ensures the integral is well-defined and can be computed robustly for all $r$, including $r=0$. At $r=0$, the integral for $\\rho_1(0)$ becomes identical to the integral in the density equation, so $\\rho_1(0) = \\rho$ by definition. Consequently, $n(0) = 1$ and $g(0) = 1 - 1/\\nu$. A numerical check of this identity serves as a validation of the self-consistency of the root-finding and integration procedures. After calculating $\\rho_1(r)$, we compute $n(r) = \\rho_1(r)/\\rho$ and finally $g(r) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\nu}n(r)^2$.\n\nFor validation and benchmarking, we use the analytic zero-temperature ($T \\to 0$) limit, known as the Slater model. In this limit, $n(k; \\mu, T)$ becomes a Heaviside step function, $\\Theta(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} - k)$. The integral for $\\rho_1(r)$ can then be solved analytically:\n$$\n\\rho_{1,0}(r) = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi^2 r} \\int_0^{k_{\\mathrm{F,0}}} \\mathrm{d}k \\, k \\sin(kr) = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{\\sin(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r) - k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r \\cos(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r)}{r^3}\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\rho = \\frac{\\nu k_{\\mathrm{F,0}}^3}{6\\pi^2}$, the normalized density matrix becomes:\n$$\nn_0(r) = \\frac{\\rho_{1,0}(r)}{\\rho} = 3 \\frac{\\sin(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r) - k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r \\cos(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r)}{(k_{\\mathrm{F,0}} r)^3}\n$$\nThe corresponding zero-temperature pair correlation function is $g_0(r) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\nu} |n_0(r)|^2$.\n\nThe program implements these steps to address the four test cases:\n1.  For $T = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, $\\mu$ is found, and $g_{\\mathrm{num}}(r)$ is computed on a grid. This is compared to the analytic $g_0(r)$ by calculating the maximum absolute deviation, $\\max_r |g_{\\mathrm{num}}(r) - g_{0}(r)|$, which is expected to be small, confirming the correctness of the finite-temperature code.\n2.  For a moderate temperature $T=5.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, the chemical potential $\\mu$ is computed and reported, illustrating the effect of thermal excitation on $\\mu$.\n3.  Also at $T=5.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, $g(0)$ is computed numerically by evaluating the integral for $\\rho_1(0)$ and using the found $\\mu$. The absolute deviation of this numerical result from the exact theoretical value $1 - 1/\\nu$ quantifies the precision of the numerical scheme.\n4.  At a high temperature $T=40.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, $g(r)$ is evaluated at $r=r_\\star$. This probes the damping of the exchange-hole correlations (Pauli blocking effects) at high temperatures.",
