This cross section is often expressed in terms of the astrophysical S-factor, $S(E)$, a function that encapsulates the purely nuclear aspects of the interaction by factoring out the dominant Coulomb repulsion. This first practice bridges the gap between experiment and theory by demonstrating how to extract $S(E)$ from raw laboratory data, such as the total measured yield and beam energy. A crucial part of this exercise involves propagating experimental uncertainties, a vital skill for assessing the confidence in the nuclear data that underpins all of stellar evolution theory .",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard task in experimental nuclear astrophysics: the determination of the astrophysical S-factor, $S(E)$, and its uncertainty from measured reaction yield data. All provided definitions, constants, and parameters are consistent with established nuclear physics principles and experimental practice. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the task is to relate the measured angle-integrated yield, $Y$, to the astrophysical S-factor, $S(E)$. This requires a multi-step derivation that connects the macroscopic observable ($Y$) to the microscopic nuclear physics quantity ($S(E)$) and subsequently propagates the experimental uncertainties.\n\nFirst, we establish the quantitative expression for the S-factor, $S(E)$. The relationship between the total yield $Y$ (dimensionless counts) and the total reaction cross section $\\sigma(E)$ (in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^2$) is given by:\n$$\nY = \\mathcal{L} \\, n_t \\, \\sigma(E) \\, \\varepsilon\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity (total number of projectiles per unit area, in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), $n_t$ is the target areal density (number of target nuclei per unit area, in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), and $\\varepsilon$ is the dimensionless detection efficiency. We can solve for the cross section:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\frac{Y}{\\mathcal{L} \\, n_t \\, \\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe astrophysical S-factor, $S(E)$, is defined to factor out the strong energy dependence of the cross section arising from the Coulomb barrier penetration by the charged projectile and target nuclei, along with a phase space factor. The standard definition is:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\frac{S(E)}{E} \\exp(-2\\pi\\eta(E))\n$$\nHere, $E$ is the center-of-mass energy, and $\\eta(E)$ is the dimensionless Sommerfeld parameter, which quantifies the strength of the Coulomb interaction. Solving this equation for $S(E)$ gives:\n$$\nS(E) = E \\cdot \\sigma(E) \\cdot \\exp(2\\pi\\eta(E))\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma(E)$ from the yield equation, we obtain the master formula for the S-factor in terms of the experimental observables:\n$$\nS(E) = E \\cdot \\left( \\frac{Y}{\\mathcal{L} \\, n_t \\, \\varepsilon} \\right) \\cdot \\exp(2\\pi\\eta(E))\n$$\nThe Sommerfeld parameter $\\eta(E)$ is given by $\\eta(E) = Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha c / v(E)$, where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the charge numbers of the reacting nuclei, $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $v(E)$ is the relative velocity. In the non-relativistic limit, $v(E) = \\sqrt{2E/\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass. For computation, all quantities must be in a consistent unit system (e.g., SI). If $E$ is given in $\\mathrm{keV}$ and $\\mu$ in $\\mathrm{amu}$, they must be converted to Joules and kilograms, respectively, using the provided conversion factors. Let $E_{\\mathrm{keV}}$ be the energy in $\\mathrm{keV}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{amu}}$ be the reduced mass in $\\mathrm{amu}$. The energy in joules is $E_{\\mathrm{J}} = E_{\\mathrm{keV}} \\times 10^3 \\times e$, and the mass in kilograms is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{kg}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{amu}} \\times u$, where $e$ is the elementary charge in Coulombs ($1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$) and $u$ is the atomic mass unit in kilograms. Substituting $v(E)$ into the expression for $\\eta(E)$ yields:\n$$\n\\eta(E) = Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{kg}}}{2E_{\\mathrm{J}}}}\n$$\nThe desired final units for $S(E)$ are $\\mathrm{keV} \\cdot \\mathrm{barn}$. The term $E$ in the S-factor formula should be in $\\mathrm{keV}$. The cross section $\\sigma(E)$ calculated from the yield equation is in $\\mathrm{cm}^2$ and must be converted to barns using the relation $1 \\, \\mathrm{barn} = 10^{-24} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2$. Thus, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{barn}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\times 10^{24}$.\n\nNext, we address the propagation of uncertainties. The problem specifies that the energy $E$ and yield $Y$ have uncertainties $\\delta E$ and $\\delta Y$, respectively, and are uncorrelated. All other parameters ($\\mathcal{L}, n_t, \\varepsilon$) are assumed to be known exactly. For a function $S(E, Y)$, the first-order (Gaussian) uncertainty propagation formula is:\n$$\n(\\delta S)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E} \\right)^2 (\\delta E)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial Y} \\right)^2 (\\delta Y)^2\n$$\nTo apply this, we compute the partial derivatives of our S-factor expression. It is convenient to work with relative uncertainties. Let $K = (10^{24})/(\\mathcal{L} n_t \\varepsilon)$ be a constant incorporating the unit conversion and experimental parameters. Our S-factor function is $S(E, Y) = K \\cdot E \\cdot Y \\cdot \\exp(2\\pi\\eta(E))$.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $Y$ is trivial:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial Y} = K \\cdot E \\cdot \\exp(2\\pi\\eta(E)) = \\frac{S}{Y}\n$$\nFor the partial derivative with respect to $E$, we recognize that $\\eta(E)$ is proportional to $E^{-1/2}$. Let $\\eta(E) = C E^{-1/2}$ where $C$ is a constant. The function is $S(E) \\propto E \\exp(2\\pi C E^{-1/2})$. Using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E} \\propto \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left[ E \\exp(2\\pi C E^{-1/2}) \\right] = 1 \\cdot \\exp(\\dots) + E \\cdot \\exp(\\dots) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}(2\\pi C E^{-1/2})\n$$\nThe derivative of the exponent is $2\\pi C \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} E^{-3/2}\\right) = -\\pi C E^{-3/2} = -\\pi \\eta(E)/E$.\nSubstituting this back gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E} \\propto \\exp(\\dots) \\left[ 1 + E \\left( -\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{E} \\right) \\right] = \\exp(\\dots) [1 - \\pi\\eta(E)]\n$$\nRestoring the proportionality constant $S/ (E \\exp(\\dots))$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E} = \\frac{S}{E} (1 - \\pi\\eta(E))\n$$\nPlugging these derivatives into the uncertainty formula yields:\n$$\n(\\delta S)^2 = \\left( \\frac{S}{E} (1 - \\pi\\eta) \\right)^2 (\\delta E)^2 + \\left( \\frac{S}{Y} \\right)^2 (\\delta Y)^2\n$$\nDividing by $S^2$ gives the squared relative uncertainty:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\delta S}{S}\\right)^2 = \\left( (1 - \\pi\\eta) \\frac{\\delta E}{E} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta Y}{Y} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe absolute uncertainty $\\delta S$ can then be calculated as:\n$$\n\\delta S = S \\sqrt{\\left( (1 - \\pi\\eta) \\frac{\\delta E}{E} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta Y}{Y} \\right)^2}\n$$\nThe computational algorithm will proceed for each test case by:\n1. Converting input quantities ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{amu}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{keV}}$) to SI units ($\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\mathrm{J}$).\n2. Calculating the Sommerfeld parameter $\\eta(E)$.\n3. Calculating the cross section $\\sigma(E)$ from the yield $Y$ and converting it to barns.\n4. Calculating the S-factor $S(E)$ in $\\mathrm{keV} \\cdot \\mathrm{barn}$.\n5. Calculating the uncertainty $\\delta S(E)$ using the derived propagation formula.\nThe process is then repeated for all test cases provided.",

Assuming the particles (1 and 2, with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$) are in a plasma at temperature $T$ and follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the distribution of their relative speeds $v$ is given by:\n$$\n\\phi(v)\\,dv = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) v^2 \\,dv\n$$\nwhere $\\mu = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)$ is the reduced mass and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe reaction rate is the integral of $\\sigma(v) v$ over this distribution:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(v) v \\, \\phi(v) \\, dv = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(v) v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) dv\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the center-of-mass energy $E$, we use the relation $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$. This gives $v^2 = 2E/\\mu$ and $v = \\sqrt{2E/\\mu}$. The differential element $dv$ is found by differentiating $E$: $dE = \\mu v \\, dv$, which means $v \\, dv = dE/\\mu$. We can rewrite the term $v^3 \\, dv$ as $(v^2)(v \\, dv)$:\n$$\nv^3 \\, dv = \\left(\\frac{2E}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{dE}{\\mu}\\right) = \\frac{2E}{\\mu^2} dE\n$$\nThe exponential term becomes $\\exp(-E/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$. Substituting these into the integral for $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(E) \\left(\\frac{2E}{\\mu^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) dE\n$$\nSimplifying the constant pre-factor:\n$$\n4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{2}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{8\\pi}{\\mu^2} \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{(2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{3/2}} = \\frac{8\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\mu} (2\\pi)^{3/2} (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{3/2}} = \\frac{2^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{3/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nThus, the rate in terms of energy is:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(E) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) dE\n$$\nThe problem specifies the nonresonant cross section model $\\sigma(E) = S(E)\\,E^{-1}\\,\\exp(-2\\pi \\eta)$, where $2\\pi \\eta = \\sqrt{E_G/E}$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(S(E) E^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right)\\right) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) dE\n$$\nThe terms $E^{-1}$ and $E$ cancel, yielding the final derived form of the integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty S(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - \\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right) dE\n$$\nThis expression separates the astrophysical $S$-factor $S(E)$ from the thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-E/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$ and the quantum-mechanical barrier penetration (Gamow) factor $\\exp(-\\sqrt{E_G/E})$. The product of these two exponentials forms the \"Gamow peak,\" which is a sharply peaked function of energy.\n\n### Calculation of Fractional Error $\\epsilon$ and Numerical Strategy\n\nThe fractional error $\\epsilon$ is defined as $\\epsilon = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{const}}/\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{true}} - 1$. The pre-factor $\\sqrt{8/(\\pi\\mu)} (1/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)^{3/2}$ is common to both rates and cancels in the ratio. The remaining integrals determine $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty S_{\\mathrm{const}}(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - \\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty S_{\\mathrm{true}}(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - \\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right) dE} - 1 $$\nFrom the problem, $S_{\\mathrm{true}}(E) = S_0 (1 + a E + b E^2)$ and $S_{\\mathrm{const}}(E)$ corresponds to using $a=0, b=0$, so $S_{\\mathrm{const}}(E) = S_0$. With $S_0=1$, we have $S_{\\mathrm{true}}(E) = 1 + a E + b E^2$ and $S_{\\mathrm{const}}(E) = 1$. Let $W(E) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - \\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right)$. Then:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty W(E) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty (1+aE+bE^2) W(E) dE} - 1 $$\nThe integrand involving $W(E)$ is numerically challenging due to its extremely small values outside a narrow energy range (the Gamow peak). To ensure numerical stability, we can scale the integrand. The exponent $g(E) = -E/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T - \\sqrt{E_G/E}$ has a maximum at the Gamow peak energy $E_0$, found by setting $dg/dE=0$. This yields:\n$$ E_0 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{E_G} k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{2}\\right)^{2/3} $$\nThe maximum value of the exponent is $g_{max} = g(E_0) = -3E_0 / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$. We can rewrite the integrals as:\n$$ I = \\int_0^\\infty S(E) \\exp(g(E)) dE = \\exp(g_{max}) \\int_0^\\infty S(E) \\exp(g(E) - g_{max}) dE $$\nThe scaled integrand $S(E) \\exp(g(E) - g_{max})$ has a maximum value close to $S(E_0)$, which is of order unity, thus preventing underflow. Since $\\exp(g_{max})$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator of $\\epsilon$'s ratio, it cancels. The algorithm will therefore compute the ratio of the integrals of the scaled integrands.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows:\n1.  Define the required physical and mathematical constants.\n2.  For each test case $(T_9, a, b)$:\n    a. Calculate the system-dependent constants: reduced mass $\\mu$, energy equivalent $\\mu c^2$, and Gamow energy $E_G$. All energies are in $\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n    b. Calculate the thermal energy $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ from the given temperature $T_9$ (in GK).\n    c. Determine the Gamow peak energy $E_0$ and the scaling factor exponent $g_{max}$.\n    d. Define the scaled exponential kernel $W_{scaled}(E) = \\exp(g(E) - g_{max})$.\n    e. Numerically integrate $I_{\\mathrm{const}}' = \\int_0^\\infty W_{scaled}(E) dE$ and $I_{\\mathrm{true}}' = \\int_0^\\infty (1+aE+bE^2) W_{scaled}(E) dE$ using a robust quadrature method like `scipy.integrate.quad` over the interval $[0, \\infty)$.\n    f. Compute the fractional error $\\epsilon = I_{\\mathrm{const}}' / I_{\\mathrm{true}}' - 1$.\n3.  Collect the results and format them as specified.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics and nuclear astrophysics (Debye-Hückel theory), is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the weak-screening length and enhancement factor, followed by a numerical calculation for specific stellar conditions.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Debye Length and Weak-Screening Factor**\n\nWe begin with the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ in a plasma, given in Gaussian cgs units:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -4\\pi \\sum_j Z_j e\\, n_j(\\phi) $$\nThe sum is over all charged particle species $j$ (ions and electrons). The number density $n_j$ of each species follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the potential $\\phi$:\n$$ n_j(\\phi) = n_{j0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Z_j e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $n_{j0}$ is the average number density of species $j$, $Z_j e$ is its charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nIn the weak-screening limit, the electrostatic potential energy is much smaller than the characteristic thermal energy, i.e., $|Z_j e \\phi| \\ll k_B T$. This allows for a first-order Taylor expansion of the exponential:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Z_j e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{Z_j e \\phi}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this linearized density into the Poisson equation yields:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -4\\pi \\sum_j Z_j e n_{j0} \\left(1 - \\frac{Z_j e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right) = -4\\pi \\left( \\sum_j Z_j e n_{j0} - \\frac{e^2 \\phi}{k_B T} \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} \\right) $$\nThe first term in the parentheses, $\\sum_j Z_j e n_{j0}$, is the net charge density of the unperturbed plasma. The plasma is assumed to be globally charge-neutral, so this sum is zero. The Poisson equation thus simplifies to the screened Poisson equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} \\right) \\phi $$\nThis equation is of the form $\\nabla^2 \\phi = k_D^2 \\phi$, where we define the square of the inverse Debye length as:\n$$ k_D^2 = \\frac{1}{R_D^2} = \\frac{4\\pi e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} $$\nThe Debye length $R_D$ is therefore:\n$$ R_D = \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{4\\pi e^2 \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0}} \\right)^{1/2} $$\nFor a central point charge $Z_1 e$, the spherically symmetric solution to $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\phi/R_D^2$ that vanishes at infinity and approaches the bare Coulomb potential as $r \\to 0$ is the Debye-Hückel potential:\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{Z_1 e}{r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R_D}\\right) $$\nThe interaction potential energy between the central charge $Z_1$ and an incoming particle of charge $Z_2$ is $U(r) = Z_2 e \\phi(r)$. The screening effect introduces a perturbation to the bare Coulomb potential energy $U_C(r) = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r}$. The perturbation energy is:\n$$ \\Delta U(r) = U(r) - U_C(r) = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r} \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R_D}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nIn the weak-screening regime, most nuclear reactions occur at distances much smaller than the Debye length ($r \\ll R_D$). We can Taylor expand the exponential to first order: $\\exp(-r/R_D) \\approx 1 - r/R_D$. The potential energy shift becomes approximately constant:\n$$ \\Delta U(r) \\approx \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r} \\left( \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R_D}\\right) - 1 \\right) = -\\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{R_D} $$\nThis constant energy shift, $U_s = - \\Delta U = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{R_D}$, effectively lowers the Coulomb barrier. The reaction rate, which is averaged over the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution of particles $\\propto \\exp(-E/k_B T)$, is enhanced by a factor corresponding to this energy shift. The weak-screening enhancement factor, $f_{\\mathrm{sc}}$, is the ratio of the screened to the unscreened reaction rates, which is well-approximated by:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{sc}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{U_s}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{R_D k_B T}\\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we compute the number densities of the constituent particles. The plasma consists of fully ionized hydrogen ($Z_H=1, A_H=1$) and helium ($Z_{He}=2, A_{He}=4$), and electrons ($Z_e=-1$). The mass fractions are $X_H = 0.7$ and $X_{He} = 0.28$. The plasma parameters are $\\rho = 150\\ \\mathrm{g\\ cm^{-3}}$ and $T = 0.02 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{K} = 2 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe number density of an ion species $i$ is $n_i = \\frac{X_i \\rho}{A_i m_u}$.\n$$ n_H = \\frac{X_H \\rho}{A_H m_u} = \\frac{0.7 \\times 150\\ \\mathrm{g\\ cm^{-3}}}{1 \\times 1.660539 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{g}} \\approx 6.3232 \\times 10^{25}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\n$$ n_{He} = \\frac{X_{He} \\rho}{A_{He} m_u} = \\frac{0.28 \\times 150\\ \\mathrm{g\\ cm^{-3}}}{4 \\times 1.660539 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{g}} \\approx 6.3232 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\nThe electron number density $n_e$ is determined by charge neutrality: $n_e = \\sum_i Z_i n_i = Z_H n_H + Z_{He} n_{He}$.\n$$ n_e = 1 \\cdot n_H + 2 \\cdot n_{He} \\approx (6.3232 \\times 10^{25} + 2 \\times 6.3232 \\times 10^{24})\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\approx 7.5878 \\times 10^{25}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\nNext, we compute the sum $\\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0}$, which includes ions and electrons:\n$$ \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} = Z_H^2 n_H + Z_{He}^2 n_{He} + Z_e^2 n_e = 1^2 n_H + 2^2 n_{He} + (-1)^2 n_e = n_H + 4 n_{He} + n_e $$\nUsing the relation $n_e = n_H + 2 n_{He}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} = n_H + 4 n_{He} + (n_H + 2 n_{He}) = 2 n_H + 6 n_{He} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_H$ and $n_{He}$:\n$$ \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} = \\frac{\\rho}{m_u} \\left( 2 \\frac{X_H}{A_H} + 6 \\frac{X_{He}}{A_{He}} \\right) = \\frac{150}{m_u} \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 0.7}{1} + \\frac{6 \\times 0.28}{4} \\right) = \\frac{150}{m_u} (1.4 + 0.42) = \\frac{273}{m_u} $$\n$$ \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0} = \\frac{273}{1.660539 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{g}} \\approx 1.6440 \\times 10^{26}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\nNow we can calculate the Debye length $R_D$:\n$$ R_D^2 = \\frac{k_B T}{4\\pi e^2 \\sum_j Z_j^2 n_{j0}} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ K^{-1}}) (2 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{K})}{4\\pi (4.8032047 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{esu})^2 (1.6440 \\times 10^{26}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}})} $$\n$$ R_D^2 \\approx \\frac{2.7613 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{erg}}{4\\pi (2.3071 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ cm}) (1.6440 \\times 10^{26}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}})} \\approx \\frac{2.7613 \\times 10^{-9}}{4.7665 \\times 10^8}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2} \\approx 5.7931 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2} $$\n$$ R_D \\approx \\sqrt{5.7931 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}} \\approx 2.4069 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R_D = 2.407 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the screening factors $f_{\\mathrm{sc}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{R_D k_B T}\\right)$. The argument of the exponential is:\n$$ \\frac{e^2}{R_D k_B T} = \\frac{2.3071 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ cm}}{(2.4069 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{cm})(2.7613 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{erg})} \\approx \\frac{2.3071 \\times 10^{-19}}{6.6463 \\times 10^{-18}} \\approx 0.034714 $$\n\nFor the proton-proton ($p+p$) reaction, $Z_1=1$, $Z_2=1$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+p) = \\exp(1 \\times 1 \\times 0.034714) = \\exp(0.034714) \\approx 1.0353 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+p) = 1.035$.\n\nFor the proton-nitrogen ($p+{}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$) reaction, $Z_1=1$, $Z_2=7$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+{}^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = \\exp(1 \\times 7 \\times 0.034714) = \\exp(0.24300) \\approx 1.2751 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+{}^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 1.275$.\n\nThe requested ordered triple is $\\left(R_D,\\ f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p{+}p),\\ f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p{+}{}^{14}\\mathrm{N})\\right)$, with values rounded to four significant figures.\n$R_D = 2.407 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n$f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+p) = 1.035$\n$f_{\\mathrm{sc}}(p+{}^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 1.275$",
