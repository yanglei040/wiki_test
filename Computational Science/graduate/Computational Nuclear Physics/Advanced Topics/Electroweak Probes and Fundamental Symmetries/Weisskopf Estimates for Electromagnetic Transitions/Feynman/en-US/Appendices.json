            "problem": "Consider electromagnetic radiation emitted in a nuclear transition from an initial angular momentum and parity state $J_i^\\pi$ to a final state $J_f^\\pi$. Electromagnetic radiation of multipolarity $L$ carries angular momentum $L$ and transforms under spatial inversion with a parity factor that depends on whether the radiation is electric ($E L$) or magnetic ($M L$): an electric multipole of order $L$ changes parity by a factor $(-1)^L$, whereas a magnetic multipole changes parity by $(-1)^{L+1}$. Assume real photon emission, so the radiated field must carry nonzero angular momentum.\n\nStarting from angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics and the properties of the Clebsch–Gordan (CG) series, derive the angular momentum selection condition that constrains the radiation multipole $L$ in terms of $J_i$ and $J_f$, and then apply the parity rule to the specific transition $J_i^\\pi=0^+$ to $J_f^\\pi=2^+$. Use the Weisskopf single-particle model to identify how the reduced transition probability $B(E L)$ scales with mass number $A$ via the nuclear radius $R$ and how the partial $\\gamma$-decay rate scales with the transition energy $E_\\gamma$ and the multipole order $L$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard problem in nuclear physics concerning electromagnetic transitions, which can be solved using fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and established nuclear models.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of the angular momentum and parity selection rules; second, the application of these rules to the specific transition $J_i^\\pi=0^+ \\to J_f^\\pi=2^+$; and third, the determination of the scaling relations from the Weisskopf single-particle model. Finally, each provided option will be evaluated against these results.\n\n**1. Angular Momentum and Parity Selection Rules**\n\nAn electromagnetic transition involves the emission of a photon, which is a quantum of the electromagnetic field. This photon carries a definite amount of angular momentum, denoted by the multipole order $L$, and has a definite parity, $\\pi_\\gamma$.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial nucleus has angular momentum $J_i$, and the final system consists of the nucleus with angular momentum $J_f$ and the emitted photon with angular momentum $L$. The conservation law is expressed through the vector coupling of angular momenta:\n    $$ \\vec{J_i} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{L} $$\n    This vector addition implies the \"triangle inequality\" for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$ |J_i - J_f| \\le L \\le J_i + J_f $$\n    Furthermore, for a transition involving the emission of a single real photon, the multipolarity must be non-zero, i.e., $L \\ge 1$. This is because a real photon is a transverse field and cannot have zero angular momentum.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation**: The electromagnetic interaction conserves parity. Therefore, the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parities of the final state components:\n    $$ \\pi_i = \\pi_f \\cdot \\pi_\\gamma $$\n    where $\\pi_i$ and $\\pi_f$ are the parities of the initial and final nuclear states, and $\\pi_\\gamma$ is the parity of the emitted radiation. The parity of the radiation depends on its type (electric or magnetic) and multipolarity $L$:\n    *   For electric multipole radiation ($EL$): $\\pi_\\gamma(EL) = (-1)^L$\n    *   For magnetic multipole radiation ($ML$): $\\pi_\\gamma(ML) = (-1)^{L+1}$\n\n**2. Application to the $0^+ \\to 2^+$ Transition**\n\nWe now apply these general rules to the specific transition from an initial state $J_i^\\pi = 0^+$ to a final state $J_f^\\pi = 2^+$.\n\n*   **Allowed Multipolarity $L$**: Using the angular momentum selection rule with $J_i=0$ and $J_f=2$:\n    $$ |0 - 2| \\le L \\le 0 + 2 $$\n    $$ 2 \\le L \\le 2 $$\n    This uniquely determines the multipolarity of the radiation to be $L=2$. This satisfies the condition $L \\ge 1$.\n\n*   **Allowed Radiation Type ($E$ or $M$)**: We use the parity selection rule with $\\pi_i = +1$ (for the $0^+$ state) and $\\pi_f = +1$ (for the $2^+$ state).\n    $$ \\pi_i = \\pi_f \\cdot \\pi_\\gamma $$\n    $$ (+1) = (+1) \\cdot \\pi_\\gamma $$\n    This implies that the parity of the emitted radiation must be even: $\\pi_\\gamma = +1$. Now we check this condition for the allowed multipolarity $L=2$:\n    *   For an electric quadrupole ($E2$) transition: $\\pi_\\gamma(E2) = (-1)^2 = +1$. This is allowed.\n    *   For a magnetic quadrupole ($M2$) transition: $\\pi_\\gamma(M2) = (-1)^{2+1} = -1$. This is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, the transition $0^+ \\to 2^+$ must proceed via pure electric quadrupole ($E2$) radiation.\n\n**3. Weisskopf Estimates for Scaling**\n\nThe Weisskopf model provides single-particle estimates for transition rates. It assumes the transition is due to a single nucleon changing its state within a simple potential well of radius $R$.\n\n*   **Reduced Transition Probability $B(EL)$**: The reduced transition probability for an electric multipole transition, $B(EL)$, is proportional to the square of the electric multipole moment. In the single-particle model, this moment scales with the nuclear radius $R$ as $R^L$. Therefore:\n    $$ B(EL)_{sp} \\propto (R^L)^2 = R^{2L} $$\n    The nuclear radius is empirically known to scale with the mass number $A$ as $R = R_0 A^{1/3}$, where $R_0$ is a constant. Substituting this into the scaling for $B(EL)$:\n    $$ B(EL)_{sp} \\propto (A^{1/3})^{2L} = A^{2L/3} $$\n    For our $E2$ transition, $L=2$:\n    $$ B(E2)_{sp} \\propto R^{2(2)} = R^4 \\implies B(E2)_{sp} \\propto A^{2(2)/3} = A^{4/3} $$\n\n*   **Partial Decay Rate $\\lambda_W$**: The partial decay rate (transition probability per unit time) for a given multipole transition depends strongly on the transition energy $E_\\gamma$ and the reduced transition probability. The theoretical scaling is:\n    $$ \\lambda_W(EL) \\propto E_\\gamma^{2L+1} B(EL) $$\n    Substituting the Weisskopf estimate for $B(EL)_{sp}$:\n    $$ \\lambda_W(EL) \\propto E_\\gamma^{2L+1} A^{2L/3} $$\n    For our $E2$ transition, $L=2$:\n    $$ \\lambda_W(E2) \\propto E_\\gamma^{2(2)+1} A^{2(2)/3} = E_\\gamma^5 A^{4/3} $$\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on the derivations above.\n\n*   **A. From angular momentum coupling, $|J_i-J_f|\\le L\\le J_i+J_f$ and $L\\neq 0$, so only $L=2$ is allowed for $0^+\\to 2^+$. Parity conservation ($\\pi_f=\\pi_i$) then selects electric quadrupole ($E2$) and forbids magnetic quadrupole ($M2$). In the Weisskopf estimate, $B(E2)\\propto R^{4}\\propto A^{4/3}$ and the partial rate scales as $E_\\gamma^{2L+1}=E_\\gamma^{5}$, hence $\\lambda_W(E2)\\propto A^{4/3}E_\\gamma^{5}$.**\n    *   Angular momentum selection rule and its application to $0^+ \\to 2^+$ to get $L=2$: Correct.\n    *   Parity selection rule application: The condition $\\pi_i = \\pi_f$ implies even parity radiation, which selects $E2$ and forbids $M2$. Correct.\n    *   Weisskopf scaling for $B(E2)$: $B(E2) \\propto R^{2(2)} = R^4$. Since $R \\propto A^{1/3}$, $B(E2) \\propto (A^{1/3})^4 = A^{4/3}$. Correct.\n    *   Weisskopf scaling for $\\lambda_W(E2)$: $\\lambda_W(E2) \\propto E_\\gamma^{2(2)+1} A^{4/3} = E_\\gamma^5 A^{4/3}$. Correct.\n    *   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. The allowed radiation satisfies $L=1$ or $L=2$ for $0^+\\to 2^+$, and parity conservation favors magnetic quadrupole ($M2$) over electric quadrupole ($E2$). The Weisskopf rate scales as $\\lambda\\propto A^{2/3}E_\\gamma^{3}$.**\n    *   Allowed $L$: Incorrect. The triangle inequality $|0-2| \\le L \\le 0+2$ strictly limits $L$ to $2$.\n    *   Parity selection: Incorrect. Parity conservation requires even parity radiation, which selects $E2$ and forbids $M2$.\n    *   Rate scaling: Incorrect. The scaling $\\lambda \\propto A^{2/3}E_\\gamma^3$ corresponds to an $E1$ transition ($L=1$), not the required $E2$ transition.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Since $L\\ge 0$, the possibilities are $L=0,1,2$ for $0^+\\to 2^+$, and parity conservation allows electric dipole ($E1$). The Weisskopf rate is independent of $A$ and scales as $\\lambda\\propto E_\\gamma^{3}$.**\n    *   Allowed $L$: Incorrect. This ignores the lower bound from the triangle inequality, $|J_i-J_f| \\le L$, as well as the $L \\neq 0$ rule for single photon emission.\n    *   Parity selection: Incorrect. $E1$ ($L=1$) radiation has odd parity ($(-1)^1 = -1$), which is forbidden for a transition with no parity change.\n    *   Rate scaling: Incorrect. Independence from $A$ would imply $L=0$, which is forbidden. The $E_\\gamma^3$ scaling is for $L=1$.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Only $L=2$ is allowed by angular momentum coupling for $0^+\\to 2^+$, and parity conservation allows both $E2$ and $M2$. The Weisskopf $E2$ rate scales as $\\lambda\\propto A^{2}E_\\gamma^{7}$.**\n    *   Allowed $L$: Correct.\n    *   Parity selection: Incorrect. Parity conservation allows only $E2$ and forbids $M2$.\n    *   Rate scaling: Incorrect. The scaling $\\lambda \\propto A^2 E_\\gamma^7$ corresponds to an $L=3$ transition, specifically $E3$ ($\\lambda \\propto A^{2(3)/3}E_\\gamma^{2(3)+1} = A^2E_\\gamma^7$). The correct scaling for $E2$ is $\\lambda \\propto A^{4/3}E_\\gamma^5$.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and the Weisskopf model.",

            "solution": "The user has requested a rigorous validation and solution for a problem in computational nuclear physics concerning the scaling of electromagnetic transition probabilities.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nI will first validate the problem statement according to the specified procedure.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data, definitions, and model-based assumptions:\n1.  **System**: Two isotopes of the same element, implying a constant proton number $Z$ and different mass numbers $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n2.  **Condition**: The isotopes share the same quadrupole deformation parameter, $\\beta_2$.\n3.  **Model Context**: A collective rotor description for electric quadrupole ($E2$) transitions and the Weisskopf single-particle estimate as a benchmark.\n4.  **Fundamental Bases (Scaling Laws)**:\n    -   Nuclear radius: $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, where $r_0$ is a constant.

It is built upon standard, well-established models in nuclear structure physics: the collective model (specifically the rigid rotor) and the Weisskopf single-particle model. The scaling relations for the nuclear radius ($R \\propto A^{1/3}$), the collective quadrupole moment ($Q_0$), and the single-particle transition estimates are canonical approximations taught in graduate-level nuclear physics courses.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the scaling with mass number $A$ for the collective reduced transition probability $B(E2)$, the Weisskopf estimate $B_W(E2)$, and their ratio, under the specified conditions ($Z$ and $\\beta_2$ are constant).\n\n**1. Scaling of the Collective $B(E2)$**\n\n-   The problem states that for a collective rotor, $B(E2) \\propto Q_0^2$.\n-   It also states that the intrinsic quadrupole moment scales as $Q_0 \\propto Z e\\, R^2\\, \\beta_2$.\n-   Substituting the expression for $Q_0$ into the one for $B(E2)$, we get:\n    $$ B(E2) \\propto (Z e\\, R^2\\, \\beta_2)^2 = Z^2 e^2 R^4 \\beta_2^2 $$\n-   The nuclear radius is given to scale as $R \\propto A^{1/3}$. Therefore, $R^4 \\propto (A^{1/3})^4 = A^{4/3}$.\n-   Substituting this into the expression for $B(E2)$:\n    $$ B(E2) \\propto Z^2 e^2 (A^{4/3}) \\beta_2^2 $$\n-   Since we are considering isotopes ($Z$ is constant) with a fixed deformation ($\\beta_2$ is constant), the scaling of $B(E2)$ with mass number is:\n    $$ B(E2) \\propto A^{4/3} $$\n\n**2. Scaling of the Weisskopf Estimate $B_W(E2)$**\n\n-   The problem statement provides the scaling for the Weisskopf estimate directly: $B_W(E2) \\propto e^2 R^4$.\n-   Again, using the scaling for the nuclear radius, $R \\propto A^{1/3}$, we find:\n    $$ B_W(E2) \\propto e^2 (A^{1/3})^4 = e^2 A^{4/3} $$\n-   Thus, the Weisskopf estimate also scales with mass number as:\n    $$ B_W(E2) \\propto A^{4/3} $$\n\n**3. Scaling of the Ratio $B(E2)/B_W(E2)$**\n\n-   Using the full proportionalities derived above:\n    $$ \\frac{B(E2)}{B_W(E2)} \\propto \\frac{Z^2 e^2 R^4 \\beta_2^2}{e^2 R^4} $$\n-   The terms $e^2$ and $R^4$ cancel out.\n    $$ \\frac{B(E2)}{B_W(E2)} \\propto Z^2 \\beta_2^2 $$\n-   Alternatively, using the final scaling with $A$:\n    $$ \\frac{B(E2)}{B_W(E2)} \\propto \\frac{A^{4/3}}{A^{4/3}} = A^0 = 1 $$\n-   This shows that, within the assumptions of the given models, the ratio $B(E2)/B_W(E2)$ is independent of the mass number $A$. Its magnitude is determined by the constants of proportionality and, most significantly, by the factors $Z^2$ and $\\beta_2^2$. This ratio is often used as a measure of collectivity; a large value indicates that the transition is highly collective (many nucleons participate), consistent with the dependence on the number of protons $Z$ and the degree of collective deformation $\\beta_2$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nNow I will evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n-   **A. Both $B(E2)$ and $B_W(E2)$ scale approximately as $A^{4/3}$, so their ratio is nearly independent of $A$, and is primarily sensitive to $Z^2$ and $\\beta_2^2$ through the collective quadrupole moment.**\n    -   My derivation shows that $B(E2) \\propto A^{4/3}$ and $B_W(E2) \\propto A^{4/3}$. This is consistent with the first part of the statement.\n    -   My derivation also shows that the ratio $\\frac{B(E2)}{B_W(E2)}$ is independent of $A$ and proportional to $Z^2 \\beta_2^2$. This is consistent with the second part of the statement.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. $B(E2)$ scales as $A^{2/3}$ because it is a surface property, whereas $B_W(E2)$ scales as $A^{4/3}$, so $B(E2)/B_W(E2)$ decreases with increasing $A$; its dependence on $Z$ and $\\beta_2$ is weak compared to $A$.**\n    -   The premise that $B(E2)$ scales as $A^{2/3}$ is incorrect. My derivation, based on the provided fundamentals ($B(E2) \\propto Q_0^2$ and $Q_0 \\propto R^2$), shows a scaling of $A^{4/3}$. The justification \"because it is a surface property\" is a physical misinterpretation; while the deformation can be viewed as a surface effect, the quadrupole moment is a volume integral over the charge distribution, scaling with $R^2$, leading to $B(E2) \\propto (R^2)^2 = R^4 \\propto A^{4/3}$.\n    -   The conclusion that the ratio decreases with $A$ is therefore incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. $B_W(E2)$ is independent of $A$ because it is a single-particle estimate, while $B(E2)$ grows as $A^{4/3}$; thus $B(E2)/B_W(E2)$ increases with $A$ and is only weakly dependent on $Z$ and $\\beta_2$.**\n    -   The premise that $B_W(E2)$ is independent of $A$ is incorrect. A single-particle estimate is calculated for a nucleon within a potential well whose size is defined by the nuclear radius $R$. Since $R$ depends on $A$, so does $B_W(E2)$. My derivation confirms $B_W(E2) \\propto R^4 \\propto A^{4/3}$.\n    -   The conclusion that the ratio increases with $A$ is therefore incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Even with the same $\\beta_2$, the ratio $B(E2)/B_W(E2)$ depends strongly on the neutron number through shell structure and cannot be captured by simple scaling in $A$, $Z$, and $\\beta_2$; therefore, it is not primarily sensitive to $Z$ and $\\beta_2$.**\n    -   This statement introduces physical effects (shell structure) that are explicitly outside the scope of the simplified models provided in the problem's \"fundamental bases\". The question requires reasoning *within the framework of the given models*. While it is true that in reality, shell effects can cause significant deviations from these simple scaling laws, the problem is an exercise in applying the models as given. Based on the provided rotor and Weisskopf models, the ratio *is* independent of $A$ and primarily sensitive to $Z$ and $\\beta_2$. This option contradicts the direct consequences of the premises.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Begin from the definitions of reduced transition probabilities and multipole operators in nuclear electromagnetic transitions, and use only the following foundational starting points:\n\n- The reduced transition probability $B(\\pi L)$ is the square of the reduced matrix element of the corresponding multipole operator, where $\\pi \\in \\{\\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{M}\\}$ denotes electric or magnetic character and $L \\in \\mathbb{N}$ denotes the multipolarity.\n- The electric multipole operator of order $L$ scales radially as $r^L$, and the magnetic multipole operator of order $L$ scales radially as $r^{L-1}$ times a magneton factor; under a uniform density model with a sharp radius $R$, the radial integrals are dominated by powers of $R$.\n- The nuclear radius is modeled as $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, where $A$ is the mass number and $r_0$ is a radius parameter in femtometers ($\\mathrm{fm}$).\n\nYour objectives are:\n\n1) Derive, from these bases and angular momentum algebra of reduced matrix elements, the scaling laws of the Weisskopf single-particle estimates $B_W(\\pi L)$ with respect to $A$ and $r_0$ for both electric and magnetic transitions, including any numerical coefficients that arise from the uniform-density radial integral. Express the final $B_W(\\pi L)$ in conventional nuclear units: for electric transitions as multiples of $e^2 \\,\\mathrm{fm}^{2L}$ and for magnetic transitions as multiples of $\\mu_N^2 \\,\\mathrm{fm}^{2L-2}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $\\mu_N$ is the nuclear magneton. You must explicitly show how the dependence on $R$ enters the matrix element.\n\n2) Using your derived expressions, define a dimensionless sensitivity metric that quantifies the effect of varying $r_0$ in the closed interval $[r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}] = [1.1, 1.3]\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ relative to a reference value $r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. The metric must be the peak-to-peak fractional variation relative to the reference value:\n$$\nS(\\pi,L;A) \\equiv \\max_{r_0 \\in \\{r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}\\}} \\frac{B_W(\\pi L; r_0)}{B_W(\\pi L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})} \\;-\\; \\min_{r_0 \\in \\{r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}\\}} \\frac{B_W(\\pi L; r_0)}{B_W(\\pi L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})}.\n$$\nShow that the constants and the $A$-dependence cancel in this ratio, leaving only a dependence on ratios of $r_0$ and the appropriate power determined by $(\\pi,L)$.\n\n3) Implement a program that computes $S(\\pi,L;A)$ for a specified test suite. Your implementation must:\n- Use $r_{0,\\min} = 1.1$, $r_{0,\\max} = 1.3$, and $r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.2$ (all in $\\mathrm{fm}$).\n- Treat each case independently at fixed $A$, $\\pi$, and $L$.\n- Output the results as unitless decimal floats rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite to evaluate:\n- Case 1: $A=60$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{E}$, $L=2$\n- Case 2: $A=208$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{E}$, $L=3$\n- Case 3: $A=16$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{E}$, $L=1$\n- Case 4: $A=100$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{M}$, $L=1$\n- Case 5: $A=150$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{M}$, $L=2$\n- Case 6: $A=90$, $\\pi = \\mathrm{E}$, $L=4$\n\nFinal output format requirement:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the six results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\ldots,\\text{result}_6]$, where each result is a unitless float rounded to six decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the standard Weisskopf model of nuclear transitions, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All necessary data and definitions for a complete derivation and computation are provided. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: first, the derivation of scaling laws for Weisskopf single-particle estimates; second, the formulation of a dimensionless sensitivity metric; and third, the implementation of a program to compute this metric for a given test suite.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Weisskopf Estimate Scaling Laws**\n\nThe reduced transition probability $B(\\pi L)$ is proportional to the square of the reduced matrix element of the multipole operator, $\\hat{O}(\\pi L)$. The Weisskopf model simplifies the calculation of this matrix element by assuming that the transition is caused by a single nucleon and that its probability density is uniform within a sharp nuclear radius $R$. The radial part of the matrix element is an integral of the form $\\langle r^k \\rangle$. With a uniform probability density ($1/V = 3/(4\\pi R^3)$), this integral becomes:\n$$\n\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\int_{\\text{nucleus}} r^k \\cdot (\\text{probability density}) \\cdot dV = \\int_0^R r^k \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi R^3}\\right) 4\\pi r^2 dr = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\int_0^R r^{k+2} dr = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\frac{R^{k+3}}{k+3} = \\frac{3}{k+3}R^k\n$$\nThis result is central to determining the scaling with the nuclear radius $R$. The nuclear radius is given by the relation $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, where $A$ is the mass number and $r_0$ is the nuclear radius parameter.\n\n**Electric Transitions ($B_W(\\mathrm{E}L)$):**\nThe electric multipole operator of order $L$, $\\hat{O}(\\mathrm{E}L)$, is proportional to $e r^L Y_{LM}(\\Omega)$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The corresponding reduced matrix element is thus proportional to $e \\langle r^L \\rangle$. The radial dependence of the operator is $r^L$, so we evaluate the radial integral with $k=L$:\n$$\n\\langle r^L \\rangle = \\frac{3}{L+3}R^L\n$$\nThe reduced transition probability, $B(\\mathrm{E}L)$, is proportional to the square of this matrix element. Taking into account the angular factors, which are typically absorbed into a numerical prefactor, the standard Weisskopf estimate is given by:\n$$\nB_W(\\mathrm{E}L) = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+3} \\right)^2 R^{2L}\n$$\nThe problem requires expressing this in units of $e^2 \\mathrm{fm}^{2L}$. Substituting $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$ and ensuring $r_0$ is in units of $\\mathrm{fm}$:\n$$\nB_W(\\mathrm{E}L) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+3} \\right)^2 r_0^{2L} A^{2L/3} \\right] e^2 \\mathrm{fm}^{2L}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates the scaling law for electric transitions: $B_W(\\mathrm{E}L) \\propto r_0^{2L} A^{2L/3}$.\n\n**Magnetic Transitions ($B_W(\\mathrm{M}L)$):**\nThe magnetic multipole operator of order $L$, $\\hat{O}(\\mathrm{M}L)$, involves nucleon magnetic moments and orbital motion. As specified, its radial dependence scales as $r^{L-1}$. The matrix element is therefore proportional to $\\mu_N \\langle r^{L-1} \\rangle$, where $\\mu_N$ is the nuclear magneton. We evaluate the radial integral with $k=L-1$:\n$$\n\\langle r^{L-1} \\rangle = \\frac{3}{(L-1)+3}R^{L-1} = \\frac{3}{L+2}R^{L-1}\n$$\nThe full Weisskopf estimate for magnetic transitions includes factors from the spin-dependent part of the operator, which are not directly derivable from the problem's minimal premises. However, within the \"standard single-nucleon Weisskopf framework,\" these factors are conventionally approximated by a numerical constant, typically $10$. The complete estimate is thus:\n$$\nB_W(\\mathrm{M}L) = \\frac{10}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+2} \\right)^2 R^{2L-2} \\mu_N^2\n$$\nExpressing this in the required units of $\\mu_N^2 \\mathrm{fm}^{2L-2}$ and substituting $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$:\n$$\nB_W(\\mathrm{M}L) = \\left[ \\frac{10}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+2} \\right)^2 r_0^{2L-2} A^{(2L-2)/3} \\right] \\mu_N^2 \\mathrm{fm}^{2L-2}\n$$\nThis gives the scaling law for magnetic transitions: $B_W(\\mathrm{M}L) \\propto r_0^{2L-2} A^{(2L-2)/3}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Sensitivity Metric**\n\nThe dimensionless sensitivity metric $S(\\pi,L;A)$ is defined as:\n$$\nS(\\pi,L;A) \\equiv \\max_{r_0 \\in \\{r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}\\}} \\frac{B_W(\\pi L; r_0)}{B_W(\\pi L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})} \\;-\\; \\min_{r_0 \\in \\{r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}\\}} \\frac{B_W(\\pi L; r_0)}{B_W(\\pi L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})}\n$$\nWe analyze the ratio $\\frac{B_W(\\pi L; r_0)}{B_W(\\pi L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})}$ for both transition types.\n\nFor an electric transition E$L$:\n$$\n\\frac{B_W(\\mathrm{E}L; r_0)}{B_W(\\mathrm{E}L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+3} \\right)^2 r_0^{2L} A^{2L/3}}{\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+3} \\right)^2 r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}^{2L} A^{2L/3}} = \\frac{r_0^{2L}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}^{2L}} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{2L}\n$$\nFor a magnetic transition M$L$:\n$$\n\\frac{B_W(\\mathrm{M}L; r_0)}{B_W(\\mathrm{M}L; r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+2} \\right)^2 r_0^{2L-2} A^{(2L-2)/3}}{\\frac{10}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{L+2} \\right)^2 r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}^{2L-2} A^{(2L-2)/3}} = \\frac{r_0^{2L-2}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}^{2L-2}} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{2L-2}\n$$\nIn both cases, all constants and the dependence on mass number $A$ cancel, as anticipated. We can unify these results by defining an exponent $p(\\pi, L)$:\n$$\np(\\pi, L) = \\begin{cases} 2L & \\text{if } \\pi = \\mathrm{E} \\\\ 2L-2 & \\text{if } \\pi = \\mathrm{M} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe ratio becomes $\\left(r_0 / r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)^{p(\\pi,L)}$. Since $L \\ge 1$, the exponent $p(\\pi, L) \\ge 0$. For $p > 0$, the function $f(r_0) = (r_0/r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}})^p$ is monotonically increasing with $r_0$. For the special case $p=0$ (which occurs for M$1$ transitions), the ratio is always $1$.\n\nGiven $r_0 \\in [r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}]$, with $r_{0,\\min} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, $r_{0,\\max} = 1.3\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, and $r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, the maximum and minimum of the ratio are achieved at the boundaries of the interval $\\{r_{0,\\min}, r_{0,\\max}\\}$.\n$$\n\\max \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^p = \\left(\\frac{r_{0,\\max}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^p \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\min \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^p = \\left(\\frac{r_{0,\\min}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^p\n$$\nTherefore, the sensitivity metric simplifies to a function of only $\\pi$, $L$, and the given radius parameters, independent of $A$:\n$$\nS(\\pi,L) = \\left(\\frac{r_{0,\\max}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{p(\\pi, L)} - \\left(\\frac{r_{0,\\min}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{p(\\pi, L)}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Computational Implementation**\n\nThe task now is to calculate $S(\\pi,L)$ for the specified test suite using the derived formula. We set $r_{0,\\min} = 1.1$, $r_{0,\\max} = 1.3$, and $r_{0,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.2$. The calculation for each case is as follows:\n\n*   **Case 1**: $A=60, \\pi=\\mathrm{E}, L=2$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{E},2) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^4 - (1.1/1.2)^4 \\approx 0.672821$.\n*   **Case 2**: $A=208, \\pi=\\mathrm{E}, L=3$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{E},3) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^6 - (1.1/1.2)^6 \\approx 0.974248$.\n*   **Case 3**: $A=16, \\pi=\\mathrm{E}, L=1$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{E},1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^2 - (1.1/1.2)^2 = 1/3 \\approx 0.333333$.\n*   **Case 4**: $A=100, \\pi=\\mathrm{M}, L=1$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{M},1) = 2 \\times 1 - 2 = 0$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^0 - (1.1/1.2)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n*   **Case 5**: $A=150, \\pi=\\mathrm{M}, L=2$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{M},2) = 2 \\times 2 - 2 = 2$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^2 - (1.1/1.2)^2 = 1/3 \\approx 0.333333$.\n*   **Case 6**: $A=90, \\pi=\\mathrm{E}, L=4$. The exponent is $p(\\mathrm{E},4) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    $S = (1.3/1.2)^8 - (1.1/1.2)^8 \\approx 1.304284$.\n\nThe implementation will encode this logic to generate the final list of results.",
