A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution involves three parts as requested: deriving the rotational frequency $\\omega(I)$, constructing the Routhian $R(\\omega)$ to first order in $\\alpha$, and discussing the stability of the rotation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Rotational Frequency $\\omega(I)$**\n\nThe rotational frequency $\\omega$ is defined as the first derivative of the energy $E(I)$ with respect to the angular momentum $I$.\nGiven the energy expression:\n$$E(I)=\\frac{I(I+1)}{2\\mathcal{J}}+\\alpha\\,I^{4} = \\frac{I^2+I}{2\\mathcal{J}}+\\alpha\\,I^{4}$$\nWe differentiate $E(I)$ with respect to $I$, treating $I$ as a continuous variable:\n$$\\omega(I) = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I} \\left( \\frac{I^2+I}{2\\mathcal{J}}+\\alpha\\,I^{4} \\right)$$\nPerforming the differentiation, we obtain:\n$$\\omega(I) = \\frac{2I+1}{2\\mathcal{J}} + 4\\alpha I^3$$\nThis expression gives the rotational frequency as a function of the spin $I$. The first term corresponds to a rigid rotor, while the second is a correction due to the stiffness parameter $\\alpha$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Routhian $R(\\omega)$**\n\nThe Routhian $R(\\omega)$ is the Legendre transform of $E(I)$, defined as $R(\\omega) = E(I) - \\omega I$, evaluated at the value of $I$ that minimizes this expression for a given $\\omega$. This minimization condition is precisely $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}(E(I) - \\omega I) = 0$, which yields $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial I} = \\omega$.\n\nThis means we must first invert the relation $\\omega(I)$ to find $I$ as a function of $\\omega$, denoted $I(\\omega)$. The equation to solve is:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{2I+1}{2\\mathcal{J}} + 4\\alpha I^3$$\nThis is a cubic equation for $I$ and is difficult to solve exactly. However, since $\\alpha$ is a small parameter, we can find $I(\\omega)$ perturbatively.\n\nLet $E(I) = E_0(I) + \\alpha E_1(I)$, where $E_0(I) = \\frac{I(I+1)}{2\\mathcal{J}}$ and $E_1(I) = I^4$.\nThe Routhian can be written as $R(\\omega, \\alpha)$. We seek an expression for $R$ that is accurate to first order in $\\alpha$. We can use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem (or the envelope theorem), which states that the derivative of the transformed function with respect to a parameter is the partial derivative of the original function with respect to that parameter, evaluated at the stationary point.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} (E(I) - \\omega I) \\bigg|_{I=I(\\omega)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{I(I+1)}{2\\mathcal{J}} + \\alpha I^4 - \\omega I \\right) \\bigg|_{I=I(\\omega)} = I(\\omega)^4 $$\nTo find $R(\\omega)$ up to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha)$, we can integrate this expression with respect to $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $\\alpha$:\n$$ R(\\omega, \\alpha) \\approx R(\\omega, 0) + \\int_0^\\alpha \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\alpha'} \\bigg|_{\\alpha'=0} d\\alpha' = R_0(\\omega) + \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\alpha} \\bigg|_{\\alpha=0} \\right) $$\nFrom the derivative above, $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\alpha} \\big|_{\\alpha=0} = I(\\omega, \\alpha=0)^4$. Let's denote $I_0(\\omega) = I(\\omega, \\alpha=0)$.\nSo, the Routhian to first order in $\\alpha$ is:\n$$R(\\omega) \\approx R_0(\\omega) + \\alpha I_0(\\omega)^4$$\nwhere $R_0(\\omega)$ is the Routhian for the unperturbed system ($\\alpha=0$), and $I_0(\\omega)$ is the spin for the unperturbed system.\n\nFirst, we find $I_0(\\omega)$ by setting $\\alpha=0$ in the equation for $\\omega(I)$:\n$$\\omega = \\omega_0(I_0) = \\frac{2I_0+1}{2\\mathcal{J}}$$\nSolving for $I_0$:\n$$2\\mathcal{J}\\omega = 2I_0 + 1 \\implies I_0(\\omega) = \\mathcal{J}\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nNext, we find the unperturbed Routhian, $R_0(\\omega)$:\n$$R_0(\\omega) = E_0(I_0) - \\omega I_0 = \\frac{I_0(I_0+1)}{2\\mathcal{J}} - \\omega I_0$$\nSubstitute $I_0(\\omega) = \\mathcal{J}\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$I_0(I_0+1) = \\left(\\mathcal{J}\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\mathcal{J}\\omega + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = (\\mathcal{J}\\omega)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\mathcal{J}^2\\omega^2 - \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSo,\n$$R_0(\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathcal{J}^2\\omega^2 - \\frac{1}{4}}{2\\mathcal{J}} - \\omega\\left(\\mathcal{J}\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathcal{J}\\omega^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8\\mathcal{J}} - \\mathcal{J}\\omega^2 + \\frac{\\omega}{2}$$\n$$R_0(\\omega) = -\\frac{\\mathcal{J}\\omega^2}{2} + \\frac{\\omega}{2} - \\frac{1}{8\\mathcal{J}}$$\nFinally, we assemble the full Routhian to first order in $\\alpha$:\n$$R(\\omega) \\approx R_0(\\omega) + \\alpha I_0(\\omega)^4 = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathcal{J}\\omega^2}{2} + \\frac{\\omega}{2} - \\frac{1}{8\\mathcal{J}}\\right) + \\alpha \\left(\\mathcal{J}\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4$$\nThis is the required expression for the Routhian to leading order in $\\alpha$.\n\n**3. Discussion of the Stability Criterion**\n\nThe stability criterion for the rotational motion is given as $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\omega} > 0$. This means that for the rotation to be stable, the angular momentum $I$ must be a monotonically increasing function of the rotational frequency $\\omega$.\nUsing the inverse function theorem, $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}\\right)^{-1}$. The condition $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\omega} > 0$ is therefore equivalent to $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I} > 0$ (assuming $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}$ is not zero or infinite).\n\nWe calculate $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}$ from our derived expression for $\\omega(I)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}\\left(\\frac{2I+1}{2\\mathcal{J}} + 4\\alpha I^3\\right) = \\frac{2}{2\\mathcal{J}} + 12\\alpha I^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{J}} + 12\\alpha I^2$$\nThe stability condition is thus:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{J}} + 12\\alpha I^2 > 0$$\nSince $\\mathcal{J}>0$ is given, $1/\\mathcal{J}$ is positive. We analyze the stability based on the sign of $\\alpha$:\n- If $\\alpha \\geq 0$: The term $12\\alpha I^2$ is non-negative. The sum $\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{J}} + 12\\alpha I^2$ is always strictly positive. Therefore, for $\\alpha \\geq 0$, the rotation is stable for all values of spin $I$.\n- If $\\alpha < 0$: Let $\\alpha = -|\\alpha|$. The stability condition becomes $\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{J}} - 12|\\alpha|I^2 > 0$. This inequality holds only when $12|\\alpha|I^2 < \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{J}}$, which means $I^2 < \\frac{1}{12|\\alpha|\\mathcal{J}}$. The rotation is stable only for spins below a critical value $I_{crit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{12|\\alpha|\\mathcal{J}}}$. Above this spin, the system becomes unstable ($\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\omega} < 0$), a phenomenon known as backbending.\n\nThis stability criterion is directly related to the convexity of the energy function $E(I)$. A function is strictly convex if its second derivative is positive. Let's examine the second derivative of $E(I)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial I^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}\\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial I}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}$$\nThus, the stability condition $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I} > 0$ is identical to the mathematical condition for strict convexity of the energy, $\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial I^2} > 0$. An unstable rotational region corresponds to a non-convex (concave) region of the $E(I)$ curve.",

The single-particle part of the Routhian is diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues (single-particle Routhians) $e'_m = -\\omega m$.\n\nThe constant pairing interaction $H_{\\text{pair}} = -G \\sum_{k,k'>0} c_{k}^\\dagger c_{\\bar{k}}^\\dagger c_{\\bar{k}'} c_{k'}$ acts between time-reversed states, which in this basis correspond to pairs $(m, -m)$. The problem is solved using the BCS approximation, which is updated iteratively based on a seniority-blocking mechanism.\n\n### 2. Iterative BCS Solution and Blocking\n\nThe procedure involves iteratively solving the BCS equations for a successively smaller set of active (unblocked) pairs. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the set of unblocked pairs, represented by their positive magnetic quantum numbers $m_k$, and let $|\\mathcal{P}|$ be the number of such pairs. Let $N_{\\text{rem}}$ be the number of particles distributed among these pairs.\n\nAt each step, we solve the standard zero-temperature BCS equations for a set of $|\\mathcal{P}|$ doubly degenerate levels with energy $\\epsilon=0$ and a particle number $N_{\\text{rem}}$.\nThe number equation is:\n$$N_{\\text{rem}} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}} 2 v_k^2 = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\left(1 - \\frac{-\\lambda}{\\sqrt{(-\\lambda)^2 + \\Delta^2}}\\right) = |\\mathcal{P}| \\left(1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + \\Delta^2}}\\right)$$\nThe gap equation is:\n$$1 = \\frac{G}{2} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(-\\lambda)^2 + \\Delta^2}} = \\frac{G |\\mathcal{P}|}{2\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + \\Delta^2}}$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the chemical potential and $\\Delta$ is the pairing gap.\n\nSolving this system of equations for $\\lambda$ and $\\Delta$ yields:\nFrom the gap equation, the non-rotating quasiparticle energy $E_0 = \\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + \\Delta^2}$ is found to be constant for all pairs in the condensate:\n$$E_0 = \\frac{G|\\mathcal{P}|}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the number equation gives the chemical potential:\n$$N_{\\text{rem}} = |\\mathcal{P}| \\left(1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{E_0}\\right) \\implies \\lambda = E_0 \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{rem}}}{|\\mathcal{P}|} - 1\\right) = \\frac{G}{2}(N_{\\text{rem}} - |\\mathcal{P}|)$$\nThe pairing gap $\\Delta$ can then be calculated from $\\Delta^2 = E_0^2 - \\lambda^2$:\n$$\\Delta^2 = \\left(\\frac{G|\\mathcal{P}|}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{G}{2}(N_{\\text{rem}} - |\\mathcal{P}|)\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{G}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(|\\mathcal{P}|^2 - (N_{\\text{rem}}-|\\mathcal{P}|)^2\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{G}{2} \\sqrt{(|\\mathcal{P}| - (N_{\\text{rem}}-|\\mathcal{P}|)) (|\\mathcal{P}| + (N_{\\text{rem}}-|\\mathcal{P}|))} = \\frac{G}{2} \\sqrt{(2|\\mathcal{P}| - N_{\\text{rem}}) N_{\\text{rem}}}$$\nA non-trivial pairing solution ($\\Delta > 0$) exists only if the term under the square root is positive, which requires $0 < N_{\\text{rem}} < 2|\\mathcal{P}|$. If this condition is not met, pairing collapses ($\\Delta=0$).\n\n### 3. Rotational Effects and Pair Blocking\n\nIn the rotating frame, the quasiparticle Routhians for a pair $k$ are split by the cranking term:\n$$E'_{k, \\text{aligned}} = E_0 - \\omega m_k$$\n$$E'_{k, \\text{anti-aligned}} = E_0 + \\omega m_k$$\nAccording to the problem, a pair is blocked when its lowest quasiparticle Routhian first reaches zero. For $\\omega > 0$, this occurs for the aligned state ($E'_{k, \\text{aligned}}$). The system is stable as long as all $E'_{k, \\text{aligned}} > 0$. The first pair to become unstable as $\\omega$ increases is the one with the smallest critical frequency $\\omega_c(k) = E_0 / m_k$. This corresponds to the unblocked pair with the largest magnetic quantum number, $m_{\\text{max}} = \\max\\{m_k | k \\in \\mathcal{P}\\}$.\nThe next blocking event thus occurs at:\n$$\\omega_{\\text{next}} = \\frac{E_0}{m_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{G|\\mathcal{P}|}{2m_{\\text{max}}}$$\nWhen this frequency is reached, the pair with $m_{\\text{max}}$ is blocked. For the next step of the calculation, this pair is removed from the set $\\mathcal{P}$, and the particle number for the remaining condensate is reduced by two, i.e., $N_{\\text{rem}} \\to N_{\\text{rem}} - 2$.\n\n### 4. Algorithm for Finding Collapse Frequency\n\nThe pairing collapse frequency $\\omega_{\\text{coll}}$ is found by the following iterative algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Start with the full set of pairs $\\mathcal{P}_0$, corresponding to $m_k \\in \\{j, j-1, \\dots, \\tfrac{1}{2}\\}$.\n    - Set the initial remaining particle number $N_{\\text{rem}} = N$.\n    - Initialize the collapse frequency candidate $\\omega_{\\text{coll}} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Iteration**:\n    - Loop as long as the conditions for a non-trivial pairing solution ($0 < N_{\\text{rem}} < 2|\\mathcal{P}|$) are met. In each iteration:\n        a. Calculate the non-rotating quasiparticle energy $E_0 = \\frac{G|\\mathcal{P}|}{2}$.\n        b. Identify the largest magnetic quantum number $m_{\\text{max}}$ in the current set of unblocked pairs $\\mathcal{P}$.\n        c. Calculate the frequency for the next blocking event: $\\omega_{\\text{next}} = E_0 / m_{\\text{max}}$. This value is stored as the current candidate for $\\omega_{\\text{coll}}$.\n        d. Update the system for the next state: remove $m_{\\text{max}}$ from $\\mathcal{P}$ (so $|\\mathcal{P}| \\to |\\mathcal{P}|-1$) and decrease the particle number by two ($N_{\\text{rem}} \\to N_{\\text{rem}}-2$).\n\n3.  **Termination**:\n    - The loop terminates when the condition for non-trivial pairing is violated (i.e., when $N_{\\text{rem}} \\leq 0$ or $N_{\\text{rem}} \\geq 2|\\mathcal{P}|$).\n    - The collapse frequency $\\omega_{\\text{coll}}$ is the last calculated value of $\\omega_{\\text{next}}$, which is the frequency at which the system transitions into the collapsed state.",
