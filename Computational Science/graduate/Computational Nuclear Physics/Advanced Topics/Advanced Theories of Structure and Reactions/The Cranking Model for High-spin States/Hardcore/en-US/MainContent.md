## Introduction
Understanding the behavior of atomic nuclei under the extreme stress of rapid rotation is a central challenge in [nuclear structure physics](@entry_id:752746). A full quantum mechanical description in the [laboratory frame](@entry_id:166991) is often computationally prohibitive, creating a gap between theory and the rich experimental data available for [high-spin states](@entry_id:750320). The [cranking model](@entry_id:157772), a powerful semi-classical approach, bridges this gap by transforming the problem into a reference frame that co-rotates with the nucleus. This maneuver provides a computationally tractable yet physically insightful method for exploring the interplay between collective rotation and microscopic single-particle excitations.

We will begin by examining the fundamental principles and mechanisms that form the bedrock of the [cranking model](@entry_id:157772).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The description of atomic nuclei under extreme rotational stress requires a theoretical framework capable of handling the interplay between collective motion and microscopic single-particle degrees of freedom. The **[cranking model](@entry_id:157772)**, originally proposed by David Inglis, provides such a framework by treating [nuclear rotation](@entry_id:159181) semiclassically. Instead of solving the full quantum mechanical problem in the [laboratory frame](@entry_id:166991), which is computationally prohibitive, the model transforms the problem into a reference frame that co-rotates with the nucleus. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the [cranking model](@entry_id:157772), from its formal basis to its application in explaining key high-spin phenomena.

### The Routhian Formalism and Variational Principle

The cornerstone of the [cranking model](@entry_id:157772) is the transformation from the laboratory (inertial) frame to a uniformly rotating intrinsic frame. In classical mechanics, this is achieved by introducing the Routhian, which serves as the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame. The quantum mechanical analogue is the **Routhian operator**, $\hat{H}'$, derived from the laboratory-frame Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ via a Legendre-like transformation:

$$ \hat{H}' = \hat{H} - \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{J}} $$

Here, $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is the rotational frequency, a classical vector parameter, and $\hat{\mathbf{J}}$ is the [total angular momentum operator](@entry_id:149439). For the common case of **principal-axis cranking**, where the nucleus is assumed to rotate about a principal axis (conventionally the $x$-axis), the vector relation simplifies to a scalar one: $\hat{H}' = \hat{H} - \omega \hat{J}_x$. The parameter $\omega$ acts as a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the expectation value of the angular momentum along the rotation axis.

The goal of a cranking calculation is to find the [stationary state](@entry_id:264752) of the system for a given rotational frequency $\omega$. This is achieved by applying the variational principle to the Routhian operator. The [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) of $\hat{H}'$ is the **Routhian energy**, $R(\omega)$:

$$ R(\omega) = \langle \Psi(\omega) | \hat{H}' | \Psi(\omega) \rangle = \langle \Psi(\omega) | \hat{H} | \Psi(\omega) \rangle - \omega \langle \Psi(\omega) | \hat{J}_x | \Psi(\omega) \rangle $$

In modern calculations, particularly within the [macroscopic-microscopic method](@entry_id:159296), the [nuclear shape](@entry_id:159866) is described by deformation parameters (e.g., quadrupole variables $\beta$ and $\gamma$) and [pairing correlations](@entry_id:158315) by a [pairing gap](@entry_id:160388) $\Delta$. The intrinsic energy $\langle \hat{H} \rangle$ is decomposed into a macroscopic component $E_{\text{mac}}(\beta, \gamma)$ (from the [liquid drop model](@entry_id:141747)) and a microscopic shell and pairing correction term $E_{\text{shell}}(\beta, \gamma, \Delta)$. Minimizing the Routhian with respect to the [shape parameters](@entry_id:270600) at a fixed frequency yields the equilibrium configuration of the rotating nucleus. This minimized energy landscape is known as the **Total Routhian Surface (TRS)** .

The [stationarity condition](@entry_id:191085) derived from this [variational principle](@entry_id:145218) has a profound connection to time-dependent mean-field theory. A uniformly rotating solution is, by definition, one that is stationary in the rotating frame. In the context of Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, the evolution of the [one-body density matrix](@entry_id:161726) $\rho$ is governed by the Liouville-von Neumann equation. Transforming this equation into the [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637) reveals that the condition for a stationary density, $\dot{\rho}_{\text{rot}} = 0$, is equivalent to the [commutation relation](@entry_id:150292) $[\hat{h}', \rho] = 0$, where $\hat{h}' = \hat{h}[\rho] - \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ is the self-consistent single-particle Routhian. This commutation condition signifies that the nuclear mean field has self-consistently adapted to the rotational stress, resulting in a state where the occupied single-particle orbitals are eigenstates of the cranked Hamiltonian. This is precisely the condition fulfilled by solving the cranked Hartree-Fock or HFB equations .

The [cranking model](@entry_id:157772), while powerful, is an approximation. Its formal justification comes from its relationship with the more fundamental but computationally intensive method of **angular-momentum projection**. The **Kamlah expansion** provides a rigorous link, showing that for a strongly [deformed nucleus](@entry_id:160887) (where the intrinsic state is not an [eigenstate](@entry_id:202009) of $\hat{J}^2$), minimizing the projected energy for a state of high spin $J$ is asymptotically equivalent to solving the cranking equations at a frequency $\omega$ chosen such that the expectation value of angular momentum $\langle \hat{J}_x \rangle$ matches $J$. Cranking is thus the leading-order approximation to angular-momentum projection in the high-spin limit for well-deformed systems .

### Symmetries and Quasiparticle States in the Rotating Frame

The introduction of the cranking term $-\omega \hat{J}_x$ modifies the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. For a nucleus with an axially symmetric [mean field](@entry_id:751816) (about the $z$-axis), the static Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ commutes with $\hat{J}_z$. However, the cranking term breaks this [axial symmetry](@entry_id:173333), as $[\hat{J}_z, -\omega \hat{J}_x] \neq 0$. Consequently, the projection of angular momentum on the symmetry axis, $K$, is no longer a [good quantum number](@entry_id:263156).

A crucial [discrete symmetry](@entry_id:146994), however, is often preserved. If the [nuclear shape](@entry_id:159866) is invariant under a rotation by $\pi$ about the cranking axis (the $x$-axis), the full cranked Hamiltonian $\hat{H}'$ commutes with the [rotation operator](@entry_id:136702) $\hat{R}_x(\pi) = \exp(-i\pi \hat{J}_x)$. The eigenvalues of this operator, known as the **signature**, are conserved. Since a rotation by $2\pi$ acts as $(-1)^A$ on a system of $A$ fermions, we have $\hat{R}_x(\pi)^2 = (-1)^A$.
- For an **even-A** system (e.g., the vacuum or a two-quasiparticle state), the eigenvalues of $\hat{R}_x(\pi)$ are $r = \pm 1$.
- For an **odd-A** system (e.g., a single-quasiparticle state), the eigenvalues are $r = \pm i$.

The signature is often denoted by a quantum number $\alpha$, defined via $r = \exp(-i\pi\alpha)$. For even-A systems, this gives $\alpha = 0, 1$, corresponding to [rotational bands](@entry_id:754426) with only even spins ($I=0, 2, 4, ...$) or only odd spins ($I=1, 3, 5, ...$). For odd-A systems, $\alpha = \pm 1/2$, corresponding to bands with half-integer spins ($I = 1/2, 5/2, 9/2, ...$ or $I = 3/2, 7/2, 11/2, ...$). The conservation of signature block-diagonalizes the cranked Hamiltonian matrix into independent sectors, greatly simplifying numerical calculations .

Within this framework, the single-particle or quasiparticle states evolve as a function of $\omega$. Their energies in the [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637), the quasiparticle Routhians, change due to the influence of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces contained within the cranking term. As $\omega$ increases, the Routhians of different quasiparticle states can approach each other. If these states have the same signature, a [residual interaction](@entry_id:159129) between them will cause their energy levels to repel, leading to an **[avoided crossing](@entry_id:144398)**. At such a crossing, the adiabatic [eigenstates](@entry_id:149904) (the exact eigenstates at each $\omega$) rapidly exchange their physical character. To follow the smooth evolution of a specific physical configuration (e.g., a high-$j$ intruder orbital), one must employ a **diabatic tracing** scheme. This is computationally achieved by stepping through frequency in small increments $\delta\omega$ and, at each step, identifying the state at $\omega+\delta\omega$ that has the maximum [wavefunction overlap](@entry_id:157485) with the state at $\omega$. This ensures that the traced configuration maintains a continuous physical character, which is essential for a coherent interpretation of [rotational bands](@entry_id:754426) .

### Observables and Rotational Response

The [cranking model](@entry_id:157772) provides a direct link between theoretical calculations and experimental observables. The key quantities are the angular momentum and the moments of inertia.

The angular momentum $I(\omega)$ of the nucleus at a given frequency is identified with the [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) $\langle \hat{J}_x \rangle$ in the self-consistent cranked state. Conversely, the rotational frequency corresponding to a state of spin $I$ is given by the derivative of the laboratory-frame energy $E$ with respect to spin: $\hbar\omega(I) = \partial E / \partial I$. Experimentally, [rotational bands](@entry_id:754426) are observed as sequences of $\gamma$-ray transitions. For a $\Delta I = 2$ band, the transition energy is $E_\gamma(I \to I-2) = E(I) - E(I-2)$. From this, the rotational frequency at spin $I$ can be accurately estimated using a central finite difference:

$$ \hbar\omega(I) \approx \frac{E(I+2) - E(I-2)}{4} = \frac{E_\gamma(I+2 \to I) + E_\gamma(I \to I-2)}{4} $$

This formula allows for a direct mapping from experimental energies to the theoretical frequency domain. Once this is established, we can define the **[quasiparticle alignment](@entry_id:753968)**, $i(\omega)$, as the angular momentum contributed by the valence nucleons relative to a smoothly rotating core. It is calculated by subtracting a reference rotation from the [total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748):

$$ i(\omega) = I(\omega) - \mathcal{J}_{\text{ref}}\omega $$

where $\mathcal{J}_{\text{ref}}$ is the moment of inertia of a reference configuration, often parameterized with a smooth function of $\omega$. This quantity is crucial for isolating the microscopic effects of pair-breaking and alignment from the collective rotation of the core .

To characterize the rotational response in more detail, two distinct [moments of inertia](@entry_id:174259) are defined:
1.  The **kinematic moment of inertia**, $\mathcal{J}^{(1)}(\omega) = I(\omega)/\omega$. This is a global measure, representing the average angular momentum per unit of rotational frequency.
2.  The **dynamic moment of inertia**, $\mathcal{J}^{(2)}(\omega) = dI/d\omega$. This is a local, differential measure that quantifies the rotational susceptibility of the nucleus—its ability to gain angular momentum in response to an infinitesimal increase in rotational frequency.

For a classical rigid rotor, $\mathcal{J}^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{J}^{(2)}$ are identical and constant. In a real nucleus, their differing behaviors reveal profound details about the underlying microscopic structure. The dynamic moment of inertia, being a derivative, is particularly sensitive to rapid, localized changes in [nuclear structure](@entry_id:161466), such as those occurring during a [band crossing](@entry_id:161733) .

### Mechanism of Backbending and Band Crossing

One of the most dramatic phenomena in high-spin nuclear physics is **[backbending](@entry_id:161120)**, where the moment of inertia increases so rapidly with spin that the rotational frequency can temporarily decrease. The [cranking model](@entry_id:157772) provides an elegant explanation for this phenomenon through the mechanism of **[band crossing](@entry_id:161733)**.

In an even-even nucleus at low spin, nucleons are coupled into spin-zero pairs by the [pairing interaction](@entry_id:158014). This paired state forms the **ground-state band (gsb)**. As the rotational frequency $\omega$ increases, the Coriolis force ($-\omega \hat{j}_x$) acts on individual nucleons. This force is particularly strong on nucleons in high-$j$ intruder orbitals (e.g., $i_{13/2}$ neutrons in the rare-earth region), as they can carry a large amount of angular momentum.

It can become energetically favorable for the nucleus to break a pair of these high-$j$ nucleons and align their individual angular momenta with the rotation axis. This creates an excited **two-quasiparticle (2qp) band**. In the [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637), the Routhian of this aligned band decreases rapidly with frequency. Its Routhian relative to the gsb is approximately $R_{\text{rel}}(\omega) \approx 2\Delta - \omega \Delta i_x$, where $2\Delta$ is the energy cost to break the pair and $\Delta i_x$ is the large amount of angular momentum gained by the alignment.

A crossing between the gsb and the 2qp band occurs when $R_{\text{rel}} \approx 0$, which happens at a crossing frequency $\omega_c \approx 2\Delta/\Delta i_x$. Due to a [residual interaction](@entry_id:159129) between the bands, the crossing is avoided. In this narrow frequency region, the yrast (lowest-energy) configuration rapidly transitions from the gsb character to the aligned 2qp character. This sudden injection of aligned angular momentum $\Delta i_x$ over a small frequency interval $\Delta\omega$ causes a sharp spike in the dynamic moment of inertia, $\mathcal{J}^{(2)} = dI/d\omega \approx \Delta i_x / \Delta\omega$. This pronounced peak in $\mathcal{J}^{(2)}$ is the theoretical signature of [backbending](@entry_id:161120) .

### Advanced Microscopic Connections

The [cranking model](@entry_id:157772) can be integrated within fully self-consistent mean-field theories, such as those based on Skyrme or Gogny Energy Density Functionals (EDFs). This provides a deeper connection between the [rotational dynamics](@entry_id:267911) and the underlying nuclear interaction.

A key concept in this context is time-reversal symmetry. The static ground state of an even-even nucleus is time-reversal invariant. In this state, all local densities that are odd under [time reversal](@entry_id:159918)—such as the **[current density](@entry_id:190690)** $\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r})$ and the **spin density** $\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{r})$—have a vanishing [expectation value](@entry_id:150961). The cranking term $-\omega \hat{J}_x$, being proportional to the time-odd operator $\hat{J}_x$, explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. It acts as an external source that induces non-zero time-odd fields. The orbital part, $-\omega \hat{L}_x$, generates a nuclear current ($\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}) \neq 0$), while the spin part, $-\omega \hat{S}_x$, induces a net spin polarization ($\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{r}) \neq 0$). The response of the nucleus to these sources is governed by the time-odd terms in the EDF, which must be constrained by fundamental principles like Galilean invariance .

This self-consistent framework also allows for a more rigorous calculation of the rotational response itself. The moment of inertia can be understood as the static susceptibility of the system to the rotational perturbation. The Inglis-Belyaev formula provides a simple estimate by treating the quasiparticles as non-interacting. A more sophisticated approach is the **Thouless-Valatin (TV) correction**, which is calculated within the self-consistent Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA). This method includes the residual interactions between quasiparticles, which generate induced mean fields that screen the external perturbation. The TV approach correctly restores the [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077) at the level of linear response, ensuring that the spurious Nambu-Goldstone mode is properly decoupled. This self-consistent treatment generally increases the moment of inertia compared to the Inglis-Belyaev value, bringing it closer to the experimental value by accounting for the collective enhancement of the rotational response  .
