Each term is proportional to the negative of the radial derivative of a Fermi distribution, $-\\frac{d\\rho_{0q}(r)}{dr}$. A Fermi distribution is nearly constant in the nuclear interior and falls rapidly to zero around the half-density radius $R_q$. Its derivative is therefore negligible everywhere except in a narrow region around $r \\approx R_q$, which defines the nuclear surface. Since both terms in the sum are sharply peaked functions at their respective surface radii ($R_p$ and $R_n$), the total isovector transition density is localized near the nuclear surface.

The normalization constant $\\rho_0$ is found by requiring the volume integral of the density to be the proton number, $Z$.\n$$ Z = \\int \\rho_p(r) d^3r = 4\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_p(r) r^2 dr = 4\\pi \\int_0^R \\rho_0 r^2 dr = 4\\pi \\rho_0 \\frac{R^3}{3} $$\nThis gives $\\rho_0 = \\frac{3Z}{4\\pi R^3}$.\nNow we compute the moment $J_3$:\n$$ J_3^{\\text{sharp}} = \\int_0^\\infty r^3 \\rho_p(r) dr = \\int_0^R r^3 \\rho_0 dr = \\rho_0 \\frac{R^4}{4} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_0$:\n$$ J_3^{\\text{sharp}} = \\left( \\frac{3Z}{4\\pi R^3} \\right) \\frac{R^4}{4} = \\frac{3ZR}{16\\pi} $$\nFinally, we obtain the analytical expression for $B(E2)$ in the sharp-surface model:\n$$ B(E2)_{\\text{sharp}} = 80 \\Delta^2 (J_3^{\\text{sharp}})^2 = 80 \\Delta^2 \\left( \\frac{3ZR}{16\\pi} \\right)^2 = 80 \\Delta^2 \\frac{9Z^2 R^2}{256\\pi^2} $$\n$$ B(E2)_{\\text{sharp}} = \\frac{5 \\times 16 \\times 9}{16 \\times 16} \\frac{\\Delta^2 Z^2 R^2}{\\pi^2} = \\frac{45 \\Delta^2 Z^2 R^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\nUsing $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, we get:\n$$ B(E2)_{\\text{sharp}} = \\frac{45 \\Delta^2 Z^2 r_0^2 A^{2/3}}{16\\pi^2} $$\n\n**2. Finite-Diffuseness Model**\nThe proton density is given by the 2pF distribution: $\\rho_p(r) = \\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{r-c}{a}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$, with $ c = r_0 A^{1/3}$.\nThe normalization constant $\\rho_0$ must be determined numerically. Let's define the un-normalized moments $K_n$:\n$$ K_n = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{r^n}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{r-c}{a}\\right)} dr $$\nThe normalization condition is $Z = 4\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_p(r) r^2 dr = 4\\pi \\rho_0 K_2$, which gives:\n$$ \\rho_0 = \\frac{Z}{4\\pi K_2} $$\nThe third moment $J_3$ is:\n$$ J_3^{\\text{fd}} = \\int_0^\\infty r^3 \\rho_p(r) dr = \\rho_0 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{r^3}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{r-c}{a}\\right)} dr = \\rho_0 K_3 $$\nSubstituting for $\\rho_0$:\n$$ J_3^{\\text{fd}} = \\left( \\frac{Z}{4\\pi K_2} \\right) K_3 = \\frac{Z}{4\\pi} \\frac{K_3}{K_2} $$\nThe $B(E2)$ value is then:\n$$ B(E2)_{\\text{fd}} = 80 \\Delta^2 (J_3^{\\text{fd}})^2 = 80 \\Delta^2 \\left( \\frac{Z K_3}{4\\pi K_2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{80 Z^2 \\Delta^2}{16\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{K_3}{K_2} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ B(E2)_{\\text{fd}} = \\frac{5 Z^2 \\Delta^2}{\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{K_3}{K_2} \\right)^2 $$\nThe integrals $K_2$ and $K_3$ do not have simple analytical solutions and must be computed numerically. The implementation will use numerical quadrature to evaluate these integrals for each test case.\n\n**Summary of Computational Formulae**\nFor all calculations, we use $e=1$.\n- **Sharp-Surface**:\n  $$ B(E2)_{\\text{sharp}} = \\frac{45 \\Delta^2 Z^2 r_0^2 A^{2/3}}{16\\pi^2} $$\n  Units: With $\\Delta$ and $r_0$ in fm, the result is in $e^2 \\text{fm}^4$.\n- **Finite-Diffuseness**:\n  $$ B(E2)_{\\text{fd}} = \\frac{5 Z^2 \\Delta^2}{\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{K_3}{K_2} \\right)^2 $$\n  where $K_n = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{r^n}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{r - r_0 A^{1/3}}{a}\\right)} dr$.\n  The integrals $K_2$ and $K_3$ are evaluated numerically.\n\nThese formulae will now be implemented to solve for the given test suite.",
