            "problem": "A central goal in bottom-up proteomics is to maximize peptide recovery for comprehensive protein identification and quantification using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In native proteins, cysteinyl thiols can be oxidized to form disulfide bonds that constrain polypeptide structure and cross-link peptide segments. Reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT) restores thiols, and subsequent alkylation with iodoacetamide (IAA) stabilizes these thiols by forming carbamidomethyl adducts, preventing re-oxidation. From the standpoint of mass spectrometry, the chemistry of disulfide formation and breakage imposes predictable mass changes that translate into measurable shifts in mass-to-charge ratio, which can be used to validate sample preparation and aid database searching.\n\nConsider a tryptic peptide that contains $n_{\\text{Cys}} = 3$ cysteine residues, two of which are connected by a single intrapeptide disulfide bond ($n_{\\text{SS}} = 1$) in the native state. The peptide is measured by electrospray ionization at charge state $z = 4$. Under a sample preparation workflow consisting of reduction with DTT followed by alkylation with IAA, each cysteine thiol is carbamidomethylated. Assume the following widely accepted values: each carbamidomethylation adds $+57.0215$ daltons to the neutral peptide mass per cysteine, and breaking one disulfide bond adds two hydrogen atoms with monoisotopic mass $1.007825$ daltons per hydrogen atom to the neutral peptide mass. For a fixed charge state $z$, a change in the neutral peptide mass produces a proportional change in the observed $m/z$.\n\nUsing only these foundational facts about disulfide chemistry and mass spectrometric measurement, compute the expected change in the observed $m/z$ (reduced/alkylated minus native disulfide form) for this peptide at charge state $z = 4$. Round your final answer to four significant figures and express it in dalton per charge (Th).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the expected change in the observed mass-to-charge ratio ($\\Delta(m/z)$) when a tryptic peptide undergoes a standard proteomics sample preparation workflow. The peptide initially contains $n_{\\text{Cys}} = 3$ cysteine residues, with one intrapeptide disulfide bond ($n_{\\text{SS}}=1$). The workflow consists of reduction followed by alkylation. The final measurement is at a charge state of $z=4$.\n\nThe change in the mass-to-charge ratio, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is directly proportional to the change in the neutral mass of the peptide, $\\Delta M$, and inversely proportional to the charge state, $z$. This relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta M}{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta M = M_{\\text{final}} - M_{\\text{initial}}$. Here, $M_{\\text{initial}}$ is the mass of the native peptide with the disulfide bond, and $M_{\\text{final}}$ is the mass of the fully reduced and alkylated peptide.\n\nThe total change in neutral mass, $\\Delta M$, is the sum of the mass changes from two distinct chemical modifications:\n1.  The reduction of the disulfide bond.\n2.  The alkylation of all cysteine thiols.\n\nLet us calculate the mass change for each step.\n\nFirst, consider the reduction of the single disulfide bond ($n_{\\text{SS}}=1$). A disulfide bond ($-\\text{S}-\\text{S}-$) is broken by a reducing agent (like DTT), and two thiol groups ($-\\text{SH}$) are formed. This chemical transformation requires the addition of two hydrogen atoms to the peptide.\nThe mass change due to reduction, $\\Delta M_{\\text{red}}$, is therefore the mass of two hydrogen atoms. Using the provided monoisotopic mass of hydrogen, $m_{\\text{H}} = 1.007825$ daltons, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta M_{\\text{red}} = n_{\\text{SS}} \\times 2 \\times m_{\\text{H}} = 1 \\times 2 \\times 1.007825 \\text{ Da} = 2.01565 \\text{ Da}\n$$\n\nSecond, consider the alkylation with iodoacetamide (IAA). This reaction modifies all available thiol groups. In the native state, the peptide has $n_{\\text{Cys}} = 3$ cysteines. Since two are involved in the disulfide bond, there is one free thiol. After reduction, the two cysteines from the disulfide bond are converted to thiols, resulting in a total of $n_{\\text{Cys}} = 3$ free thiols. The problem states that the workflow alkylates each cysteine thiol, so all $3$ thiols are modified.\nThe alkylation of a thiol group ($-\\text{SH}$) with IAA replaces the hydrogen atom with a carbamidomethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CONH}_2$). The problem provides the net mass change for this reaction as $+57.0215$ daltons per cysteine residue.\nThe total mass change due to alkylation, $\\Delta M_{\\text{alk}}$, is the sum of the mass changes for all $n_{\\text{Cys}} = 3$ cysteines being alkylated:\n$$\n\\Delta M_{\\text{alk}} = n_{\\text{Cys}} \\times 57.0215 \\text{ Da} = 3 \\times 57.0215 \\text{ Da} = 171.0645 \\text{ Da}\n$$\n\nThe total change in the neutral mass of the peptide, $\\Delta M$, is the sum of the mass changes from reduction and alkylation:\n$$\n\\Delta M = \\Delta M_{\\text{red}} + \\Delta M_{\\text{alk}} = 2.01565 \\text{ Da} + 171.0645 \\text{ Da} = 173.08015 \\text{ Da}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the change in the observed $m/z$ ratio. The peptide is measured at a charge state of $z=4$.\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta M}{z} = \\frac{173.08015}{4} = 43.2700375 \\text{ Th}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $43.2700375$. The first four significant figures are $4$, $3$, $2$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) \\approx 43.27 \\text{ Th}\n$$\nThis represents the expected shift in the $m/z$ value of the peptide from its native, disulfide-bonded state to its fully reduced and alkylated state.",
