A powerful approach to connect these molecular details to regulatory function is through equilibrium statistical mechanics. This practice delves into a classic prokaryotic example, the lactose repressor system, to derive the promoter's response curve from first principles. By accounting for multiple operator sites and the possibility of DNA looping, you will build a partition function for the system and use it to quantify the system's sensitivity, represented by the apparent Hill coefficient $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ .

Assume the following standard equilibrium statistical thermodynamics model for DNA binding:\n\n- The active LacI tetramer has free concentration $R$.\n- Binding of a single tetramer to $O_{i}$ has association constant $K_{i}$, so the statistical weight of the microstate with $O_{i}$ occupied by one tetramer is $K_{i}R$.\n- Simultaneous occupation of both $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ by two independent tetramers has statistical weight $K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}$.\n- A looped microstate in which a single tetramer bridges $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ has statistical weight $K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}$, where $c_{\\ell}$ is the effective intramolecular coupling factor (with units of molar concentration) that encapsulates the DNA looping configurational free energy.\n\nAssume that transcription is completely blocked whenever any operator is occupied (including the looped state), so the promoter is transcriptionally active only when both $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are unoccupied.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Hill Coefficient**\n\nThe state of the promoter can be described by the occupancy of the two operators, $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$. According to the provided information, the system has the following microstates and statistical weights:\n1.  Both operators unoccupied (unrepressed/active state): weight = $1$.\n2.  $O_{1}$ occupied, $O_{2}$ unoccupied (repressed state): weight = $K_{1}R$.\n3.  $O_{2}$ occupied, $O_{1}$ unoccupied (repressed state): weight = $K_{2}R$.\n4.  Both operators occupied by two independent tetramers (repressed state): weight = $K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}$.\n5.  Both operators bridged by a single tetramer in a DNA loop (repressed state): weight = $K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates:\n$$\nZ = 1 + K_{1}R + K_{2}R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}\n$$\nThe promoter is repressed if it is in any state other than the completely unoccupied state. The sum of the statistical weights of the repressed states, $Z_{\\mathrm{rep}}$, is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{rep}} = K_{1}R + K_{2}R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}\n$$\nThe probability of the promoter being in a repressed state, $\\theta(R)$, is the ratio of the sum of weights of repressed states to the total partition function:\n$$\n\\theta(R) = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{rep}}}{Z} = \\frac{K_{1}R + K_{2}R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}}{1 + K_{1}R + K_{2}R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}}\n$$\nThe probability of the promoter being in the active (unrepressed) state is $1 - \\theta(R) = \\frac{1}{Z}$.\nThe quantity $\\frac{\\theta(R)}{1-\\theta(R)}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta(R)}{1-\\theta(R)} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{rep}}/Z}{1/Z} = Z_{\\mathrm{rep}} = K_{1}R + K_{2}R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}\n$$\nLet's define $Y(R) \\equiv \\frac{\\theta(R)}{1-\\theta(R)}$. We can group terms by powers of $R$:\n$$\nY(R) = (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}\n$$\nThe apparent Hill coefficient is defined as $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{d\\,\\ln(Y(R))}{d\\,\\ln R}$. Using the chain rule, this can be written as:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{d\\ln Y}{dR} \\cdot \\frac{dR}{d\\ln R} = \\left(\\frac{1}{Y}\\frac{dY}{dR}\\right) \\cdot R = \\frac{R}{Y}\\frac{dY}{dR}\n$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of $Y(R)$ with respect to $R$:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR}\\left[ (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} \\right] = (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell}) + 2K_{1}K_{2}R\n$$\nNow we substitute this into the expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}}(R) = \\frac{R \\left[ (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell}) + 2K_{1}K_{2}R \\right]}{(K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}} = \\frac{(K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R + 2K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}}{(K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R + K_{1}K_{2}R^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires this expression to be evaluated at the concentration $R_{1/2}$ where $\\theta(R_{1/2}) = 1/2$. At this concentration, $Y(R_{1/2}) = \\frac{1/2}{1-1/2} = 1$.\nSo, at $R=R_{1/2}$, the denominator of the expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ becomes $1$:\n$$\n(K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R_{1/2} + K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2} = 1\n$$\nThe expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ evaluated at $R_{1/2}$ is therefore just the numerator evaluated at $R_{1/2}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R_{1/2} + 2K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression. From the condition $Y(R_{1/2})=1$, we can express the linear term as:\n$$\n(K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R_{1/2} = 1 - K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = (1 - K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2}) + 2K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2} = 1 + K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ evaluated at half repression.\n\n**Condition for Higher-Order Cooperativity ($n_{\\mathrm{H}}>1$)**\n\nThe condition for effective higher-order cooperativity is $n_{\\mathrm{H}} > 1$. Using our derived expression:\n$$\n1 + K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2} > 1\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nK_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2} > 0\n$$\nSince $K_1$ and $K_2$ are association constants and $R_{1/2}$ is a physical concentration, they must all be non-negative. For the inequality to be strict, we must have $K_1 > 0$, $K_2 > 0$, and $R_{1/2} > 0$. The concentration $R_{1/2}$ is the positive root of the quadratic equation $K_{1}K_{2}R^{2} + (K_{1} + K_{2} + K_{1}K_{2}c_{\\ell})R - 1 = 0$, which is always positive if the coefficients are non-negative and the constant term is non-zero.\nTherefore, the parameter regime that produces $n_{\\mathrm{H}}>1$ is simply $K_1 > 0$ and $K_2 > 0$. Physically, this means that both operator sites must be functional binding sites. The cooperativity ($n_{\\mathrm{H}}>1$) arises from the term quadratic in $R$ in the expression for $Y(R)$, which represents the simultaneous, independent binding of two repressor tetramers to the two operators. The looping term ($K_{1}K_{2}Rc_{\\ell}$) is linear in $R$ and does not contribute to increasing the Hill coefficient beyond $1$; in fact, it tends to decrease $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ by lowering $R_{1/2}$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the parameter set: $K_{1}=10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$, $K_{2}=10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$, and $c_{\\ell}=0\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nFirst, we find the half-repression concentration $R_{1/2}$ by solving $Y(R_{1/2})=1$. For these parameters, the equation is:\n$$\n(K_{1} + K_{2})R_{1/2} + K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n(10^{8} + 10^{8})R_{1/2} + (10^{8})(10^{8})R_{1/2}^{2} = 1\n$$\n$$\n(2 \\times 10^{8})R_{1/2} + 10^{16}R_{1/2}^{2} = 1\n$$\nRearranging into standard quadratic form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ with $x=R_{1/2}$:\n$$\n10^{16}R_{1/2}^{2} + (2 \\times 10^{8})R_{1/2} - 1 = 0\n$$\nWe solve for the positive root of $R_{1/2}$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nR_{1/2} = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-(2 \\times 10^{8}) + \\sqrt{(2 \\times 10^{8})^{2} - 4(10^{16})(-1)}}{2(10^{16})}\n$$\n$$\nR_{1/2} = \\frac{-2 \\times 10^{8} + \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{16} + 4 \\times 10^{16}}}{2 \\times 10^{16}} = \\frac{-2 \\times 10^{8} + \\sqrt{8 \\times 10^{16}}}{2 \\times 10^{16}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{1/2} = \\frac{-2 \\times 10^{8} + 2\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{8}}{2 \\times 10^{16}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{8}(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2 \\times 10^{16}} = (\\sqrt{2}-1) \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nNow, we compute $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ using the derived formula:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 + K_{1}K_{2}R_{1/2}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 + (10^{8})(10^{8}) \\left( (\\sqrt{2}-1) \\times 10^{-8} \\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 + 10^{16} \\left( (\\sqrt{2}-1)^{2} \\times 10^{-16} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 + (\\sqrt{2}-1)^{2} = 1 + (2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 1 + 3 - 2\\sqrt{2} = 4 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}} = 4 - 2 \\times 1.41421356... = 4 - 2.82842712... = 1.1715728...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.172$.",

All necessary data, models, and definitions are provided without contradiction. The model describes a Type-1 Coherent Feedforward Loop (C1-FFL) with AND-logic using standard ordinary differential equations and a high-cooperativity approximation (Heaviside functions), which is a common and valid simplification in computational systems biology. The objectives are clearly stated and mathematically formalizable. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe governing equations for the concentrations of proteins $Z$ and $Y$ are given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha_{z}\\,h_{x}(X(t)) - \\delta_{z}\\,Z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_{y}\\,h_{x}(X(t))\\,h_{z}(Z(t)) - \\delta_{y}\\,Y\n$$\nwhere the activation functions are Heaviside step functions, $h_{x}(X) = H(X-K_{x})$ and $h_{z}(Z) = H(Z-K_{z})$, with $H(u)=0$ for $u<0$ and $H(u)=1$ for $u \\ge 0$. The AND logic for the promoter of $Y$ is captured by the product $h_{x}(X)\\,h_{z}(Z)$.\n\n**1. ON Step Response Analysis**\n\nFor the ON step, the input is $X(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$ and $X(t) = X_{0}$ for $t \\ge 0$, where the constant $X_{0} > K_{x}$. The initial conditions at $t=0$ are $Z(0)=0$ and $Y(0)=0$.\n\nFor $t \\ge 0$, since $X(t) = X_{0} > K_{x}$, the activation function $h_{x}(X(t))$ evaluates to $H(X_{0}-K_{x}) = 1$. The system of ODEs simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha_{z} - \\delta_{z}\\,Z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_{y}\\,h_{z}(Z(t)) - \\delta_{y}\\,Y\n$$\nFirst, we solve the equation for the intermediate factor concentration, $Z(t)$, subject to the initial condition $Z(0)=0$. This is a first-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation, with the solution:\n$$\nZ(t) = \\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\delta_z t)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression indicates that $Z(t)$ increases from its initial value of $0$ and asymptotically approaches the steady-state concentration $Z_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha_{z}}{\\delta_{z}}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the dynamics of the output $Y(t)$. The production of $Y$ is controlled by the term $\\alpha_{y}\\,h_{z}(Z(t))$, which is non-zero only if $Z(t) \\ge K_{z}$. The ON-delay, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is defined as the earliest time $t > 0$ at which production of $Y$ becomes positive, which corresponds to the time when $Z(t)$ first reaches its threshold $K_{z}$.\n$$\nZ(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = K_{z}\n$$\nSubstituting the solution for $Z(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\delta_z t_{\\mathrm{on}})\\right) = K_{z}\n$$\nA finite, positive, and real-valued solution for $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ exists only if the steady-state concentration of $Z$ exceeds the threshold $K_{z}$. This establishes the necessary condition for the circuit to activate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} > K_{z} \\quad \\text{or equivalently} \\quad \\alpha_{z} > \\delta_{z} K_{z}\n$$\nAssuming this condition is met, we solve for $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-\\delta_z t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\frac{\\delta_z K_z}{\\alpha_z}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-\\delta_z t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = 1 - \\frac{\\delta_z K_z}{\\alpha_z} = \\frac{\\alpha_z - \\delta_z K_z}{\\alpha_z}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\delta_z t_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_z - \\delta_z K_z}{\\alpha_z}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{on}} = -\\frac{1}{\\delta_z} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_z - \\delta_z K_z}{\\alpha_z}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\delta_z} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\alpha_z - \\delta_z K_z}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the ON-delay. For time $0 \\le t < t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $Z(t) < K_{z}$, so $h_{z}(Z(t)) = 0$. The ODE for $Y$ is $\\frac{dY}{dt} = -\\delta_{y} Y$, which with $Y(0)=0$ yields $Y(t)=0$. For $t \\ge t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $Z(t) \\ge K_{z}$ and $h_{z}(Z(t)) = 1$. The ODE $\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_{y} - \\delta_{y} Y$ with the condition $Y(t_{\\mathrm{on}})=0$ gives the solution $Y(t) = \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}} (1 - \\exp(-\\delta_{y}(t - t_{\\mathrm{on}})))$.\n\n**2. OFF Step Response Analysis**\n\nFor the OFF step, the input is $X(t) = X_{0} > K_{x}$ for $t < 0$ and $X(t) = 0$ for $t \\ge 0$. The system is at steady state for $t < 0$. Under these pre-step conditions, $h_{x}(X_{0})=1$. We assume the condition $\\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\delta_z} > K_z$ holds, so the system is fully active, implying $h_z(Z)=1$. The steady-state values are $Z(0^{-}) = \\frac{\\alpha_{z}}{\\delta_{z}}$ and $Y(0^{-}) = \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\delta_{y}}$. These serve as initial conditions for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the input is $X(t)=0$. Since $K_{x}>0$, $X(t) < K_{x}$, so $h_{x}(X(t))=0$. The ODE for $Y$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_{y}\\,(0)\\,h_{z}(Z(t)) - \\delta_{y}\\,Y = -\\delta_{y}\\,Y\n$$\nDue to the AND logic, the production term for $Y$ becomes zero immediately at $t=0$ when $X$ is removed. This means the delay to turn OFF production is effectively zero ($t_{\\mathrm{off}}=0$). The concentration of $Y$ then simply decays from its initial steady-state value: $Y(t) = \\frac{\\alpha_y}{\\delta_y} \\exp(-\\delta_y t)$.\n\n**3. Condition for Sign-Sensitive Delay**\n\nSign-sensitive delay is defined in the problem as a finite delay to turn ON and effectively zero delay to turn OFF.\nOur analysis confirms that the OFF-delay is always zero ($t_{\\mathrm{off}}=0$) due to the AND logic at the $Y$ promoter.\nThe ON-delay, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is finite and positive if and only if the condition for the activation of $Z$ to cross its threshold $K_z$ is met. As derived previously, this parameter regime is given by the inequality:\n$$\n\\alpha_z > \\delta_z K_z\n$$\nThe problem asks for the closed-form expression for the ON-delay time, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, which is the result derived in the first section.

Conditional on $G(t)$, the mRNA concentration $m(t)$ and protein concentration $p(t)$ satisfy the ordinary differential equations\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = s\\,G(t) - \\gamma_{m}\\,m(t), \\qquad \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{t}\\,m(t) - \\gamma_{p}\\,p(t),\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the transcription rate when the promoter is active, $\\gamma_{m}$ is the mRNA degradation rate, $k_{t}$ is the translation rate constant, and $\\gamma_{p}$ is the protein degradation rate.

Using only fundamental principles appropriate to computational systems biology—namely, the Central Dogma of molecular biology for process orientation, mass-action kinetics for degradation and production, and balance of probability flux for stationary stochastic processes—derive the stationary marginal distribution $P(m)$ of the mRNA concentration under this PDMP.

            "solution": "The problem describes a single-gene regulatory module using a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). The state of the system is given by the tuple $(G(t), m(t), p(t))$, where $G(t) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the discrete promoter state and $(m(t), p(t))$ are the continuous mRNA and protein concentrations. We are asked to find the stationary marginal distribution of the mRNA concentration, $P(m)$, and then compute a ratio of the squared coefficient of variation for two different parameter sets.\n\nFirst, we derive the stationary distribution $P(m)$. The protein dynamics are decoupled from the $(G, m)$ subsystem for this part of the problem, so we can ignore the equation for $p(t)$. Let $P_0(m)$ and $P_1(m)$ be the stationary probability densities for the mRNA concentration $m$ conditional on the promoter being inactive ($G=0$) and active ($G=1$), respectively. The total stationary distribution is $P(m) = P_0(m) + P_1(m)$.\n\nThe time evolution of the system is governed by a master equation. In the stationary state, the net probability flux must be zero. The stationary master equations for the conditional densities are:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ v_0(m) P_0(m) \\right] - k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) + k_{\\mathrm{off}} P_1(m)\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ v_1(m) P_1(m) \\right] + k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} P_1(m)\n$$\nwhere $v_0(m)$ and $v_1(m)$ are the deterministic drifts of $m$ in each state:\n$$\nv_0(m) = \\frac{dm}{dt}\\bigg|_{G=0} = -\\gamma_m m\n$$\n$$\nv_1(m) = \\frac{dm}{dt}\\bigg|_{G=1} = s - \\gamma_m m\n$$\nSubstituting the drift terms into the master equations:\n$$\n(1) \\quad 0 = \\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ \\gamma_m m P_0(m) \\right] - k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) + k_{\\mathrm{off}} P_1(m)\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad 0 = -\\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ (s - \\gamma_m m) P_1(m) \\right] + k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} P_1(m)\n$$\nAdding equations (1) and (2) gives:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ \\gamma_m m P_0(m) - (s - \\gamma_m m) P_1(m) \\right]\n$$\nThis implies that the total probability flux, $J(m) = v_0(m)P_0(m) + v_1(m)P_1(m) = -\\gamma_m m P_0(m) + (s - \\gamma_m m) P_1(m)$, is constant. Since the probability densities must vanish as $m \\to \\infty$, this constant must be zero. Therefore, the flux is zero for all $m$:\n$$\n-\\gamma_m m P_0(m) + (s - \\gamma_m m) P_1(m) = 0\n$$\nThis yields an algebraic relationship between the two conditional densities:\n$$\nP_1(m) = \\frac{\\gamma_m m}{s - \\gamma_m m} P_0(m)\n$$\nThis relationship holds for the domain where both densities can be non-zero. The drift $v_1(m)$ is positive for $m < s/\\gamma_m$ and negative for $m > s/\\gamma_m$. This means mRNA can only be produced up to the level $m = s/\\gamma_m$. For any $m > s/\\gamma_m$, the promoter being active would lead to a decrease in $m$. Consequently, there is no source of probability in the region $m > s/\\gamma_m$, and thus the stationary densities $P_0(m)$ and $P_1(m)$ must be zero for $m > s/\\gamma_m$. The support of the distribution $P(m)$ is the interval $[0, s/\\gamma_m]$. The relation $P_1(m) = \\frac{\\gamma_m m}{s - \\gamma_m m} P_0(m)$ holds for $m \\in [0, s/\\gamma_m)$.\n\nNow we substitute this relation back into equation (2):\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ (s - \\gamma_m m) P_1(m) \\right] = k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} P_1(m)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ \\gamma_m m P_0(m) \\right] = k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\frac{\\gamma_m m}{s - \\gamma_m m} P_0(m)\n$$\nExpanding the derivative on the left side:\n$$\n\\gamma_m P_0(m) + \\gamma_m m \\frac{dP_0(m)}{dm} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} P_0(m) - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\gamma_m m}{s - \\gamma_m m} P_0(m)\n$$\nRearranging to form a separable ordinary differential equation for $P_0(m)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P_0(m)} \\frac{dP_0(m)}{dm} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}} - \\gamma_m}{\\gamma_m m} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{s - \\gamma_m m} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\gamma_m} - 1\\right)\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{s - \\gamma_m m}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $m$:\n$$\n\\ln P_0(m) = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\gamma_m} - 1\\right) \\ln m + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\gamma_m} \\ln(s - \\gamma_m m) + \\text{const}\n$$\nLet $\\alpha = k_{\\mathrm{on}}/\\gamma_m$ and $\\beta = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/\\gamma_m$.\n$$\n\\ln P_0(m) = (\\alpha - 1)\\ln m + \\beta \\ln(s - \\gamma_m m) + \\text{const}\n$$\nThis gives the functional form of $P_0(m)$:\n$$\nP_0(m) = C_0 m^{\\alpha-1} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta}\n$$\nUsing the relation between $P_1(m)$ and $P_0(m)$, we find $P_1(m)$:\n$$\nP_1(m) = \\frac{\\gamma_m m}{s - \\gamma_m m} C_0 m^{\\alpha-1} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta} = C_0 \\gamma_m m^{\\alpha} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta-1}\n$$\nThe total stationary distribution $P(m) = P_0(m) + P_1(m)$ is:\n$$\nP(m) = C_0 \\left[ m^{\\alpha-1} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta} + \\gamma_m m^{\\alpha} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta-1} \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\nP(m) = C_0 m^{\\alpha-1} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta-1} \\left[ (s - \\gamma_m m) + \\gamma_m m \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP(m) = C_0 s \\cdot m^{\\alpha-1} (s - \\gamma_m m)^{\\beta-1}\n$$\nThis functional form is that of a scaled Beta distribution. Let $C = C_0 s$ be the normalization constant. To confirm the distribution shape, consider the transformation $x = \\gamma_m m / s$. Then $m = sx/\\gamma_m$, $dm = (s/\\gamma_m)dx$, and $x \\in [0, 1]$. The probability density in terms of $x$, $P(x)$, is:\n$$\nP(x) dx = P(m) dm \\implies P(x) = P(m(x))\\frac{dm}{dx} \\propto \\left(\\frac{sx}{\\gamma_m}\\right)^{\\alpha-1} \\left(s - s x\\right)^{\\beta-1} \\propto x^{\\alpha-1} (1-x)^{\\beta-1}\n$$\nThis is the kernel of a Beta distribution with shape parameters $\\alpha = k_{\\mathrm{on}}/\\gamma_m$ and $\\beta = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/\\gamma_m$.\n\nNext, we derive the squared coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV}^2(m) = \\operatorname{Var}(m) / (\\operatorname{E}[m])^2$. We can compute the moments of $m$ from the moments of the Beta-distributed variable $x$.\nThe $k$-th moment of a Beta$(\\alpha, \\beta)$ random variable $x$ is given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}[x^k] = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+k)\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta+k)}\n$$\nThe first two moments are:\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}[x] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}[x^2] = \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)}{(\\alpha+\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}\n$$\nSince $m = (s/\\gamma_m)x$, the moments of $m$ are:\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}[m] = \\frac{s}{\\gamma_m} \\operatorname{E}[x] = \\frac{s}{\\gamma_m} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}[m^2] = \\left(\\frac{s}{\\gamma_m}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{E}[x^2] = \\left(\\frac{s}{\\gamma_m}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)}{(\\alpha+\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}\n$$\nNow we compute $\\mathrm{CV}^2(m)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^2(m) = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[m^2]}{(\\operatorname{E}[m])^2} - 1 = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s}{\\gamma_m}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)}{(\\alpha+\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}}{\\left(\\frac{s}{\\gamma_m}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)^2} - 1 = \\frac{(\\alpha+1)(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha(\\alpha+\\beta+1)} - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^2(m) = \\frac{\\alpha^2 + \\alpha\\beta + \\alpha + \\beta - (\\alpha^2 + \\alpha\\beta + \\alpha)}{\\alpha(\\alpha+\\beta+1)} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}\n$$\nSubstituting back the original parameters $\\alpha=k_{\\mathrm{on}}/\\gamma_m$ and $\\beta=k_{\\mathrm{off}}/\\gamma_m$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^2(m) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}/\\gamma_m}{(k_{\\mathrm{on}}/\\gamma_m)(k_{\\mathrm{on}}/\\gamma_m + k_{\\mathrm{off}}/\\gamma_m + 1)} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}+k_{\\mathrm{off}}+\\gamma_m}{\\gamma_m}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\gamma_m}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}(k_{\\mathrm{on}}+k_{\\mathrm{off}}+\\gamma_m)}\n$$\nNow we use this formula to compute $\\mathrm{CV}^2(m)$ for the two given parameter sets.\n\nFor the prokaryote-like regime:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on},P} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off},P} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $\\gamma_{m,P} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^{2}(m)_P = \\frac{(1.00)(0.30)}{(0.10)(0.10+1.00+0.30)} = \\frac{0.3}{0.10(1.40)} = \\frac{0.3}{0.14} = \\frac{30}{14} = \\frac{15}{7}\n$$\nFor the eukaryote-like regime:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on},E} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off},E} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $\\gamma_{m,E} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^{2}(m)_E = \\frac{(0.03)(0.05)}{(0.02)(0.02+0.03+0.05)} = \\frac{0.0015}{0.02(0.10)} = \\frac{0.0015}{0.0020} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the burstiness contrast ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\mathrm{CV}^{2}(m)_P}{\\mathrm{CV}^{2}(m)_E} = \\frac{15/7}{3/4} = \\frac{15}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{7} = \\frac{20}{7}\n$$\nThe derivation is complete and the final numerical result has been calculated as an exact fraction.",
