            "problem": "A $20$-residue peptide with one-letter code sequence $S$ is given by $S = \\mathrm{D K L I V L I A G L V L I V L F I A R D}$. You are provided with two experimentally established lookup tables: the Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy values and the Chou–Fasman helix propensities for the $20$ canonical amino acids. Use these to compute the Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy profile at odd-window size $w = 7$ and then, under physiological ionic strength, predict the most probable helical segment by integrating hydropathy and helix propensity criteria.\n\nThe Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy values $h(\\cdot)$ are:\n$A: 1.8$, $R: -4.5$, $N: -3.5$, $D: -3.5$, $C: 2.5$, $Q: -3.5$, $E: -3.5$, $G: -0.4$, $H: -3.2$, $I: 4.5$, $L: 3.8$, $K: -3.9$, $M: 1.9$, $F: 2.8$, $P: -1.6$, $S: -0.8$, $T: -0.7$, $W: -0.9$, $Y: -1.3$, $V: 4.2$.\n\nThe Chou–Fasman (CF) helix propensities $P_{\\alpha}(\\cdot)$ are:\n$A: 1.42$, $R: 0.98$, $N: 0.65$, $D: 1.01$, $C: 0.70$, $Q: 1.11$, $E: 1.51$, $G: 0.57$, $H: 1.00$, $I: 1.08$, $L: 1.21$, $K: 1.16$, $M: 1.45$, $F: 1.13$, $P: 0.57$, $S: 0.77$, $T: 0.83$, $W: 1.08$, $Y: 0.69$, $V: 1.06$.\n\nCompute the Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy profile $H(i)$ at center positions $i \\in \\{4,5,\\dots,16\\}$ by averaging $h(\\cdot)$ over the length-$w$ window centered at $i$, i.e., positions $\\{i-3,i-2,\\dots,i+3\\}$. Using a hydropathy threshold $H^{*} = 1.6$, identify all center positions where $H(i) > H^{*}$ and select the longest contiguous run of such center positions; define the candidate helical segment as the residue index interval from the first to the last center position in that run.\n\nTo incorporate physiological ionic strength, use Debye–Hückel (DH) screening at ionic strength $I = 0.15$ $\\mathrm{mol/L}$ and temperature $T = 310$ $\\mathrm{K}$ with relative permittivity of water $\\varepsilon_{r} = 78.5$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the prediction of a helical segment within a $20$-residue peptide, $S = \\mathrm{D K L I V L I A G L V L I V L F I A R D}$, by integrating two criteria: a Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy profile and Chou–Fasman helix propensities, with an adjustment for electrostatic screening under physiological conditions. The solution proceeds in a stepwise manner.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the Kyte–Doolittle Hydropathy Profile**\nThe hydropathy profile $H(i)$ is computed for center positions $i \\in \\{4, 5, \\dots, 16\\}$ by averaging the Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy values, $h(\\cdot)$, over a window of size $w=7$. The window for a center position $i$ includes residues from $i-3$ to $i+3$. The peptide sequence is first mapped to its corresponding hydropathy values using the provided table.\n\nSequence $S$: D K L I V L I A G L V L I V L F I A R D\nIndices: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20$\nHydropathy values $h(S_i)$: $-3.5, -3.9, 3.8, 4.5, 4.2, 3.8, 4.5, 1.8, -0.4, 3.8, 4.2, 3.8, 4.5, 4.2, 3.8, 2.8, 4.5, 1.8, -4.5, -3.5$\n\nThe calculation of $H(i) = \\frac{1}{7} \\sum_{j=i-3}^{i+3} h(S_j)$ for each specified center position $i$ yields the following profile:\n\nFor $i=4$, the window is from position $1$ to $7$ (D, K, L, I, V, L, I).\n$H(4) = \\frac{1}{7}(-3.5 - 3.9 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5) = \\frac{13.4}{7} \\approx 1.914$\n\nFor $i=5$, the window is from position $2$ to $8$ (K, L, I, V, L, I, A).\n$H(5) = \\frac{1}{7}(-3.9 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 1.8) = \\frac{18.7}{7} \\approx 2.671$\n\nContinuing this process for all required center positions:\n$H(6) = \\frac{1}{7}(3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 1.8 - 0.4) = \\frac{22.2}{7} \\approx 3.171$\n$H(7) = \\frac{1}{7}(4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 1.8 - 0.4 + 3.8) = \\frac{22.2}{7} \\approx 3.171$\n$H(8) = \\frac{1}{7}(4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 1.8 - 0.4 + 3.8 + 4.2) = \\frac{21.9}{7} \\approx 3.129$\n$H(9) = \\frac{1}{7}(3.8 + 4.5 + 1.8 - 0.4 + 3.8 + 4.2 + 3.8) = \\frac{21.5}{7} \\approx 3.071$\n$H(10) = \\frac{1}{7}(4.5 + 1.8 - 0.4 + 3.8 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5) = \\frac{22.2}{7} \\approx 3.171$\n$H(11) = \\frac{1}{7}(1.8 - 0.4 + 3.8 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2) = \\frac{21.9}{7} \\approx 3.129$\n$H(12) = \\frac{1}{7}(-0.4 + 3.8 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8) = \\frac{23.9}{7} \\approx 3.414$\n$H(13) = \\frac{1}{7}(3.8 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 2.8) = \\frac{27.1}{7} \\approx 3.871$\n$H(14) = \\frac{1}{7}(4.2 + 3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 2.8 + 4.5) = \\frac{27.8}{7} \\approx 3.971$\n$H(15) = \\frac{1}{7}(3.8 + 4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 2.8 + 4.5 + 1.8) = \\frac{25.4}{7} \\approx 3.629$\n$H(16) = \\frac{1}{7}(4.5 + 4.2 + 3.8 + 2.8 + 4.5 + 1.8 - 4.5) = \\frac{17.1}{7} \\approx 2.443$\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Candidate Helical Segment**\nThe hydropathy criterion requires identifying center positions where $H(i) > H^{*} = 1.6$. Reviewing the results from Step 1, all calculated hydropathy values for $i$ from $4$ to $16$ are greater than $1.6$. This constitutes a single contiguous run of qualifying center positions: $\\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\\}$.\nAccording to the problem, the candidate helical segment is the residue index interval from the first to the last center position in this run. Therefore, the candidate segment spans from residue index $4$ to residue index $16$.\nThe segment is: $S[4-16] = \\mathrm{I V L I A G L V L I V L F}$. Its length is $16 - 4 + 1 = 13$ residues.\n\n**Step 3: Quantify Debye–Hückel Screening**\nThe problem directs us to quantify the Debye–Hückel (DH) screening factor, $f$. This requires calculating the inverse Debye length, $\\kappa$, under the specified physiological conditions. The formula for $\\kappa^2$ is:\n$$ \\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 N_A e^2 I}{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r k_B T} $$\nThe given ionic strength $I = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$ must be converted to SI units: $I = 150 \\ \\mathrm{mol/m^3}$. Using the provided physical constants:\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{C^{2}/(N \\cdot m^{2})}$\n$\\varepsilon_r = 78.5$\n$k_B = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n$T = 310 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n$e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n\n$\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 (6.022 \\times 10^{23}) (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2 (150)}{(8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (78.5) (1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) (310)} \\approx \\frac{4.647 \\times 10^{-12}}{2.977 \\times 10^{-30}} \\approx 1.561 \\times 10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$\n$\\kappa = \\sqrt{1.561 \\times 10^{18}} \\approx 1.249 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.\n\nThe screening factor $f$ corresponds to the exponential decay of the electrostatic potential, $f = \\exp(-\\kappa r)$, where $r$ is the interaction distance. Given $r = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.60 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$\\kappa r = (1.249 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}})(0.60 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 0.7494$\n$f = \\exp(-0.7494) \\approx 0.4726$.\n\n**Step 4: Adjust Mean Helix Propensity**\nThe adjustment to the mean helix propensity depends on finding oppositely charged $i \\leftrightarrow i+3$ or $i \\leftrightarrow i+4$ residue pairs within the candidate segment ($S[4-16]$). The charged amino acids are Aspartate (D), Glutamate (E) (negative), and Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Histidine (H) (positive).\nThe candidate segment's sequence is $\\mathrm{I V L I A G L V L I V L F}$. This segment contains exclusively non-polar, uncharged residues. Consequently, there are no oppositely charged pairs satisfying the $i \\leftrightarrow i+3$ or $i \\leftrightarrow i+4$ condition within this segment. As per the problem statement, if no such pairs exist, no adjustment is applied to the mean helix propensity.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Final Helix Declaration Criterion**\nThe final step is to check if the candidate segment is a probable helix. This requires its mean effective Chou–Fasman (CF) helix propensity, $\\bar{P}_{\\alpha,\\text{eff}}$, to exceed the threshold $P^{*} = 1.00$. Since no adjustment was made, $\\bar{P}_{\\alpha,\\text{eff}} = \\bar{P}_{\\alpha}$. We calculate the mean propensity $\\bar{P}_{\\alpha}$ for the segment $S[4-16]$.\n\nThe CF propensities $P_{\\alpha}(\\cdot)$ for the residues in the segment are:\nI: $1.08$, V: $1.06$, L: $1.21$, I: $1.08$, A: $1.42$, G: $0.57$, L: $1.21$, V: $1.06$, L: $1.21$, I: $1.08$, V: $1.06$, L: $1.21$, F: $1.13$.\nThe sum of these propensities is:\n$\\sum P_{\\alpha} = 1.08+1.06+1.21+1.08+1.42+0.57+1.21+1.06+1.21+1.08+1.06+1.21+1.13 = 14.38$.\nThe segment has length $13$. The mean propensity is:\n$\\bar{P}_{\\alpha} = \\frac{14.38}{13} \\approx 1.106$.\n\nThe final condition is $\\bar{P}_{\\alpha,\\text{eff}} > P^{*}$, which is $1.106 > 1.00$. This condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the segment of residues from index $4$ to index $16$ is declared the most probable helix. The start and end indices are $4$ and $16$.",

The computational method must implement the following scientifically justified base:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been assessed and is determined to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics as applied to protein folding, specifically the Eyring–Polanyi equation and the Denaturant Linear Free Energy Relationship (DLFER). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, constants, and a clear objective. The terminology is objective and unambiguous. It represents a standard, formalizable problem in computational biophysics.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nThe foundation of our computational method rests on deriving a linear relationship between the observable rate constants and the denaturant concentration, from which the parameters of interest can be extracted.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Eyring–Polanyi Equation**\n    The relationship between a microscopic rate constant, $k$, and the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, is given by the Eyring–Polanyi equation from Transition State Theory (TST):\n    $$k = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T}\\right)$$\n    Here, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is Planck's constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant. The term $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right)$ is the universal frequency factor, which we will treat as a constant at a fixed temperature $T$.\n\n2.  **Logarithmic Transformation**\n    To linearize the exponential relationship, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n    $$\\ln k = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T}$$\n    This equation shows that the natural logarithm of the rate constant is linearly proportional to the activation free energy.\n\n3.  **Incorporating the Denaturant Linear Free Energy Relationship (DLFER)**\n    The DLFER model posits a linear dependence of the activation free energy barriers on the denaturant concentration, $[D]$. We apply this model to both the folding ($f$) and unfolding ($u$) processes.\n\n    **For Folding ($k_f$):**\n    The activation free energy for folding is given as $\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}([D]) = \\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}(0) + m_f [D]$, where $\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}(0)$ is the activation barrier in the absence of denaturant and $m_f$ is the folding $m$-value. Substituting this into the logarithmic form of the Eyring equation:\n    $$\\ln k_f([D]) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}(0) + m_f [D]}{R T}$$\n    Rearranging this equation into the standard linear form $y = c + b x$, where $y = \\ln k_f([D])$ and $x = [D]$:\n    $$\\ln k_f([D]) = \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}(0)}{RT} \\right] - \\left( \\frac{m_f}{RT} \\right) [D]$$\n    The term in square brackets is the intercept, and the term in parentheses is the slope. The slope of a plot of $\\ln k_f$ versus $[D]$, which we denote $\\text{slope}_f$, is therefore:\n    $$\\text{slope}_f = -\\frac{m_f}{RT}$$\n    From this, we can solve for the folding $m$-value:\n    $$m_f = -(\\text{slope}_f) \\cdot RT$$\n\n    **For Unfolding ($k_u$):**\n    Similarly, the activation free energy for unfolding is given as $\\Delta G_u^{\\ddagger}([D]) = \\Delta G_u^{\\ddagger}(0) - m_u [D]$, where the negative sign convention for the $m_u [D]$ term indicates that denaturant destabilizes the native state, thus lowering the unfolding barrier. Substituting this into the logarithmic Eyring equation:\n    $$\\ln k_u([D]) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta G_u^{\\ddagger}(0) - m_u [D]}{R T}$$\n    Rearranging into the linear form $y = c + b x$, where $y = \\ln k_u([D])$ and $x = [D]$:\n    $$\\ln k_u([D]) = \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta G_u^{\\ddagger}(0)}{RT} \\right] + \\left( \\frac{m_u}{RT} \\right) [D]$$\n    The slope of a plot of $\\ln k_u$ versus $[D]$, denoted $\\text{slope}_u$, is:\n    $$\\text{slope}_u = +\\frac{m_u}{RT}$$\n    Solving for the unfolding $m$-value:\n    $$m_u = (\\text{slope}_u) \\cdot RT$$\n\n### Computational Implementation\n\nThe derived relationships form the basis of our algorithm. For each dataset $(T, [D], k_f, k_u)$:\n\n1.  Transform the rate constant data by taking the natural logarithm: $\\ln k_f$ and $\\ln k_u$.\n2.

Use the ideal gas constant $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and the given temperature $T$ in Kelvin.\n4.  Calculate the $m$-values. The units of the slope will be $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$ since $\\ln k$ is dimensionless and $[D]$ is in $\\mathrm{M}$. The product slope $\\times RT$ will have units of $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$. To convert to the required units of $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$, we divide by $1000$.\n    $$m_f \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}}\\right] = -(\\text{slope}_f) \\cdot R \\cdot T / 1000$$\n    $$m_u \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}}\\right] = (\\text{slope}_u) \\cdot R \\cdot T / 1000$$\n5.

Many proteins function by switching between different conformational states, and this equilibrium can be controlled by the binding of small molecules. This hands-on practice delves into the core of allostery by using statistical mechanics to model how a ligand shifts a protein's conformational ensemble, thereby modulating its activity .

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of ambiguity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A monomeric allosteric protein interconverts between a relaxed conformation $R$ and a tense conformation $T$.\n- In the absence of ligand, the standard Gibbs free energy difference is $\\Delta G_{0} = G_T^{0} - G_R^{0}$.\n- A ligand $L$ binds to a single site on the protein in both conformations.\n- The dissociation constants are $K_{d,R}$ for the $R$ state and $K_{d,T}$ for the $T$ state.\n- The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{abs}}$.\n- The free ligand concentration is fixed at $[L]$.\n- Assumptions: ideal solution, single independent binding site.\n- The task is to derive the total probability of the $R$ conformation, $p_R([L])$, from first principles (Boltzmann distribution, law of mass action) and then to compute the change in this probability, $\\Delta p_R = p_R([L]) - p_R(0)$.\n- Parameter values:\n  - $\\Delta G_{0} = -6.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n  - $K_{d,R} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n  - $K_{d,T} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n  - $[L] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n  - $T_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- The ideal gas constant $R$ is to be used.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic two-state allosteric model, a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry and systems biology. It is firmly based on the principles of statistical mechanics (Boltzmann distribution) and chemical thermodynamics (Gibbs free energy, law of mass action). The parameter values are physically realistic for protein-ligand interactions.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined. It asks for a derivation and a specific numerical calculation, and all necessary parameters and constants are provided. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or ambiguities. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe system consists of four distinct microstates: the unbound relaxed state ($R$), the ligand-bound relaxed state ($RL$), the unbound tense state ($T$), and the ligand-bound tense state ($TL$).\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of finding the system in a particular microstate $i$ is proportional to its Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-G_i / (RT_{\\mathrm{abs}}))$, where $G_i$ is the molar Gibbs free energy of that state. To simplify the analysis, we can work with statistical weights, which are proportional to the populations of the states at equilibrium. Let's define the statistical weight of the unbound relaxed state, $w(R)$, as our reference and set it to $1$.\n\n$w(R) = 1$\n\nThe equilibrium between the unbound $R$ and $T$ states is $R \\rightleftharpoons T$. The equilibrium constant for this isomerization is $L_0 = [T]/[R]$. This constant is related to the standard free energy difference $\\Delta G_{0}$ by the relation:\n$L_0 = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{0} / (RT_{\\mathrm{abs}}))$\nThe statistical weight of the unbound $T$ state, relative to the unbound $R$ state, is therefore:\n$w(T) = L_0$\n\nNext, consider ligand binding. The binding of ligand $L$ to the $R$ state is described by the equilibrium $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$, with a dissociation constant $K_{d,R} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$. From the law of mass action, the ratio of the population of the bound state to the unbound state is $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}$. The statistical weight of the ligand-bound $R$ state is thus:\n$w(RL) = w(R) \\times \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}$\n\nSimilarly, for the $T$ state, the binding equilibrium is $T + L \\rightleftharpoons TL$ with dissociation constant $K_{d,T} = \\frac{[T][L]}{[TL]}$. The ratio of populations is $\\frac{[TL]}{[T]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}$. The statistical weight of the ligand-bound $T$ state, relative to the unbound $R$ state, is:\n$w(TL) = w(T) \\times \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}} = L_0 \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}$\n\nThe total partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates:\n$Z = w(R) + w(RL) + w(T) + w(TL)$\n$Z = 1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}} + L_0 + L_0 \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}$\n$Z = \\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}\\right) + L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}\\right)$\n\nThe total probability of the protein being in the $R$ conformation, $p_R([L])$, is the sum of the weights of the microstates belonging to the $R$ conformation ($R$ and $RL$) divided by the total partition function $Z$.\n$$p_R([L]) = \\frac{w(R) + w(RL)}{Z} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}\\right) + L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}\\right)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the probability of the $R$ state as a function of ligand concentration.\n\nThe probability of the $R$ state in the absence of ligand, $p_R(0)$, is found by setting $[L]=0$ in the above expression:\n$$p_R(0) = \\frac{1 + 0}{(1 + 0) + L_0(1 + 0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + L_0}$$\n\nThe change in the $R$-state population upon ligand addition is $\\Delta p_R = p_R([L]) - p_R(0)$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe given parameters are:\n$\\Delta G_{0} = -6.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -6000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$K_{d,R} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$K_{d,T} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$[L] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the allosteric constant $L_0$:\n$$L_0 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT_{\\mathrm{abs}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-6000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}\\right)$$\n$$L_0 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{6000}{2477.572}\\right) \\approx \\exp(2.42173) \\approx 11.2655$$\n\nNow, we calculate $p_R(0)$:\n$$p_R(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + L_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + 11.2655} = \\frac{1}{12.2655} \\approx 0.081530$$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless ligand concentration terms. Since $K_{d,R}$, $K_{d,T}$, and $[L]$ are all in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the units cancel.\n$$\\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}} = \\frac{10}{0.5} = 20$$\n$$\\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}} = \\frac{10}{50} = 0.2$$\n\nNow, we can calculate $p_R([L])$ for $[L] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$p_R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,R}}\\right) + L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,T}}\\right)} = \\frac{1 + 20}{(1 + 20) + 11.2655 \\times (1 + 0.2)}$$\n$$p_R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\frac{21}{21 + 11.2655 \\times 1.2} = \\frac{21}{21 + 13.5186} = \\frac{21}{34.5186} \\approx 0.608364$$\n\nFinally, we compute the change in probability, $\\Delta p_R$:\n$$\\Delta p_R = p_R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) - p_R(0) \\approx 0.608364 - 0.081530 = 0.526834$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.5268$.",
