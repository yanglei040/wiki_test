I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to find all Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) for the given metabolic network. This involves two main steps: first, characterizing the set of all feasible flux vectors, and second, identifying which of these vectors have inclusion-minimal support.\n\n**1. Characterize the Feasible Flux Cone**\n\nA flux vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ is feasible if it satisfies both the steady-state mass balance constraint, $S\\,v=0$, and the irreversibility constraint, $v \\ge 0$.\n\nThe mass balance equation is:\n$$S\\,v = \\begin{bmatrix}1-10\\\\01-1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis matrix equation expands into a system of two linear equations:\n$$1 \\cdot v_1 - 1 \\cdot v_2 + 0 \\cdot v_3 = 0 \\implies v_1 - v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$$\n$$0 \\cdot v_1 + 1 \\cdot v_2 - 1 \\cdot v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 - v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 = v_3$$\nFrom these two equations, we deduce that $v_1 = v_2 = v_3$. Any vector $v$ satisfying the steady-state condition must be of the form:\n$$v = \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ c \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = c \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nfor some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The set of all such vectors forms the null space of the matrix $S$.\n\nNext, we apply the irreversibility constraint, $v \\ge 0$. This means each component of $v$ must be non-negative:\n$$v_1 \\ge 0, \\quad v_2 \\ge 0, \\quad v_3 \\ge 0$$\nSince $v_1 = v_2 = v_3 = c$, this single condition simplifies to $c \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all feasible flux vectors, known as the feasible flux cone $C$, is given by:\n$$C = \\left\\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid v = c \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, c \\ge 0 \\right\\}$$\nThis is a ray in the non-negative orthant of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ originating from the origin and extending along the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n**2. Compute the Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs)**\n\nAn EFM is defined as a *nonzero* feasible flux vector whose support is inclusion-minimal. The support of a vector $v$, denoted $\\text{supp}(v)$, is the set of indices of its nonzero components.\n$$\\text{supp}(v) = \\{i \\mid v_i \\neq 0\\}$$\n\nLet's examine the supports of the nonzero feasible fluxes in our cone $C$. A nonzero feasible flux corresponds to selecting $c  0$. For any such $v \\in C$ where $c  0$, the vector is $v = \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ c \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $c \\neq 0$, all three components are nonzero.\nThus, for any nonzero feasible flux $v$, its support is:\n$$\\text{supp}(v) = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\n\nTo be an EFM, the support $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ must be inclusion-minimal. This means there cannot exist any other nonzero feasible flux vector $w$ such that $\\text{supp}(w)$ is a proper subset of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nLet's test this condition. Suppose there exists a nonzero feasible flux $w$ where $\\text{supp}(w) \\subset \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. This would imply that at least one component of $w$ is zero.\nSince $w$ must be a feasible flux, it must belong to the cone $C$, so it must be of the form $w = k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for some $k \\ge 0$.\nIf any component of $w$ is zero, say $w_i = 0$ for some $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, then we have $k \\cdot 1 = 0$, which implies $k=0$.\nIf $k=0$, then the vector $w$ is the zero vector, $w = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. However, EFMs are defined as *nonzero* flux vectors.\nThis demonstrates that the only feasible flux with a support smaller than $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is the zero vector. Therefore, there are no *nonzero* feasible fluxes with a support that is a proper subset of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThis confirms that the support $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is inclusion-minimal. Consequently, every nonzero feasible flux in this system is an EFM. The set of all EFMs is the ray $\\left\\{ c \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mid c  0 \\right\\}$.\n\nBy convention, an elementary mode is reported as a single representative vector, scaled to have the smallest possible positive integer entries. The vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$ already satisfies this condition.\n\nThus, there is a single elementary flux mode for this network.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe computed EFM is the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The problem requires this to be expressed as a single row vector.",

It is a standard exercise in constraint-based modeling and Elementary Flux Mode analysis, a core topic in computational systems biology. The definitions of the stoichiometric matrices, steady-state conditions ($Sv=0$), and flux cones are standard and mathematically precise. The matrices $S$ and $S'$ accurately represent the stoichiometry of the described reactions. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The question is formalizable and requires a rigorous mathematical derivation. It does not contain any scientific falsehoods, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Analysis of the Original Formulation\n\nWe first determine the properties of the flux cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}$. The cone is defined by the set of flux vectors $v = (v_T, v_{R_1}, v_{R_2}, v_D)^T$ that satisfy the steady-state condition $S v = 0$ along with the given sign constraints.\nThe system of linear equations from $S v = 0$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_T \\\\ v_{R_1} \\\\ v_{R_2} \\\\ v_D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the following equations:\n$1.$ $v_T - v_{R_1} = 0 \\implies v_T = v_{R_1}$\n$2.$ $v_{R_1} - v_{R_2} = 0 \\implies v_{R_1} = v_{R_2}$\n$3.$ $v_{R_2} - v_D = 0 \\implies v_{R_2} = v_D$\n\nFrom these equations, we deduce that all flux components must be equal: $v_T = v_{R_1} = v_{R_2} = v_D$.\nAny vector in the null space of $S$, $\\ker(S)$, can be expressed as a scalar multiple of a single basis vector. Let $v_{R_1} = \\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then any solution is of the form:\n$$ v = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe null space $\\ker(S)$ is a one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nThe flux cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}$ is the intersection of $\\ker(S)$ with the half-spaces defined by the irreversibility constraints: $v_{R_1} \\ge 0$, $v_{R_2} \\ge 0$, and $v_D \\ge 0$.\nApplying these constraints to the general solution:\n- $v_{R_1} = \\alpha \\ge 0$\n- $v_{R_2} = \\alpha \\ge 0$\n- $v_D = \\alpha \\ge 0$\nAll constraints require $\\alpha \\ge 0$. The constraint on the reversible flux $v_T$ is automatically satisfied since $v_T = \\alpha \\ge 0$.\nThe cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}$ is therefore the set of vectors $\\{ \\alpha (1, 1, 1, 1)^T \\mid \\alpha \\ge 0 \\}$. This is a ray from the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nAn Elementary Flux Mode (EFM) is a non-decomposable, support-minimal generating vector of the flux cone. Since $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}$ is generated by a single vector, this vector (up to positive scaling) is the only EFM. We can represent this EFM by setting $\\alpha=1$:\n$$ e_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^T $$\nThe support of this EFM, defined as the set of reactions with non-zero flux, is $\\{T, R_1, R_2, D\\}$. This support is minimal because setting any one of the four fluxes to zero forces all others to be zero to satisfy the steady-state conditions.\n\nThe dimension of a convex cone is the dimension of the subspace it spans. Since $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}$ is a ray, it spans a one-dimensional subspace.\nTherefore, $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}) = 1$.\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of the Split Formulation\n\nNext, we analyze the flux cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}$ for the system with the split reversible reaction. The cone is the set of non-negative flux vectors $v' = (v'_{T_f}, v'_{T_r}, v'_{R_1}, v'_{R_2}, v'_D)^T$ satisfying $S' v' = 0$.\nThe system of linear equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} v'_{T_f} \\\\ v'_{T_r} \\\\ v'_{R_1} \\\\ v'_{R_2} \\\\ v'_D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the following equations:\n$1.$ $v'_{T_f} - v'_{T_r} - v'_{R_1} = 0 \\implies v'_{R_1} = v'_{T_f} - v'_{T_r}$\n$2.$ $v'_{R_1} - v'_{R_2} = 0 \\implies v'_{R_1} = v'_{R_2}$\n$3.$ $v'_{R_2} - v'_D = 0 \\implies v'_{R_2} = v'_D$\n\nCombining these yields $v'_{R_1} = v'_{R_2} = v'_D = v'_{T_f} - v'_{T_r}$.\nThe rank of the $3 \\times 5$ matrix $S'$ is $3$. The dimension of its null space is $\\dim(\\ker(S')) = \\text{columns} - \\text{rank} = 5 - 3 = 2$. We can choose two free variables to parameterize the solution space. Let's choose $v'_{T_f} = k_1$ and $v'_{T_r} = k_2$, where $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A general vector in $\\ker(S')$ is:\n$$ v' = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 \\\\ k_2 \\\\ k_1-k_2 \\\\ k_1-k_2 \\\\ k_1-k_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe flux cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}$ requires all components of $v'$ to be non-negative: $v' \\ge 0$. This imposes the following inequalities on the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$:\n- $v'_{T_f} = k_1 \\geq 0$\n- $v'_{T_r} = k_2 \\geq 0$\n- $v'_{R_1} = k_1 - k_2 \\geq 0 \\implies k_1 \\ge k_2$\n- $v'_{R_2} = k_1 - k_2 \\geq 0$\n- $v'_D = k_1 - k_2 \\geq 0$\n\nThus, the cone is described by vectors of the form above, with parameters satisfying $k_1 \\ge k_2 \\ge 0$. This is a two-dimensional cone in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, whose extremal rays (EFMs) correspond to the boundaries of the feasible parameter region. The boundaries are given by $k_2=0$ and $k_1=k_2$.\n\nEFM 1: Let $k_2=0$ and $k_1=1$ (for normalization). This corresponds to the ray where only the forward transport is active.\n$$ e'_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis represents the pathway $X_{\\text{ext}} \\to X \\to A \\to B \\to \\emptyset$. Its support is $\\{T_f, R_1, R_2, D\\}$, which is a minimal set of reactions for a non-trivial steady-state flux.\n\nEFM 2: Let $k_1=k_2=1$. This corresponds to the ray where the internal pathway is inactive.\n$$ e'_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis represents the futile cycle $X_{\\text{ext}} \\to X \\to X_{\\text{ext}}$. Its support is $\\{T_f, T_r\\}$, which is also minimal.\n\nThe flux cone $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}$ is the set of all non-negative linear combinations of these two EFMs:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}} = \\{ c_1 e'_1 + c_2 e'_2 \\mid c_1 \\ge 0, c_2 \\ge 0 \\} $$\nThe generating vectors $e'_1$ and $e'_2$ are linearly independent. The dimension of the subspace spanned by these two vectors is $2$.\nTherefore, $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}) = 2$.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of the Change in Dimension\n\nThe change in the dimension of the flux cone is defined as $\\Delta = \\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}) - \\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}})$.\nUsing the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n- $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{orig}}) = 1$\n- $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{split}}) = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values, we compute $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\nThe splitting of one reversible reaction into two irreversible reactions increases the dimension of the flux cone by one. This additional dimension corresponds to the new futile cycle EFM that is created.",

The non-negativity condition for irreversible reactions: $v \\ge 0$ (i.e., $v_i \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$).\n\nThe given $3 \\times 6$ stoichiometric matrix is:\n$$\nS \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  +1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  +1  -1 \\\\\n+1  -1  -1  +1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0 \\\\\n\\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  +1  -1  -1  +1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe columns of $S$, denoted $c_i$, correspond to the reactions $(r_{1}^{\\mathrm{f}}, r_{1}^{\\mathrm{r}}, r_{2}^{\\mathrm{f}}, r_{2}^{\\mathrm{r}}, r_{3}^{\\mathrm{f}}, r_{3}^{\\mathrm{r}})$.\n\nFirst, we identify the EFMs of this network. EFMs are vectors in the flux cone that have minimal support. The support of a vector $v$ is the set of indices of its non-zero components, $\\mathrm{supp}(v) = \\{i | v_i \\neq 0\\}$. For a given EFM $e$, there are no two non-zero flux vectors $v_a, v_b$ such that $e = v_a + v_b$ and $\\mathrm{supp}(v_a) \\subset \\mathrm{supp}(e)$ and $\\mathrm{supp}(v_b) \\subset \\mathrm{supp}(e)$. For a simple network like this one, EFMs correspond to the minimal cycles.\n\nThe network consists of three reversible reactions forming a cycle: $\\mathrm{M}_1 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_2 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_3 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_1$. We can identify five minimal steady-state pathways (EFMs):\n\n$1$. The forward macro-cycle $\\mathrm{M}_1 \\to \\mathrm{M}_2 \\to \\mathrm{M}_3 \\to \\mathrm{M}_1$. This pathway uses reactions $r_{1}^{\\mathrm{f}}$, $r_{2}^{\\mathrm{f}}$, and $r_{3}^{\\mathrm{f}}$. The corresponding EFM, up to a positive scaling factor, is $e_1 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)^{\\top}$. This vector satisfies $S e_1 = c_1 + c_3 + c_5 = (-1, 1, 0)^{\\top} + (0, -1, 1)^{\\top} + (1, 0, -1)^{\\top} = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Its support is $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$, which is minimal.\n\n$2$. The backward macro-cycle $\\mathrm{M}_1 \\to \\mathrm{M}_3 \\to \\mathrm{M}_2 \\to \\mathrm{M}_1$. This pathway uses reactions $r_{3}^{\\mathrm{r}}$, $r_{2}^{\\mathrm{r}}$, and $r_{1}^{\\mathrm{r}}$. The corresponding EFM is $e_2 = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)^{\\top}$. This vector satisfies $S e_2 = c_2 + c_4 + c_6 = (1, -1, 0)^{\\top} + (0, 1, -1)^{\\top} + (-1, 0, 1)^{\\top} = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Its support is $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$, which is minimal.\n\n$3$. The futile cycle (or internal cycle) for the first reversible reaction $\\mathrm{M}_1 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_2$. This pathway uses reactions $r_{1}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $r_{1}^{\\mathrm{r}}$. The EFM is $e_3 = (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. This vector satisfies $S e_3 = c_1 + c_2 = (-1, 1, 0)^{\\top} + (1, -1, 0)^{\\top} = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Its support is $\\{1, 2\\}$, which is minimal.\n\n$4$. The futile cycle for the second reversible reaction $\\mathrm{M}_2 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_3$. This pathway uses reactions $r_{2}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $r_{2}^{\\mathrm{r}}$. The EFM is $e_4 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. This vector satisfies $S e_4 = c_3 + c_4 = (0, -1, 1)^{\\top} + (0, 1, -1)^{\\top} = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Its support is $\\{3, 4\\}$, which is minimal.\n\n$5$. The futile cycle for the third reversible reaction $\\mathrm{M}_3 \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{M}_1$. This pathway uses reactions $r_{3}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $r_{3}^{\\mathrm{r}}$. The EFM is $e_5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)^{\\top}$. This vector satisfies $S e_5 = c_5 + c_6 = (1, 0, -1)^{\\top} + (-1, 0, 1)^{\\top} = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Its support is $\\{5, 6\\}$, which is minimal.\n\nThus, the original flux cone possesses $5$ extreme rays (EFMs).\n\nNext, we introduce the thermodynamic constraint. The Gibbs free energy change for each reaction $i$ is $\\Delta G_i = \\mu^{\\top} c_i$, with the chemical potential vector given as $\\mu = (0, -1, 1)^{\\top}$. We calculate $\\Delta G_i$ for each of the $6$ reactions:\n- $\\Delta G_1 = \\mu^{\\top} c_1 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1$\n- $\\Delta G_2 = \\mu^{\\top} c_2 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = +1$\n- $\\Delta G_3 = \\mu^{\\top} c_3 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = +2$\n- $\\Delta G_4 = \\mu^{\\top} c_4 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -2$\n- $\\Delta G_5 = \\mu^{\\top} c_5 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -1$\n- $\\Delta G_6 = \\mu^{\\top} c_6 = (0, -1, 1) \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = +1$\n\nThe thermodynamic constraint requires $v_i \\Delta G_i \\le 0$ for each reaction $i$. Since all components $v_i$ of an EFM are non-negative ($v_i \\ge 0$), this constraint is violated if any reaction $i$ with a non-zero flux ($v_i  0$) has a positive Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G_i  0$).\nThe reactions with $\\Delta G_i  0$ are $r_{1}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ (reaction $2$), $r_{2}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ (reaction $3$), and $r_{3}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ (reaction $6$). Any EFM that utilizes any of these reactions is thermodynamically infeasible and is therefore eliminated.\n\nWe now check each EFM against this criterion:\n- $e_1 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)^{\\top}$: The active reactions are $1$, $3$, and $5$. For reaction $3$, $v_3=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_3 = +2  0$. This violates the thermodynamic constraint. Thus, $e_1$ is eliminated.\n- $e_2 = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)^{\\top}$: The active reactions are $2$, $4$, and $6$. For reaction $2$, $v_2=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_2 = +1  0$. For reaction $6$, $v_6=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_6 = +1  0$. Both violate the constraint. Thus, $e_2$ is eliminated.\n- $e_3 = (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$: The active reactions are $1$ and $2$. For reaction $2$, $v_2=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_2 = +1  0$. This violates the thermodynamic constraint. Thus, $e_3$ is eliminated.\n- $e_4 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$: The active reactions are $3$ and $4$. For reaction $3$, $v_3=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_3 = +2  0$. This violates the thermodynamic constraint. Thus, $e_4$ is eliminated.\n- $e_5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)^{\\top}$: The active reactions are $5$ and $6$. For reaction $6$, $v_6=1  0$ and $\\Delta G_6 = +1  0$. This violates the thermodynamic constraint. Thus, $e_5$ is eliminated.\n\nAll $5$ of the identified EFMs (extreme rays) are found to be thermodynamically infeasible. The imposition of the thermodynamic constraints eliminates every extreme ray of the original flux cone.\n\nThe number of extreme rays eliminated is $5$.",
