Assume a balanced population: each initial state carries mass $1/2$, and each terminal state requires mass $1/2$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to find a critical value $a^{\\star}$ for a parameter in a one-dimensional optimal transport problem. The setup involves two initial states at positions $x_{1} = 0$ and $x_{2} = 1$, each with an initial mass of $1/2$. These states evolve into two terminal states at positions $y_{1} = a$ and $y_{2} = 1 - a$, each requiring a final mass of $1/2$. The parameter $a$ is defined on the open interval $(0,1)$. The transport cost between an initial point $x_i$ and a terminal point $y_j$ is the squared Euclidean distance, $c_{ij} = (x_i - y_j)^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the entries of the $2 \\times 2$ cost matrix $C = (c_{ij})$:\n$c_{11} = (x_1 - y_1)^2 = (0 - a)^2 = a^2$\n$c_{12} = (x_1 - y_2)^2 = (0 - (1-a))^2 = (1-a)^2$\n$c_{21} = (x_2 - y_1)^2 = (1 - a)^2$\n$c_{22} = (x_2 - y_2)^2 = (1 - (1-a))^2 = a^2$\nThe cost matrix is therefore:\n$$ C = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & (1-a)^2 \\\\ (1-a)^2 & a^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe problem is to find a coupling matrix $\\gamma = (\\gamma_{ij})$ that minimizes the total transport cost, which is given by the linear objective function $C(\\gamma) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_{ij} \\gamma_{ij}$. The coupling $\\gamma$ must satisfy a set of constraints defining a balanced transport plan:\n1. Non-negativity: $\\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n2. Row sum constraints (mass conservation at sources):\n   $\\gamma_{11} + \\gamma_{12} = 1/2$\n   $\\gamma_{21} + \\gamma_{22} = 1/2$\n3. Column sum constraints (mass conservation at targets):\n   $\\gamma_{11} + \\gamma_{21} = 1/2$\n   $\\gamma_{12} + \\gamma_{22} = 1/2$\n\nThese four linear equality constraints on the four variables $\\gamma_{ij}$ are not independent. The space of feasible couplings can be parameterized by a single variable. Let us set $\\gamma_{11} = \\epsilon$.\nFrom the first row constraint, $\\gamma_{12} = 1/2 - \\epsilon$.\nFrom the first column constraint, $\\gamma_{21} = 1/2 - \\epsilon$.\nFrom the second row constraint, $\\gamma_{22} = 1/2 - \\gamma_{21} = 1/2 - (1/2 - \\epsilon) = \\epsilon$.\nThis is consistent with the second column constraint: $\\gamma_{12} + \\gamma_{22} = (1/2 - \\epsilon) + \\epsilon = 1/2$.\nSo, any feasible coupling matrix can be expressed as:\n$$ \\gamma(\\epsilon) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon & \\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon & \\epsilon \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe non-negativity constraint $\\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$ implies that $\\epsilon \\ge 0$ and $1/2 - \\epsilon \\ge 0$, which restricts $\\epsilon$ to the closed interval $[0, 1/2]$.\n\nThe total cost can now be written as a function of $\\epsilon$:\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} \\gamma_{ij}(\\epsilon) = c_{11}\\epsilon + c_{12}(\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon) + c_{21}(\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon) + c_{22}\\epsilon $$\nSubstituting the cost values:\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = a^2 \\epsilon + (1-a)^2 (\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon) + (1-a)^2 (\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon) + a^2 \\epsilon $$\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = 2a^2 \\epsilon + 2(1-a)^2 (\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon) = 2a^2 \\epsilon + (1-a)^2 - 2(1-a)^2 \\epsilon $$\n$$ C(\\epsilon) = [2a^2 - 2(1-a)^2] \\epsilon + (1-a)^2 $$\nThis is a linear function of $\\epsilon$. Let's analyze the coefficient of $\\epsilon$, which determines the slope of this function:\n$$ \\text{Slope} = 2a^2 - 2(1-a)^2 = 2(a^2 - (1-2a+a^2)) = 2(a^2 - 1 + 2a - a^2) = 2(2a - 1) $$\nThe total cost function is $C(\\epsilon) = 2(2a - 1)\\epsilon + (1-a)^2$.\nTo find the optimal coupling, we must minimize this linear function over the feasible domain $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1/2]$. The minimum of a linear function on a closed interval occurs at an endpoint, unless the function is constant.\n\nCase 1: The slope is positive. $2(2a - 1) > 0 \\implies 2a > 1 \\implies a > 1/2$.\nIn this case, $C(\\epsilon)$ is minimized at the lower bound of the domain, $\\epsilon = 0$. The optimizer is unique, $\\epsilon^{\\star} = 0$, giving the coupling $\\gamma^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to a deterministic plan (an off-diagonal permutation) where $x_1 \\to y_2$ and $x_2 \\to y_1$.\n\nCase 2: The slope is negative. $2(2a - 1) < 0 \\implies 2a < 1 \\implies a < 1/2$.\nIn this case, $C(\\epsilon)$ is minimized at the upper bound of the domain, $\\epsilon = 1/2$. The optimizer is unique, $\\epsilon^{\\star} = 1/2$, giving the coupling $\\gamma^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This also corresponds to a deterministic plan (a diagonal permutation) where $x_1 \\to y_1$ and $x_2 \\to y_2$.\n\nCase 3: The slope is zero. $2(2a - 1) = 0 \\implies 2a = 1 \\implies a = 1/2$.\nIn this case, the cost function $C(\\epsilon) = (1-1/2)^2 = 1/4$ becomes constant for all $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1/2]$. Thus, any feasible coupling $\\gamma(\\epsilon)$ is an optimal plan. This includes the two deterministic plans at the endpoints ($\\epsilon=0$ and $\\epsilon=1/2$) as well as a continuum of \"split couplings\" for any $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1/2)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical value $a^{\\star}$ at which the optimal plan ceases to be uniquely induced by a single map. For $a \\neq 1/2$, the optimal plan is unique and deterministic. At $a=1/2$, the optimal plan becomes non-unique and admits non-deterministic solutions (split couplings). Therefore, this transition point is the critical value we seek.\n$$ a^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2} $$",

The objective function is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\gamma) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^n \\gamma_{ij} c_{ij} - \\varepsilon H(\\gamma) + \\tau \\mathrm{KL}(\\gamma \\mathbf{1}_n | a) + \\tau \\mathrm{KL}(\\gamma^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_m | b) $$\nHere, $c_{ij}$ is the ground cost, $\\varepsilon > 0$ is the entropic regularization parameter, $\\tau > 0$ is the relaxation parameter for the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence penalty, $H(\\gamma) = -\\sum_{ij} \\gamma_{ij}(\\log \\gamma_{ij} - 1)$ is the entropy, and $\\gamma \\mathbf{1}_n$ and $\\gamma^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_m$ are the marginals of the plan $\\gamma$.\n\nThe solution to this minimization problem has a specific structure: $\\gamma_{ij} = u_i K_{ij} v_j$, or in matrix form, $\\gamma = \\mathrm{diag}(u) K \\mathrm{diag}(v)$, where $u \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{m}$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ are positive scaling vectors and $K$ is the Gibbs kernel, defined as $K_{ij} = \\exp(-c_{ij}/\\varepsilon)$. The scaling vectors $u$ and $v$ are found by iterating a set of fixed-point update rules, an approach known as the generalized Sinkhorn algorithm.\n\nThe solution process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute the Cost Matrix and Gibbs Kernel**:\n    First, we construct the cost matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$. The cost $c_{ij}$ represents the effort to move a unit of mass from state $x_i$ to state $y_j$. As specified, the cost is the squared Euclidean distance: $c_{ij} = (x_i - y_j)^2$. Given the one-dimensional supports $x = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{5}$ and $y = \\{y_j\\}_{j=1}^{5}$, this is computed for all pairs $(i, j)$.\n    Next, the Gibbs kernel $K$ is computed from the cost matrix $C$ and the entropic regularization parameter $\\varepsilon$:\n    $$ K_{ij} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{c_{ij}}{\\varepsilon}\\right) $$\n    The kernel $K$ transforms the costs into similarities, where larger costs result in smaller kernel entries.\n\n2.  **Generalized Sinkhorn Iterations**:\n    The core of the solution is to find the scaling vectors $u$ and $v$. We initialize them, for instance, as vectors of ones. The vectors are then updated iteratively until they converge. The update rules, as given in the problem, are derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the UOT optimization problem:\n    $$ u \\leftarrow \\left(\\frac{a}{K v}\\right)^{\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau + \\varepsilon}} $$\n    $$ v \\leftarrow \\left(\\frac{b}{K^{\\top} u}\\right)^{\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau + \\varepsilon}} $$\n    In these expressions, $Kv$ and $K^{\\top}u$ are matrix-vector products, divisions are performed elementwise, and the exponent is applied elementwise to the resulting vectors. It is convenient to pre-compute the exponent $p = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau + \\varepsilon}$. The iterations continue until the change between successive updates of a scaling vector (e.g., the relative L2-norm of the difference) falls below a predefined tolerance, or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n3.  **Compute Final Quantities**:\n    Upon convergence of $u$ and $v$, the optimal transport plan $\\gamma$ is implicitly defined. We do not need to construct this potentially large matrix explicitly. Instead, we can directly compute its row and column sums (the plan's marginals).\n    The mass leaving the source states is the vector $s = \\gamma \\mathbf{1}_n = u \\odot (K v)$, where $\\odot$ denotes elementwise (Hadamard) product.\n    The mass arriving at the target states is the vector $t = \\gamma^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_m = v \\odot (K^{\\top} u)$.\n    The total mass transported by the plan, $M$, is the sum of all elements in $\\gamma$, which is equivalent to summing the elements of either marginal: $M = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} s_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j$.\n\n    With the total transported mass $M$ computed, we can quantify the mass creation and destruction as relative fractions:\n    -   The fraction of mass created, relative to the total mass of the source distribution $a$, is:\n        $$ f_{\\mathrm{create,source}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{M - \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i}\\right) $$\n    -   The fraction of mass destroyed, relative to the total mass of the target distribution $b$, is:\n        $$ f_{\\mathrm{destroy,target}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} b_j - M}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} b_j}\\right) $$\n    These formulas capture the net change in mass facilitated by the transport plan.\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each of the three provided test cases, which differ in their parameters and state locations, to obtain the final results.",
