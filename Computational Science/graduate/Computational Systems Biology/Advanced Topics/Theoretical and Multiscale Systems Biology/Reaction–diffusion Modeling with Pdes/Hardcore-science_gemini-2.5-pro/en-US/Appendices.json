            "solution": "The problem presented is a classic initial value problem for the one-dimensional diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation. The task is to find the time-evolving concentration profile $c(x,t)$ given a Gaussian initial condition, and then to compute the time evolution of the variance of this distribution.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is in order.\nThe givens are:\n- The governing partial differential equation (PDE): $\\partial_t c = D \\partial_{xx} c$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $t > 0$.\n- The constant diffusivity: $D>0$.\n- The initial condition: $c(x,0) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_0^2}\\right)$, where $M>0$ is the total amount and $\\sigma_0^2>0$ is the initial variance.\n- The boundary condition: $c(x,t) \\to 0$ as $|x|\\to\\infty$.\n- The definitions for the mean $\\mu(t)$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(t)$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes Fickian diffusion, a fundamental physical process. It is mathematically well-posed: the diffusion equation with a smooth, rapidly decaying initial condition on an infinite domain has a unique, stable solution. The problem is self-contained, objective, and free of any contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe most efficient method for solving this linear PDE on an infinite domain is the Fourier transform. Let $\\hat{c}(k,t)$ be the spatial Fourier transform of $c(x,t)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{c(x,t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} c(x,t) \\exp(-ikx) \\, dx\n$$\nApplying the Fourier transform to the PDE $\\partial_t c = D \\partial_{xx} c$, we use the property that the transform of a spatial derivative $\\partial_x$ corresponds to multiplication by $ik$ in the Fourier domain.\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{\\partial_t c(x,t)\\} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\hat{c}(k,t)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{D \\partial_{xx} c(x,t)\\} = D (ik)^2 \\hat{c}(k,t) = -Dk^2 \\hat{c}(k,t)\n$$\nThe PDE is thus transformed into a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for each wave number $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{c}}{dt} = -Dk^2 \\hat{c}(k,t)\n$$\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,t) = \\hat{c}(k,0) \\exp(-Dk^2 t)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{c}(k,0)$ is the Fourier transform of the initial condition $c(x,0)$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\hat{c}(k,0)$. The initial condition is a Gaussian function:\n$$\nc(x,0) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_0^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe Fourier transform of a general Gaussian function $A \\exp(-ax^2)$ is $A \\sqrt{\\pi/a} \\exp(-k^2/(4a))$. In our case, $A = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2}}$ and $a = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_0^2}$.\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,0) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2}} \\sqrt{\\pi \\Big/ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_0^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{4 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_0^2}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,0) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2}} \\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 \\sigma_0^2}{2}\\right) = M \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 \\sigma_0^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\hat{c}(k,t)$:\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,t) = M \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 \\sigma_0^2}{2}\\right) \\exp(-Dk^2 t) = M \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{2}(\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt)\\right)\n$$\nTo find $c(x,t)$, we perform the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{c}(k,t)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{c}(k,t) \\exp(ikx) \\, dk\n$$\nThe function $\\hat{c}(k,t)$ is a Gaussian in $k$. Using the standard inverse Fourier transform pair, $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{ \\exp(-bk^2) \\} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi b}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4b}\\right)$, with the constant $M$ as a prefactor.\nHere, we identify $b = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt}{2}$.\n$$\nc(x,t) = M \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt}{2}\\right)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt}{2}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the solution for the concentration field:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi (\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2(\\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt)}\\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that a Gaussian initial profile remains Gaussian under diffusion, with its variance increasing linearly in time.\n\nNow, we proceed to calculate the mean $\\mu(t)$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(t)$.\nThe mean is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu(t) = \\frac{1}{M}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\, c(x,t)\\, dx\n$$\nThe function $c(x,t)$ is an even function of $x$ for all $t \\ge 0$, since $x$ appears only as $x^2$. The integrand $x c(x,t)$ is therefore an odd function of $x$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric domain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is zero. Thus,\n$$\n\\mu(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0.\n$$\nThe variance is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{1}{M}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\big(x-\\mu(t)\\big)^2\\, c(x,t)\\, dx\n$$\nSince $\\mu(t)=0$, this simplifies to the second moment of the normalized concentration profile:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{1}{M}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t)\\, dx\n$$\nThe distribution $p(x,t) = \\frac{c(x,t)}{M}$ is a probability density function, specifically a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2(t) = \\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt$. By definition, the integral we are computing is the variance of this distribution. Therefore, we can immediately identify the result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt\n$$\nFor completeness, we can verify this by direct integration:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2(t)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2(t)}\\right) dx\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma^2(t) = \\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2(t)}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2(t)}\\right) dx\n$$\nThe integral is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2a}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. Here, $a = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2(t)}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2(t)}\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2(t)}\\right)} \\sqrt{\\pi \\Big/ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2(t)}} = \\sigma^2(t) \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2(t)}} \\left( \\sigma^2(t) \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2(t)} \\right) = \\sigma^2(t)\n$$\nThus, we confirm that $\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\sigma_0^2 + 2Dt$. This linear growth of variance is a hallmark of normal diffusion.\n\nThe problem asks for a single closed-form expression for $c(x,t)$ as the final answer.",

The concepts of Fickian diffusion, first-order decay, and constant flux boundary conditions are fundamental and well-established principles in physics, chemistry, and mathematical biology. The model is a standard representation of morphogen gradient formation. This criterion is met.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem seeks a steady-state solution to a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (the time-independent reaction-diffusion equation). A unique solution requires two boundary conditions. The problem provides two: a Neumann condition (flux) at $x=0$ and a Dirichlet condition at $x \\to \\infty$. These conditions are sufficient and appropriate for the semi-infinite domain, ensuring a unique and stable solution exists.

There are no missing pieces of information or internal contradictions. This criterion is met.\n- **Realism and Feasibility:** The setup is a widely used and scientifically plausible model for biological pattern formation. The parameters are positive constants, which is physically realistic. This criterion is met.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, vagueness, triviality). It is a standard, well-defined problem in the field of computational systems biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation for the morphogen in an arbitrary control volume. Consider a small one-dimensional segment of the tissue from $x$ to $x+\\Delta x$ with a constant cross-sectional area $A$. The total amount of the morphogen in this volume is $\\int_x^{x+\\Delta x} c(x',t) A dx'$. The rate of change of this amount is given by the balance of fluxes at the boundaries and the total rate of degradation within the volume.\n\nLet $J(x,t)$ be the diffusive flux (amount per unit area per unit time). The rate of change of the morphogen amount is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_x^{x+\\Delta x} c(x',t) A dx' = A J(x,t) - A J(x+\\Delta x, t) - \\int_x^{x+\\Delta x} \\mu c(x',t) A dx' $$\nDividing by $A \\Delta x$ and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus in the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} - \\mu c $$\nThis is the general one-dimensional continuity equation with a first-order reaction term.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux $J(x,t)$ is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$ J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting this into the continuity equation, and assuming the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant, we obtain the governing reaction-diffusion PDE:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\mu c $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu c $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, $c(x)$, which is the solution when the system no longer changes in time. This implies $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\mu c = 0 $$\nThis can be rewritten in a standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\mu}{D} c = 0 $$\nLet us define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/\\mu}$ or, equivalently, a characteristic wavenumber $k = \\sqrt{\\mu/D}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - k^2 c = 0 $$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - k^2 = 0$, which has two distinct real roots, $r_1 = k$ and $r_2 = -k$. The general solution is therefore a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$ c(x) = C_1 \\exp(kx) + C_2 \\exp(-kx) $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  A constant inward source flux $J_0$ at $x=0$. The flux is given by $J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$. An inward flux means it is directed in the positive $x$ direction, so $J(0) = J_0$. This gives the boundary condition:\n    $$ -D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=0} = J_0 $$\n2.  The concentration vanishes in the far field:\n    $$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} c(x) = 0 $$\n\nWe apply these conditions to the general solution. First, applying the far-field condition:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left[ C_1 \\exp(kx) + C_2 \\exp(-kx) \\right] = 0 $$\nSince $k = \\sqrt{\\mu/D} > 0$, the term $\\exp(kx)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$, while the term $\\exp(-kx)$ decays to zero. For the limit to be zero, the coefficient of the growing exponential term must be zero. Thus, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$ c(x) = C_2 \\exp(-kx) $$\nNow, we apply the flux condition at $x=0$. We first compute the derivative of $c(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ C_2 \\exp(-kx) \\right] = -k C_2 \\exp(-kx) $$\nEvaluating this derivative at $x=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=0} = -k C_2 \\exp(0) = -k C_2 $$\nSubstituting this into the flux boundary condition equation:\n$$ -D(-k C_2) = J_0 $$\n$$ D k C_2 = J_0 $$\nSolving for the remaining constant $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{J_0}{Dk} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_2$ back into the solution for $c(x)$:\n$$ c(x) = \\frac{J_0}{Dk} \\exp(-kx) $$\nFinally, we substitute back the definition of $k = \\sqrt{\\mu/D}$:\n$$ c(x) = \\frac{J_0}{D \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{D}}} \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{D}}\\right) $$\nThe pre-exponential factor can be simplified:\n$$ \\frac{J_0}{D \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{D}}} = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{D^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{D}}} = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{D^2 \\frac{\\mu}{D}}} = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{D\\mu}} $$\nThus, the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$ c(x) = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{D\\mu}} \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{D}}\\right) $$\nThis expression describes an exponential decay of the morphogen concentration with distance from the source, with a characteristic length scale of $\\sqrt{D/\\mu}$.",

Let $u_j(t)$ be the approximation of $u(x_j, t)$. Using a second-order central difference for the Laplacian, we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{d u_j}{d t} = D \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{h^2} \\right) + f(u_j)\n$$\nwhere $f(u) = r u (1 - u/K)$ is the nonlinear reaction term.

Linear Stability Analysis\nThe analysis is performed around the homogeneous steady state $u^{*} = K$. Let $u_j^n = u^{*} + v_j^n = K + v_j^n$, where $v_j^n$ is a small perturbation. The reaction term $f(u)$ is linearized around $u=K$:\n$$\nf(u) \\approx f(K) + f'(K)(u-K)\n$$\nWe have $f(K) = r K (1 - K/K) = 0$. The derivative is $f'(u) = r - \\frac{2ru}{K}$. At $u=K$, $f'(K) = r - \\frac{2rK}{K} = -r$. Thus, the linearized reaction term is $f(K+v_j^n) \\approx -r v_j^n$.\n\nSubstituting the perturbation $u_j^n = K + v_j^n$ into the IMEX scheme and using the linearized reaction term gives the equation for the perturbation:\n$$\n\\frac{v_j^{n+1} - v_j^n}{\\Delta t} = D \\left( \\frac{v_{j+1}^{n+1} - 2v_j^{n+1} + v_{j-1}^{n+1}}{h^2} \\right) - r v_j^n\n$$\nTo analyze stability, we use a discrete Fourier (von Neumann) analysis. We consider a single spatial mode of the form $v_j^n = g^n e^{i k x_j}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $g$ is the amplification factor for one time step. Substituting this into the perturbation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{g^{n+1} e^{i k j h} - g^n e^{i k j h}}{\\Delta t} = D \\frac{g^{n+1} e^{i k (j+1) h} - 2 g^{n+1} e^{i k j h} + g^{n+1} e^{i k (j-1) h}}{h^2} - r g^n e^{i k j h}\n$$\nDividing by $g^n e^{i k j h}$:\n$$\n\\frac{g - 1}{\\Delta t} = g \\frac{D}{h^2} \\left( e^{i k h} - 2 + e^{-i k h} \\right) - r\n$$\nUsing the identity $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2 \\cos(\\theta)$, the term in parentheses becomes $2 \\cos(kh) - 2 = -2(1 - \\cos(kh)) = -4 \\sin^2(kh/2)$.\n$$\ng - 1 = -g \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right) - r \\Delta t\n$$\nSolving for the amplification factor $g$:\n$$\ng \\left( 1 + \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right) \\right) = 1 - r \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\ng(k) = \\frac{1 - r \\Delta t}{1 + \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nFor a stable scheme, we require $|g(k)| \\leq 1$ for all permissible wavenumbers $k$. The Neumann boundary conditions on a finite domain of length $L=Nh$ allow discrete wavenumbers $k_m = \\frac{m \\pi}{L}$ for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. The term $kh/2$ becomes $k_m h / 2 = \\frac{m \\pi h}{2 L} = \\frac{m \\pi}{2 N}$. Let's denote the amplification factor for mode $m$ as $g_m$.\n\nThe denominator is $1 + \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N})$. Since $D, \\Delta t, h$ are positive, this denominator is always $\\geq 1$.\nThe condition $g_m \\leq 1$ requires $\\frac{1 - r \\Delta t}{1 + \\dots} \\leq 1$. As the denominator is $\\geq 1$, this simplifies to $1 - r \\Delta t \\leq 1 + \\dots$, or $-r \\Delta t \\leq (\\text{a positive term})$, which is always true for $r>0, \\Delta t>0$.\n\nThe critical condition for stability is $g_m \\geq -1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - r \\Delta t}{1 + \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N}\\right)} \\geq -1\n$$\nSince the denominator is positive, we can multiply across:\n$$\n1 - r \\Delta t \\geq -1 - \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n2 \\geq r \\Delta t - \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n2 \\geq \\Delta t \\left( r - \\frac{4 D}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all modes $m = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. The \"worst-case spatial mode\" is the one that imposes the most stringent (smallest) upper bound on $\\Delta t$. This occurs when the expression in the parentheses, let's call it $\\Phi(m)$, is maximized.\n$$\n\\Phi(m) = r - \\frac{4 D}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N}\\right)\n$$\nThe function $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is non-negative and is minimized at $\\theta=0$. The term $\\sin^2(\\frac{m \\pi}{2N})$ is minimized for $m=0$, where it equals $0$.\nTherefore, $\\Phi(m)$ is maximized at $m=0$:\n$$\n\\max_{m} \\Phi(m) = \\Phi(0) = r - \\frac{4 D}{h^2} \\sin^2(0) = r\n$$\nThe worst-case mode is the spatially uniform mode ($m=0$, $k=0$), for which diffusion has no effect. The stability condition is determined solely by the explicit treatment of the reaction term. Substituting $\\Phi(0)=r$ into the stability inequality gives the tightest constraint:\n$$\n2 \\geq \\Delta t \\cdot r\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{r}\n$$\nThe maximum allowed time step is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}} = 2/r$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}}$\nGiven the parameter $r = 2.1 \\times 10^{-2}$ $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{2}{2.1 \\times 10^{-2}} \\, \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{200}{2.1} \\, \\mathrm{s} \\approx 95.238095... \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx 95.24 \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe other parameters ($D, K, L, h$) do not affect the linear stability limit of this specific IMEX scheme, as the bottleneck is the explicit treatment of the reaction term for the zero-wavenumber mode.",
