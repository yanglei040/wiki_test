The solution proceeds in five steps: first, we determine the deterministic steady state; second, we compute the Jacobian matrix $A$; third, we compute the diffusion matrix $D$; fourth, we solve the stationary Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix $C$; and finally, we use the results to calculate the desired quantities.\n\nStep 1: Determine the deterministic steady state $x^{\\ast}$.\nThe deterministic rate equations for the mean concentrations are given by the expression $\\frac{dx}{dt} = S \\nu(x)$, where $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X} \\\\ x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the state vector of molecular counts, $S$ is the stoichiometry matrix, and $\\nu(x)$ is the propensity vector.\n\nWriting this out explicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X} \\\\ x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k_{0} \\\\ \\gamma_{1} x_{X} \\\\ k_{12} x_{X} \\\\ \\gamma_{2} x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_{0} - \\gamma_{1} x_{X} - k_{12} x_{X} \\\\ k_{12} x_{X} - \\gamma_{2} x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{X}}{dt} = k_{0} - (\\gamma_{1} + k_{12})x_{X}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{Y}}{dt} = k_{12}x_{X} - \\gamma_{2}x_{Y}\n$$\nThe steady state $x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X}^{\\ast} \\\\ x_{Y}^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix}$ is found by setting the time derivatives to zero.

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the expression levels of two independent reporter genes in the same cell.\n- In the extrinsic model, both genes are subject to the same extrinsic variable $\\lambda$. Thus, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are conditionally independent given $\\lambda$, but they are correlated across the population. Their covariance is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1|\\lambda], \\mathbb{E}[X_2|\\lambda]) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\lambda, \\lambda) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) $$\nThe correlation coefficient $\\rho = \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X_1)\\mathrm{Var}(X_2)}$ is:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)} $$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) > 0$ for there to be any extrinsic noise, the correlation is strictly positive, $\\rho > 0$.\n- In the intrinsic model, the stochastic bursting of the two independent reporters is uncorrelated. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = 0$ and $\\rho = 0$.\nThis difference in predicted correlation provides a clear experimental signature.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-lognormal mixture...**\n- **Extrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $\\lambda \\sim \\mathrm{LogNormal}(\\mu_\\ell, \\sigma_\\ell^2)$ with $\\sigma_\\ell^2 = \\log(1 + 1/r)$ and $\\mu_\\ell = \\log(\\mu) - \\sigma_\\ell^2/2$. For a lognormal distribution, the mean is $e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2}$ and the variance is $(e^{\\sigma_\\ell^2}-1)(e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2})^2$.\n  - Mean: $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = e^{(\\log(\\mu) - \\sigma_\\ell^2/2) + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2} = e^{\\log(\\mu)} = \\mu$. This is correct.\n  - Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) = (e^{\\log(1+1/r)}-1)(\\mu)^2 = ((1+1/r)-1)\\mu^2 = \\mu^2/r$. This is also correct. The parameterization correctly matches the required moments.\n- **Intrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $r \\equiv \\alpha/\\gamma$ and $b \\equiv \\mu/r$. This implies $\\mu = rb$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = 1/\\mu + 1/r$, which is the standard, correct formulation.\n- **Distinguishability:** The extrinsic model is a Poisson-Lognormal mixture, while the intrinsic model is a Negative Binomial distribution. These are different distributions, so they will differ in higher-order moments, satisfying the problem's condition.\n- **Experimental Strategy:** The two-color dual-reporter assay is the correct method. The analysis correctly predicts that for the extrinsic model, the correlation $\\rho$ is strictly positive, while for the intrinsic model, $\\rho \\approx 0$. Let's check the formula for $\\rho$. The option claims $\\rho = \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)/[\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)+\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda]]$, which aligns with our derivation $\\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}$. It then substitutes the matched parameters to get $\\rho = (\\mu/r)/[1 + \\mu/r]$. Let's verify this step: $\\rho = \\frac{\\mu^2/r}{\\mu + \\mu^2/r} = \\frac{\\mu/r}{1 + \\mu/r}$. The final formula is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. All parts of this option are consistent with first principles.\n\n**B. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-gamma mixture...**\n- It is a known mathematical result that a Poisson-Gamma mixture distribution is a Negative Binomial distribution. The intrinsic bursting model also follows a Negative Binomial distribution. By matching the mean and variance (or mean and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$), the two models become mathematically identical, producing the exact same Negative Binomial distribution. This violates the problem's requirement that the models \"differ in higher-order moments\". Furthermore, the proposed experimental strategy is to \"measure the Fano factor alone; a difference in $F$ is expected\". This is incorrect. The Fano factor is $F = \\mu \\cdot \\mathrm{CV}^2$. Since both $\\mu$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$ are matched by construction, the Fano factors must be identical.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Extrinsic heterogeneity is introduced by making the degradation rate $\\gamma$ log-normally distributed...**\n- This option's proposed experimental strategy is to \"quantify only the mean $\\mu$ across the population; a difference in means is expected\". This directly contradicts a fundamental premise of the problem, which is to construct two models that share the same population mean $\\mu$. The entire point is to find a way to distinguish models that are indistinguishable at the level of the mean and variance.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-lognormal mixture with $\\sigma_\\ell^2 = \\log(1 + \\mu)$ and $\\mu_\\ell = \\log(\\mu)$...**\n- **Extrinsic Model Parameterization:** The proposed parameters give a mean for $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2} = e^{\\log(\\mu) + \\log(1+\\mu)/2} = \\mu\\sqrt{1+\\mu} \\neq \\mu$. The parameterization fails to match the mean.\n- **Intrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $b \\equiv r/\\mu$. This would give a mean of $\\mathbb{E}[X] = rb = r(r/\\mu) = r^2/\\mu$, which is not equal to $\\mu$ in general. The correct relation is $b = \\mu/r$.\n- **Experimental Strategy:** The proposal is to measure the \"autocorrelation at zero lag only\".

            "introduction": "Cells in a real population are not static but are dynamically progressing through the cell cycle, a factor that significantly impacts gene expression noise. This advanced problem tackles this complexity by modeling how gene dosage doubling during the S-phase and subsequent partitioning at mitosis shape the noise statistics measured in a typical snapshot experiment . This practice provides a rigorous framework for understanding how population structure and non-stationary single-cell dynamics combine to create the observed cell-to-cell variability.",

            "problem": "Consider a constitutive messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcription-degradation process in a single gene that undergoes gene dosage doubling exactly once per cell cycle during a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis phase (S-phase). Model the mRNA count as a continuous-time birth-death process with time-dependent immigration (birth) rate due solely to gene copy number changes, and linear first-order degradation. Assume the following scientifically standard foundations:\n\n1. The process is an immigration-death Markov process: if $m(t)$ is the mRNA copy number at time $t$, births occur at rate $\\alpha(t)$ and deaths occur at rate $\\gamma \\, m(t)$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is the degradation rate constant. The chemical master equation implies moment dynamics\n   - $\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\,\\mathbb{E}[m(t)] = \\alpha(t) - \\gamma \\,\\mathbb{E}[m(t)]$,\n   - $\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\,\\mathrm{Var}[m(t)] = \\alpha(t) + \\gamma \\,\\mathbb{E}[m(t)] - 2 \\gamma \\,\\mathrm{Var}[m(t)]$,\n   where $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ denotes expectation and $\\mathrm{Var}[\\cdot]$ denotes variance.\n2. Gene dosage doubling is modeled as a piecewise-constant birth rate over each cell cycle of duration $T$: for $t$ within a cycle,\n   - for $0 \\le t < \\phi_S T$, there is one gene copy with $\\alpha(t) = k$,\n   - for $\\phi_S T \\le t < T$, there are two gene copies with $\\alpha(t) = 2k$,\n   where $0 \\le \\phi_S \\le 1$ is the S-phase onset fraction and $k > 0$ is the per-copy transcription rate. Thus, $\\alpha(t)$ is a known periodic function with period $T$.\n3. At cell division ($t = T$), molecules are partitioned into the focal daughter cell via independent binomial partitioning with success probability $p = 1/2$ for each molecule. Therefore, if $M_T$ is the pre-division count, then the post-division count $M_0$ satisfies $M_0 \\,|\\, M_T \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(M_T, p)$, which induces the boundary conditions on the first two moments:\n   - $\\mathbb{E}[M_0] = p \\,\\mathbb{E}[M_T]$,\n   - $\\mathrm{Var}[M_0] = p^2 \\,\\mathrm{Var}[M_T] + p(1-p)\\,\\mathbb{E}[M_T]$.\n4. The population is asynchronous and sampled uniformly in cell age on $[0,T)$ for a snapshot measurement. Thus, the snapshot mean is the time-average of the age-conditional mean over one cell cycle, and the snapshot second moment is the time-average of the age-conditional second moment over one cell cycle. The snapshot variance is the time-average of the age-conditional second moment minus the square of the snapshot mean.\n\nYour task is to compute, for a given parameter set $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S)$, the snapshot Fano factor $F$ and the coefficient of variation squared (CV$^2$) of the mRNA count distribution across cells in the asynchronous snapshot. Use the following precise definitions, with all sampling in time uniform on $[0,T)$:\n- The Fano factor $F$ is defined as $F = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{snap}}[m]}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{snap}}[m]}$.\n- The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{snap}}[m]}}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{snap}}[m]}$. Report $\\mathrm{CV}^2$.\n\nWork from the fundamental bases above. In particular, you must:\n- Enforce the cyclo-stationary condition across generations via the binomial boundary mapping at division and the piecewise-constant dynamics within the cycle.\n- Derive the time evolution of the first two moments within each piecewise-constant segment of $\\alpha(t)$.\n- Compute the snapshot mean and snapshot second moment by integrating the age-conditional moments over one cycle.\n- From these, compute the snapshot variance, the Fano factor $F$, and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$.\n\nPhysical and numerical units:\n- Use $k$ in molecules per minute, $\\gamma$ in per minute, and $T$ in minutes. The outputs $F$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$ are dimensionless.\n- Report each floating-point result rounded to exactly six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nCompute results for the following parameter sets $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S)$, each with binomial partition probability $p = 1/2$:\n- Case A (happy path, fast degradation): $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S) = (5.0, 1.0, 60.0, 0.5)$.\n- Case B (slow degradation, strong cell-cycle memory): $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S) = (2.0, 0.05, 60.0, 0.5)$.\n- Case C (doubling at birth limit): $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S) = (2.0, 1.0, 60.0, 0.0)$.\n- Case D (doubling extremely late): $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S) = (2.0, 1.0, 60.0, 0.99)$.\n- Case E (no doubling within the cycle, control): $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S) = (2.0, 1.0, 60.0, 1.0)$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list of floats enclosed in square brackets. For each case, output two numbers in order: first the Fano factor $F$, then $\\mathrm{CV}^2$. Aggregate all cases in the order A, B, C, D, E into one flat list. For example, the format is $[F_A,\\mathrm{CV}^2_A,F_B,\\mathrm{CV}^2_B,F_C,\\mathrm{CV}^2_C,F_D,\\mathrm{CV}^2_D,F_E,\\mathrm{CV}^2_E]$, with each value rounded to exactly six decimal places and no additional text.",
            "solution": "We begin from the immigration-death model with time-dependent immigration rate $\\alpha(t)$ and first-order degradation rate $\\gamma$.

For the mean, we use an integrating factor $e^{\\gamma t}$. For the variance, note that the variance ODE is linear with an inhomogeneous term $\\alpha + \\gamma \\mu(t)$; substituting the known $\\mu(t)$ yields a superposition of exponentials, which integrates explicitly.\n\nCell division boundary conditions are induced by binomial partitioning. If $M_T$ is the random count immediately prior to division and $M_0$ is the daughter’s count after division, the binomial thinning with success probability $p = 1/2$ gives the mapping on moments:\n$$\n\\mu(0^+) = \\mathbb{E}[M_0] = p\\,\\mathbb{E}[M_T] = p\\,\\mu(T^-),\n$$\n$$\nv(0^+) = \\mathrm{Var}[M_0] = p^2 \\,\\mathrm{Var}[M_T] + p(1-p)\\,\\mathbb{E}[M_T] = p^2 v(T^-) + p(1-p)\\,\\mu(T^-).\n$$\nWe seek the cyclo-stationary solution in which the distribution (and its moments) are periodic across cycles.

The two segments have constant birth rates $\\alpha_1 = k$ and $\\alpha_2 = 2k$, respectively. Let $\\mu_b$ and $v_b$ denote the birth moments at $t=0^+$, and $\\mu_T$ and $v_T$ the pre-division moments at $t=T^-$. Propagating the moments across the two segments yields linear-affine relations:\n- The mean across the full cycle can be written\n$$\n\\mu_T = A\\,\\mu_b + c, \\quad A \\equiv e^{-\\gamma T}, \\quad c \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\gamma}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t_1}\\right)e^{-\\gamma t_2} + \\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\gamma}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t_2}\\right).\n$$\nThis follows from composing the mean solution over segment $1$ (length $t_1$) and segment $2$ (length $t_2$).\n- The variance across the full cycle can be expressed as\n$$\nv_T = B\\,v_b + E\\,\\mu_b + F,\n$$\nwith $B \\equiv e^{-2\\gamma T}$, $E \\equiv e^{-\\gamma T} - e^{-2\\gamma T}$, and\n$$\nF \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\gamma} e^{-2\\gamma t_2}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t_1}\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\gamma}\\left(1 - e^{-2\\gamma t_2}\\right) + \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\gamma}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t_1}\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\gamma}\\right]\\left(e^{-\\gamma t_2} - e^{-2\\gamma t_2}\\right).\n$$\nThe algebra proceeds by first writing the variance after segment $1$ as\n$$\nv_1 = e^{-2\\gamma t_1} v_b + \\left(e^{-\\gamma t_1} - e^{-2\\gamma t_1}\\right)\\mu_b + \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\gamma}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t_1}\\right),\n$$\nand then propagating through segment $2$, collecting terms dependent on $v_b$, $\\mu_b$, and constants. A notable simplification is that the coefficient $E$ of $\\mu_b$ collapses to $E = e^{-\\gamma T} - e^{-2\\gamma T}$, independent of the split time $t_1$.\n\nImposing cyclo-stationarity with binomial partitioning at division gives a fixed-point system for $(\\mu_b, v_b)$:\n$$\n\\mu_b = p\\,\\mu_T = p(A\\,\\mu_b + c) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\mu_b = \\frac{p\\,c}{1 - pA},\n$$\n$$\nv_b = p^2 v_T + p(1-p)\\mu_T = p^2\\left(B v_b + E\\mu_b + F\\right) + p(1-p)\\left(A\\mu_b + c\\right),\n$$\nwhich yields\n$$\nv_b = \\frac{p^2(E\\mu_b + F) + p(1-p)(A\\mu_b + c)}{1 - p^2 B}.\n$$\nThese closed-form expressions determine the cyclo-stationary birth moments $(\\mu_b, v_b)$ for any $(k,\\gamma,T,\\phi_S)$ with $p=1/2$.\n\nTo compute snapshot statistics across an asynchronous population sampled uniformly in age on $[0,T)$, we time-average the age-conditional moments.
