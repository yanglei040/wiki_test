            "problem": "Consider a single-substrate catalytic reaction in a well-mixed compartment under the Law of Mass Action: $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\to E + P$, where $E$ is free enzyme, $S$ is substrate, $ES$ is enzyme–substrate complex, and $P$ is product. Let $E(t)$, $S(t)$, $ES(t)$, and $P(t)$ denote the concentrations of each species as functions of time $t$. Let the elementary rate constants be $k_{1}$ for association $E+S\\to ES$, $k_{-1}$ for dissociation $ES\\to E+S$, and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ for catalytic turnover $ES\\to E+P$. Assume enzyme conservation $E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = E(t) + ES(t)$ with $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ constant. Define the Michaelis constant $K_{M}$ in terms of the elementary rate constants. Work in International System of Units (SI), with concentration measured in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and time measured in $\\mathrm{s}$. \nTasks:\n1. Using the Law of Mass Action, write the ordinary differential equations (ODE) for $E(t)$, $S(t)$, $ES(t)$, and $P(t)$.\n2. Perform dimensional analysis to determine the units of $k_{1}$, $k_{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and $K_{M}$. Verify that every term in each rate law has consistent dimensions.\n3.

It provides a complete and consistent setup for a standard problem in enzyme kinetics. No flaws were identified. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is given by $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\to E + P$, with forward rate constant $k_1$, reverse rate constant $k_{-1}$, and catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.\n\n**1. System of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nApplying the Law of Mass Action to the reaction network, we can write the time-evolution equations for the concentrations of the species $E(t)$, $S(t)$, $ES(t)$, and $P(t)$. The rates of the individual reaction steps are:\n- Association $E+S\\to ES$: $v_1 = k_1 E(t) S(t)$\n- Dissociation $ES\\to E+S$: $v_{-1} = k_{-1} ES(t)$\n- Catalysis $ES\\to E+P$: $v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} ES(t)$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species concentration is the sum of the rates of the reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of the reactions that consume it.\n\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -v_1 + v_{-1} + v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = -k_1 E(t)S(t) + (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -v_1 + v_{-1} = -k_1 E(t)S(t) + k_{-1}ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dES}{dt} = v_1 - v_{-1} - v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_1 E(t)S(t) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t) $$\n\nThe problem states the conservation of total enzyme, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = E(t) + ES(t)$. Differentiating this with respect to time $t$ yields $\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = \\frac{dE}{dt} + \\frac{dES}{dt}$. Summing the derived ODEs for $E$ and $ES$ confirms this: $\\frac{dE}{dt} + \\frac{dES}{dt} = [-k_1 E S + (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES] + [k_1 E S - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES] = 0$.\n\n**2. Dimensional Analysis**\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the physical dimensions of a quantity $X$. Concentrations are given in units of moles per liter, which we denote dimensionally as $C = \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Time is in seconds, denoted as $T = \\mathrm{s}$. The dimension of a rate of change of concentration is $C/T$.\n\n- From the term $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)$ in the equation for $dP/dt$, we have $[k_{\\mathrm{cat}}][ES] = C/T$. Since $[ES] = C$, it follows that $[k_{\\mathrm{cat}}] = T^{-1}$.\n- Similarly, from the term $k_{-1}ES(t)$ in the equation for $dS/dt$, we have $[k_{-1}][ES] = C/T$, which gives $[k_{-1}] = T^{-1}$.\n- From the term $k_1 E(t)S(t)$ in the equation for $dS/dt$, we have $[k_1][E][S] = C/T$. Since $[E] = [S] = C$, we have $[k_1]C^2 = C/T$, which gives $[k_1] = C^{-1}T^{-1}$.\n- The Michaelis constant is defined as $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}$. Its dimensions are $[K_M] = \\frac{[k_{-1}] + [k_{\\mathrm{cat}}]}{[k_1]}$. Since $k_{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ have the same dimensions $T^{-1}$, their sum also has dimensions $T^{-1}$. Thus, $[K_M] = \\frac{T^{-1}}{C^{-1}T^{-1}} = C$.\n\nThe units are therefore:\n- $k_1$: $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{-1}$: $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$: $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $K_M$: $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nThe dimensional consistency is verified as every term in each ODE has dimensions of $C/T$.\n\n**3. Nondimensionalization**\n\nWe introduce the dimensionless variables and characteristic scales as defined in the problem:\n- Time: $\\tau = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} t \\implies t = \\tau / k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$\n- Substrate concentration: $\\sigma(\\tau) = S(t)/K_M \\implies S(t) = K_M \\sigma(\\tau)$\n- Enzyme complex concentration: $c(\\tau) = ES(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\implies ES(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c(\\tau)$\n- Free enzyme concentration: $e(\\tau) = E(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\implies E(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e(\\tau)$\n\nThe enzyme conservation law $E(t) + ES(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ becomes $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e(\\tau) + E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c(\\tau) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which simplifies to the dimensionless form $e(\\tau) + c(\\tau) = 1$.\n\n**4. Derivation of the Dimensionless Rate under QSSA**\n\nTo derive the normalized rate $v^*(\\sigma)$, we first nondimensionalize the ODE for the enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$.\n$$ \\frac{dES}{dt} = k_1 E(t)S(t) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\nSubstitute the definitions of the dimensionless variables:\n$$ \\frac{d(E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c)}{d(\\tau/k_{\\mathrm{cat}})} = k_1 (E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e)(K_M\\sigma) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})(E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c) $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\frac{d}{d\\tau}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{tot}}k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = k_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_M e \\sigma - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) E_{\\mathrm{tot}} c $$\nDivide by $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_1 K_M}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} e \\sigma - \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} c $$\nSubstitute $e = 1 - c$ and the definition $K_M = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})/k_1$. The term $\\frac{k_1 K_M}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\frac{k_{-1}+k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}$.\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} (1-c) \\sigma - \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} c $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ (1-c)\\sigma - c \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ \\sigma - c(\\sigma+1) \\right] $$\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) is valid when the concentration of the intermediate complex $ES$ changes on a much faster time scale than the substrate $S$. This condition, given as $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}/(K_M+S_0) \\ll 1$, allows us to set the time derivative of the fast variable to zero. In dimensional terms, $\\frac{dES}{dt} \\approx 0$. In dimensionless terms, this corresponds to $\\frac{dc}{d\\tau} \\approx 0$.\nApplying the QSSA to the dimensionless equation for $c$:\n$$ 0 \\approx \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ \\sigma - c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) \\right] $$\nwhere $c_{qss}$ is the quasi-steady-state value of $c$. Since the pre-factor is non-zero, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$ \\sigma - c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma = c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) $$\nSolving for $c_{qss}$ gives the dimensionless complex concentration as a function of the dimensionless substrate concentration:\n$$ c_{qss}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\sigma} $$\nThe product formation rate is $v = dP/dt = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)$. The problem asks for the dimensionless normalized rate $v^{*}(\\sigma) = v/(k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_{\\mathrm{tot}})$.\n$$ v^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{ES(t)}{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\nBy definition, $c = ES(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Therefore, $v^{*} = c$.\nUnder the QSSA, the rate is determined by the quasi-steady-state complex concentration:\n$$ v^{*}(\\sigma) = c_{qss}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\sigma} $$\nThis is the normalized Michaelis-Menten equation in dimensionless form.",

Intuitively, $A_1$ and $A_2$ compare maximal production to degradation-scaled dissociation constants, $m$ and $n$ specify cooperativity (nonlinearity) of repression, and $\\Delta$ quantifies relative degradation speeds.\n\nSteady states $(\\bar{x}^*, \\bar{y}^*)$ satisfy the algebraic equations\n$$\n\\bar{x}^* = \\frac{A_1}{1 + (\\bar{y}^*)^n}, \\quad\n\\bar{y}^* = \\frac{A_2}{\\Delta(1 + (\\bar{x}^*)^m)}.\n$$\nTo determine linear stability, we linearize the system at a steady state and examine the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side. Define the vector field\n$$\nf_1(\\bar{x},\\bar{y}) = \\frac{A_1}{1 + \\bar{y}^n} - \\bar{x},\\quad\nf_2(\\bar{x},\\bar{y}) = \\frac{A_2}{1 + \\bar{x}^m} - \\Delta \\bar{y}.\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is\n$$\nJ(\\bar{x},\\bar{y}) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\bar{x}} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\bar{y}}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial \\bar{x}} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial \\bar{y}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -\\frac{A_1 n \\bar{y}^{n-1}}{(1+\\bar{y}^n)^2}\\\\\n-\\frac{A_2 m \\bar{x}^{m-1}}{(1+\\bar{x}^m)^2} & -\\Delta\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nA steady state is linearly stable if both eigenvalues of $J$ have negative real parts. For this two-dimensional system, this is equivalent to the trace being negative and the determinant being positive; however, we will compute eigenvalues numerically for robustness.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each physical parameter set:\n1. Compute the dimensionless groups $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\Delta$, $m$, $n$ from $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n)$ via $A_1 = \\alpha_x/(\\gamma_x K_x)$, $A_2 = \\alpha_y/(\\gamma_x K_y)$, and $\\Delta = \\gamma_y/\\gamma_x$.\n2. Find all nonnegative steady states by solving $f_1(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})=0$, $f_2(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})=0$ using multiple initial guesses over a grid in a bounded domain informed by the nullcline bounds $\\bar{x} \\le A_1$, $\\bar{y} \\le A_2/\\Delta$ (the maximums attained when the denominator terms $1+\\bar{y}^n$ and $1+\\bar{x}^m$ are minimized).\n3. Cluster the numerical solutions to remove duplicates using a small tolerance, and discard nonphysical solutions with negative components.\n4. For each steady state, evaluate $J$ and compute its eigenvalues. Count a steady state as linearly stable if both eigenvalues have negative real parts (within a small numerical tolerance).\n5. Report the integer count of linearly stable steady states for each test case.\n\nInterpretation of dimensionless groups and bistability:\n- Larger $A_1$ and $A_2$ increase the ability of each gene to maintain expression despite repression, making the nullclines extend to larger values and increasing the chance of multiple intersections (leading to two stable fixed points and one unstable).\n- Hill exponents $m>1$ and $n>1$ introduce sigmoidal repression curves, which are essential for generating multiple intersections; $m=n=1$ typically yields monostability.\n- The degradation ratio $\\Delta$ skews the relative response times and steady-state levels; deviations from $\\Delta=1$ deform the nullclines and can either promote or suppress bistability depending on balance with $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n\nThe test suite spans: a symmetric, cooperative, high-production case (expected bistability); a symmetric, cooperative, low-production case (expected monostability); an asymmetric production case; a noncooperative case; and a case with unequal degradation rates. The program will compute, for each case, the number of linearly stable steady states. The final output must be a single line in the format $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5]$ where $r_i$ are integers.",
