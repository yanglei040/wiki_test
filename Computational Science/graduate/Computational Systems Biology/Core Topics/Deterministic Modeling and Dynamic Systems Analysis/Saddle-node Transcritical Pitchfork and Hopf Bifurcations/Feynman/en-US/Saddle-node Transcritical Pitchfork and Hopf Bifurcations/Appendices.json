This first exercise focuses on the canonical normal form of this bifurcation .

            "problem": "In a simplified model of a bistable regulatory module in computational systems biology, the activation state variable $x$ evolves according to the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{x} = \\mu + x^{2}$, where the control parameter $\\mu$ is a nondimensional measure of net activation bias induced by upstream signals after appropriate rescaling. A bifurcation occurs at the threshold where equilibria are created or annihilated. For $\\mu  0$, two equilibria exist and one is stable, consistent with saddle-node bifurcation phenomenology. Starting from the foundational definition of an equilibrium for an ODE and the conceptual basis that small perturbations about a stable equilibrium obey a linearized dynamics that relaxes exponentially, determine the analytic expression for the magnitude of the relaxation rate $|\\lambda(\\mu)|$ near the stable equilibrium for $\\mu  0$. Express your final answer as a function of $\\mu$ and do not round; no physical units are required. Additionally, use your derived expression to explain, in words within your solution, how critical slowing down manifests as $\\mu \\uparrow 0^{-}$.",
            "solution": "The problem presents a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the evolution of a state variable $x$:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\mu + x^{2}\n$$\nHere, $\\dot{x}$ represents the time derivative $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, and $\\mu$ is a control parameter. This equation is the normal form for a saddle-node bifurcation. The problem asks for the analytic expression for the magnitude of the relaxation rate, $|\\lambda(\\mu)|$, for the stable equilibrium that exists when $\\mu  0$.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibria (or fixed points) of the system, which are the values of $x$ for which the system's state does not change over time. These points, denoted by $x^*$, are found by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$.\n$$\n\\mu + (x^*)^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $x^*$ gives:\n$$\n(x^*)^{2} = -\\mu\n$$\nReal-valued equilibria exist only if $-\\mu \\geq 0$, or equivalently, $\\mu \\leq 0$. For the specific case given in the problem, $\\mu  0$, we have two distinct equilibria:\n$$\nx^* = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\mu}\n$$\nLet us denote these two equilibria as $x^*_1 = \\sqrt{-\\mu}$ and $x^*_2 = -\\sqrt{-\\mu}$.\n\nNext, we determine the stability of each equilibrium by linearizing the system around them. The stability of a one-dimensional system is determined by the sign of the first derivative of the right-hand side of the ODE, evaluated at the equilibrium. Let $f(x) = \\mu + x^2$. The derivative is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = 2x\n$$\nThe value of this derivative at an equilibrium $x^*$ is the eigenvalue, $\\lambda$, of the linearized system. The dynamics of a small perturbation $\\delta x$ from the equilibrium $x^*$ are governed by $\\dot{\\delta x} \\approx \\lambda \\delta x$. If $\\lambda  0$, the perturbation decays, and the equilibrium is stable. If $\\lambda > 0$, the perturbation grows, and the equilibrium is unstable.\n\nLet's evaluate $\\lambda$ for each of our two equilibria:\n1.  For the equilibrium $x^*_1 = \\sqrt{-\\mu}$:\n    The corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = f'(x^*_1) = 2(\\sqrt{-\\mu})$. Since $\\mu  0$, $-\\mu$ is a positive quantity, and its square root is a positive real number. Thus, $\\lambda_1 = 2\\sqrt{-\\mu} > 0$. This equilibrium is unstable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium $x^*_2 = -\\sqrt{-\\mu}$:\n    The corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2 = f'(x^*_2) = 2(-\\sqrt{-\\mu}) = -2\\sqrt{-\\mu}$. Since $\\sqrt{-\\mu}$ is a positive real number, $\\lambda_2  0$. This equilibrium is stable, as stated in the problem.\n\nThe problem defines the relaxation rate based on the exponential decay of small perturbations around the stable equilibrium. The solution to the linearized equation $\\dot{\\delta x} = \\lambda_2 \\delta x$ is $\\delta x(t) = \\delta x(0)\\exp(\\lambda_2 t)$. The rate of this exponential relaxation is determined by the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$. The magnitude of this rate, $|\\lambda_2|$, is what the problem asks for.\n\nThe relaxation rate for the stable equilibrium is $\\lambda(\\mu) = \\lambda_2 = -2\\sqrt{-\\mu}$. The magnitude of this relaxation rate is:\n$$\n|\\lambda(\\mu)| = |-2\\sqrt{-\\mu}|\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$, the term $\\sqrt{-\\mu}$ is real and positive. Therefore, the magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\lambda(\\mu)| = 2\\sqrt{-\\mu}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the magnitude of the relaxation rate near the stable equilibrium for $\\mu  0$.\n\nThe problem also requires an explanation of how critical slowing down manifests as $\\mu \\uparrow 0^{-}$ (i.e., as $\\mu$ approaches $0$ from the negative side). Critical slowing down is the phenomenon where the time it takes for a system to return to a stable equilibrium following a perturbation diverges as a control parameter approaches a bifurcation point. In this system, the bifurcation point is at $\\mu = 0$.\n\nThe characteristic relaxation time, $\\tau$, is the time scale over which a perturbation decays. It is inversely related to the magnitude of the relaxation rate:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{|\\lambda(\\mu)|} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-\\mu}}\n$$\nAs the parameter $\\mu$ approaches the bifurcation point at $\\mu = 0$ from below ($\\mu \\uparrow 0^{-}$), the value of $-\\mu$ approaches $0$. Consequently, the magnitude of the relaxation rate, $|\\lambda(\\mu)| = 2\\sqrt{-\\mu}$, also approaches $0$. This means that the \"restoring force\" that pulls the system back to its stable state becomes progressively weaker. The relaxation time $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-\\mu}}$ therefore tends to infinity. This divergence of the relaxation time as the system nears the critical point $\\mu = 0$ is the hallmark of critical slowing down. The system takes an increasingly long time to recover from even infinitesimal disturbances, \"slowing down\" its return to equilibrium.",

            "introduction": "Unlike the saddle-node bifurcation where equilibria are created from nothing, the transcritical bifurcation involves the collision and subsequent exchange of stability between two distinct equilibrium branches. This scenario is common in models of competition or when a trivial state (like zero concentration) loses stability to a non-trivial one.

The phase dynamics $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$ are decoupled and constant, so the existence and stability of oscillations are determined entirely by the amplitude dynamics $\\dot{r}=\\mu r - r^{3}$.\n\nWe start from the definition of a limit cycle in a planar autonomous ODE: a closed isolated trajectory to which nearby trajectories may converge (stable) or from which they diverge (unstable). In polar coordinates for a rotationally symmetric normal form, a limit cycle corresponds to a constant-amplitude solution $r(t)\\equiv r^{\\ast}$ with $\\theta$ rotating uniformly, hence it is sufficient to find nonzero equilibria of the amplitude equation and assess their stability.\n\nConsider the amplitude ODE:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = f(r) = \\mu r - r^{3}.\n$$\nEquilibria of $r$ satisfy $f(r)=0$.

For $\\mu0$, the quantities $\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}$ are not real, so the only real equilibrium is $r=0$.\n\nTo determine stability of these equilibria in the one-dimensional amplitude equation, we linearize $f(r)$ at each equilibrium by computing its derivative:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\mu - 3 r^{2}.\n$$\nAt $r=0$,\n$$\nf'(0) = \\mu.\n$$\nThus, for $\\mu0$, $f'(0)0$, which implies that $r=0$ is an unstable equilibrium of the amplitude dynamics; trajectories with small $r$ increase away from zero.

A Hopf bifurcation occurs when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of the linearization of the planar system crosses the imaginary axis, generating oscillations.
