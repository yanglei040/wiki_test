            "introduction": "A fundamental challenge in analyzing high-throughput data is correcting for technical variations between samples that can obscure true biological differences. Quantile normalization is a powerful and widely used technique, particularly for microarray data, that addresses this by forcing the empirical distribution of intensities to be identical across a set of arrays. This exercise provides hands-on practice with the algorithm, allowing you to manually transform a raw data matrix and understand how this rank-based procedure effectively aligns sample distributions without making strong parametric assumptions about the data.",

            "problem": "In computational systems biology, cross-sample normalization aims to remove technical variation while preserving biologically meaningful rank structure. Quantile normalization is a widely used approach for microarray data and, with care, for Ribonucleic Acid sequencing (RNA-seq) after appropriate variance-stabilizing transformations. The core idea is to make the empirical distributions of all samples identical by aligning their order statistics and replacing each value by a common target computed across samples at the same rank. Consider a gene expression matrix with $3$ genes (rows) and $3$ samples (columns). Let the observed intensity matrix be\n$$\nX \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n8 & 1 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTreat each column as a sample. Perform quantile normalization across columns using the following operational definition grounded in order statistics: for each column, sort its entries in non-decreasing order to produce order statistics at ranks $1,2,3$; at each rank $r \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, compute the across-column average of the values occupying rank $r$; then, for each column, assign to each original entry the average corresponding to the rank it occupies in its column. If a column has ties (equal values) occupying multiple consecutive ranks, assign to each tied entry the average of the target values for those ranks. After completing quantile normalization to obtain a matrix $Y$, compute the determinant $\\det(Y)$. Express your final answer as an exact rational number with no rounding and no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires performing quantile normalization on a given $3 \\times 3$ gene expression matrix $X$ to obtain a normalized matrix $Y$, and then to compute the determinant of $Y$.\n\nThe given expression matrix is:\n$$\nX \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n8 & 1 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere each column represents a sample and each row represents a gene.\n\nThe quantile normalization procedure consists of three main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Sorting and Ranking**\nFirst, we sort the values in each column (sample) in non-decreasing order to determine the rank of each entry within its column.\n\nFor column $1$: $[5, 2, 8]$. The sorted order is $[2, 5, 8]$.\nThe value $2$ has rank $1$.\nThe value $5$ has rank $2$.\nThe value $8$ has rank $3$.\n\nFor column $2$: $[7, 7, 1]$. The sorted order is $[1, 7, 7]$.\nThe value $1$ has rank $1$.\nThe two values of $7$ are tied and occupy ranks $2$ and $3$.\n\nFor column $3$: $[3, 9, 3]$. The sorted order is $[3, 3, 9]$.\nThe two values of $3$ are tied and occupy ranks $1$ and $2$.\nThe value $9$ has rank $3$.\n\nWe can arrange the sorted columns into a new matrix, $X_{\\text{sorted}}$, where each row corresponds to a specific rank.\n$$\nX_{\\text{sorted}} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n8 & 7 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row contains all values of rank $1$, the second row contains all values of rank $2$ (or the lower rank in a tie), and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Computing the Target Distribution**\nThe target distribution is computed by taking the average of the values for each rank across all samples. These averages correspond to the row-wise means of the $X_{\\text{sorted}}$ matrix. Let $T_r$ be the target value for rank $r$.\n\nTarget for rank $1$ ($T_1$):\n$$\nT_1 \\;=\\; \\frac{2 + 1 + 3}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n$$\nTarget for rank $2$ ($T_2$):\n$$\nT_2 \\;=\\; \\frac{5 + 7 + 3}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n$$\nTarget for rank $3$ ($T_3$):\n$$\nT_3 \\;=\\; \\frac{8 + 7 + 9}{3} = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n$$\nThe set of target values corresponding to ranks $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is $\\{2, 5, 8\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing the Normalized Matrix $Y$**\nWe now replace each entry in the original matrix $X$ with the target value corresponding to its rank within its original column. We must apply the specified rule for handling ties.\n\nFor column $1$ of $Y$: The original entries are $(5, 2, 8)$, which have ranks $(2, 1, 3)$ respectively. We replace them with the corresponding target values $(T_2, T_1, T_3)$.\n$$\nY_{\\cdot 1} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} T_2 \\\\ T_1 \\\\ T_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor column $2$ of $Y$: The original entries are $(7, 7, 1)$. The value $1$ has rank $1$ and is replaced by $T_1 = 2$. The two values of $7$ are tied for ranks $2$ and $3$. According to the problem's rule, each of these tied entries is replaced by the average of the target values for those ranks, which is $\\frac{T_2 + T_3}{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Value for tied entries} \\;=\\; \\frac{5 + 8}{2} = \\frac{13}{2}\n$$\nSo, the second column of $Y$ is:\n$$\nY_{\\cdot 2} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{13}{2} \\\\ \\frac{13}{2} \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor column $3$ of $Y$: The original entries are $(3, 9, 3)$. The value $9$ has rank $3$ and is replaced by $T_3 = 8$. The two values of $3$ are tied for ranks $1$ and $2$. These are replaced by the average of the target values for those ranks, which is $\\frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Value for tied entries} \\;=\\; \\frac{2 + 5}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n$$\nSo, the third column of $Y$ is:\n$$\nY_{\\cdot 3} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{2} \\\\ 8 \\\\ \\frac{7}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nCombining the columns gives the fully normalized matrix $Y$:\n$$\nY \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & \\frac{13}{2} & \\frac{7}{2} \\\\\n2 & \\frac{13}{2} & 8 \\\\\n8 & 2 & \\frac{7}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Computing the Determinant of $Y$**\nThe determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by the formula $a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$.\n\nFor matrix $Y$:\n$$\n\\det(Y) \\;=\\; 5 \\left( (\\frac{13}{2})(\\frac{7}{2}) - (8)(2) \\right) - \\frac{13}{2} \\left( (2)(\\frac{7}{2}) - (8)(8) \\right) + \\frac{7}{2} \\left( (2)(2) - (\\frac{13}{2})(8) \\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the cofactors for the first row:\n$$\n(\\frac{13}{2})(\\frac{7}{2}) - (8)(2) \\;=\\; \\frac{91}{4} - 16 \\;=\\; \\frac{91}{4} - \\frac{64}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{27}{4}\n$$\n$$\n(2)(\\frac{7}{2}) - (8)(8) \\;=\\; 7 - 64 \\;=\\; -57\n$$\n$$\n(2)(2) - (\\frac{13}{2})(8) \\;=\\; 4 - 52 \\;=\\; -48\n$$\nNow substitute these values back into the determinant formula:\n$$\n\\det(Y) \\;=\\; 5 \\left( \\frac{27}{4} \\right) - \\frac{13}{2} \\left( -57 \\right) + \\frac{7}{2} \\left( -48 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(Y) \\;=\\; \\frac{135}{4} + \\frac{741}{2} - \\frac{336}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(Y) \\;=\\; \\frac{135}{4} + \\frac{741 - 336}{2} \\;=\\; \\frac{135}{4} + \\frac{405}{2}\n$$\nTo sum these terms, we use a common denominator of $4$:\n$$\n\\det(Y) \\;=\\; \\frac{135}{4} + \\frac{810}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{135 + 810}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{945}{4}\n$$\nThe determinant of the quantile-normalized matrix $Y$ is $\\frac{945}{4}$.",

A seemingly intuitive approach is to scale by the total number of reads per sample, but this method can introduce severe bias when a large number of genes are asymmetrically regulated between conditions. This problem presents a hypothetical but conceptually vital scenario to demonstrate this failure, contrasting the flawed results of total-count normalization with the correct interpretation enabled by stable spike-in controls. By working through this example, you will gain a deep appreciation for the compositional nature of sequencing data and the importance of choosing a robust normalization strategy.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-condition Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment comparing condition $A$ and condition $B$. Assume sampling follows a multinomial model: the expected read count assigned to transcript $i$ in sample $j$ is proportional to its underlying molecule abundance in that sample. Each sample yields exactly $R = 3828$ mapped reads (endogenous plus spike-ins). Endogenous transcripts consist of a housekeeping gene $H$ and five other genes $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}, G_{4}, G_{5}$. Two External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in transcripts $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are added at equal absolute amounts to each sample prior to library preparation. The true underlying molecule abundances per cell are:\n- In condition $A$: $m_{H} = 100$, $m_{G_{k}} = 100$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, and $m_{S_{1}} = m_{S_{2}} = 30$.\n- In condition $B$: there is a global activation doubling all non-housekeeping endogenous genes while leaving $H$ unchanged: $m_{H} = 100$, $m_{G_{k}} = 200$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, and $m_{S_{1}} = m_{S_{2}} = 30$.\n\nUnder the multinomial sampling assumption and equal $R$ across samples, the observed read counts are consistent with these abundances and equal to:\n- Sample $A$: $c_{H,A} = 580$, $c_{G_{k},A} = 580$ for each $k$, $c_{S_{1},A} = c_{S_{2},A} = 174$, with total $T_{A} = 3828$.\n- Sample $B$: $c_{H,B} = 330$, $c_{G_{k},B} = 660$ for each $k$, $c_{S_{1},B} = c_{S_{2},B} = 99$, with total $T_{B} = 3828$.\n\nYou will examine the effect of total-count normalization in the presence of global transcriptional shifts and then implement a spike-in-based remedy. Define the total-count normalized fold-change for gene $i$ between $B$ and $A$ as the ratio of its count-proportions, and define the spike-in normalization factor for sample $B$ as the ratio of the total spike-in counts in $A$ to those in $B$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression; do not round.",
            "solution": "The central task is to quantify the bias introduced by total-count normalization for a non-differentially expressed gene in the context of global, asymmetric transcriptional amplification, and to contrast this with spike-in-based normalization.\n\nLet $c_{i,j}$ be the read count for transcript $i$ in sample $j$, where $j \\in \\{A, B\\}$. The total number of reads in each sample is constant, denoted by $R$. The given data states $T_A = T_B = R = 3828$.\n\n**Task 1: Total-Count Normalized Fold-Change**\n\nThe problem defines the total-count normalized fold-change for a gene $i$ between condition $B$ and $A$ as the ratio of its count-proportions.\nThe count-proportion for gene $i$ in sample $j$ is $p_{i,j} = \\frac{c_{i,j}}{T_j}$, where $T_j$ is the total read count in sample $j$.\nThe fold-change is then $FC_{\\text{TC}, i} = \\frac{p_{i,B}}{p_{i,A}} = \\frac{c_{i,B}/T_B}{c_{i,A}/T_A}$.\n\nSince the problem states that the total read counts are equal, $T_A = T_B = 3828$, the expression for the fold-change simplifies to the ratio of the raw counts:\n$$FC_{\\text{TC}, i} = \\frac{c_{i,B}}{c_{i,A}}$$\n\nFor the housekeeping gene $H$, we are given the counts:\n$c_{H,A} = 580$\n$c_{H,B} = 330$\n\nThe estimated fold-change for $H$ using total-count normalization is:\n$$FC_{\\text{TC}, H} = \\frac{c_{H,B}}{c_{H,A}} = \\frac{330}{580} = \\frac{33}{58}$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the base-2 logarithm of this value:\n$$\n\\log_{2}(FC_{\\text{TC}, H}) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{33}{58}\\right)\n$$\nThis result shows an apparent downregulation of the housekeeping gene, which is known to be biologically unchanged. This artifact arises because the proportion of reads from gene $H$ decreases in sample $B$ due to the massive increase in reads from genes $G_k$, even though the absolute abundance of $H$ molecules remains constant.\n\n**Task 2: Spike-In Corrected Fold-Change**\n\nSpike-in normalization uses the counts from externally added RNA standards (spike-ins) to derive a normalization factor. The premise is that these spike-ins are added in equal absolute amounts to each sample, so any observed difference in their sequencing counts must be due to technical or compositional variations, such as the change in total RNA content seen here.\n\nThe spike-in normalization factor for sample $B$, $f_S$, is defined as the ratio of total spike-in counts in sample $A$ to those in sample $B$.\nTotal spike-in counts in sample $A$: $C_{S,A} = c_{S_1,A} + c_{S_2,A} = 174 + 174 = 348$.\nTotal spike-in counts in sample $B$: $C_{S,B} = c_{S_1,B} + c_{S_2,B} = 99 + 99 = 198$.\n\nThe normalization factor is:\n$$f_S = \\frac{C_{S,A}}{C_{S,B}} = \\frac{348}{198} = \\frac{174}{99} = \\frac{58 \\times 3}{33 \\times 3} = \\frac{58}{33}$$\n\nThis factor is used to correct the counts in sample $B$. The corrected count for gene $H$ in sample $B$, denoted $c'_{H,B}$, is:\n$$c'_{H,B} = c_{H,B} \\times f_S = 330 \\times \\frac{58}{33} = 10 \\times 58 = 580$$\n\nThe spike-in corrected fold-change, $FC_{S, H}$, is the ratio of the corrected count in $B$ to the count in $A$:\n$$FC_{S, H} = \\frac{c'_{H,B}}{c_{H,A}} = \\frac{580}{580} = 1$$\n\nThe base-2 logarithm of the corrected fold-change is:\n$$\n\\log_{2}(FC_{S, H}) = \\log_{2}(1) = 0\n$$\nThis result correctly reflects the underlying biology that the housekeeping gene $H$ is not changing between conditions $A$ and $B$.\n\n**Task 3: Bias Induced by Total-Count Normalization**\n\nThe bias is defined as the difference between the total-count log-fold-change estimate and the spike-in corrected log-fold-change estimate.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\log_{2}(FC_{\\text{TC}, H}) - \\log_{2}(FC_{S, H})\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values calculated in the previous tasks:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{33}{58}\\right) - 0 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{33}{58}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis bias can be expressed in terms of the normalization factor $f_S$. The bias is:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{FC_{\\text{TC}, H}}{FC_{S, H}}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{c_{H,B}/c_{H,A}}{(c_{H,B} \\times f_S)/c_{H,A}}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{f_S}\\right) = -\\log_{2}(f_S)\n$$\nSubstituting the value for $f_S$:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = -\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{58}{33}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{58}{33}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{33}{58}\\right)\n$$\nThis confirms the result. The bias is a direct consequence of the change in library composition, which is captured by the spike-in normalization factor but ignored by the total-count method. The final answer is the closed-form analytical expression for this bias.",

The fifth digit is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit ($5$) to $6$.\n$\\tilde{K}_{3,2} \\approx 9.086$\nThe full normalized matrix $\\tilde{K}$ is computed by dividing each column $j$ of $K$ by its corresponding size factor $s_j$.\n$$\n\\tilde{K} \\approx\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n100/1.10064 & 150/1.65096 & 50/0.563835 \\\\\n40/1.10064 & 60/1.65096 & 20/0.563835 \\\\\n0/1.10064 & 15/1.65096 & 5/0.563835 \\\\\n200/1.10064 & 0/1.65096 & 100/0.563835 \\\\\n5/1.10064 & 8/1.65096 & 0/0.563835\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\approx\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n90.856 & 90.856 & 88.678 \\\\\n36.342 & 36.342 & 35.471 \\\\\n0 & 9.086 & 8.868 \\\\\n181.712 & 0 & 177.356 \\\\\n4.543 & 4.846 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe requested value is the entry at row $3$, column $2$.",
