It is a standard, well-posed problem in mathematical biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Steady-State Condition\nA steady state of a dynamical system is a state in which the system's variables do not change over time. For the protein concentration $x(t)$, this condition is mathematically expressed as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$. Let $x^{\\ast}$ denote the steady-state concentration. Substituting this into the given ODE yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}} = 0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)^{n}}-\\beta x^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)^{n}} = \\beta x^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis is the steady-state condition. It equates the rate of protein synthesis (the left-hand side, a decreasing Hill function) to the rate of protein loss (the right-hand side, a linear function). This aligns perfectly with the biochemical interpretation of a steady state as a balance between production and loss fluxes. The solutions to this algebraic equation correspond to the steady-state concentrations of the system.\n\n### Analysis of Existence and Uniqueness of a Positive Steady State\nTo analyze the existence and uniqueness of a biologically relevant steady state, $x^{\\ast} > 0$, we analyze the intersections of two functions for $x \\ge 0$: the production rate function, $P(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}}$, and the loss rate function, $L(x) = \\beta x$.\n\nLet's examine the properties of these two functions for $x \\ge 0$:\n1.  **Production Rate, $P(x)$**:\n    - At $x=0$, the production rate is maximal: $P(0) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+0} = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $P(0)$ is positive.\n    - As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $(\\frac{x}{K})^n \\to \\infty$ (since $n>0, K>0$), so $P(x) \\to 0$.\n    - The function $P(x)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing for $x > 0$. Its derivative is $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\alpha\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-1}\\right] = -\\alpha\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right)$. Since all parameters $\\alpha, n, K$ are positive, and for $x>0$, we have $P'(x) < 0$.\n\n2.  **Loss Rate, $L(x)$**:\n    - At $x=0$, the loss rate is $L(0) = 0$.\n    - The function $L(x)$ is a straight line passing through the origin with a constant positive slope $\\beta$.\n\nTo find the steady states, we seek solutions to $P(x) = L(x)$. Let us define a new function $f(x) = P(x) - L(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\beta x$. We are looking for roots of $f(x)=0$ for $x > 0$.\n\n- **Existence**: At $x=0$, we have $f(0) = P(0) - L(0) = \\alpha - 0 = \\alpha > 0$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $P(x) \\to 0$ and $L(x) \\to \\infty$, so $f(x) \\to -\\infty$. Since $f(x)$ is a continuous function for $x \\ge 0$, and it changes sign from positive at $x=0$ to negative for large $x$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there must be at least one root $x^{\\ast} > 0$. Therefore, a positive steady state always exists under the given parameter constraints.\n\n- **Uniqueness**: To establish uniqueness, we examine the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = P'(x) - L'(x) = -\\frac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} - \\beta\n$$\nFor all $x \\ge 0$ and given the constraints $\\alpha>0$, $\\beta>0$, $K>0$, and $n>0$, both terms in the expression for $f'(x)$ are non-positive. The first term is zero at $x=0$ (for $n>1$) or approaches a finite negative value (for $n=1$), and is strictly negative for $x>0$. The second term, $-\\beta$, is a strictly negative constant. Thus, $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$.\nA function that is continuous and has a strictly negative derivative is strictly monotonically decreasing. A strictly monotonic function can cross any given horizontal line (in this case, the $x$-axis, where $f(x)=0$) at most once.\nSince we have already established that at least one root exists, and we have now shown that at most one root can exist, we conclude that there is a unique positive steady state $x^{\\ast} > 0$.\n\nThis existence and uniqueness are guaranteed for all positive values of the parameters: $\\alpha>0, \\beta>0, K>0, n>0$. There are no further conditions required.\n\nRegarding parameter regimes where multiple solutions could arise: for the specific mathematical model of negative autoregulation provided, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = P(x) - L(x)$, where $P(x)$ is monotonically decreasing and $L(x)$ is monotonically increasing, multiple steady states are not possible. The function $f(x)=P(x)-L(x)$ is strictly decreasing, guaranteeing a unique root. Multiple steady states (bistability) typically require a non-monotonic production function, which often arises from positive feedback loops or cooperative activation motifs, not from simple negative feedback as modeled here. Therefore, under the stated assumptions of the model, no parameter regime leads to multiple steady states.\n\n### Explicit Solution for the Noncooperative Case ($n=1$)\nWe now specialize to the case where $n=1$. The steady-state equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}} = \\beta x^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe solve for $x^{\\ast} > 0$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\beta x^{\\ast} \\left(1 + \\frac{x^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\beta x^{\\ast} + \\frac{\\beta}{K} (x^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x^{\\ast}$. We write it in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{K} (x^{\\ast})^2 + \\beta x^{\\ast} - \\alpha = 0\n$$\nWe use the quadratic formula, $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = \\frac{\\beta}{K}$, $b = \\beta$, and $c = -\\alpha$.\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{-\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{K}\\right)(-\\alpha)}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{K}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{-\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $K$ are all positive, the discriminant $\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}$ is strictly positive, ensuring two distinct real solutions. We require a biologically relevant solution, meaning $x^{\\ast}>0$.\nThe term under the square root is $\\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}} > \\sqrt{\\beta^2} = |\\beta|$. Since $\\beta>0$, this is $\\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}} > \\beta$.\n\n- The solution with the minus sign in the numerator, $-\\beta - \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}$, is negative. Since the denominator $\\frac{2\\beta}{K}$ is positive, this entire solution is negative and therefore not biologically relevant.\n- The solution with the plus sign, $-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}$, is positive. This is the unique physically meaningful steady state.\n\nWe take the positive root and simplify the expression:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}} = \\frac{K}{2\\beta} \\left(-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2\\left(1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$, we can factor it out of the square root:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2\\beta} \\left(-\\beta + \\beta\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\beta$ from the parenthesis:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{K\\beta}{2\\beta} \\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}} - 1\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final, simplified analytic expression for the unique positive steady state when $n=1$.",

The Jacobian matrix $J$ for a general two-dimensional system is defined as:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives for the given functions $F(x,y)$ and $G(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\alpha\\,x + k\\,f(y)) = -\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\alpha\\,x + k\\,f(y)) = k\\,\\frac{\\partial f(y)}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\delta\\,y + k\\,g(x)) = k\\,\\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\delta\\,y + k\\,g(x)) = -\\delta\n$$\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the equilibrium point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$.

The partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t)} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = -\\beta $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t-\\tau)} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = \\alpha \\cdot (-1) \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{v}{K}\\right)^n\\right)^{-2} \\cdot n \\left(\\frac{v}{K}\\right)^{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{K} $$\nEvaluating at the steady state $(u, v) = (x^{\\ast}, x^{\\ast}) = (K, K)$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t)}\\right|_{x^{\\ast}} = -\\beta $$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t-\\tau)}\\right|_{x^{\\ast}} = -\\frac{\\alpha n}{K} \\frac{(K/K)^{n-1}}{(1+(K/K)^n)^2} = -\\frac{\\alpha n}{K} \\frac{1}{(1+1)^2} = -\\frac{\\alpha n}{4K} $$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = 2\\beta K$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t-\\tau)}\\right|_{x^{\\ast}} = -\\frac{(2\\beta K)n}{4K} = -\\frac{n\\beta}{2} $$\nThe linearized equation for the perturbation $\\delta x(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt} = -\\beta\\, \\delta x(t) - \\frac{n\\beta}{2} \\delta x(t-\\tau) $$\nNow, we find the dimensionless linearized loop gain. This is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the input-output slope of the synthesis term to the outflow rate. The synthesis term is $S(x_{delay}) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(x_{delay}/K)^n}$. Its slope at steady state is what we just calculated as $\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x(t-\\tau)}\\right|_{x^{\\ast}} = -\\frac{n\\beta}{2}$. The magnitude of this slope is $|\\frac{-n\\beta}{2}| = \\frac{n\\beta}{2}$. The outflow rate is $\\beta$.\nThe dimensionless linearized loop gain, which we denote as $G$, is:\n$$ G = \\frac{\\text{magnitude of synthesis slope}}{\\text{outflow rate}} = \\frac{n\\beta/2}{\\beta} = \\frac{n}{2} $$\nTo assess stability, we examine the characteristic equation of the linearized DDE. We propose a solution of the form $\\delta x(t) = C e^{\\lambda t}$. Substituting this into the linearized DDE yields:\n$$ \\lambda C e^{\\lambda t} = -\\beta C e^{\\lambda t} - \\frac{n\\beta}{2} C e^{\\lambda(t-\\tau)} $$\nDividing by $C e^{\\lambda t}$ (for $C \\neq 0$) gives the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda + \\beta + \\frac{n\\beta}{2} e^{-\\lambda\\tau} = 0 $$\nThe loss of stability occurs when a pair of complex-conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis. This is the marginal stability condition, where $\\lambda = i\\omega$ for some real frequency $\\omega > 0$. At the point of criticality, the Hill coefficient is $n = n_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n$$ i\\omega + \\beta + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}{2} e^{-i\\omega\\tau} = 0 $$\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{-i\\omega\\tau} = \\cos(\\omega\\tau) - i\\sin(\\omega\\tau)$:\n$$ i\\omega + \\beta + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}{2} (\\cos(\\omega\\tau) - i\\sin(\\omega\\tau)) = 0 $$\nWe separate this equation into its real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: $\\beta + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}{2}\\cos(\\omega\\tau) = 0 \\implies \\cos(\\omega\\tau) = -\\frac{2}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}}$\nImaginary part: $\\omega - \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}{2}\\sin(\\omega\\tau) = 0 \\implies \\sin(\\omega\\tau) = \\frac{2\\omega}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}$\nThe phase lag $\\omega\\tau$ must be in the second quadrant since $n_{\\mathrm{crit}}>0$ implies $\\cos(\\omega\\tau)<0$ and $\\omega, \\beta, n_{\\mathrm{crit}}>0$ implies $\\sin(\\omega\\tau)>0$.\nWe can find the relationship between $\\omega$ and $\\tau$ by dividing the two equations:\n$$ \\tan(\\omega\\tau) = \\frac{\\sin(\\omega\\tau)}{\\cos(\\omega\\tau)} = \\frac{2\\omega/(n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta)}{-2/n_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = -\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta} $$\nThis condition is equivalent to the standard phase condition for delayed negative feedback, $\\omega\\tau + \\arctan(\\omega/\\beta) = \\pi$.\nWe are given the specific delay $\\tau = \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\beta}$. Substituting this into the phase condition $\\tan(\\omega\\tau) = -\\omega/\\beta$:\n$$ \\tan\\left(\\omega \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\beta}\\right) = -\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta} $$\nLet $u = \\omega/\\beta$. The equation becomes a transcendental equation for the dimensionless frequency $u$:\n$$ \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}u\\right) = -u $$\nWe can find the solution by inspection. Let's test $u=1$:\nLHS: $\\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\cdot 1\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) = -1$.\nRHS: $-1$.\nSince LHS = RHS, $u=1$ is a solution. The function $g(u) = \\tan(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}u) + u$ is strictly increasing in the relevant interval, so this solution is unique.\nThus, the critical frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = 1 \\cdot \\beta = \\beta$.\n\nNow we find $n_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ using the identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2\\omega}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\beta}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\\right)^2 = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{4\\omega^2}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2\\beta^2} + \\frac{4}{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2} = 1 $$\n$$ 4\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\beta^2} + 1\\right) = n_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2 $$\nSubstituting the critical frequency $\\omega=\\beta$:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{\\beta^2}{\\beta^2} + 1\\right) = 4(1+1) = 8 $$\nSince the Hill coefficient $n$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} $$",
