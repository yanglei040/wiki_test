At these points, all rates of change are zero, allowing us to convert a complex system of differential equations into a more manageable set of algebraic equations. This foundational exercise  provides hands-on practice in deriving the steady-state concentrations for the core p53–MDM2 negative feedback loop, a fundamental skill for analyzing the baseline condition of any biological circuit.",

            "problem": "Consider the tumor suppressor protein $p53$ and its negative regulator mouse double minute $2$ homolog (MDM2), coupled through transcriptional and post-translational feedback. Under basal stress in a mammalian cell, assume Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-$\\kappa$B) remains at a basal level and does not modulate the $p53$–MDM2 loop. Let $p$ denote the concentration of $p53$ protein, $m$ the concentration of MDM2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), and $M$ the concentration of MDM2 protein. Assume the following processes hold:\n- Basal synthesis of $p53$ at rate $k_{p}$.\n- First-order degradation of $p53$ at rate $\\delta_{p} p$.\n- MDM2-mediated catalytic degradation of $p53$ at mass-action rate $\\alpha p M$ (MDM2 is recycled and not consumed in the event).\n- Transcription of MDM2 mRNA induced by $p53$ at rate $\\beta p$.\n- First-order degradation of MDM2 mRNA at rate $\\delta_{m} m$.\n- Translation of MDM2 protein from mRNA at rate $\\gamma m$.\n- First-order degradation of MDM2 protein at rate $\\delta_{M} M$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the dynamics are modeled by the ordinary differential equations\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{p} \\;-\\; \\delta_{p} p \\;-\\; \\alpha p M,\\qquad\n\\frac{dm}{dt} \\;=\\; \\beta p \\;-\\; \\delta_{m} m,\\qquad\n\\frac{dM}{dt} \\;=\\; \\gamma m \\;-\\; \\delta_{M} M.\n$$\nAll kinetic parameters $k_{p}, \\delta_{p}, \\alpha, \\beta, \\delta_{m}, \\gamma, \\delta_{M}$ are positive constants.\n\nStarting from mass-action kinetics and central dogma-based production and degradation processes, derive the steady-state concentrations $(p^{*}, m^{*}, M^{*})$ that satisfy $\\frac{dp}{dt}=\\frac{dm}{dt}=\\frac{dM}{dt}=0$.

            "solution": "The problem is to find the steady-state concentrations of the species $p$, $m$, and $M$ for the given system of ordinary differential equations. The steady state, denoted by $(p^{*}, m^{*}, M^{*})$, is the fixed point of the system where all time derivatives are zero. We must also analyze the conditions under which this fixed point is existent, unique, and physically meaningful (i.e., all concentrations are positive).\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{p} - \\delta_{p} p - \\alpha p M\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\beta p - \\delta_{m} m\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\gamma m - \\delta_{M} M\n$$\nAt steady state, we set $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$, $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$, and $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. This yields the following system of algebraic equations for the steady-state concentrations $(p^{*}, m^{*}, M^{*})$:\n$$\nk_{p} - \\delta_{p} p^{*} - \\alpha p^{*} M^{*} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta p^{*} - \\delta_{m} m^{*} = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma m^{*} - \\delta_{M} M^{*} = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\nAll kinetic parameters $k_{p}, \\delta_{p}, \\alpha, \\beta, \\delta_{m}, \\gamma, \\delta_{M}$ are given as positive constants.\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we can express $m^{*}$ in terms of $p^{*}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{m} m^{*} = \\beta p^{*} \\implies m^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta_{m}} p^{*}\n$$\nFrom equation $(3)$, we can express $M^{*}$ in terms of $m^{*}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{M} M^{*} = \\gamma m^{*} \\implies M^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta_{M}} m^{*}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m^{*}$ into the equation for $M^{*}$, we obtain $M^{*}$ in terms of $p^{*}$:\n$$\nM^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta_{M}} \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta_{m}} p^{*} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} p^{*}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $M^{*}$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\nk_{p} - \\delta_{p} p^{*} - \\alpha p^{*} \\left( \\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} p^{*} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation involves only $p^{*}$ and the known parameters. We can rearrange it into a standard quadratic form, $A(p^{*})^{2} + Bp^{*} + C = 0$:\n$$\nk_{p} - \\delta_{p} p^{*} - \\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right) (p^{*})^{2} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and reordering gives:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right) (p^{*})^{2} + \\delta_{p} p^{*} - k_{p} = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $p^{*}$ with coefficients:\n$A = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}$, $B = \\delta_{p}$, and $C = -k_{p}$.\nSince all kinetic parameters are positive, we can ascertain the signs of these coefficients: $A > 0$, $B > 0$, and $C  0$.\n\nThe solutions for $p^{*}$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^{2} - 4AC}}{2A}\n$$\nThe discriminant of this equation is $\\Delta = B^{2} - 4AC$. Substituting the coefficients:\n$$\n\\Delta = (\\delta_{p})^{2} - 4 \\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right) (-k_{p}) = \\delta_{p}^{2} + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_{p}}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}\n$$\nGiven that all parameters are positive, both terms in the discriminant, $\\delta_{p}^{2}$ and $\\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_{p}}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}$, are strictly positive. Therefore, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is always positive. This guarantees the existence of two distinct real roots for $p^{*}$.\n\nThe two roots are:\n$$\np^{*}_{1} = \\frac{-\\delta_{p} + \\sqrt{\\delta_{p}^{2} + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_{p}}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}}}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p^{*}_{2} = \\frac{-\\delta_{p} - \\sqrt{\\delta_{p}^{2} + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_{p}}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}}}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right)}\n$$\nFor a solution to be physically meaningful, the concentration $p^{*}$ must be non-negative.\nLet's analyze the signs of the roots. The denominator $2A = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}} \\right)$ is positive.\nFor the second root, $p^{*}_{2}$, the numerator is $-\\delta_{p} - \\sqrt{\\Delta}$. Since $\\delta_{p} > 0$ and $\\sqrt{\\Delta} > 0$, the numerator is strictly negative. Thus, $p^{*}_{2}  0$, which is physically impossible.\nFor the first root, $p^{*}_{1}$, we analyze the numerator. Since $\\Delta = \\delta_{p}^{2} + \\text{a positive term}$, we have $\\sqrt{\\Delta} > \\sqrt{\\delta_{p}^{2}} = \\delta_{p}$. Therefore, the numerator $-\\delta_{p} + \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is strictly positive. As the denominator is also positive, $p^{*}_{1} > 0$.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that for any set of positive kinetic parameters, there exists a unique, positive, and therefore physically valid, steady-state concentration for $p53$, which we denote simply as $p^{*}$.\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{-\\delta_{p} + \\sqrt{\\delta_{p}^{2} + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_{p}}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}}}{2 \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta_{m}\\delta_{M}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{\\delta_m\\delta_M}{2\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{\\delta_m\\delta_M}{2\\alpha\\beta\\gamma} \\left( -\\delta_p + \\sqrt{\\delta_p^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_p}{\\delta_m\\delta_M}} \\right)\n$$\nSince a unique positive $p^{*}$ exists, unique positive values for $m^{*}$ and $M^{*}$ also exist, as they are related by positive proportionality constants:\n$$\nm^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta_{m}} p^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta_{m}} \\frac{\\delta_m\\delta_M}{2\\alpha\\beta\\gamma} \\left( -\\delta_p + \\sqrt{\\delta_p^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_p}{\\delta_m\\delta_M}} \\right) = \\frac{\\delta_M}{2\\alpha\\gamma} \\left( -\\delta_p + \\sqrt{\\delta_p^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_p}{\\delta_m\\delta_M}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nM^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta_{M}} m^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta_{M}} \\frac{\\delta_M}{2\\alpha\\gamma} \\left( -\\delta_p + \\sqrt{\\delta_p^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_p}{\\delta_m\\delta_M}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} \\left( -\\delta_p + \\sqrt{\\delta_p^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta\\gamma k_p}{\\delta_m\\delta_M}} \\right)\n$$\nIn conclusion, the system possesses a single, non-trivial fixed point $(p^{*}, m^{*}, M^{*})$ with all components being positive for any choice of positive kinetic parameters. No additional conditions on the parameters are required for the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of this fixed point.",
