It presents a standard application of differential calculus to sensitivity analysis within the established framework of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics.

The derivation of the solution will now proceed.\n\nThe solution will be derived by first finding the analytical solution for $x(t,p)$ and then applying the definitions of local and relative sensitivity through partial differentiation.\n\nFirst, we solve the given ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -p\\,x(t)\n$$\nThis is a linear, first-order, separable differential equation. We separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x} = -p\\,dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x} \\,dx = \\int -p \\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|x(t)| = -pt + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides yields:\n$$\n|x(t)| = \\exp(-pt + C) = \\exp(C)\\exp(-pt)\n$$\nLet $A = \\pm \\exp(C)$. Since concentration $x(t)$ and initial concentration $x_0$ are typically non-negative, we can write:\n$$\nx(t) = A\\exp(-pt)\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $x(0)=x_{0}$ to determine the constant $A$:\n$$\nx(0) = A\\exp(-p \\cdot 0) = A \\cdot 1 = x_{0}\n$$\nThus, $A=x_{0}$. The explicit solution for the concentration, showing its dependence on time $t$ and the parameter $p$, is:\n$$\nx(t,p) = x_{0}\\exp(-pt)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the local sensitivity, $S_{x,p}(t)$. By definition, $S_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{\\partial x(t,p)}{\\partial p}$. We differentiate the solution $x(t,p)$ with respect to $p$, holding $t$ and $x_0$ constant:\n$$\nS_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( x_{0}\\exp(-pt) \\right)\n$$\nSince $x_{0}$ is independent of $p$, we can move it outside the derivative:\n$$\nS_{x,p}(t) = x_{0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\exp(-pt) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, where $\\frac{d}{du} \\exp(u) = \\exp(u)$ and the inner function is $u(p) = -pt$, we have $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial p} = -t$. Therefore:\n$$\nS_{x,p}(t) = x_{0} \\left( \\exp(-pt) \\cdot (-t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{x,p}(t) = -t \\cdot x_{0}\\exp(-pt)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expression in terms of $p$, $t$, $x_0$, and $x(t)$. Recognizing that $x(t) = x_{0}\\exp(-pt)$, we can substitute this into the expression for $S_{x,p}(t)$:\n$$\nS_{x,p}(t) = -t \\, x(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we derive the relative sensitivity, $s_{x,p}(t)$. The definition is $s_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\ln x(t,p)}{\\partial \\ln p}$. We can rewrite this using the chain rule for partial derivatives:\n$$\ns_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\ln x}{\\partial p} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\ln p}\n$$\nLet's compute each term separately. First, we find $\\ln x(t,p)$:\n$$\n\\ln x(t,p) = \\ln(x_{0}\\exp(-pt)) = \\ln(x_{0}) + \\ln(\\exp(-pt)) = \\ln(x_{0}) - pt\n$$\nNow, we differentiate this with respect to $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln x(t,p)}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} (\\ln(x_{0}) - pt) = 0 - t = -t\n$$\nFor the second term, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\ln p}$, let $u = \\ln p$. This implies $p = \\exp(u)$. Then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\ln p} = \\frac{dp}{du} = \\frac{d}{du}(\\exp(u)) = \\exp(u) = p\n$$\nCombining these two results, we get the relative sensitivity:\n$$\ns_{x,p}(t) = (-t) \\cdot p = -pt\n$$\nAlternatively, one can use the relationship $s_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{p}{x(t)}S_{x,p}(t)$:\n$$\ns_{x,p}(t) = \\frac{p}{x(t)} \\cdot (-t \\, x(t)) = -pt\n$$\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nThe derived expressions are $S_{x,p}(t) = -t \\, x(t)$ and $s_{x,p}(t) = -pt$.

The kinase stimulus is a known, bounded, smooth input $u(t)$ that is not identically zero. The dynamics follow mass-action kinetics with forward phosphorylation rate proportional to $u(t)$ and backward dephosphorylation rate constant.

The analysis will proceed in three steps as requested: first, the derivation of an input-output relation using differential algebra; second, the determination of parameter identifiability from this relation; and third, an analysis of local sensitivities to explain the relationship between non-zero sensitivity and non-identifiability.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Input-Output Relation**\n\nWe are given the state dynamics for the concentration of the phosphorylated substrate, $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k_1 k_3 u(t) (X_T - x(t)) - k_2 x(t)\n$$\nThe measured output is given by $y(t) = x(t)$. This equality allows for the direct elimination of the unobserved state variable $x(t)$ from the system dynamics. By substituting $y(t)$ for $x(t)$ and, consequently, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ for $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, we obtain the input-output relation:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_1 k_3 u(t) (X_T - y(t)) - k_2 y(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order, nonlinear-in-variables (due to the $u(t)y(t)$ term), non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation that relates the input $u(t)$ and the output $y(t)$ without reference to the internal state $x(t)$. This equation forms the basis for the identifiability analysis.\n\n**2. Structural Identifiability Analysis**\n\nStructural identifiability concerns whether the unknown parameters of a model can be uniquely determined from perfect, noise-free input-output data over a sufficient time interval. To analyze this, we rearrange the input-output equation to group terms by the unknown parameters $(k_1, k_2, k_3)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_1 k_3 X_T u(t) - k_1 k_3 u(t) y(t) - k_2 y(t)\n$$\nLet us rewrite this equation by explicitly showing the parameter groupings that multiply distinct functions of the known input $u(t)$ and measured output $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + k_2 y(t) + (k_1 k_3) u(t) y(t) = (k_1 k_3 X_T) u(t)\n$$\nFor the parameters to be uniquely identifiable, each distinct coefficient multiplying a unique function of the time-varying signals (here, $y(t)$, $u(t)y(t)$, and $u(t)$) must be uniquely determinable. Let us define two composite parameters:\n$$\np_1 = k_2\n$$\n$$\np_2 = k_1 k_3\n$$\nSubstituting these into the input-output equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + p_1 y(t) + p_2 u(t) y(t) = p_2 X_T u(t)\n$$\nFrom this equation, assuming the input $u(t)$ is sufficiently exciting such that the regressors $y(t)$, $u(t)y(t)$, and $u(t)$ are not linearly dependent, one can uniquely determine the coefficients $p_1$ and $p_2$. Note that the coefficient of $u(t)$ is $p_2 X_T$, which is not independent of $p_2$ since $X_T$ is a known constant. This confirms that there are only two identifiable parameter groupings.\n\nNow, we investigate whether we can uniquely recover the original parameters $(k_1, k_2, k_3)$ from the identified composite parameters $(p_1, p_2)$.\n- From $p_1 = k_2$, the parameter $k_2$ is uniquely determined. Therefore, $k_2$ is structurally identifiable.\n- From $p_2 = k_1 k_3$, we have one equation with two unknown parameters, $k_1$ and $k_3$. This equation does not admit a unique solution for $k_1$ and $k_3$. For any given identifiable value $p_2  0$, any pair of positive constants $(k'_1, k'_3)$ satisfying $k'_1 k'_3 = p_2$ will produce the exact same input-output behavior.\n\nThis lack of a unique solution reveals a parameter symmetry. Specifically, if $(k_1, k_3)$ is a valid parameter set, then for any scaling factor $\\alpha  0$, the parameter set $(k'_1, k'_3) = (\\alpha k_1, k_3/\\alpha)$ is observationally equivalent, since their product remains unchanged:\n$$\nk'_1 k'_3 = (\\alpha k_1) \\left(\\frac{k_3}{\\alpha}\\right) = k_1 k_3 = p_2\n$$\nTherefore, the parameters $k_1$ and $k_3$ are structurally non-identifiable. The model as a whole is structurally non-identifiable. The identifiable combinations are $k_2$ and the product $k_1 k_3$.\n\n**3. Local Sensitivity and Non-Identifiability**\n\nLocal sensitivity analysis examines the effect of small parameter perturbations on the model output. The sensitivity of the output $y(t)$ with respect to a parameter $k_i$ is given by the partial derivative $s_i(t) = \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial k_i}$. A non-zero sensitivity $s_i(t)$ indicates that the parameter $k_i$ influences the output. Non-identifiability arises not from a lack of influence (i.e., zero sensitivity), but from a linear dependence among the sensitivity functions of different parameters.\n\nWe derive the sensitivity equations by differentiating the input-output relation with respect to each parameter $k_i$, assuming the initial condition $x_0 = y(0)$ is independent of the parameters, which implies $s_i(0) = \\frac{\\partial y(0)}{\\partial k_i} = 0$.\n\nFor $k_1$: Let $s_1(t) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_1}$.\n$$\n\\frac{ds_1}{dt} = k_3 u(t) (X_T - y) - k_1 k_3 u(t) \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_1} - k_2 \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{ds_1}{dt} + (k_2 + k_1 k_3 u(t)) s_1(t) = k_3 u(t) (X_T - y(t))\n$$\nSince $u(t)$ is not identically zero and $y(t)$ is generally not equal to $X_T$, the driving term on the right-hand side is non-zero. With the initial condition $s_1(0) = 0$, the solution $s_1(t)$ is generally non-zero. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_1} \\neq 0$.\n\nFor $k_3$: Let $s_3(t) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_3}$.\n$$\n\\frac{ds_3}{dt} = k_1 u(t) (X_T - y) - k_1 k_3 u(t) \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_3} - k_2 \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{ds_3}{dt} + (k_2 + k_1 k_3 u(t)) s_3(t) = k_1 u(t) (X_T - y(t))\n$$\nSimilarly, the driving term is non-zero, and thus $s_3(t) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k_3} \\neq 0$.\n\nThe coexistence of non-zero sensitivities with non-identifiability is explained by the linear dependence between the sensitivity vectors $s_1(t)$ and $s_3(t)$. Let us examine the relationship between their respective differential equations.\nThe ODE for $s_1(t)$ is: $\\mathcal{L}[s_1] = g_1(t)$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the linear operator $\\frac{d}{dt} + (k_2 + k_1 k_3 u(t))$ and $g_1(t) = k_3 u(t) (X_T - y(t))$.\nThe ODE for $s_3(t)$ is: $\\mathcal{L}[s_3] = g_3(t)$, where $g_3(t) = k_1 u(t) (X_T - y(t))$.\n\nNotice that $g_3(t) = \\frac{k_1}{k_3} g_1(t)$, which implies $k_1 g_1(t) - k_3 g_3(t) = 0$.\nConsider the linear combination $S(t) = k_1 s_1(t) - k_3 s_3(t)$. Applying the linear operator $\\mathcal{L}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[S(t)] = \\mathcal{L}[k_1 s_1(t) - k_3 s_3(t)] = k_1 \\mathcal{L}[s_1(t)] - k_3 \\mathcal{L}[s_3(t)] = k_1 g_1(t) - k_3 g_3(t) = 0\n$$\nSo, $S(t)$ satisfies the homogeneous differential equation $\\frac{dS}{dt} + (k_2 + k_1 k_3 u(t)) S(t) = 0$. The initial condition is $S(0) = k_1 s_1(0) - k_3 s_3(0) = k_1(0) - k_3(0) = 0$. The unique solution to this initial value problem is $S(t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\nTherefore, we have proven that for all time $t$:\n$$\nk_1 \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial k_1} - k_3 \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial k_3} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad k_1 \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial k_1} = k_3 \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial k_3}\n$$\nThis linear dependence between the sensitivity functions demonstrates that the effects of changing $k_1$ and $k_3$ on the output $y(t)$ are perfectly collinear. An infinitesimal change $dk_1$ can be exactly nullified by a corresponding change $dk_3 = -\\frac{k_3}{k_1} dk_1$, leaving the output unchanged. This relationship corresponds to keeping the product $k_1 k_3$ constant, which is the root of the structural non-identifiability identified earlier. Thus, non-zero sensitivity only implies influence, not distinguishability of influence.\n\nThe single structurally identifiable parameter combination that involves both $k_1$ and $k_3$ is their product, $k_1 k_3$.",
