By calculating the induced metric $\\gamma_{ij}$ and extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$ for a standard foliation, you will verify that flat spacetime yields trivial initial data, where the spatial slices are flat and the extrinsic curvature vanishes.

            "problem": "Consider Minkowski spacetime written in global inertial coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ with line element $ds^{2}=-dt^{2}+dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}$. Perform a $(3+1)$ split using the hypersurfaces $t=\\text{const}$, with lapse $\\alpha=1$ and shift $\\beta^{i}=0$ in geometric units where $G=c=1$. Starting from the covariant definitions appropriate to a $(3+1)$ decomposition in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism, namely that the induced spatial metric on each slice is the pullback of the spacetime metric and that the extrinsic curvature is the negative spatial projection of the covariant derivative of the future-pointing unit normal to the slice, compute the explicit components of the induced spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}$ and the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$ on the $t=\\text{const}$ slices.

            "solution": "The problem requires a $(3+1)$ decomposition of Minkowski spacetime to compute the induced spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}$ and the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$ for a specific slicing, and then to verify that these quantities satisfy the vacuum Einstein constraint equations.\n\nThe spacetime is Minkowski spacetime, described by the line element in global inertial coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$ as:\n$$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$\nThe spacetime metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are:\n$$g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad g^{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe spacetime is foliated by a family of spacelike hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_t$ defined by $t = \\text{const}$. The future-pointing unit normal vector field to these slices, $n^\\mu$, is essential for the decomposition. The gradient of the scalar function $t$ is $\\nabla_\\mu t = \\delta_\\mu^0 = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. The covariant normal vector $n_\\mu$ is related to this gradient by $n_\\mu = -\\alpha \\nabla_\\mu t$. Given the lapse function $\\alpha=1$, we have:\n$$n_\\mu = -1 \\cdot \\delta_\\mu^0 = (-1, 0, 0, 0)$$\nWe can verify that this vector is normalized, $n_\\mu n^\\mu = -1$. The contravariant components are found by raising the index with the metric:\n$$n^\\mu = g^{\\mu\\nu} n_\\nu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} n_\\nu = \\eta^{00} n_0 = (-1)(-1) = 1$$\nSo, $n^\\mu = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. This vector is future-pointing since $n^0 > 0$. The shift vector $\\beta^i$ is given as $\\beta^i = 0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the induced spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}$. The induced metric tensor on the hypersurfaces is the projection of the four-dimensional metric onto the slice, which is defined as:\n$$\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\mu\\nu} + n_\\mu n_\\nu$$\nSubstituting the components of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $n_\\mu$:\n$$\\gamma_{00} = g_{00} + n_0 n_0 = -1 + (-1)(-1) = -1 + 1 = 0$$\n$$\\gamma_{0i} = g_{0i} + n_0 n_i = 0 + (-1)(0) = 0$$\n$$\\gamma_{i0} = g_{i0} + n_i n_0 = 0 + (0)(-1) = 0$$\n$$\\gamma_{ij} = g_{ij} + n_i n_j = \\delta_{ij} + (0)(0) = \\delta_{ij}$$\nHere, indices $i, j$ run from $1$ to $3$ (representing spatial coordinates $x, y, z$), and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The full projection tensor is:\n$$\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe induced spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}$ consists of the spatial components of $\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}$. Therefore:\n$$\\gamma_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the metric of flat three-dimensional Euclidean space, as expected for a spatial slice of Minkowski spacetime.\n\nNext, we compute the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$. The problem defines this as the negative spatial projection of the covariant derivative of the future-pointing unit normal. The full extrinsic curvature tensor is given by $K_{\\mu\\nu} = -\\gamma_\\mu^\\alpha \\nabla_\\alpha n_\\nu$, where $\\gamma_\\mu^\\alpha = \\delta_\\mu^\\alpha + n^\\alpha n_\\mu$ is the projection operator. The components $K_{ij}$ are the spatial components of this tensor.\nThe covariant derivative is $\\nabla_\\alpha n_\\nu = \\partial_\\alpha n_\\nu - \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\alpha\\nu} n_\\lambda$. In Minkowski spacetime with global inertial coordinates, all metric components are constant. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols of the first and second kind are zero: $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\alpha\\nu} = 0$.\nThe covariant derivative simplifies to the partial derivative:\n$$\\nabla_\\alpha n_\\nu = \\partial_\\alpha n_\\nu$$\nThe vector field $n_\\nu = (-1, 0, 0, 0)$ is constant throughout the spacetime. Therefore, its partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate are zero:\n$$\\partial_\\alpha n_\\nu = 0$$\nThis immediately implies that the extrinsic curvature tensor is zero everywhere:\n$$K_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$$\nThe spatial components $K_{ij}$ are therefore also zero:\n$$K_{ij} = 0$$\nThis result signifies that the $t=\\text{const}$ hypersurfaces are \"flatly\" embedded in the flat four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nNow, we must argue why this initial data set $(\\gamma_{ij}, K_{ij})$ trivially satisfies the vacuum Einstein constraint equations. The vacuum constraints are the Hamiltonian constraint and the momentum constraint.\n\nThe Hamiltonian constraint is:\n$$\\mathcal{H} \\equiv R^{(3)} + (\\text{Tr}(K))^2 - K_{ij}K^{ij} = 0$$\nHere, $R^{(3)}$ is the Ricci scalar of the three-metric $\\gamma_{ij}$, $\\text{Tr}(K) = \\gamma^{ij}K_{ij}$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, and $K_{ij}K^{ij} = K_{ij}\\gamma^{ik}\\gamma^{jl}K_{kl}$.\nLet's evaluate each term with our computed data:\n1.  The induced metric is $\\gamma_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, which is the metric of flat Euclidean 3-space. The Riemann curvature tensor for this flat metric is zero. Consequently, its Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar are also zero. Thus, $R^{(3)} = 0$.\n2.  The extrinsic curvature is $K_{ij} = 0$. This implies its trace is zero, $\\text{Tr}(K) = 0$, and the quadratic term $K_{ij}K^{ij}$ is also zero.\nSubstituting these into the Hamiltonian constraint equation gives:\n$$\\mathcal{H} = 0 + (0)^2 - 0 = 0$$\nThe Hamiltonian constraint is satisfied trivially.\n\nThe momentum (or diffeomorphism) constraint is:\n$$\\mathcal{M}_i \\equiv D_j K^j_i - D_i (\\text{Tr}(K)) = 0$$\nHere, $D_j$ is the covariant derivative operator compatible with the three-metric $\\gamma_{ij}$.\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n1.  Since $K_{ij} = 0$, its mixed-index form $K^j_i = \\gamma^{jk}K_{ki}$ is also zero.\n2.  The trace, $\\text{Tr}(K)$, is also zero.\nThe momentum constraint equation becomes:\n$$\\mathcal{M}_i = D_j(0) - D_i(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThe covariant derivative of a zero tensor is zero. Thus, the momentum constraint is also satisfied trivially.\n\nThe initial data for flat Minkowski spacetime in this simple slicing, $(\\gamma_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}, K_{ij}=0)$, is the trivial solution to the vacuum Einstein constraint equations.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the value of the vacuum Hamiltonian constraint scalar $\\mathcal{H}$ evaluated on these slices. As demonstrated in the analysis of the Hamiltonian constraint:\n$$\\mathcal{H} = R^{(3)} + (\\text{Tr}(K))^2 - K_{ij}K^{ij} = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThe value of the Hamiltonian constraint scalar is $0$.",

The term with $g^{0k}$:\nFirst, we find the combination of spatial derivatives:\n$\\partial_k g_{ij} = \\partial_k(2H l_i l_j) = 2((\\partial_k H)l_i l_j + H(\\partial_k l_i)l_j + H l_i(\\partial_k l_j)) = \\frac{2H}{r}(\\delta_{ki}l_j + \\delta_{kj}l_i - 3l_k l_i l_j)$.\nThen, $(\\partial_i g_{kj} + \\partial_j g_{ki} - \\partial_k g_{ij}) = \\frac{2H}{r}[(\\delta_{ik}l_j + \\delta_{ij}l_k - 3l_i l_k l_j) + (\\delta_{jk}l_i + \\delta_{ji}l_k - 3l_j l_k l_i) - (\\delta_{ki}l_j + \\delta_{kj}l_i - 3l_k l_i l_j)] = \\frac{2H}{r}(2\\delta_{ij}l_k - 3l_i l_j l_k)$.\nContracting this with $g^{0k}$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}g^{0k}(\\dots) = \\frac{1}{2}(2H l^k) \\frac{2H}{r}(2\\delta_{ij}l_k - 3l_i l_j l_k) = \\frac{2H^2}{r} l^k(2\\delta_{ij}l_k - 3l_i l_j l_k)$.\nUsing $l^k l_k = 1$:\n$= \\frac{2H^2}{r}(2\\delta_{ij} - 3l_i l_j)$.\n\nSumming the two terms to get $\\Gamma^0_{ij}$:\n$$ \\Gamma^0_{ij} = -\\frac{2H(1+2H)}{r}(\\delta_{ij}-2l_i l_j) + \\frac{2H^2}{r}(2\\delta_{ij}-3l_i l_j) $$\n$$ = \\frac{2H}{r} [ -(1+2H)(\\delta_{ij}-2l_i l_j) + H(2\\delta_{ij}-3l_i l_j) ] $$\n$$ = \\frac{2H}{r} [ (-\\delta_{ij} - 2H\\delta_{ij}) + (2l_i l_j + 4H l_i l_j) + (2H\\delta_{ij} - 3Hl_i l_j) ] $$\n$$ = \\frac{2H}{r} [ -\\delta_{ij} + 2l_i l_j + H l_i l_j ] = \\frac{2H}{r}[-\\delta_{ij} + (2+H)l_i l_j] $$\nFinally, we compute $K_{ij}$ using $K_{ij} = -\\alpha \\Gamma^0_{ij}$ and the given lapse $\\alpha = (1+2H)^{-1/2}$:\n$$ K_{ij} = -(1+2H)^{-1/2} \\left( \\frac{2H}{r}[-\\delta_{ij} + (2+H)l_i l_j] \\right) $$\n$$ K_{ij} = \\frac{2H}{r\\sqrt{1+2H}} [\\delta_{ij} - (2+H)l_i l_j] $$\nExpressing the result explicitly in terms of $M$ and $r$ by substituting $H=M/r$:\n$$ K_{ij} = \\frac{2(M/r)}{r\\sqrt{1+2M/r}} \\left[ \\delta_{ij} - \\left(2+\\frac{M}{r}\\right)l_i l_j \\right] $$\n$$ K_{ij} = \\frac{2M}{r^2\\sqrt{1+2M/r}} \\left[ \\delta_{ij} - \\left(2+\\frac{M}{r}\\right)l_i l_j \\right] $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the extrinsic curvature components.",
