            "problem": "A black hole–neutron star binary is expected to produce an observable electromagnetic counterpart (e.g., a kilonova) only if the neutron star is tidally disrupted outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Consider a system with a nonspinning neutron star of mass $M_{\\text{NS}}$ and radius $R_{\\text{NS}}$ on a quasi-circular, equatorial, prograde orbit around a Kerr black hole of mass $M_{\\text{BH}}$ and dimensionless spin $a \\equiv c J/(G M_{\\text{BH}}^{2})$ aligned with the orbital angular momentum. Assume the neutron star equation of state (EOS) determines $R_{\\text{NS}}$ at fixed $M_{\\text{NS}}$, and neglect neutron-star spin, magnetic fields, and higher-order finite-size corrections beyond the leading-order tidal criterion.\n\nStarting from first principles:\n- Use the tidal disruption threshold defined by equating the black hole’s differential (tidal) gravitational acceleration across the neutron star to the neutron star’s surface self-gravity to obtain the leading-order tidal disruption radius $r_{\\text{t}}(M_{\\text{BH}}, M_{\\text{NS}}, R_{\\text{NS}})$.\n- Use the standard general relativistic expression for the prograde equatorial ISCO radius $r_{\\text{ISCO}}(a)$ of a Kerr black hole, expressed in units of the gravitational radius $G M_{\\text{BH}}/c^{2}$.\n- Impose the marginal disruption condition $r_{\\text{t}} = r_{\\text{ISCO}}$ to define the minimum spin $a_{\\min}$ required for disruption outside the ISCO.\n\nFor the specific system parameters $M_{\\text{BH}} = 5\\,M_{\\odot}$, $M_{\\text{NS}} = 1.4\\,M_{\\odot}$, and $R_{\\text{NS}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{km}$, compute $a_{\\min}$. Round your answer to three significant figures and report it as a dimensionless number. You may use $G M_{\\odot}/c^{2} = 1.4766\\,\\mathrm{km}$. In addition, in your derivation, briefly comment on the sensitivity of $a_{\\min}$ to the neutron star EOS by indicating how $a_{\\min}$ depends on $R_{\\text{NS}}$ at fixed masses (qualitative scaling is sufficient). The final reported value must be only the numerical value of $a_{\\min}$, rounded as instructed, and dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general relativity and astrophysics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the minimum dimensionless spin parameter $a_{\\min}$ of a Kerr black hole (BH) such that a nonspinning neutron star (NS) in a prograde equatorial orbit is tidally disrupted at or outside the black hole's innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). This condition, $r_{\\text{t}} \\ge r_{\\text{ISCO}}$, is a necessary prerequisite for producing an observable kilonova. The marginal case occurs when the tidal disruption radius $r_{\\text{t}}$ is equal to the ISCO radius $r_{\\text{ISCO}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the tidal disruption radius $r_{\\text{t}}$. Following the problem's prescription, we equate the differential tidal acceleration from the BH across the NS to the NS's own surface gravitational acceleration. We use a Newtonian approximation for this leading-order estimate. The gravitational acceleration produced by the BH of mass $M_{\\text{BH}}$ at a distance $r$ is $g_{\\text{BH}}(r) = G M_{\\text{BH}} / r^2$. The differential tidal acceleration, $\\Delta g_{\\text{tidal}}$, across the diameter of the NS (approximated as $2R_{\\text{NS}}$) along the line connecting the centers of the two objects is:\n$$\n\\Delta g_{\\text{tidal}} = g_{\\text{BH}}(r - R_{\\text{NS}}) - g_{\\text{BH}}(r + R_{\\text{NS}}) = \\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{(r - R_{\\text{NS}})^2} - \\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{(r + R_{\\text{NS}})^2}\n$$\nAssuming the orbital separation $r$ is much larger than the NS radius $R_{\\text{NS}}$ ($r \\gg R_{\\text{NS}}$), we can use a Taylor expansion. A simpler and more common approach, which yields the same leading-order result, is to consider the gradient of the gravitational field. The tidal acceleration across the radius of the star is approximately:\n$$\n\\Delta g_{\\text{tidal}} \\approx \\left| \\frac{dg_{\\text{BH}}}{dr} \\right| R_{\\text{NS}} = \\left| \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{r^2}\\right) \\right| R_{\\text{NS}} = \\frac{2 G M_{\\text{BH}}}{r^3} R_{\\text{NS}}\n$$\nThe self-gravitational acceleration at the surface of the NS, which holds the star together against tidal disruption, is:\n$$\ng_{\\text{NS}} = \\frac{G M_{\\text{NS}}}{R_{\\text{NS}}^2}\n$$\nTidal disruption occurs when the tidal acceleration overcomes the self-gravity. The tidal disruption radius $r_{\\text{t}}$ is the distance where these two accelerations are equal:\n$$\n\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{BH}}}{r_{\\text{t}}^3} R_{\\text{NS}} = \\frac{G M_{\\text{NS}}}{R_{\\text{NS}}^2}\n$$\nSolving for $r_{\\text{t}}$, we find:\n$$\nr_{\\text{t}}^3 = \\frac{2 M_{\\text{BH}}}{M_{\\text{NS}}} R_{\\text{NS}}^3 \\implies r_{\\text{t}} = \\left(\\frac{2 M_{\\text{BH}}}{M_{\\text{NS}}}\\right)^{1/3} R_{\\text{NS}}\n$$\n\nNext, we write the expression for the ISCO radius of a Kerr black hole for a prograde equatorial orbit. The radius is typically expressed in dimensionless form, $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}} = r_{\\text{ISCO}} / (G M_{\\text{BH}}/c^2)$. The formula depends on the dimensionless spin parameter $a$:\n$$\n\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a) = 3 + Z_2 - \\sqrt{(3 - Z_1)(3 + Z_1 + 2Z_2)}\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nZ_1 = 1 + (1 - a^2)^{1/3} \\left[ (1+a)^{1/3} + (1-a)^{1/3} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nZ_2 = \\sqrt{3a^2 + Z_1^2}\n$$\nThe physical radius is $r_{\\text{ISCO}}(a) = \\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a) \\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{c^2}$. The function $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a)$ is monotonically decreasing for $a \\in [0, 1]$, from $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(0)=6$ (Schwarzschild) to $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(1)=1$ (extremal Kerr, prograde).\n\nWe now impose the marginal disruption condition, $r_{\\text{t}} = r_{\\text{ISCO}}$, to find the minimum spin $a_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2 M_{\\text{BH}}}{M_{\\text{NS}}}\\right)^{1/3} R_{\\text{NS}} = \\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min}) \\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{c^2}\n$$\nWe can solve for the required dimensionless ISCO radius:\n$$\n\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min}) = \\frac{c^2 R_{\\text{NS}}}{G M_{\\text{BH}}} \\left(\\frac{2 M_{\\text{BH}}}{M_{\\text{NS}}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the specific system parameters: $M_{\\text{BH}} = 5\\,M_{\\odot}$, $M_{\\text{NS}} = 1.4\\,M_{\\odot}$, $R_{\\text{NS}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{km}$, and the conversion constant $G M_{\\odot}/c^2 = 1.4766\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the tidal disruption radius $r_{\\text{t}}$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{M_{\\text{BH}}}{M_{\\text{NS}}} = \\frac{5}{1.4} = \\frac{25}{7}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\text{t}} = (2q)^{1/3} R_{\\text{NS}} = \\left(2 \\times \\frac{25}{7}\\right)^{1/3} (12\\,\\mathrm{km}) \\approx (7.142857)^{1/3} (12\\,\\mathrm{km}) \\approx 1.9257 \\times 12\\,\\mathrm{km} \\approx 23.108\\,\\mathrm{km}\n$$\nNext, calculate the gravitational radius of the black hole:\n$$\n\\frac{G M_{\\text{BH}}}{c^2} = 5 \\times \\frac{G M_{\\odot}}{c^2} = 5 \\times 1.4766\\,\\mathrm{km} = 7.383\\,\\mathrm{km}\n$$\nNow, we find the required dimensionless ISCO radius $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min})$:\n$$\n\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min}) = \\frac{r_{\\text{t}}}{G M_{\\text{BH}}/c^2} = \\frac{23.108\\,\\mathrm{km}}{7.383\\,\\mathrm{km}} \\approx 3.1300\n$$\nWe must now solve the transcendental equation $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min}) = 3.1300$ for $a_{\\min}$. Since an analytical inversion is not straightforward, we solve it numerically. By iteratively testing values of $a$, we find:\n- For $a = 0.75$, $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(0.75) \\approx 3.158$.\n- For $a = 0.80$, $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(0.80) \\approx 2.906$.\nThe target value of $3.1300$ lies between these two. Further refinement through numerical methods (e.g., bisection or interpolation) reveals that $a \\approx 0.756$ results in $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(0.756) \\approx 3.129$. This value is sufficiently close for the required precision. More detailed interpolation yields $a_{\\min} \\approx 0.7558$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get $a_{\\min} = 0.756$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the sensitivity of $a_{\\min}$ to the neutron star equation of state (EOS), which determines $R_{\\text{NS}}$ at a fixed $M_{\\text{NS}}$. The equation for the required ISCO radius is $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min}) \\propto R_{\\text{NS}}$. The function $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the spin $a$. Therefore, if $R_{\\text{NS}}$ increases (corresponding to a \"stiffer\" EOS), the required $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}(a_{\\min})$ also increases. For $\\hat{r}_{\\text{ISCO}}$ to be larger, its argument $a_{\\min}$ must be smaller. Thus, $a_{\\min}$ decreases as $R_{\\text{NS}}$ increases. Physically, a larger, less compact neutron star is disrupted more easily (i.e., at a larger distance), so a less rapidly spinning black hole (with a correspondingly larger ISCO radius) is sufficient to cause disruption outside the ISCO.",

Dividing the equation by $\\hat{H}_0^2 = (c\\hat{z}/\\hat{D}_L)^2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{\\hat{H}_0^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{c}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 \\sigma_z^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\hat{H}_0}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{D_L}^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{\\hat{D}_L^2} \\right]$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\hat{D}_L}{c\\hat{z}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{c}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 \\sigma_z^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{D_L}^2 + \\frac{1}{\\hat{H}_0^2} \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{\\hat{D}_L^2}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_z}{\\hat{z}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{D_L}}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{(c\\hat{z})^2}$$\nThis final expression succinctly captures the three independent sources of uncertainty in quadrature.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $\\sigma_z = 0.0005$, $\\sigma_{D_L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$, and $\\sigma_v = 300\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$.\nThe recession velocity estimate is $c\\hat{z} = (2.99792458 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}) \\times 0.0098 \\approx 2937.97\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$.\nThe squared relative uncertainties are:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_z}{\\hat{z}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.0005}{0.0098}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.002603$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{D_L}}{\\hat{D}_L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{10}{40}\\right)^2 = 0.0625$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_v}{c\\hat{z}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}}{2937.97\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.010427$$\n\nThe total squared relative uncertainty is the sum of these terms:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.002603 + 0.0625 + 0.010427 = 0.07553$$\nThe relative uncertainty is the square root:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0} \\approx \\sqrt{0.07553} \\approx 0.2748$$\nFinally, the absolute uncertainty $\\sigma_{H_0}$ is:\n$$\\sigma_{H_0} = \\hat{H}_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{H_0}}{\\hat{H}_0}\\right) \\approx (73.44915\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}) \\times 0.2748 \\approx 20.1867\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the uncertainty is $\\sigma_{H_0} \\approx 20.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$.\n\nThe point estimate and its $1\\sigma$ uncertainty, rounded to three significant figures, are $73.4\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and $20.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, respectively.",
