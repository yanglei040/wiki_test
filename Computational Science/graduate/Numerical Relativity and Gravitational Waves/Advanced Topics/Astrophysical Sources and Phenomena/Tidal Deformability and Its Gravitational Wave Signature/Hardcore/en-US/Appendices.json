It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and an objective problem in physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts: first, to derive the expression for the dimensionless tidal deformability $\\Lambda$ in terms of the Love number $k_2$ and compactness $C$; second, to compute the numerical value of $\\Lambda$ for a given neutron star; and third, to analyze its sensitivity to the star's radius.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $\\Lambda$ in terms of $k_2$ and $C$**\n\nThe dimensionless tidal deformability $\\Lambda$ is constructed from the dimensional tidal deformability $\\lambda$, the gravitational constant $G$, the star's mass $M$, and the speed of light $c$. We begin by determining the physical dimensions of $\\lambda$. The dimensional tidal deformability relates the induced quadrupole moment $Q_{ij}$ of the star to the external tidal field $\\mathcal{E}_{ij}$ via $Q_{ij} = -\\lambda \\mathcal{E}_{ij}$.\nThe tidal field $\\mathcal{E}_{ij}$ is the second spatial derivative of the external gravitational potential, so its units are acceleration per unit length, or $[T]^{-2}$. The quadrupole moment $Q_{ij}$ has units of mass times length squared, $[M][L]^2$.\nTherefore, the dimensions of $\\lambda$ are:\n$$ [\\lambda] = \\frac{[Q_{ij}]}{[\\mathcal{E}_{ij}]} = \\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^{-2}} = [M][L]^2[T]^2 $$\nWe seek a dimensionless combination of the form $\\Lambda \\propto \\lambda^a M^b G^d c^f$. The dimensions of the constants are $[M]=[M]$, $[G]=[M]^{-1}[L]^3[T]^{-2}$, and $[c]=[L][T]^{-1}$. For $\\Lambda$ to be dimensionless, the exponents must satisfy the following system of linear equations based on the fundamental units of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Mass: $a+b-d = 0$\n    \\item Length: $2a+3d+f = 0$\n    \\item Time: $2a-2d-f = 0$\n\\end{itemize}\nAdding the length and time equations yields $4a+d=0$, which implies $d = -4a$.\nSubstituting $d=-4a$ into the time equation gives $2a-2(-4a)-f=0$, which simplifies to $10a - f=0$, or $f=10a$.\nSubstituting $d=-4a$ into the mass equation gives $a+b-(-4a)=0$, which simplifies to $b+5a=0$, or $b=-5a$.\nBy convention, we set the exponent of $\\lambda$ to $a=1$. This gives the exponents $b=-5$, $d=-4$, and $f=10$.\nThus, the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter $\\Lambda$ is proportional to $\\lambda M^{-5} G^{-4} c^{10}$. The conventionally adopted definition is:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{\\lambda c^{10}}{G^4 M^5} $$\nThe problem states that $\\Lambda$ is also defined from the Love number $k_2$. The standard relation between the dimensional tidal deformability $\\lambda$ and the dimensionless Love number $k_2$, originating from the leading-order near-zone response, is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{k_2 R^5}{G} $$\nwhere $R$ is the star's radius. Substituting this expression for $\\lambda$ into our definition of $\\Lambda$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{k_2 R^5}{G} \\right) \\frac{c^{10}}{G^4 M^5} = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 \\frac{R^5 c^{10}}{G^5 M^5} $$\nFinally, we express this in terms of the compactness $C = GM / (Rc^2)$. We can rewrite the expression for $\\Lambda$ as:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 \\left( \\frac{Rc^2}{GM} \\right)^5 = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 \\left( \\left( \\frac{GM}{Rc^2} \\right)^{-1} \\right)^5 $$\nThis gives the final derived expression for $\\Lambda$ in terms of $k_2$ and $C$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 C^{-5} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation of $\\Lambda$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the neutron star:\n- Mass: $M = 1.4\\,M_{\\odot}$\n- Radius: $R = 12\\,\\mathrm{km}$\n- Love number: $k_2 = 0.09$\nWe are also given the solar gravitational radius, $G M_{\\odot}/c^2 = 1.476625\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the compactness $C$. Using the given values, we can keep units of kilometers for both $GM/c^2$ and $R$, as $C$ is dimensionless.\n$$ C = \\frac{GM}{Rc^2} = \\frac{G(1.4\\,M_{\\odot})}{Rc^2} = 1.4 \\times \\frac{G M_{\\odot}}{c^2} \\times \\frac{1}{R} $$\n$$ C = 1.4 \\times \\frac{1.476625\\,\\mathrm{km}}{12\\,\\mathrm{km}} \\approx 1.4 \\times 0.123052083 \\approx 0.172272917 $$\nNow, we can compute $\\Lambda$ using the derived formula:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 C^{-5} $$\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3} (0.09) (0.172272917)^{-5} = 0.06 \\times (0.172272917)^{-5} $$\n$$ \\Lambda \\approx 0.06 \\times 6590.252 \\approx 395.41512 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\Lambda \\approx 395.4 $$\n\n**Part 3: Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the sensitivity of $\\Lambda$ to an uncertainty in the radius $R$ of $\\Delta R = \\pm 1\\,\\mathrm{km}$, while keeping the mass $M$ and Love number $k_2$ fixed.\nFrom the expression $\\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3} k_2 (GM/(Rc^2))^{-5}$, we can see the dependence on $R$. Since $k_2$, $G$, $M$, and $c$ are constant in this analysis, we have:\n$$ \\Lambda \\propto (R^{-1})^{-5} \\implies \\Lambda \\propto R^5 $$\nThis indicates a very strong dependence of the tidal deformability on the stellar radius. An uncertainty in $R$ is amplified by a power of $5$ in $\\Lambda$.\n\nTo find the factors relating the perturbed values of $\\Lambda$ to the fiducial value $\\Lambda_0$ (at $R_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{km}$), we calculate the ratio $\\Lambda(R)/\\Lambda_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Lambda(R)}{\\Lambda_0} = \\frac{(\\text{const}) \\times R^5}{(\\text{const}) \\times R_0^5} = \\left(\\frac{R}{R_0}\\right)^5 $$\nThe perturbed radii are $R_+ = 12\\,\\mathrm{km} + 1\\,\\mathrm{km} = 13\\,\\mathrm{km}$ and $R_- = 12\\,\\mathrm{km} - 1\\,\\mathrm{km} = 11\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFor the upper bound radius $R_+ = 13\\,\\mathrm{km}$:\nThe factor is $\\left(\\frac{13}{12}\\right)^5 \\approx (1.08333)^5 \\approx 1.4925$.\nThe new tidal deformability would be $\\Lambda_+ \\approx 395.4 \\times 1.4925 \\approx 590.2$.\n\nFor the lower bound radius $R_- = 11\\,\\mathrm{km}$:\nThe factor is $\\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^5 \\approx (0.91667)^5 \\approx 0.6471$.\nThe new tidal deformability would be $\\Lambda_- \\approx 395.4 \\times 0.6471 \\approx 255.9$.\n\nTherefore, a $\\pm 1\\,\\mathrm{km}$ uncertainty on a $12\\,\\mathrm{km}$ radius (an approximately $\\pm 8.3\\%$ relative uncertainty) leads to a substantial range for $\\Lambda$, from approximately $256$ to $590$. This extreme sensitivity is why measurements of tidal deformability from gravitational wave signals provide powerful constraints on the neutron star radius and equation of state.",

Subsequently, this quantity is to be evaluated for a specific binary system.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement finds it to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of General Relativity and gravitational-wave astrophysics. The provided physical parameters are realistic. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe evolution of the binary system's orbit is driven by the emission of gravitational waves, which carry away energy and angular momentum. The energy-flux balance equation, $dE/dt = -\\mathcal{F}$, where $E$ is the binding energy of the binary and $\\mathcal{F}$ is the gravitational-wave energy flux, dictates the rate of the inspiral.\n\nThe phase of the gravitational wave in the frequency domain, $\\Psi(f)$, can be related to the time-domain evolution using the Stationary Phase Approximation (SPA). The fundamental relation is derived from the number of wave cycles, $dN = f dt$. The total phase is $\\Psi = 2\\pi N$. Thus, the phase accumulated over a frequency interval $df$ is $d\\Psi = 2\\pi f dt$. The time $dt$ spent in this interval is given by $dt = (df/dt)^{-1} df = \\dot{f}^{-1} df$. The rate of frequency change, $\\dot{f}$, is obtained from the energy balance:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = \\frac{df}{dt} = \\frac{df}{dE}\\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\mathcal{F} \\frac{df}{dE}\n$$\nThe phase is therefore given by the integral:\n$$\n\\Psi(f) = \\int_{f_0}^{f} 2\\pi f' \\frac{1}{\\dot{f}'} df' = - \\int_{f_0}^{f} 2\\pi f' \\frac{dE/df'}{\\mathcal{F}(f')} df'\n$$\nThe total energy $E$ and flux $\\mathcal{F}$ are expanded in Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections beyond the leading Newtonian terms.

It involves accounting for the conservative interaction energy of the tidally-induced mass quadrupoles and the energy flux radiated by these same quadrupoles. The problem requires us to start from these known terms. The results of such calculations (e.g., by Flanagan & Hinderer, 2008; Damour, Nagar, & Villain, 2012) show that the phase correction integrates to a term proportional to $(\\pi \\mathcal{M} f)^{5/3}$, where $\\mathcal{M} = (m_1 m_2)^{3/5} / (m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$ is the chirp mass. The phase correction is conventionally written as:\n$$\n\\delta\\Psi_T(f) = -\\frac{39}{512\\eta} \\left(\\frac{G \\pi M f}{c^3}\\right)^{5/3} \\tilde{\\Lambda}\n$$\nwhere $M=m_1+m_2$ is the total mass and $\\eta = m_1 m_2 / M^2$ is the symmetric mass ratio. The quantity $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the desired mass-weighted effective tidal deformability. Performing the full integration starting from the 5PN energy and flux corrections yields the following combination of the individual dimensionless deformabilities $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Lambda} = \\frac{16}{13} \\left[ \\frac{(m_1 + 12m_2)m_1^4}{(m_1+m_2)^5}\\Lambda_1 + \\frac{(m_2 + 12m_1)m_2^4}{(m_1+m_2)^5}\\Lambda_2 \\right]\n$$\nThis is the derived combination that controls the leading-order tidal signature in the gravitational waveform.\n\nThe physical origin of this combination lies in the fact that the total tidal effect is a sum of the response of star $1$ to the tidal field of star $2$, and vice versa. The tidal field created by a body of mass $m_B$ on its companion $m_A$ is proportional to $m_B$. The response of star $A$ is proportional to its own deformability, $\\Lambda_A$. The resulting modifications to the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission are complex functions of the masses, leading to the specific weighting factors $(m_1+12m_2)m_1^4$ and $(m_2+12m_1)m_2^4$ seen above.\n\nWe now evaluate $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ for the given binary parameters: $m_1 = 1.2\\,M_{\\odot}$, $m_2 = 1.6\\,M_{\\odot}$, $\\Lambda_1 = 800$, and $\\Lambda_2 = 200$. The mass units ($M_\\odot$) will cancel in the mass-ratio terms.\nThe total mass is $M = m_1+m_2 = 1.2+1.6 = 2.8\\,M_{\\odot}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the two terms inside the brackets:\nThe term for the first star ($m_1, \\Lambda_1$) is:\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{(m_1 + 12m_2)m_1^4}{M^5}\\Lambda_1 = \\frac{(1.2 + 12 \\times 1.6)(1.2)^4}{(2.8)^5} \\times 800\n$$\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{(1.2 + 19.2)(2.0736)}{172.10368} \\times 800 = \\frac{(20.4)(2.0736)}{172.10368} \\times 800 = \\frac{42.29984}{172.10368} \\times 800 \\approx 0.245780 \\times 800 \\approx 196.624\n$$\nThe term for the second star ($m_2, \\Lambda_2$) is:\n$$\nT_2 = \\frac{(m_2 + 12m_1)m_2^4}{M^5}\\Lambda_2 = \\frac{(1.6 + 12 \\times 1.2)(1.6)^4}{(2.8)^5} \\times 200\n$$\n$$\nT_2 = \\frac{(1.6 + 14.4)(6.5536)}{172.10368} \\times 200 = \\frac{(16.0)(6.5536)}{172.10368} \\times 200 = \\frac{104.8576}{172.10368} \\times 200 \\approx 0.609270 \\times 200 \\approx 121.854\n$$\nThe total contribution to the phase is dominated by the star for which the product of its deformability and its specific mass-weighting is largest. In this case, $T_1 \\approx 196.6$ is significantly larger than $T_2 \\approx 121.9$. Therefore, the less massive but more deformable star ($m_1$) provides the dominant contribution to the overall tidal signal. This is a characteristic feature of neutron star binaries, as lower-mass neutron stars are typically predicted to have larger radii and thus much larger tidal deformabilities.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Lambda} = \\frac{16}{13} (T_1 + T_2) = \\frac{16}{13} (196.624 + 121.854) = \\frac{16}{13} (318.478)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Lambda} \\approx 1.230769 \\times 318.478 \\approx 391.9729\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures yields $392.0$.",
