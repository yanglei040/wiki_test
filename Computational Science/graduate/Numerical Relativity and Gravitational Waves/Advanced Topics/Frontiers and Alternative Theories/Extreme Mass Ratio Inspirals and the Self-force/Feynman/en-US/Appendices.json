The goal is to test the adiabatic approximation by comparing the gravitational-wave phase accumulation $\\phi(t)$ computed from a purely dissipative self-force model (radiation reaction only) to a self-consistent evolution including a leading-order conservative piece. Work within the following physically justified and widely used approximations:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-defined problem in the domain of gravitational-wave astrophysics. A validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors were found. The problem asks for the computation of a specific physical observable—the accumulated phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$ due to a conservative post-Newtonian effect—by numerically integrating a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that model the evolution of a binary system undergoing an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI).\n\nThe physical system is modeled by the state vector $\\vec{y}(t) = [a(t), e(t), \\Delta \\phi(t)]$, where $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis, $e$ is the eccentricity, and $\\Delta \\phi$ is the phase difference of interest. The evolution of this state is described by the initial value problem $\\frac{d\\vec{y}}{dt} = \\vec{F}(\\vec{y})$, with initial conditions $\\vec{y}(0) = [a_0, e_0, 0]$. The components of the ODE system $\\vec{F}(\\vec{y})$ are derived from the principles stated in the problem.\n\n1.  **Evolution of the Semi-Major Axis $a(t)$**: The rate of change of the semi-major axis is governed by the energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, given by the Peters-Mathews formula.\n    $$\n    \\frac{da}{dt} = -\\frac{64}{5} \\frac{G^3 m M (m+M)}{c^5} \\frac{1}{a^3 (1-e^2)^{7/2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{73}{24} e^2 + \\frac{37}{96} e^4 \\right)\n    $$\n    Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m$ and $M$ are the masses of the two objects. This equation describes the dissipative decay of the orbit.\n\n2.  **Evolution of the Eccentricity $e(t)$**: The change in eccentricity is also derived from the Peters-Mathews formalism, driven by the loss of orbital angular momentum to gravitational waves.\n    $$\n    \\frac{de}{dt} = -\\frac{304}{15} \\frac{G^3 m M (m+M)}{c^5} \\frac{e}{a^4 (1-e^2)^{5/2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{121}{304} e^2 \\right)\n    $$\n    This equation typically leads to the circularization of the orbit over time. If the initial eccentricity $e_0$ is $0$, the derivative $\\frac{de}{dt}$ is always zero, so the orbit remains circular.\n\n3.  **Evolution of the Phase Difference $\\Delta \\phi(t)$**: The problem defines the phase difference $\\Delta \\phi(t)$ as the integral of the additional phase accumulated per unit time due to the leading-order conservative periastron advance. The rate of change is therefore the integrand itself:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\Delta \\phi)}{dt} = 2 \\, n(a) \\, k(a,e)\n    $$\n    The terms $n(a)$ and $k(a,e)$ are the orbital mean motion and the 1PN periastron advance factor, respectively:\n    $$\n    n(a) = \\sqrt{\\frac{G (m+M)}{a^3}}, \\quad k(a,e) = \\frac{3 G (m+M)}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}\n    $$\n    Substituting these into the derivative yields the ODE for the phase difference:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\Delta \\phi)}{dt} = \\frac{6 (G(m+M))^{3/2}}{c^2 a^{5/2} (1 - e^2)}\n    $$\n\nThis system of three coupled, first-order ODEs forms a complete initial value problem that can be solved numerically. The algorithmic approach is as follows:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants ($G$, $c$, $M_{\\odot}$) and system parameters ($M$, $m$). From these, calculate the total mass $M_{tot} = M+m$ and the gravitational radius of the primary black hole, $r_g = GM/c^2$.\n2.  For each test case, specified by the initial parameters $(a_0, e_0, \\iota, T)$:\n    a. Convert the initial semi-major axis $a_0$, given in units of $r_g$, into meters.\n    b. Set the initial state vector $\\vec{y}_0 = [a_0[\\text{m}], e_0, 0]$. The initial phase difference $\\Delta\\phi(0)$ is $0$. The inclination $\\iota$ is extraneous to the dynamics in this simplified model.\n    c. Implement a function that calculates the vector of derivatives, $\\frac{d\\vec{y}}{dt} = [\\frac{da}{dt}, \\frac{de}{dt}, \\frac{d(\\Delta \\phi)}{dt}]$, for a given state $\\vec{y}=[a, e, \\Delta\\phi]$.\n    d. Employ a robust numerical ODE solver, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to integrate the system from time $t=0$ to the final time $t=T$, starting from the initial state $\\vec{y}_0$.\n    e. From the solver's output, extract the value of the third state variable, $\\Delta\\phi$, at the final time $T$.\n3.  Arrange the computed values of $\\Delta\\phi(T)$ from all test cases into a single list and print it in the specified format.\n\nThis structured methodology ensures a correct and numerically stable solution. Using an adaptive solver like the default Runge-Kutta 4(5) method in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` is well-suited for this problem, as it can adjust its step size to maintain accuracy as the orbital parameters evolve and the characteristic timescales of the system change.",

Explicitly, compute $\\Delta\\phi=\\Big(\\mathrm{unwrap}\\big(\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}-\\phi_{h}^{\\rm base}\\big)\\Big)\\big|_{t=T}-\\Big(\\mathrm{unwrap}\\big(\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}-\\phi_{h}^{\\rm base}\\big)\\Big)\\big|_{t=0}$, in radians.\n- Estimate the Fourier-domain signature of the phase jump in the spectrum of $h(t)$ from the resonant run by computing the discrete Fourier transform of $h(t)$ on the interval $[0,T]$ with uniform sampling of step $\\Delta t$. Let $\\tilde{h}_{k}$ be the one-sided discrete Fourier transform magnitudes and let $k_{0}$ be the index of the largest nonzero-frequency bin. Define the sideband ratio $r$ as the average magnitude of the two immediate neighboring bins relative to the peak, namely $r=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}-1}\\big|+\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}+1}\\big|}{\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}}\\big|}$, with appropriate one-sided boundary handling so that if $k_{0}$ lies at a boundary, use the single available neighbor. Report $r$ as a dimensionless float.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Action-angle Hamiltonian structure and definitions of actions and angles.\n- Slow dissipative drift due to the gravitational self-force encoded as $\\dot{\\vec{J}}=\\varepsilon\\,\\vec{f}(\\vec{J})$, with the supplied constant-rate model.\n- Angle evolution given by their instantaneous frequencies $\\dot{q}_{i}=\\omega_{i}(\\vec{J})$ and a small resonant perturbation proportional to $\\varepsilon\\,\\kappa\\,\\cos\\psi$.\n- The Fourier transform and the definition of spectral peaks and neighboring bins.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use a fixed-step, deterministic numerical integrator appropriate for smooth ordinary differential equations to advance the angles $q_{r}(t)$ and $q_{\\theta}(t)$ on a uniform time grid $t_{n}=n\\,\\Delta t$ for $n=0,1,\\dots,N$, with $T=N\\,\\Delta t$.\n- At each substep, use the exact linear-in-time expressions for $J_{r}(t)$ and $J_{\\theta}(t)$ implied by the constant drift.\n- Unwrap phases in radians when computing $\\Delta\\phi$.\n- Compute the one-sided discrete Fourier spectrum of $h(t)$ over the full interval $[0,T]$ with uniform sampling $\\Delta t$ to obtain the sideband ratio $r$ as defined above.\n\nConstants common to all test cases:\n- $n_{r}=3$, $n_{\\theta}=2$.\n- $m_{r}=3$, $m_{\\theta}=2$.\n- $\\varepsilon=10^{-3}$.\n- $a_{r}=0.35$, $b_{r}=0.02$, $a_{\\theta}=0.5$, $b_{\\theta}=0.01$.\n- Initial actions $J_{r}(0)=1.0$, $J_{\\theta}(0)=0.8$.\n- Initial angles $q_{r}(0)=0$, $q_{\\theta}(0)=0$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each case, specify $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)$ as follows. All angles are in radians; times are in the same dimensionless units consistently with the dynamics.\n\n- Case $1$ (typical crossing): $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)=(0.5,0.05,0.05,5000.0,0.5)$.\n- Case $2$ (weak resonance): $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)=(0.5,0.05,0.005,5000.0,0.5)$.\n- Case $3$ (slow sweep, enhanced capture): $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)=(0.1,0.01,0.05,20000.0,0.5)$.\n- Case $4$ (no crossing within window): $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)=(-0.5,-0.05,0.05,5000.0,0.5)$.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each case, integrate the resonant system (with given $\\kappa>0$) and the baseline system (with $\\kappa=0$), compute $\\Delta\\phi$ and $r$ as defined above, and collect the pair $[\\Delta\\phi,r]$ as floats.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists, in the exact format $[[\\Delta\\phi_{1},r_{1}],[\\Delta\\phi_{2},r_{2}],[\\Delta\\phi_{3},r_{3}],[\\Delta\\phi_{4},r_{4}]]$.\n\nAll numeric outputs must be in radians for $\\Delta\\phi$ and dimensionless for $r$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a simplified but coherent toy model for studying transient resonances in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a valid and important topic in gravitational wave physics. The governing equations, initial conditions, and required computations are specified unambiguously. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the equations of motion for the action-angle variables of a simplified EMRI system. The actions, $\\vec{J}(t) = (J_{r}(t), J_{\\theta}(t))$, evolve according to a prescribed linear drift:\n$$\nJ_{r}(t) = J_{r}(0) - \\varepsilon\\,\\gamma_{r}\\,t\n$$\n$$\nJ_{\\theta}(t) = J_{\\theta}(0) - \\varepsilon\\,\\gamma_{\\theta}\\,t\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon=10^{-3}$ is a small parameter, and $\\gamma_{r}$ and $\\gamma_{\\theta}$ are constant drift coefficients. The initial actions are $J_{r}(0)=1.0$ and $J_{\\theta}(0)=0.8$.\n\nThe fundamental orbital frequencies, $\\omega_r$ and $\\omega_\\theta$, depend linearly on the actions:\n$$\n\\omega_{r}(J_{r}) = a_{r} + b_{r} J_{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{\\theta}(J_{\\theta}) = a_{\\theta} + b_{\\theta} J_{\\theta}\n$$\nwith constants $a_{r}=0.35$, $b_{r}=0.02$, $a_{\\theta}=0.5$, and $b_{\\theta}=0.01$. Substituting the expressions for $J_r(t)$ and $J_\\theta(t)$ yields time-dependent frequencies which drive the evolution of the angle variables $\\vec{q}(t) = (q_{r}(t), q_{\\theta}(t))$.\n\nThe angles evolve according to the following system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dq_r}{dt} = \\omega_{r}(J_{r}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dq_\\theta}{dt} = \\omega_{\\theta}(J_{\\theta}(t)) + \\varepsilon\\,\\kappa\\,\\cos(\\psi(t))\n$$\nwhere the initial conditions are $q_r(0)=0$ and $q_\\theta(0)=0$. The resonant phase is $\\psi(t) = n_{r}\\,q_{r}(t) - n_{\\theta}\\,q_{\\theta}(t)$, with the resonance defined by the integer ratio $n_r:n_\\theta = 3:2$. The parameter $\\kappa$ controls the strength of the resonant perturbation.\n\nThe problem requires numerical integration of this system. A fixed-step, fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is an appropriate choice for this non-autonomous but smooth system of ODEs. The state vector is $\\vec{q}=(q_r, q_\\theta)$, and the derivative function $\\vec{F}(t, \\vec{q})$ is given by the right-hand sides of the angle evolution equations. An integration step from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is performed as:\n$$\n\\vec{k}_1 = \\Delta t \\, \\vec{F}(t_n, \\vec{q}_n)\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{k}_2 = \\Delta t \\, \\vec{F}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\vec{q}_n + \\frac{\\vec{k}_1}{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{k}_3 = \\Delta t \\, \\vec{F}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\vec{q}_n + \\frac{\\vec{k}_2}{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{k}_4 = \\Delta t \\, \\vec{F}(t_n + \\Delta t, \\vec{q}_n + \\vec{k}_3)\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{q}_{n+1} = \\vec{q}_n + \\frac{1}{6}(\\vec{k}_1 + 2\\vec{k}_2 + 2\\vec{k}_3 + \\vec{k}_4)\n$$\nAt each evaluation of $\\vec{F}$, the actions $J_r(t)$ and $J_\\theta(t)$ are calculated from their exact linear-in-time expressions.\n\nFor each test case specified by $(\\gamma_{r},\\gamma_{\\theta},\\kappa,T,\\Delta t)$, the following procedure is executed:\n1.  **Baseline Integration**: The ODE system is integrated from $t=0$ to $t=T$ with the perturbation strength set to $\\kappa=0$. This yields the baseline angle histories $q_{r}^{\\rm base}(t)$ and $q_{\\theta}^{\\rm base}(t)$.\n2.  **Resonant Integration**: The integration is repeated with the given non-zero value of $\\kappa$. This yields the resonant angle histories $q_{r}^{\\rm res}(t)$ and $q_{\\theta}^{\\rm res}(t)$.\n3.  **Phase Jump Calculation**: The gravitational wave phases for both runs are computed using $\\phi_{h}(t)=m_{r}\\,q_{r}(t)+m_{\\theta}\\,q_{\\theta}(t)$, where $m_r=3$ and $m_\\theta=2$. The phase difference, $\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}(t)-\\phi_{h}^{\\rm base}(t)$, is calculated at each time step. The `numpy.unwrap` function is applied to this difference to resolve $2\\pi$ ambiguities. The total phase jump, $\\Delta\\phi$, is the difference between the final and initial values of this unwrapped phase difference.\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\Big(\\mathrm{unwrap}\\big(\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}-\\phi_{h}^{\\rm base}\\big)\\Big)\\big|_{t=T} - \\Big(\\mathrm{unwrap}\\big(\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}-\\phi_{h}^{\\rm base}\\big)\\Big)\\big|_{t=0}\n$$\n4.  **Sideband Ratio Calculation**: The toy gravitational wave strain for the resonant case is computed as $h(t)=\\cos(\\phi_{h}^{\\rm res}(t))$. A one-sided discrete Fourier transform of the time series $h(t)$ is computed using `numpy.fft.rfft`. The magnitudes of the transform components, $|\\tilde{h}_k|$, are found. The index $k_0$ of the largest magnitude in the non-zero frequency part of the spectrum (i.e., for $k \\ge 1$) is identified. The sideband ratio, $r$, is calculated as the average magnitude of the immediate neighbors of the peak bin, normalized by the peak magnitude.\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}-1}\\big|+\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}+1}\\big|}{\\big|\\tilde{h}_{k_{0}}\\big|}\n$$\nAppropriate boundary handling is applied: if $k_0=1$, the neighbor at $k=0$ (DC component) is ignored and $r = |\\tilde{h}_2|/|\\tilde{h}_1|$. If $k_0$ is the last element in the spectrum, $r = |\\tilde{h}_{k_0-1}|/|\\tilde{h}_{k_0}|$.\n\nThis complete procedure is applied to each of the four test cases provided, and the resulting pairs $[\\Delta\\phi, r]$ are collected. The final output is a list of these pairs, formatted as specified.",
