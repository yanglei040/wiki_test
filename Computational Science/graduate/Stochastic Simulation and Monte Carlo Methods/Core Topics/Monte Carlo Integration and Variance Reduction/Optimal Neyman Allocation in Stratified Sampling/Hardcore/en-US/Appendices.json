            "problem": "A research team plans a stratified Monte Carlo survey to estimate a population mean using Stratified Sampling within the context of Stochastic Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods. The population is partitioned into $H=4$ strata with stratum sizes $\\left(N_{h}\\right)=\\left(1000,2000,500,1500\\right)$ and corresponding stratum standard deviations $\\left(S_{h}\\right)=\\left(2,5,1,3\\right)$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. All necessary data and constraints are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is a standard application of optimization in stratified sampling theory. Therefore, it is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the sample allocation $(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ that minimizes the variance of the stratified mean estimator, subject to a fixed total sample size $n$.\n\nFirst, let us define the key quantities. The total population is partitioned into $H$ strata. Let $N_h$ be the size of stratum $h$, and $N = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} N_h$ be the total population size. The stratum weight is defined as $W_h = N_h / N$. The population mean $\\mu$ can be expressed as a weighted average of the stratum means $\\mu_h$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h}{N} \\mu_h = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\mu_h\n$$\nThe stratified estimator for the population mean, $\\hat{\\mu}_{st}$, is constructed by taking a simple random sample of size $n_h$ from each stratum $h$ and computing the sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$. The estimator is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{st} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\n$$\nThis estimator is unbiased. Using the linearity of expectation and the fact that an in-stratum sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$ is an unbiased estimator of the stratum mean $\\mu_h$ (i.e., $E[\\bar{y}_h] = \\mu_h$):\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\mu}_{st}] = E\\left[\\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\\right] = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h E[\\bar{y}_h] = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\mu_h = \\mu\n$$\nThe variance of the stratified estimator is derived based on the independence of samples across strata. This allows the variance of the sum to be the sum of the variances:\n$$\nV(\\hat{\\mu}_{st}) = V\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} V(W_h \\bar{y}_h) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h^2 V(\\bar{y}_h)\n$$\nThe variance of the sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$ from a stratum of size $N_h$ with standard deviation $S_h$ is given by $V(\\bar{y}_h) = \\frac{S_h^2}{n_h} \\left(1 - \\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)$, where the term $\\left(1 - \\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)$ is the finite population correction (FPC). The problem specifies to ignore the FPC, which is equivalent to assuming sampling is done with replacement or that the sampling fractions $n_h/N_h$ are negligible. This yields the approximation:\n$$\nV(\\bar{y}_h) \\approx \\frac{S_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nThus, the variance to be minimized, which we denote by $V$, is:\n$$\nV(n_1, \\dots, n_H) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to minimize this variance subject to the constraint of a fixed total sample size $n$:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad V = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\sum_{h=1}^{H} n_h = n\n$$\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(n_1, \\dots, n_H, \\lambda) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h} + \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} n_h - n\\right)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives with respect to each $n_h$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_h} = -\\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^2} + \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad n_h^2 = \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{\\lambda}\n$$\nAssuming $W_h, S_h, n_h$ are positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nn_h = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\n$$\nThis shows that the optimal allocation $n_h^*$ is proportional to $W_h S_h$. To find the value of $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$, we use the constraint $\\sum n_h = n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{h=1}^{H} n_h = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h S_h = n\n$$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{H} W_j S_j}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $n_h$, we obtain the optimal allocation, known as Neyman allocation:\n$$\nn_h^* = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\left( \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{H} W_j S_j}{n} \\right)} = n \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sum_{j=1}^{H} W_j S_j}\n$$\nSince $W_h = N_h/N$, this is equivalent to $n_h^* = n \\frac{N_h S_h}{\\sum_{j=1}^{H} N_j S_j}$.\n\nNow, we apply this to the given data:\n$H=4$, $n=400$.\nStratum sizes: $(N_h) = (1000, 2000, 500, 1500)$.\nStratum standard deviations: $(S_h) = (2, 5, 1, 3)$.\n\nFirst, calculate the products $N_h S_h$ for each stratum:\n$N_1 S_1 = 1000 \\times 2 = 2000$.\n$N_2 S_2 = 2000 \\times 5 = 10000$.\n$N_3 S_3 = 500 \\times 1 = 500$.\n$N_4 S_4 = 1500 \\times 3 = 4500$.\n\nThe sum is $\\sum_{h=1}^{4} N_h S_h = 2000 + 10000 + 500 + 4500 = 17000$.\n\nNow, we compute the optimal allocations $n_h^*$:\n$n_1^* = n \\frac{N_1 S_1}{\\sum N_j S_j} = 400 \\times \\frac{2000}{17000} = 400 \\times \\frac{2}{17} = \\frac{800}{17}$.\n$n_2^* = n \\frac{N_2 S_2}{\\sum N_j S_j} = 400 \\times \\frac{10000}{17000} = 400 \\times \\frac{10}{17} = \\frac{4000}{17}$.\n$n_3^* = n \\frac{N_3 S_3}{\\sum N_j S_j} = 400 \\times \\frac{500}{17000} = 400 \\times \\frac{5}{170} = 400 \\times \\frac{1}{34} = \\frac{200}{17}$.\n$n_4^* = n \\frac{N_4 S_4}{\\sum N_j S_j} = 400 \\times \\frac{4500}{17000} = 400 \\times \\frac{45}{170} = 400 \\times \\frac{9}{34} = \\frac{1800}{17}$.\n\nThe optimal allocation vector $(n_h^*)$ is $\\left(\\frac{800}{17}, \\frac{4000}{17}, \\frac{200}{17}, \\frac{1800}{17}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we compute the minimized variance, $V_{min}$, by substituting $n_h^*$ into the variance formula:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^*} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sum_{j} W_j S_j}} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h S_h (\\sum_{j} W_j S_j)}{n} = \\frac{(\\sum_{h} W_h S_h)(\\sum_{j} W_j S_j)}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h S_h\\right)^2\n$$\nTo calculate this, we first need the stratum weights $W_h$.\nTotal population size $N = 1000 + 2000 + 500 + 1500 = 5000$.\n$W_1 = 1000/5000 = 1/5$.\n$W_2 = 2000/5000 = 2/5$.\n$W_3 = 500/5000 = 1/10$.\n$W_4 = 1500/5000 = 3/10$.\n\nNow compute the sum $\\sum_{h=1}^{4} W_h S_h$:\n$\\sum W_h S_h = \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{10} \\times 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{10} \\times 3\\right)$\n$= \\frac{2}{5} + 2 + \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{20}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{34}{10} = \\frac{17}{5}$.\n\nFinally, calculate the minimal variance:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{4} W_h S_h\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{400}\\left(\\frac{17}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{400} \\times \\frac{289}{25} = \\frac{289}{10000}\n$$\nThe optimal allocation is $(n_1^*, n_2^*, n_3^*, n_4^*) = \\left(\\frac{800}{17}, \\frac{4000}{17}, \\frac{200}{17}, \\frac{1800}{17}\\right)$ and the resulting minimum variance is $\\frac{289}{10000}$.",

Subsequently, we must analyze the behavior of the optimal sample size for a particular stratum, $n_k^*$, as its per-unit sampling cost, $c_k$, approaches infinity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe given quantities and conditions are:\n- Number of strata: $L \\geq 2$.\n- Stratum sizes: $N_1, \\ldots, N_L$.\n- Total population size: $N = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} N_h$.\n- Stratum standard deviations: $S_h \\in (0, \\infty)$ for $h=1, \\ldots, L$.\n- Stratum weights: $W_h = N_h/N \\in (0,1)$ for $h=1, \\ldots, L$.\n- Stratum sample sizes: $n_h \\in (0, \\infty)$ for $h=1, \\ldots, L$.\n- Per-unit sampling costs: $c_h \\in (0, \\infty)$ for $h=1, \\ldots, L$.\n- Total budget: $C > 0$.\n- Cost constraint: $\\sum_{h=1}^{L} c_h n_h = C$.\n- Variance of the stratified estimator (objective function to minimize): $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) \\approx V(n_1, \\ldots, n_L) = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}$.\n- The finite population correction is assumed to be negligible.\n- All $W_h, S_h, c_h$ and $C$ are treated as known, deterministic, positive constants.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It describes the classical problem of optimal allocation in stratified sampling, often referred to as Neyman allocation modified for variable costs, a standard topic in survey sampling theory and statistics. The objective function and the linear cost constraint are standard. The problem is well-posed: it is a convex optimization problem (the objective function is a sum of convex functions $1/n_h$ and the constraint domain is linear) which guarantees a unique minimum. The notation is standard and all terms are clearly defined. The problem is self-contained and consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Optimal Allocation\nWe need to minimize the variance $V = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}$ subject to the cost constraint $\\sum_{h=1}^{L} c_h n_h = C$. The sample sizes $n_h$ must be positive. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(n_1, \\ldots, n_L, \\lambda) = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h} + \\lambda \\left( \\left( \\sum_{h=1}^{L} c_h n_h \\right) - C \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nTo find the minimum, we compute the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_h$ and set them to zero. These are the first-order optimality conditions. For each $h \\in \\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_h} = -\\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^2} + \\lambda c_h = 0\n$$\nSince $W_h, S_h, c_h$ are all positive and we are looking for a solution with $n_h > 0$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$\n\\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^2} = \\lambda c_h \\implies n_h^2 = \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{\\lambda c_h}\n$$\nTaking the square root (we need $n_h > 0$), we get:\n$$\nn_h = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{c_h}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the optimal sample size $n_h^*$ is proportional to $W_h S_h / \\sqrt{c_h}$. To find the constant of proportionality (which depends on $\\lambda$), we substitute this expression for $n_h$ back into the cost constraint equation:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{L} c_j n_j = C \\implies \\sum_{j=1}^{L} c_j \\left( \\frac{W_j S_j}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{c_j}} \\right) = C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} = C\n$$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ back into the equation for $n_h$:\n$$\nn_h^* = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{c_h}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{c_h}} \\cdot \\frac{C}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the optimal allocation for each stratum $h$:\n$$\nn_h^* = C \\frac{W_h S_h / \\sqrt{c_h}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Limit of $n_k^*$\nWe are asked to find the limit of $n_k^*$ as the cost $c_k$ for a specific stratum $k$ diverges, i.e., $c_k \\to \\infty$, while all other costs $c_j$ ($j \\neq k$) and all $W_j, S_j$ and $C$ remain fixed.\n\nThe expression for $n_k^*$ is:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = C \\frac{W_k S_k / \\sqrt{c_k}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\nTo analyze the limit, we can split the sum in the denominator to isolate the term containing $c_k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} = \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq k} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} \\right) + W_k S_k \\sqrt{c_k}\n$$\nLet's define a constant $A = \\sum_{j \\neq k} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}$. Since all $W_j, S_j, c_j$ for $j \\neq k$ are fixed positive values, $A$ is a positive constant. Also, let $B = W_k S_k$, which is another positive constant. The expression for $n_k^*$ becomes:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = C \\frac{B / \\sqrt{c_k}}{A + B \\sqrt{c_k}}\n$$\nTo simplify for the limit evaluation, we can write this as:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = \\frac{C B}{ \\sqrt{c_k} (A + B \\sqrt{c_k}) } = \\frac{C B}{A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the limit of this expression as $c_k \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} n_k^*(c_k) = \\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} \\frac{C B}{A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k}\n$$\nThe numerator is the positive constant $CB$.\nThe denominator is the sum of two terms, $A \\sqrt{c_k}$ and $B c_k$. As $c_k \\to \\infty$, both terms go to infinity. Thus, the entire denominator goes to infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} (A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k) = \\infty\n$$\nTherefore, the limit of the expression is a constant divided by infinity, which is zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} n_k^*(c_k) = 0\n$$\nThis result indicates that as the cost of sampling in a particular stratum becomes prohibitively expensive, the optimal allocation dictates that the number of samples taken from that stratum should approach zero.",

The problem is to minimize the worst-case variance of the stratified mean estimator, $\\hat{\\mu}_{st} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{Y}_h$.\n\nUnder the assumption of negligible sampling fractions, the variance of this estimator is given by:\n$$ V(\\hat{\\mu}_{st}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 \\sigma_h^2}{n_h} $$\nThe problem is a minimax problem, where we seek to minimize this variance with respect to the allocation $\\{n_h\\}$ while nature (the adversary) chooses the values of $\\{\\sigma_h\\}$ from their uncertainty sets to maximize the variance. The formulation is:\n$$ \\min_{\\{n_h\\}} \\max_{\\{\\sigma_h\\}} \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 \\sigma_h^2}{n_h} $$\nsubject to the constraints:\n1. $\\sum_{h=1}^{4} n_h = n = 180$\n2. $n_h \\ge n_h^{\\min} = 10$ for $h=1,2,3,4$\n3. $\\sigma_h \\in [(1-\\delta)\\hat{\\sigma}_{h}, (1+\\delta)\\hat{\\sigma}_{h}]$ for $h=1,2,3,4$, where $\\delta=0.1$.\n\nFirst, we solve the inner maximization problem for a fixed allocation $\\{n_h\\}$. To maximize the variance, we must choose the value of each $\\sigma_h$ from its uncertainty set that makes the sum largest. Since all terms $\\frac{W_h^2 \\sigma_h^2}{n_h}$ are non-negative, we can maximize the sum by maximizing each term individually. The term for stratum $h$ is maximized when $\\sigma_h^2$ is maximized, which occurs when $\\sigma_h$ is at its maximum possible value.\nThe worst-case standard deviation for stratum $h$ is $\\sigma_h^{WC} = (1+\\delta)\\hat{\\sigma}_h$.\n\nThe worst-case variance is therefore:\n$$ V_{WC}(\\{n_h\\}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 ((1+\\delta)\\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h} = (1+\\delta)^2 \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 \\hat{\\sigma}_h^2}{n_h} $$\nNow, we solve the outer minimization problem. We need to find the allocation $\\{n_h\\}$ that minimizes $V_{WC}(\\{n_h\\})$ subject to the budget and minimum sample size constraints.\n$$ \\min_{\\{n_h\\}} (1+\\delta)^2 \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 \\hat{\\sigma}_h^2}{n_h} $$\nThe constant positive factor $(1+\\delta)^2$ does not affect the optimal allocation $\\{n_h\\}$. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{(W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h}$. This is the standard form of the optimal allocation problem (Neyman allocation), where the allocation $n_h$ is proportional to $W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the products $W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h$:\n- $W_1 \\hat{\\sigma}_1 = 0.1 \\times 3 = 0.3$\n- $W_2 \\hat{\\sigma}_2 = 0.2 \\times 7 = 1.4$\n- $W_3 \\hat{\\sigma}_3 = 0.5 \\times 2 = 1.0$\n- $W_4 \\hat{\\sigma}_4 = 0.2 \\times 4 = 0.8$\n\nThe sum of these products is $\\sum_{k=1}^{4} W_k \\hat{\\sigma}_k = 0.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 0.8 = 3.5$.\n\nThe ideal (unconstrained, non-integer) allocation $n_h^*$ is given by:\n$$ n_h^* = n \\frac{W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h}{\\sum_{k=1}^{4} W_k \\hat{\\sigma}_k} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n- $n_1^* = 180 \\times \\frac{0.3}{3.5} = \\frac{54}{3.5} = \\frac{108}{7} \\approx 15.4286$\n- $n_2^* = 180 \\times \\frac{1.4}{3.5} = 180 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 72$\n- $n_3^* = 180 \\times \\frac{1.0}{3.5} = \\frac{180}{3.5} = \\frac{360}{7} \\approx 51.4286$\n- $n_4^* = 180 \\times \\frac{0.8}{3.5} = \\frac{144}{3.5} = \\frac{288}{7} \\approx 41.1429$\n\nNext, we check if these allocations satisfy the minimum size constraint $n_h \\ge 10$.\n- $n_1^* \\approx 15.43 > 10$\n- $n_2^* = 72 > 10$\n- $n_3^* \\approx 51.43 > 10$\n- $n_4^* \\approx 41.14 > 10$\nAll constraints are satisfied, so no reallocation is necessary. The ideal proportions are maintained.\n\nFinally, we must convert this real-valued allocation to an integer allocation $(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ with a total of $180$ samples, using the largest remainder method.\nThe integer parts of the allocations are:\n- $\\lfloor n_1^* \\rfloor = 15$\n- $\\lfloor n_2^* \\rfloor = 72$\n- $\\lfloor n_3^* \\rfloor = 51$\n- $\\lfloor n_4^* \\rfloor = 41$\n\nThe sum of these integer parts is $15 + 72 + 51 + 41 = 179$. We have a remainder of $180 - 179 = 1$ sample to allocate.\nThe fractional remainders are:\n- Remainder for $n_1$: $n_1^* - \\lfloor n_1^* \\rfloor = \\frac{108}{7} - 15 = \\frac{108-105}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4286$\n- Remainder for $n_2$: $n_2^* - \\lfloor n_2^* \\rfloor = 72 - 72 = 0$\n- Remainder for $n_3$: $n_3^* - \\lfloor n_3^* \\rfloor = \\frac{360}{7} - 51 = \\frac{360-357}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4286$\n- Remainder for $n_4$: $n_4^* - \\lfloor n_4^* \\rfloor = \\frac{288}{7} - 41 = \\frac{288-287}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.1429$\n\nThere is a tie for the largest remainder between stratum $1$ and stratum $3$. The problem does not specify a tie-breaking rule. A scientifically principled tie-breaker is to allocate the extra sample to the stratum where it will yield the largest decrease in variance. The marginal decrease in the objective function $\\sum \\frac{(W_h\\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h}$ by adding one sample to an allocation of $n_h$ is $\\frac{(W_h\\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h} - \\frac{(W_h\\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h+1} = \\frac{(W_h\\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h(n_h+1)}$.\nWe compare this value for $h=1$ (with $n_1=15$) and $h=3$ (with $n_3=51$).\n- For $h=1$: $\\frac{(W_1\\hat{\\sigma}_1)^2}{n_1(n_1+1)} = \\frac{(0.3)^2}{15(16)} = \\frac{0.09}{240} = 0.000375$\n- For $h=3$: $\\frac{(W_3\\hat{\\sigma}_3)^2}{n_3(n_3+1)} = \\frac{(1.0)^2}{51(52)} = \\frac{1}{2652} \\approx 0.00037707$\n\nSince the marginal variance reduction is slightly larger for stratum $3$, we allocate the remaining sample to stratum $3$.\nThe final integer allocation is:\n- $n_1 = 15$\n- $n_2 = 72$\n- $n_3 = 51 + 1 = 52$\n- $n_4 = 41$\n\nThe sum is $15+72+52+41 = 180$, and all $n_h \\ge 10$, so the solution is valid.\n\n### Discussion of Variance Implications\n\nThe robust allocation problem required minimizing the worst-case variance, which is equivalent to minimizing $(1+\\delta)^2 \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{(W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h}$. A nominal (non-robust) allocation would ignore pilot uncertainty and minimize the nominal variance, which is $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{(W_h \\hat{\\sigma}_h)^2}{n_h}$.\nBecause the objective function for the robust problem is simply a constant multiple of the objective function for the nominal problem, the optimal allocation $\\{n_h\\}$ that minimizes the expression is identical in both cases. The robust allocation is proportional to $W_h\\hat{\\sigma}_h$, which is the same as the nominal Neyman allocation.\n\nThe primary implication is not on the allocation strategy itself, but on the guaranteed performance. The nominal approach yields an allocation and an associated variance estimate, $V_{nom} = \\sum \\frac{W_h^2\\hat{\\sigma}_h^2}{n_h^{opt}}$. However, this estimate is optimistic, as it relies on the pilot estimates $\\hat{\\sigma}_h$ being perfectly accurate. The robust approach acknowledges the uncertainty and provides a worst-case guarantee. The minimized worst-case variance is $V_{WC} = (1+\\delta)^2 V_{nom}$. In this case, with $\\delta=0.1$, the guaranteed variance is $(1.1)^2 = 1.21$ times, or $21\\%$ greater than, the optimistic nominal estimate. The robust formulation forces us to recognize and quantify the potential for higher variance due to estimation error in the $\\sigma_h$, even though it does not, in this particular problem structure, alter the allocation plan.",
