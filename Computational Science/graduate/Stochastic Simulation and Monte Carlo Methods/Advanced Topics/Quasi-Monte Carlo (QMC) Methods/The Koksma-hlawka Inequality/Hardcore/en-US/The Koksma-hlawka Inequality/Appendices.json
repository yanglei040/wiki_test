The Koksma-Hlawka inequality states that for a function $f$ with finite Hardy-Krause variation $V_{\\mathrm{HK}}(f)$ and a point set $P$ with star discrepancy $D_N^*(P)$, the absolute error of the quasi-Monte Carlo estimator is bounded as follows:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{[0,1]^2} f(\\mathbf{x}) d\\mathbf{x} - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\right| \\le V_{\\mathrm{HK}}(f) D_N^*(P) $$\nThus, we must compute two quantities: the Hardy-Krause variation of the function $f$, denoted $V_{\\mathrm{HK}}(f)$, and the star discrepancy of the point set $P$, denoted $D_N^*(P)$.

The Hardy-Krause variation is given by the formula:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{HK}}(f) \\;=\\; \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq u \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,s\\}} \\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \\left| \\frac{\\partial^{|u|}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}_u}\\, f\\bigl(\\boldsymbol{x}_u; \\boldsymbol{1}_{-u}\\bigr) \\right| \\,\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{x}_u.\n$$\nLet's analyze the term inside the integral for an arbitrary non-empty subset $u \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,s\\}$. The vector $(\\boldsymbol{x}_u; \\boldsymbol{1}_{-u})$ is a point in $[0,1]^s$ whose components $x_j$ are variables if $j \\in u$ and are fixed to $1$ if $j \\notin u$. Applying this to the function $f$, we get:\n$$\nf\\bigl(\\boldsymbol{x}_u; \\boldsymbol{1}_{-u}\\bigr) = \\left( \\prod_{j \\in u} x_j \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k \\in \\{1,\\dots,s\\} \\setminus u} 1 \\right) = \\prod_{j \\in u} x_j.\n$$\nThis expression is a function of the variables $(x_j)_{j \\in u}$ only.

This analysis will illustrate the role of boundary singularities in the context of the Koksma-Hlawka inequality (KHI).\n\nWe begin by stating the definition of the Hardy-Krause variation, $V_{HK}(F)$, for a function $F:[0,1]^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, anchored at the corner $\\boldsymbol{1}=(1,1)$. For a sufficiently smooth function, it is defined as the sum of variations over projections onto lower-dimensional faces ending at $\\boldsymbol{1}$:\n$$\nV_{HK}(F) = \\int_0^1 \\left| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_1}(x_1, 1) \\right| dx_1 + \\int_0^1 \\left| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_2}(1, x_2) \\right| dx_2 + \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\left| \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2}(x_1, x_2) \\right| dx_1 dx_2\n$$\nFor functions with discontinuities, this definition must be extended to account for jumps, or by using a definition based on suprema over partitions. A particularly useful property exists for product functions of the form $F(x_1, x_2) = F_1(x_1) F_2(x_2)$. For such functions, the Hardy-Krause variation anchored at $\\boldsymbol{1}=(1,1)$ can be expressed in terms of the one-dimensional Jordan variations, $V(F_i)$, of the component functions:\n$$\nV_{HK}(F) = \\left( |F_1(1)| + V(F_1) \\right) \\left( |F_2(1)| + V(F_2) \\right) - |F_1(1)| |F_2(1)|\n$$\nWe will use this property to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, we establish whether $V_{HK}(g)$ is finite or infinite. The function is $g(x_1, x_2) = h(x_1)h(x_2)$ where $h(x) = x^{-\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. To find $V_{HK}(g)$, we first need the one-dimensional Jordan variation of $h(x)$ on $[0,1]$. For a function that is continuously differentiable on an interval $(a,b)$, its variation is the integral of the absolute value of its derivative. The derivative of $h(x)$ is $h'(x) = -\\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ and $x>0$, $h'(x)$ is always negative, so $h(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on $(0,1]$. The variation is given by the improper integral:\n$$\nV(h) = \\int_0^1 |h'(x)| \\, dx = \\int_0^1 \\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1} \\, dx\n$$\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1} \\, dx = \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} \\left[ -x^{-\\alpha} \\right]_a^1 = \\left( -1^{-\\alpha} \\right) - \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} \\left( -a^{-\\alpha} \\right) = -1 + \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} a^{-\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, the exponent $-\\alpha$ is negative. Therefore, the limit $\\lim_{a \\to 0^+} a^{-\\alpha}$ diverges to $+\\infty$. This implies that $V(h) = \\infty$. The Hardy-Krause variation $V_{HK}(g)$ is a function of $V(h)$. Since $V(h)$ is infinite, $V_{HK}(g)$ must also be infinite. Thus, the untrimmed function $g$ is not of bounded variation in the Hardy-Krause sense.\n\nNext, we derive the exact closed-form expression for $V_{HK}(f)$. The function is $f(x_1, x_2) = \\tilde{h}(x_1)\\tilde{h}(x_2)$, where $\\tilde{h}(x) = h(x)\\,\\mathbf{1}\\{x>\\epsilon\\} = x^{-\\alpha}\\,\\mathbf{1}\\{x>\\epsilon\\}$. The function $\\tilde{h}(x)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\tilde{h}(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le \\epsilon \\\\\nx^{-\\alpha} & \\text{if } \\epsilon < x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is piecewise continuous. It is constant (and thus has zero variation) on $[0, \\epsilon]$, is continuously differentiable on $(\\epsilon, 1]$, and has a single jump discontinuity at $x=\\epsilon$. The total variation $V(\\tilde{h})$ on $[0,1]$ is the sum of the variation over the smooth part and the magnitude of the jump. The variation on $(\\epsilon, 1]$ is given by the integral of $|\\tilde{h}'(x)|$:\n$$\nV_{(\\epsilon, 1]}(\\tilde{h}) = \\int_{\\epsilon}^1 |-\\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}| \\, dx = \\int_{\\epsilon}^1 \\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1} \\, dx = \\left[ -x^{-\\alpha} \\right]_{\\epsilon}^1 = -1^{-\\alpha} - (-\\epsilon^{-\\alpha}) = \\epsilon^{-\\alpha} - 1\n$$\nThe jump at $x=\\epsilon$ is from $\\tilde{h}(\\epsilon^-) = 0$ to $\\tilde{h}(\\epsilon^+) = \\epsilon^{-\\alpha}$. The magnitude of the jump is $|\\tilde{h}(\\epsilon^+) - \\tilde{h}(\\epsilon^-)| = |\\epsilon^{-\\alpha} - 0| = \\epsilon^{-\\alpha}$.\nThe total variation $V(\\tilde{h})$ is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\nV(\\tilde{h}) = V_{(\\epsilon, 1]}(\\tilde{h}) + |\\Delta \\tilde{h}(\\epsilon)| = (\\epsilon^{-\\alpha} - 1) + \\epsilon^{-\\alpha} = 2\\epsilon^{-\\alpha} - 1\n$$\nNow we can compute $V_{HK}(f)$ using the product formula. We note that $\\tilde{h}(1) = 1^{-\\alpha} = 1$ (since $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, $1>\\epsilon$).\n$$\nV_{HK}(f) = \\left( |\\tilde{h}(1)| + V(\\tilde{h}) \\right)^2 - |\\tilde{h}(1)|^2 = \\left( 1 + V(\\tilde{h}) \\right)^2 - 1^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V(\\tilde{h})$:\n$$\nV_{HK}(f) = \\left( 1 + (2\\epsilon^{-\\alpha} - 1) \\right)^2 - 1 = \\left( 2\\epsilon^{-\\alpha} \\right)^2 - 1 = 4\\epsilon^{-2\\alpha} - 1\n$$\nThis is the exact closed-form expression for the Hardy-Krause variation of the trimmed function $f$.\n\nFinally, we explain the qualitative impact of trimming on the constant in the Koksma-Hlawka inequality. The KHI provides an error bound for quasi-Monte Carlo integration:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^N F(\\boldsymbol{x}_k) - \\int_{[0,1]^d} F(\\boldsymbol{x}) d\\boldsymbol{x} \\right| \\le D_N^*(P_N) \\cdot V_{HK}(F)\n$$\nThe constant that multiplies the discrepancy $D_N^*$ is the Hardy-Krause variation of the integrand, $V_{HK}(F)$.\n\nOur analysis showed that for the original function $g(\\boldsymbol{x})$, the variation $V_{HK}(g)$ is infinite. This is due to the singularity of $g$ along the boundaries where $x_1=0$ or $x_2=0$, which causes the integrals defining the variation to diverge. An infinite variation constant makes the KHI bound trivial and uninformative; it does not guarantee convergence of the QMC estimate.\n\nBy trimming the function, we define $f(\\boldsymbol{x})$ to be zero in the problematic boundary layer region $\\{\\boldsymbol{x} \\,|\\, \\min_{i} x_i \\le \\epsilon\\}$. This act of trimming fundamentally alters the analytic properties of the integrand. The singularity at the origin is removed and replaced by a finite jump discontinuity at the boundary of the trimming region (e.g., at $x_i = \\epsilon$). As we calculated, the resulting function $f$ has a finite Hardy-Krause variation $V_{HK}(f) = 4\\epsilon^{-2\\alpha} - 1$.\n\nThe consequence is that for the trimmed function $f$, the KHI provides a meaningful, finite error bound. This guarantees a rate of convergence for the QMC integral estimate of $\\int f$, which depends on the quality of the point set (its discrepancy $D_N^*$). The trimming procedure regularizes the integrand, making it amenable to the theory that underpins QMC methods. The price of this regularization is that one is integrating a modified function, $f$, instead of the original one, $g$. However, the variation $V_{HK}(f)$ still depends strongly on the trimming parameter $\\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $f$ approaches $g$, and correspondingly, $V_{HK}(f) = 4\\epsilon^{-2\\alpha} - 1 \\to \\infty$, reflecting the re-emergence of the unbounded variation of the original function $g$.",
