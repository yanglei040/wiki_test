This exercise guides you through a theoretical investigation to uncover the root cause of this instability . By first analyzing a toy model where the likelihood is bounded, you will see how the estimator can be perfectly stable. You will then contrast this with a more realistic Gaussian model to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the variance of the estimator's core component explodes, providing a clear and foundational understanding of its unreliability.",

            "problem": "Consider a Bayesian model with parameter space $\\Theta \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ equipped with Lebesgue measure and a fixed observed data value $y$. The marginal likelihood (also called the evidence) is defined by the integral $Z = \\int_{\\Theta} p(y \\mid \\theta)\\,\\pi(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$, and the posterior density is defined by $p(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta)\\,\\pi(\\theta)$, where $\\pi(\\theta)$ is a proper prior density. The harmonic mean (HM) estimator is obtained by drawing independent samples $\\theta^{(1)},\\dots,\\theta^{(M)}$ from the posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ and setting $\\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M} U(\\theta^{(m)})\\right\\}^{-1}$ with $U(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{p(y \\mid \\theta)}$. A sufficient condition for the stability of the HM estimator is that $U(\\theta)$ be almost surely bounded under the posterior distribution. In this exercise, you will use a toy likelihood with bounded support to demonstrate such stability and then contrast it with an unbounded-support case to isolate the mechanism of instability, working only from core definitions and standard integration facts.\n\nAssume first that there exists a measurable set $A \\subset \\Theta$ with finite, strictly positive Lebesgue measure $|A| \\in (0,\\infty)$ such that the likelihood is $p(y \\mid \\theta) = \\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}/|A|$ and the prior is the uniform density $\\pi(\\theta) = \\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}/|A|$ on the same set $A$.\n\n1. Using only the definitions of $Z$ and $p(\\theta \\mid y)$, compute $Z$ and $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ in this bounded-support model.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the harmonic mean (HM) estimator for the marginal likelihood $Z$ in two different settings: a stable bounded-support case and a potentially unstable unbounded-support case. We must first validate the problem statement. The problem is a well-defined theoretical exercise in Bayesian statistics and Monte Carlo methods. It provides all necessary definitions and uses standard mathematical models (uniform and normal distributions). The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, scientifically grounded, and objective. There are no flaws that would render it invalid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address them in order to provide a complete, reasoned solution, although the final answer only requires the result from Part 2.\n\n**Part 1: Bounded-Support Model Analysis**\n\nFirst, we compute the marginal likelihood $Z$ and the posterior density $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ for the bounded-support model.\nThe marginal likelihood, or evidence, is defined as $Z = \\int_{\\Theta} p(y \\mid \\theta)\\,\\pi(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$.\nThe provided likelihood is $p(y \\mid \\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|}$ and the prior is $\\pi(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|}$, where $|A|$ is the finite, non-zero Lebesgue measure of the set $A$.\nSubstituting these into the definition of $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\int_{\\Theta} \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|}\\right) \\,d\\theta = \\int_{\\Theta} \\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|^2} \\,d\\theta $$\nSince the integrand is zero outside the set $A$, we can change the domain of integration to $A$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{1}{|A|^2} \\int_{A} 1 \\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{|A|^2} |A| = \\frac{1}{|A|} $$\nThe posterior density is given by Bayes' theorem, $p(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta)\\pi(\\theta)}{Z}$. Using the expressions for the numerator and the value of $Z$ we just calculated:\n$$ p(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{\\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|^2}}{\\frac{1}{|A|}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}\\{\\theta \\in A\\}}{|A|} $$\nThis result shows that the posterior distribution of $\\theta$ is a uniform distribution over the set $A$.\n\nNext, we analyze the function $U(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{p(y \\mid \\theta)}$. The harmonic mean estimator is constructed using samples $\\theta^{(m)}$ drawn from the posterior distribution $p(\\theta \\mid y)$. Since the support of $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ is the set $A$, any sample $\\theta$ drawn from this distribution will be in $A$ almost surely. For any $\\theta \\in A$, the likelihood is a constant: $p(y \\mid \\theta) = \\frac{1}{|A|}$.\nTherefore, for any posterior sample $\\theta$, the value of $U(\\theta)$ is:\n$$ U(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{p(y \\mid \\theta)} = \\frac{1}{1/|A|} = |A| $$\nThis implies that the random variable $U(\\theta)$, where $\\theta \\sim p(\\theta \\mid y)$, is a constant with value $|A|$. Its probability distribution is a point mass at $|A|$.\nThe expectation and variance of this constant random variable are straightforward to determine:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}[U(\\theta)] = \\mathbb{E}[|A|] = |A| $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}(U(\\theta)) = \\mathrm{Var}(|A|) = 0 $$\nThis completes the analysis required by Part 1. The function $U(\\theta)$ is almost surely bounded (in fact, constant) under the posterior, which satisfies the sufficient condition for the stability of the HM estimator.\n\n**Part 2: Variance of the Harmonic Mean Estimator**\n\nThe harmonic mean estimator $\\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ is defined as:\n$$ \\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M} U(\\theta^{(m)})\\right\\}^{-1} $$\nwhere $\\theta^{(1)}, \\dots, \\theta^{(M)}$ are independent samples from the posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$.\nFrom Part 1, we know that for any such sample $\\theta^{(m)}$, the value of $U(\\theta^{(m)})$ is deterministically equal to $|A|$.\nSubstituting this into the estimator's formula:\n$$ \\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M} |A|\\right\\}^{-1} = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{M} (M \\cdot |A|)\\right\\}^{-1} = \\left\\{|A|\\right\\}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{|A|} $$\nThe estimator $\\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ is a random variable, as it depends on the random samples $\\{\\theta^{(m)}\\}$. However, in this specific model, its value is constant and equal to $\\frac{1}{|A|}$ for any set of posterior samples and any sample size $M \\geq 1$. It is always exactly equal to the true marginal likelihood $Z$.\nThe variance of any constant random variable is zero. Therefore, the variance of the HM estimator in this model is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}\\!\\left(\\widehat{Z}_{\\mathrm{HM}}\\right) = \\mathrm{Var}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{|A|}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis is the final answer requested by the problem.\n\n**Part 3: Unbounded-Support Case and Instability Mechanism**\n\nFor completeness and to fulfill the problem's goal of contrasting the two cases, we briefly analyze the unbounded-support example.\nThe posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ resulting from a Gaussian prior $\\pi(\\theta) = \\varphi(\\theta; 0, \\tau_{0}^{2})$ and Gaussian likelihood $p(y \\mid \\theta) = \\varphi(y; \\theta, \\sigma^{2})$ is also a Gaussian, $\\varphi(\\theta; \\mu_p, \\sigma_p^2)$, with posterior variance $\\sigma_p^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2}\\right)^{-1}$.\nWe are asked for the condition on $c > 0$ under which $\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}\\!\\left[\\exp\\!\\big(c\\,(\\theta - y)^{2}\\big)\\right]$ is finite. This expectation corresponds to an integral of the form $\\int \\exp(Q(\\theta))d\\theta$, where $Q(\\theta)$ is a quadratic in $\\theta$. The integral converges if and only if the coefficient of the $\\theta^2$ term is negative. The exponent is $c(\\theta - y)^2 - \\frac{(\\theta - \\mu_p)^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}$. The coefficient of $\\theta^2$ is $c - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_p^2}$. Thus, the expectation is finite if and only if $c  \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_p^2}$.\n\nNow we apply this to the moments of $U(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{p(y \\mid \\theta)} = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\theta-y)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n1.  The expectation $\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}[U(\\theta)]$ requires finiteness for $c = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}$. The condition is $\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}  \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_p^2}$, or $\\sigma_p^2  \\sigma^2$. This is always true since $\\sigma_p^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2\\tau_0^2}{\\sigma^2+\\tau_0^2}$ and $\\frac{\\tau_0^2}{\\sigma^2+\\tau_0^2}  1$. So the expectation of $U(\\theta)$ is finite.\n2.  The variance $\\mathrm{Var}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}(U(\\theta))$ exists if $\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}[U(\\theta)^2]$ is finite. Since $U(\\theta)^2 \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\theta-y)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$, this corresponds to $c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$. The condition becomes $\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}  \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_p^2}$, or $2\\sigma_p^2  \\sigma^2$. Substituting for $\\sigma_p^2$, we get $2\\frac{\\sigma^2\\tau_0^2}{\\sigma^2+\\tau_0^2}  \\sigma^2$, which simplifies to $\\tau_0^2  \\sigma^2$.\n\nThis reveals the instability mechanism. The variance of $U(\\theta)$ is infinite unless the prior is sufficiently informative relative to the likelihood (i.e., $\\tau_0^2  \\sigma^2$). If the prior is diffuse, the posterior will have tails that are not thin enough to suppress the explosive growth of $U(\\theta)^2 = 1/p(y \\mid \\theta)^2$ for values of $\\theta$ far from $y$. This leads to an infinite variance for $U(\\theta)$, which in turn causes the HM estimator to be highly unstable, as its sampling distribution fails to converge appropriately. This contrasts sharply with the bounded-support case where $U(\\theta)$ was bounded, resulting in zero variance for the estimator.",

The focus is to show how the instability of the harmonic mean estimator can distort model selection. The context is stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo methods, using a normal likelihood with conjugate normal prior. The simulation must be fully self-contained and reproducible.\n\nThe fundamental base to use is Bayes' theorem and the definition of the marginal likelihood (model evidence): for data $y = (y_1,\\dots,y_n)$, likelihood $p(y \\mid \\theta)$, and prior $p(\\theta)$, the marginal likelihood is $Z = \\int p(y \\mid \\theta)\\, p(\\theta)\\, d\\theta$. The posterior is $p(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta)\\, p(\\theta)$. The harmonic mean estimator relies on posterior samples and forms an estimate of $Z$ via averaging functions of $p(y \\mid \\theta)$ under $p(\\theta \\mid y)$. The Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) approximates the negative log marginal likelihood via an expectation of the negative log-likelihood under a tempered posterior $p_t(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta)^t p(\\theta)$ at inverse temperature $t = 1/\\log n$.\n\nSet up the following nested models for scalar parameter $\\mu$ with known variance $\\sigma^2$ and data $y_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{true}}, \\sigma^2)$, independent for $i = 1,\\dots,n$:\n\n- Model $\\mathcal{M}_0$: the mean is fixed at $\\mu = 0$ (no free parameter).\n- Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$: the mean is unknown with prior $\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)$.\n\nUnder $\\mathcal{M}_1$, the posterior is conjugate normal. Under WBIC, the tempered posterior at inverse temperature $t$ is also normal. The harmonic mean estimator for $Z$ under $\\mathcal{M}_1$ uses samples from the posterior of $\\mu$. Because the harmonic mean estimator can have infinite variance in common settings, it is known to be unstable and potentially misleading for model selection.

Harmonic Mean Estimator (HME)**\n\nThe HME is based on the identity $Z^{-1} = E_{p(\\theta \\mid y)}[p(y \\mid \\theta)^{-1}]$. For model $\\mathcal{M}_1$, given $M$ samples $\\mu^{(j)}$ from the posterior $p(\\mu \\mid y)$, the HME of $Z_1$ is:\n$$ \\widehat{Z_1}^{\\text{HM}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{1}{p(y \\mid \\mu^{(j)})} \\right)^{-1} $$\nThe samples are drawn from the posterior distribution derived earlier: $\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_p, \\sigma_p^2)$.

For the normal-normal model, this occurs if and only if $\\tau^2 > \\sigma^2/n$. This condition indicates instability, which is a key aspect to be demonstrated.\n\n**3. Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC)**\n\nWBIC provides an approximation of the log marginal likelihood. It is defined as:\n$$ \\widehat{-\\log Z_1}^{\\text{WBIC}} = E_{p_t(\\mu \\mid y)}[-\\log p(y \\mid \\mu)] $$\nThe expectation is taken over a \"tempered\" posterior distribution $p_t(\\mu \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\mu)^t p(\\mu)$, where the inverse temperature $t$ is set to $1/\\log n$. For our model $\\mathcal{M}_1$, the tempered posterior is also a normal distribution, $p_t(\\mu \\mid y) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu \\mid \\mu_{p,t}, \\sigma_{p,t}^2)$, with parameters:\n$$ \\sigma_{p,t}^2 = \\left(\\frac{tn}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}\\right)^{-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_{p,t} = \\sigma_{p,t}^2 \\left(\\frac{tn\\bar{y}}{\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nWe estimate the expectation using Monte Carlo integration by drawing $M$ samples $\\mu^{(j)}$ from this tempered posterior and averaging the values of $-\\log p(y \\mid \\mu^{(j)})$. For model $\\mathcal{M}_0$, there is no parameter, so $-\\log Z_0$ is computed exactly.\n\n**4.

The solution is non-trivial.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: None. The proposed algorithms can be implemented and their numerical properties verified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Derivation of a Stable Computation\n\nThe harmonic mean estimator is given by:\n$$ \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{L(\\theta_i)} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^n L(\\theta_i)^{-1}} $$\nWe are given the log-likelihoods $\\ell_i = \\log L(\\theta_i)$. Thus, $L(\\theta_i)^{-1} = (\\exp(\\ell_i))^{-1} = \\exp(-\\ell_i)$.\nThe estimator can be written in terms of the log-likelihoods as:\n$$ \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(-\\ell_i)} $$\nThe primary numerical challenge lies in computing the sum $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(-\\ell_i)$. Let $x_i = -\\ell_i$. The values of $\\ell_i$ can be large positive or negative numbers, corresponding to small or large values of $x_i$. If any $x_i$ is large and positive (e.g., $x_i > 709$), the term $\\exp(x_i)$ will overflow. This occurs when the likelihood $L(\\theta_i)$ is very small, which is precisely the situation where the harmonic mean estimator is known to be statistically unstable.\n\nTo prevent this overflow during computation, we use the \"log-sum-exp\" stabilization trick. Let $m = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le n} x_i$. We can rewrite the sum $S$ as:\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m + m) = \\exp(m) \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m) $$\nLet's analyze the new sum, $s = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)$.\n-   The exponent for each term is $x_i - m$. Since $m$ is the maximum of all $x_i$, we have $x_i - m \\le 0$ for all $i$.\n-   Consequently, $\\exp(x_i - m) \\le \\exp(0) = 1$. The largest possible value for any term in the sum is $1$ (which occurs for the term where $x_i=m$). This effectively prevents overflow when computing the individual terms.\n-   If $x_i - m$ is a large negative number (e.g., $x_i - m \\lesssim -745$), the term $\\exp(x_i - m)$ will underflow to $0$. This is numerically safe and desirable. Such a term corresponds to a value of $x_i$ that is much smaller than the maximum $m$. The original term $\\exp(x_i)$ would have been negligible compared to the largest term $\\exp(m)$, so its contribution to the sum can be ignored without significant loss of numerical precision.\n\nThe overall computation is best carried out in the log domain to manage the full range of possible values for the final result.\nThe logarithm of the estimator is:\n$$ \\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\log(n) - \\log(S) $$\nUsing our stabilized expression for $S$:\n$$ \\log S = \\log\\left(\\exp(m) \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)\\right) = \\log(\\exp(m)) + \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)\\right) = m + \\log(s) $$\nSo, the stable algorithm for computing the log of the an estimator is:\n$$ \\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\log(n) - (m + \\log s) = \\log n - m - \\log \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)\\right) $$\nwhere $x_i = -\\ell_i$ and $m = \\max_i x_i$. This formula for $\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ is numerically robust. The final value $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\exp(\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}})$ can then be computed, but if $\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ is outside the range $[-745, 709]$, it is better to report the logarithm to avoid final overflow or underflow.\n\nIt is critical to distinguish this computational stability from the statistical instability of the estimator. The method above accurately computes the value of $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ for the given sample $\\{\\theta_i\\}$. However, the estimator itself has infinite variance because it is dominated by rare samples from the posterior tails where the likelihood is very small (i.e., where $x_i = -\\ell_i$ is very large). The choice of $m = \\max_i x_i$ makes it clear that the computation hinges on the single sample with the smallest likelihood, which is the root cause of the statistical instability. The log-sum-exp trick fixes the arithmetic, not the statistics.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Let $x_i = -\\ell_i$ and $m = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le n} x_i$. Compute $s = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)$ in floating point. Then compute $\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\log n - \\big(m + \\log s\\big)$ and, if needed, set $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\exp(\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}})$ only when $|\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}| \\lesssim 709$; otherwise report $\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ to avoid overflow/underflow. This prevents overflow in the accumulation of $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(-\\ell_i)$ because all exponents $x_i - m \\le 0$, and any underflowed exponentials correspond to negligible contributions. The estimator remains statistically unstable because the largest $x_i$ (smallest likelihood) can dominate, but the computation itself is numerically well-conditioned.**\n\nThis option perfectly matches the derived stable algorithm.\n1.  It correctly identifies the transformation $x_i = -\\ell_i$.\n2.  It correctly uses the maximum value $m$ as the shift constant for the log-sum-exp trick.\n3.  It provides the correct formula for the log of the estimator: $\\log \\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\log n - (m + \\log s)$.\n4.  It correctly describes the standard procedure for handling the final exponentiation.\n5.  It gives a precise and correct explanation for why this procedure avoids overflow and handles underflow safely.\n6.  Crucially, it correctly distinguishes between the achieved numerical stability of the computation and the remaining statistical instability of the estimator itself.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Let $x_i = -\\ell_i$ and $m = \\min_{1 \\le i \\le n} x_i$. Compute $s = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp(x_i - m)$, then set $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\frac{n}{\\exp(m)\\, s}$. Because the shift uses the minimum, the largest terms are downweighted, so overflow is avoided; underflow is not a concern because at least one term is $1$.**\n\nThis option proposes using the minimum of the exponents, $m = \\min_i x_i$. In the sum $\\sum_i \\exp(x_i - m)$, the exponents $x_i - m$ are now all non-negative. The term corresponding to $\\max_i x_i$ will have an exponent of $\\max_i x_i - \\min_i x_i$, which can be a very large positive number, leading directly to overflow. The reasoning `the largest terms are downweighted` is false; subtracting the minimum *magnifies* the difference between the largest terms and the minimum, exacerbating overflow.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Approximate $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ by $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} \\approx \\exp\\!\\left(\\log n - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell_i\\right)$, which is numerically stable since it uses only averages of $\\ell_i$. This is justified because the harmonic mean is close to the geometric mean for large $n$.**\n\nThe proposed approximation is $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} \\approx n \\cdot \\exp(-\\bar{\\ell})$, where $\\bar{\\ell}$ is the arithmetic mean of the log-likelihoods. The true estimator is the harmonic mean of the likelihoods, $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\text{HM}(L_i)$. The quantity $\\exp(\\bar{\\ell})$ is the geometric mean of the likelihoods, $\\text{GM}(L_i)$. The approximation is thus $\\text{HM}(L_i) \\approx n / \\text{GM}(L_i)$. There is no general mathematical principle supporting this approximation. Furthermore, the justification that `the harmonic mean is close to the geometric mean for large n` is false in general. The HM-GM-AM inequality states they are only equal if all values are identical; they can be very far apart if the values have high variance, which is characteristic of the likelihoods used in the HME. This option proposes a different, mathematically unjustified estimator instead of a stable computation of the original one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Compute $t_i = \\exp(-\\ell_i)$ and evaluate $\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i$ using pairwise summation or Kahan compensated summation to avoid catastrophic cancellation, then set $\\hat Z_{\\mathrmHM} = n/\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i$. Since compensated summation reduces rounding error, overflow and underflow are avoided in practice and the result is stable.**\n\nThis option fails to address the primary numerical problem. The first step, `Compute $t_i = \\exp(-\\ell_i)$`, is precisely where overflow will occur if any $-\\ell_i$ is large. Kahan summation and other similar techniques are designed to mitigate the loss of precision from adding many floating-point numbers; they do nothing to prevent overflow or underflow in the calculation of the terms themselves. The sum consists of positive numbers, so catastrophic cancellation (subtracting nearly equal numbers) is not the issue here. The claim that compensated summation avoids overflow is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Clip the log-likelihoods by replacing each $\\ell_i$ with $\\tilde \\ell_i = \\max(\\ell_i, c)$ for some fixed constant $c$, then compute $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$ from $\\{\\tilde \\ell_i\\}$ as in the original definition. This prevents the smallest likelihood values from dominating, thereby improving both numerical and statistical stability without introducing meaningful bias.**\n\nThis option proposes modifying the data to solve the problem. By replacing $\\ell_i$ a with clipped value $\\tilde \\ell_i = \\max(\\ell_i, c)$, any log-likelihood smaller than $c$ is raised to $c$. This puts a lower bound on the likelihoods, $L(\\theta_i) \\ge \\exp(c)$, which in turn puts an upper bound on their reciprocals, $1/L(\\theta_i) \\le \\exp(-c)$. This would indeed prevent the terms $\\exp(-\\ell_i)$ from becoming arbitrarily large and causing overflow. However, this is not a stable computation of the *original* estimator; it is the exact computation of a *different, modified* estimator. The claim that this can be done \"without introducing meaningful bias\" is unsubstantiated and generally false. This procedure introduces a systematic bias that is difficult to quantify. The goal was to compute $\\hat Z_{\\mathrm{HM}}$, not a biased version of it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
