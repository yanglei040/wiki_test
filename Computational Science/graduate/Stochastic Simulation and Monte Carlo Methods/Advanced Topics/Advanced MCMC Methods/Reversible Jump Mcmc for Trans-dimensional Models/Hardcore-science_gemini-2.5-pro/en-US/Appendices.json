I shall address them in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: RJMCMC Acceptance Probability and Limiting Bound\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of the birth-move acceptance probability, a corresponding non-asymptotic upper bound, and the limiting form of this bound.\n\nThe move from model $k$ to model $k+1$ is a birth move introducing a new coefficient $\\phi$. The problem states that the prior on the new coefficient $\\phi$ is $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)$ and the proposal for the auxiliary variable $u$ is a standard normal distribution, $q(u)$, with the mapping $\\phi = \\tau u$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $J = |\\partial\\phi/\\partial u| = \\tau$. The ratio of the prior to the proposal density multiplied by the Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\frac{p(\\phi)}{q(u)} J = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\tau}\\exp(-\\frac{\\phi^2}{2\\tau^2})}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{u^2}{2})} \\tau = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\tau}\\exp(-\\frac{(\\tau u)^2}{2\\tau^2})}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{u^2}{2})} \\tau = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\exp(-\\frac{u^2}{2})}{\\exp(-\\frac{u^2}{2})} \\tau = 1\n$$\nWith the additional assumption of symmetric move probabilities $(p(k \\to k+1) = p(k+1 \\to k))$, the acceptance probability for the birth move, $\\alpha_{k \\to k+1}$, simplifies to the minimum of $1$ and the likelihood ratio.\n\nLet $L(y|k)$ be the likelihood under model $k$. The likelihood for a single observation's residual $r$ is given as proportional to $\\left(1 + \\frac{r^{2}}{\\nu\\sigma^{2}}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}$. Assuming independence of observations, the total likelihood is the product over all data points.\nUnder model $k$, the residuals are $r_i$. The likelihood is:\n$$\nL(y|k) \\propto \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left(1 + \\frac{r_i^2}{\\nu\\sigma^2}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}\n$$\nUnder model $k+1$, the residuals are $r_i' = r_i - w_i\\phi = r_i - w_i\\tau u$.

If for some index $i$, $w_i=0$, the corresponding term in the product is $1$, so we only need to consider indices $i$ for which $w_i \\neq 0$. Let the set of such indices be $I_w = \\{i \\mid w_i \\neq 0\\}$ and its size be $n_w = |I_w|$.\n\nThe problem asks for a non-asymptotic upper bound on this probability, valid for all $u$, and then for its limiting tail behavior. A bound that captures the tail behavior for large $|u|$ is required. Such a bound can be found by analyzing the asymptotic form of the likelihood ratio as $|u| \\to \\infty$.\nFor large $|u|$, the term $(r_i - w_i\\tau u)^2$ is dominated by $(w_i\\tau u)^2$.\n$$\n(r_i - w_i\\tau u)^2 = (w_i\\tau u)^2 - 2 r_i w_i \\tau u + r_i^2 \\sim (w_i\\tau u)^2 = w_i^2 \\tau^2 u^2 \\quad \\text{as } |u| \\to \\infty\n$$\nSubstituting this into the likelihood ratio expression gives the asymptotic behavior:\n$$\n\\frac{L(y|k+1)}{L(y|k)} \\sim \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{r_i^2}{\\nu\\sigma^2}}{1 + \\frac{w_i^2\\tau^2 u^2}{\\nu\\sigma^2}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}} \\sim \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\left(\\frac{\\nu\\sigma^2 + r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2 u^2}\\right)^{\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}} \\quad \\text{as } |u| \\to \\infty\n$$\nThis expression provides the tail behavior of the acceptance ratio. We can interpret this asymptotic form as the requested \"bound\" in the sense that it is a sharp asymptotic bound. Let's express this form, which we denote $B(u, \\nu)$, more explicitly:\n$$\nB(u, \\nu) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\left(\\frac{\\nu\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2}\\right)^{\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}} \\right) |u|^{-n_w(\\nu+1)}\n$$\nThe problem then asks for the limiting form of this bound as $\\nu \\to 1^+$ (the Cauchy limit) and $|u| \\to \\infty$. The asymptotic form already accounts for $|u| \\to \\infty$. We now take the limit of $B(u, \\nu)$ as $\\nu \\to 1^+$.\n\nThe exponent becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\nu \\to 1^+} -n_w(\\nu+1) = -2n_w\n$$\nThe coefficient term becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\nu \\to 1^+} \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\left(\\frac{\\nu\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2}\\right)^{\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}} = \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1+1}{2}} = \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\frac{\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2}\n$$\nCombining these, the limiting sharp form of the bound is:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\frac{\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2\\tau^2}\\right) |u|^{-2n_w} = \\frac{\\prod_{i \\in I_w}(\\sigma^2+r_i^2)}{(\\tau^2)^{n_w} (\\prod_{i \\in I_w} w_i^2) u^{2n_w}} = (\\tau u)^{-2n_w} \\prod_{i \\in I_w} \\frac{\\sigma^2+r_i^2}{w_i^2}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Auxiliary Variable Reparameterization\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a reparameterization $u = g_\\nu(\\lambda)$ for an auxiliary variable, based on a latent scale variable $\\lambda$ from the scale-mixture representation of the Student-$t$ distribution, such that the resulting variable $u$ has a variance of $1$ for all $\\nu  0$. The distribution of $\\lambda$ is given as $\\lambda \\sim \\mathrm{Inverse\\text{-}Gamma}(\\frac{\\nu}{2}, \\frac{\\nu}{2})$.\n\nA standard method to construct a variable with zero mean and unit variance is to standardize a suitable transformation of $\\lambda$. Let's choose the function $f(\\lambda) = \\ln\\lambda$. The standardized variable $u$ is then given by:\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\ln\\lambda - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln\\lambda]}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}[\\ln\\lambda]}}\n$$\nWe need to find the mean and variance of $\\ln\\lambda$. Let $\\lambda \\sim \\mathrm{IG}(\\alpha, \\beta)$. Then the variable $Y = 1/\\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution, $Y \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)$.\nThe moments of $\\ln Y$ for a Gamma-distributed variable are well-known. The mean is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln Y] = \\psi(\\alpha) - \\ln\\beta\n$$\nwhere $\\psi(\\cdot)$ is the digamma function. The variance is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}[\\ln Y] = \\psi_1(\\alpha)\n$$\nwhere $\\psi_1(\\cdot)$ is the trigamma function.\n\nSince $\\ln\\lambda = -\\ln Y$, the mean and variance of $\\ln\\lambda$ are:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln\\lambda] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\ln Y] = -(\\psi(\\alpha) - \\ln\\beta) = \\ln\\beta - \\psi(\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}[\\ln\\lambda] = \\mathbb{V}[-\\ln Y] = (-1)^2 \\mathbb{V}[\\ln Y] = \\psi_1(\\alpha)\n$$\nFor the given problem, the parameters of the Inverse-Gamma distribution are $\\alpha = \\frac{\\nu}{2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{\\nu}{2}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln\\lambda] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right) - \\psi\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}[\\ln\\lambda] = \\psi_1\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the reparameterization $u = g_\\nu(\\lambda)$ that produces a variable with mean $0$ and variance $1$ is:\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\ln\\lambda - \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right) - \\psi\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\psi_1\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)}}\n$$\nThis expression depends on $\\nu$, $\\lambda$, and the digamma and trigamma functions as required.\n\n### Summary of Final Answers\n\nThe two parts of the problem are distinct. The final answer requires a two-entry matrix containing the results.\n1. The limiting sharp tail upper bound for $\\alpha_{k \\to k+1}$ as $\\nu \\to 1^+$.\n2.
