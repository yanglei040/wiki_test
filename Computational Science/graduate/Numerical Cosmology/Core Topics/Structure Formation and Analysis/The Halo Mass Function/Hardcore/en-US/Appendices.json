A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the variance $\\sigma^{2}(M,z)$**\n\nThe variance $\\sigma^{2}(R,z)$ of the cosmological density field smoothed on a comoving scale $R$ at redshift $z$ is defined by the integral of the power spectrum $P(k,z)$ weighted by the square of the window function in Fourier space, $W(kR)$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R,z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{k^{2}dk}{2\\pi^{2}} P(k,z) |W(kR)|^{2}\n$$\nWe are given $P(k,z)=D^{2}(z)P(k,0)$ and $P(k,0) = A\\,k^{n}$. Substituting these into the definition of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R,z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{k^{2}dk}{2\\pi^{2}} D^{2}(z) A k^{n} |W(kR)|^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R,z) = \\frac{A D^{2}(z)}{2\\pi^{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k^{n+2} |W(kR)|^{2} dk\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a change of variables to a dimensionless wavenumber $x=kR$. This implies $k=x/R$ and $dk = dx/R$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^{n+2} |W(x)|^{2} \\frac{dx}{R} = R^{-(n+3)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{n+2} |W(x)|^{2} dx\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{n+2} |W(x)|^{2} dx$ is a dimensionless constant that depends only on the spectral index $n$ and the form of the window function (here, a spherical top-hat). Let's denote this constant integral by $I_{n}$. We do not need to compute its value. The expression for the variance is then:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R,z) = \\frac{A D^{2}(z) I_{n}}{2\\pi^{2}} R^{-(n+3)}\n$$\nThis shows the power-law scaling of the variance with radius: $\\sigma^{2}(R,z) \\propto R^{-(n+3)}$. Taking the square root, the RMS fluctuation amplitude scales as $\\sigma(R,z) \\propto R^{-(n+3)/2}$.\n\nWe can eliminate the unknown amplitude constant $A$ by using the normalization $\\sigma_{8}$, defined as $\\sigma_{8} \\equiv \\sigma(R_{8}, 0)$. At redshift $z=0$, the growth factor is $D(0)=1$. Thus:\n$$\n\\sigma_{8}^{2} = \\sigma^{2}(R_{8}, 0) = \\frac{A D^{2}(0) I_{n}}{2pi^{2}} R_{8}^{-(n+3)} = \\frac{A I_{n}}{2\\pi^{2}} R_{8}^{-(n+3)}\n$$\nWe can now write the unknown combination of constants $\\frac{A I_{n}}{2\\pi^{2}}$ in terms of $\\sigma_{8}$ and $R_{8}$:\n$$\n\\frac{A I_{n}}{2\\pi^{2}} = \\sigma_{8}^{2} R_{8}^{n+3}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\sigma^{2}(R,z)$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R,z) = \\left(\\sigma_{8}^{2} R_{8}^{n+3}\\right) D^{2}(z) R^{-(n+3)} = \\sigma_{8}^{2} D^{2}(z) \\left(\\frac{R}{R_{8}}\\right)^{-(n+3)}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the RMS amplitude $\\sigma(R,z)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(R,z) = \\sigma_{8} D(z) \\left(\\frac{R}{R_{8}}\\right)^{-(n+3)/2}\n$$\nFinally, we must express this in terms of mass $M$ instead of radius $R$. Using the given relation $M = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R^{3}$, we can solve for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe ratio $R/R_{8}$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{R}{R_{8}} = \\frac{1}{R_{8}} \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R_{8}^{3}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma(R,z)$ yields $\\sigma(M,z)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(M,z) = \\sigma_{8} D(z) \\left[ \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R_{8}^{3}}\\right)^{1/3} \\right]^{-(n+3)/2}\n$$\nSimplifying the exponents, we arrive at the expression for the variance as a function of mass and redshift:\n$$\n\\sigma(M,z) = \\sigma_{8} D(z) \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R_{8}^{3}}\\right)^{-(n+3)/6}\n$$\n\n**2. Role of $D(z)$ in the Halo Mass Function**\n\nThe halo mass function, $dn/dM$, gives the comoving number density of dark matter halos per unit mass interval. In the Press-Schechter (PS) and Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalisms, it is expressed via a \"multiplicity function\" $f(\\nu)$, which depends only on the peak-height variable $\\nu$. A common form is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dM}(M,z) = \\frac{\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}}{M^{2}} \\left|\\frac{d\\ln\\nu}{d\\ln M}\\right| f(\\nu)\n$$\nThe peak height $\\nu$ is defined as the ratio of the critical overdensity for collapse, $\\delta_{c}$, to the RMS density fluctuation on the mass scale $M$ at redshift $z$:\n$$\n\\nu(M,z) \\equiv \\frac{\\delta_{c}}{\\sigma(M,z)}\n$$\nFrom the previous derivation, we know that $\\sigma(M,z) = D(z) \\sigma(M,0)$, where $\\sigma(M,0)$ is the RMS fluctuation at the present day for a mass scale $M$. Therefore, the peak height can be written as:\n$$\n\\nu(M,z) = \\frac{\\delta_{c}}{D(z)\\sigma(M,0)}\n$$\nThis relation explicitly shows how the redshift dependence enters the halo mass function. Since $\\delta_{c}$ is constant and $\\sigma(M,0)$ depends only on mass, the entire redshift evolution of $\\nu(M,z)$ is encapsulated by the inverse of the linear growth factor, $1/D(z)$. As one goes to higher redshift, $D(z)$ decreases, which increases the value of $\\nu$ for a fixed mass $M$. Since the multiplicity function $f(\\nu)$ (e.g., $f_{\\mathrm{PS}}(\\nu) \\propto \\nu \\exp(-\\nu^{2}/2)$) is typically exponentially suppressed for large $\\nu$, this means that halos of a given mass become exponentially rarer at higher redshifts. Thus, $D(z)$ directly connects the linear growth of cosmic structure to the non-linear abundance of collapsed objects (halos).\n\n**3. Final Analytic Expression for $\\nu(M,z)$**\n\nTo obtain the final expression for $\\nu(M,z)$, we combine its definition with the result for $\\sigma(M,z)$ from Part 1.\n$$\n\\nu(M,z) = \\frac{\\delta_{c}}{\\sigma(M,z)} = \\frac{\\delta_{c}}{\\sigma_{8} D(z) \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R_{8}^{3}}\\right)^{-(n+3)/6}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we can move the term with the negative exponent from the denominator to the numerator by changing the sign of the exponent:\n$$\n\\nu(M,z) = \\frac{\\delta_{c}}{\\sigma_{8} D(z)} \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi\\bar{\\rho}_{m,0}R_{8}^{3}}\\right)^{(n+3)/6}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $\\nu(M,z)$ in terms of the specified variables.",

The probability of a random walk `δ(S)` first crossing a barrier `δ_c` at variance `S = σ^2(M)` is given by `p(S) dS`. This turns out to resolve the \"cloud-in-cloud\" problem and introduces the factor of 2. The first-crossing distribution for a constant barrier is `f(S) dS = (δ_c / √(2πS^3)) * exp(-δ_c^2 / 2S) dS`.\n        *   Let's work from the expression `f(ν)` given in the problem context.\n        *   The number density of halos in the mass range `[M, M+dM]` is `n(M)dM`. The mass in these halos is `M * n(M)dM`.

The mass fraction in the range `[M, M+dM]` is `-dF(>M)`.

Applying the definition at $r=R_{\\Delta}$ (so $x=c_{\\Delta}$):\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) = 3\\rho_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{1}{c_{\\Delta}^3} \\left[ \\ln(1+c_{\\Delta}) - \\frac{c_{\\Delta}}{1+c_{\\Delta}} \\right]\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the characteristic density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrms} = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) c_{\\Delta}^3}{3 \\left[ \\ln(1+c_{\\Delta}) - \\frac{c_{\\Delta}}{1+c_{\\Delta}} \\right]}\n$$\nThe problem states that for a fixed halo, the NFW parameters $\\rho_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{s}}$ are the same regardless of the mass definition ($\\Delta=200$ or $\\Delta=\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}$). Therefore, we can equate the expressions for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{s}}$ derived from the two definitions. Let $f(c) \\equiv \\ln(1+c) - c/(1+c)$.\n$$\n\\frac{200 \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) c_{200}^3}{3 f(c_{200})} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{3 f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})}\n$$\nThe terms $3$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)$ cancel, yielding the implicit relation between $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ and $c_{200}$:\n$$\n\\frac{200 c_{200}^3}{\\ln(1+c_{200}) - \\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}} c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{\\ln(1+c_{\\mathrm{vir}}) - \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{1+c_{\\mathrm{vir}}}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the mass-conversion factor $q$**\n\nThe mass-conversion factor is defined as $q \\equiv M_{\\mathrm{vir}}/M_{200\\mathrm{c}}$. Using the definition $M_{\\Delta} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\Delta}^3 \\Delta \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)$, we have:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{vir}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_{200\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{200\\mathrm{c}}^3 (200) \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)\n$$\nThe ratio $q$ is therefore:\n$$\nq = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{M_{200\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{200\\mathrm{c}}^3 (200) \\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{R_{200\\mathrm{c}}^3 (200)}\n$$\nSubstituting $R_{\\Delta} = c_{\\Delta} r_{\\mathrm{s}}$, we get:\n$$\nq = \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{vir}} r_{\\mathrm{s}})^3 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{(c_{200} r_{\\mathrm{s}})^3 (200)} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{c_{200}^3 (200)}\n$$\nFrom the implicit relation derived in Part 1, we can find an expression for the ratio of the cubes of the concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{c_{200}^3} = \\frac{200}{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}} \\frac{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})}{f(c_{200})}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q$:\n$$\nq = \\left(\\frac{200}{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}} \\frac{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})}{f(c_{200})}\\right) \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{200} = \\frac{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})}{f(c_{200})} = \\frac{\\ln(1+c_{\\mathrm{vir}}) - \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{vir}}}{1+c_{\\mathrm{vir}}}}{\\ln(1+c_{200}) - \\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives $q$ in terms of $c_{200}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$, where $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ is itself determined by $c_{200}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical computation of $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ and $q$**\n\nWe are given $z=0$, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}=0.3$, which corresponds to $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}}=101$. For a halo with $M_{200\\mathrm{c}}=10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$, the concentration is $c_{200}=5$.\nWe must solve the implicit equation from Part 1 for $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{vir}} c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})} = \\frac{200 c_{200}^3}{f(c_{200})}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the right-hand side with $c_{200}=5$:\n$$\nf(5) = \\ln(1+5) - \\frac{5}{1+5} = \\ln(6) - \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 1.791759 - 0.833333 = 0.958426\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\frac{200 \\times 5^3}{f(5)} = \\frac{25000}{0.958426} \\approx 26084.5\n$$\nThe equation to solve for $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{101 c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})} \\approx 26084.5 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{vir}}^3}{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})} \\approx \\frac{26084.5}{101} \\approx 258.262\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $c_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ which we solve numerically. Using a numerical root-finding algorithm, we find:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{vir}} \\approx 6.716\n$$\nNow we compute the mass-conversion factor $q$ using the result from Part 2:\n$$\nq = \\frac{f(c_{\\mathrm{vir}})}{f(c_{200})} = \\frac{f(6.716)}{f(5)}\n$$\n$$\nf(6.716) = \\ln(1+6.716) - \\frac{6.716}{1+6.716} = \\ln(7.716) - \\frac{6.716}{7.716} \\approx 2.0433 - 0.8704 = 1.1729\n$$\n$$\nq \\approx \\frac{1.1729}{0.958426} \\approx 1.224\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Estimation of the shift factor $S$**\n\nThe shift factor is $S \\equiv \\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\ast})/\\phi_{200\\mathrm{c}}(M_{\\ast})$ at a fixed mass $M_{\\ast}=10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$. The halo mass function $\\phi(M) \\equiv \\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}\\ln M$ represents the number density of halos per logarithmic mass interval. The number of halos in a given infinitesimal mass range must be independent of the mass definition, so we have the conservation relation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}n = \\phi_{200\\mathrm{c}}(M_{200\\mathrm{c}}) \\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{200\\mathrm{c}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\mathrm{vir}}) \\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{\\mathrm{vir}}\n$$\nThis gives the transformation between the mass functions:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\mathrm{vir}}) = \\phi_{200\\mathrm{c}}(M_{200\\mathrm{c}}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{200\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{\\mathrm{vir}}}\n$$\nWe use the relation $M_{\\mathrm{vir}} = q M_{200\\mathrm{c}}$. The problem states to assume that $q$ is locally constant. This implies that for the purpose of transforming the differential volume element, we can treat $q$ as a constant, i.e., $\\mathrm{d}q/\\mathrm{d}M_{200\\mathrm{c}} \\approx 0$.\nUnder this assumption, $\\ln M_{\\mathrm{vir}} = \\ln q + \\ln M_{200\\mathrm{c}}$, and differentiating gives $\\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{\\mathrm{vir}} = \\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{200\\mathrm{c}}$. The Jacobian is unity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{200\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln M_{\\mathrm{vir}}} = 1\n$$\nThus, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\mathrm{vir}}) = \\phi_{200\\mathrm{c}}(M_{200\\mathrm{c}})$.\nWe want to evaluate the ratio $S$ at a fixed mass $M_{\\ast}$. Let us set $M_{\\mathrm{vir}}=M_{\\ast}$. The corresponding $M_{200\\mathrmc}$ is $M_{200\\mathrmc} = M_{\\mathrm{vir}}/q = M_{\\ast}/q$. Substituting this into the previous relation:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\ast}) = \\phi_{200\\mathrmc}(M_{\\ast}/q)\n$$\nThe shift factor is then:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{vir}}(M_{\\ast})}{\\phi_{200\\mathrmc}(M_{\\ast})} = \\frac{\\phi_{200\\mathrmc}(M_{\\ast}/q)}{\\phi_{200\\mathrmc}(M_{\\ast})}\n$$\nWe are given that the mass function follows a local power law, $\\phi(M) \\propto M^{-\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha=1.9$.\n$$\nS = \\frac{(M_{\\ast}/q)^{-\\alpha}}{M_{\\ast}^{-\\alpha}} = \\frac{M_{\\ast}^{-\\alpha} q^{\\alpha}}{M_{\\ast}^{-\\alpha}} = q^{\\alpha}\n$$\nUsing the numerical values $q \\approx 1.22384$ (using a higher precision value for the intermediate step) and $\\alpha=1.9$:\n$$\nS \\approx (1.22384)^{1.9} \\approx 1.4679\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the shift factor is $1.47$.",
