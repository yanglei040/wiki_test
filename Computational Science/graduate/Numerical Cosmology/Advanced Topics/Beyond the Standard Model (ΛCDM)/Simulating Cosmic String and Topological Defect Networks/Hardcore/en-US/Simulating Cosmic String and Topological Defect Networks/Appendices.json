This exercise tackles the foundational Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition, which provides a necessary constraint on the time step $\\Delta t$ relative to the spatial resolution $\\Delta x$ for explicit evolution schemes. By performing a von Neumann stability analysis for the Abelian-Higgs model on a 3D lattice, you will derive the upper limit on the ratio $\\Delta t / \\Delta x$ that ensures your simulation does not devolve into unphysical, exponentially growing noise.

            "problem": "In numerical cosmology simulations of cosmic string and topological defect networks, the Abelian–Higgs model is evolved on a three-dimensional cubic lattice using explicit time integration. Consider the principal (hyperbolic) part of the linearized field dynamics in natural units, where the relativistic signal speed equals $c=1$.

If the discriminant is positive, $(1 - 2\\sigma^2 S_k)^2  1$, the roots are real, and one root will have magnitude greater than $1$, leading to instability.

Thus, $|G|=1$, which corresponds to a stable, non-dissipative scheme.\n\nTo ensure stability for all possible modes, this condition must hold for the maximum possible value of $S_k$. The lattice wave vectors $k_x, k_y, k_z$ are defined within the first Brillouin zone, typically $-\\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x} \\le k_{x,y,z} \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x}$. The arguments of the sine-squared functions, e.g., $\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}$, therefore range from $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The function $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is maximized at $\\theta = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where its value is $1$. The maximum value of $S_k$ is attained when each term is maximized, which corresponds to the highest frequency \"checkerboard\" modes (e.g., $k_x = k_y = k_z = \\pi/\\Delta x$):\n$$\nS_{k, \\text{max}} = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nSubstituting this maximum value into the stability condition gives the most restrictive constraint on $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 S_{k, \\text{max}} \\le 1 \\implies 3\\sigma^2 \\le 1 \\implies \\sigma^2 \\le \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma = \\Delta t/\\Delta x \\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThis is the CFL condition for this scheme in three dimensions.\n\n1) The exact supremum of the admissible ratio $\\Delta t / \\Delta x$ is the maximum value allowed by this inequality:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n2) The conservative safe choice is calculated by multiplying this supremum by the given safety factor $s = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\ns \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nBoth quantities are dimensionless, as required.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes two methods for identifying cosmic strings on a spatial lattice plaquette in the Abelian-Higgs model.

I will proceed with the detailed solution and analysis of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe physical, gauge-invariant winding number $n$ of a string is given by the quantization of magnetic flux in the Ginzburg-Landau (Abelian-Higgs) theory. For a closed loop $\\mathcal{C}$, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} (\\nabla \\theta - e \\mathbf{A}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThis integer $n$ is non-zero if and only if the loop $\\mathcal{C}$ encloses a zero of the scalar field $|\\phi|$. The quantity $\\nabla\\theta - e\\mathbf{A}$ is proportional to the supercurrent and is gauge-invariant.\n\nOn a lattice, for an elementary plaquette, this integral is discretized. Let the vertices of the plaquette be labeled $1, 2, 3, 4$ in counter-clockwise order.\nThe true phase difference on the link from vertex $i$ to $j$ is $\\Delta\\theta_{ij} = \\theta_j - \\theta_i$. The corresponding lattice gauge field component is $A_{ij}$.\n\n**Method 1 (Phase-winding)** calculates a winding number $n_1$ based on the sum:\n$$ S_1 = \\sum_{\\ell \\in \\partial P} [\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]} $$\nwhere $[\\cdot]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]}$ denotes restriction to the principal branch $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. The winding number is then $n_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\text{round}_{2\\pi}(S_1)$. This quantity is manifestly **gauge-dependent**. Under a gauge transformation $\\theta \\to \\theta' = \\theta + e\\alpha$, the phase difference becomes $\\Delta\\theta'_{\\ell} = \\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} + e(\\alpha_j - \\alpha_i)$. The principal branch projection $[\\Delta\\theta'_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]}$ is not, in general, equal to $[\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]} + e(\\alpha_j - \\alpha_i)$, as the transformation can shift the value across the branch cut at $\\pm\\pi$. Thus, $S_1$ and the resulting $n_1$ are not gauge-invariant.\n\n**Method 2 (Gauge-invariant)** calculates a winding number $n_2$ based on the sum:\n$$ S_2 = \\sum_{\\ell \\in \\partial P} [\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} - e a A_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]} $$\nThe term inside the principal branch projection, $\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} - e a A_{\\ell}$, is a lattice discretization of the gauge-invariant combination $(\\nabla\\theta - e\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{l}$. Let's verify its gauge invariance. Under a transformation, the discrete change in $\\alpha$ is $\\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell} = \\alpha_j - \\alpha_i$. The lattice gauge field transforms as $A_{\\ell} \\to A'_{\\ell} = A_{\\ell} + \\frac{\\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell}}{a}$.\nThe term becomes:\n$$ (\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} + e \\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell}) - e a \\left(A_{\\ell} + \\frac{\\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell}}{a}\\right) = \\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} + e \\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell} - e a A_{\\ell} - e \\Delta\\alpha_{\\ell} = \\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} - e a A_{\\ell} $$\nThe quantity is exactly gauge-invariant. Therefore, $S_2$ and the inferred winding number $n_2$ are gauge-invariant, properly reflecting the physical content.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If one works in a gauge where $A_{\\mu}=0$ on the links forming the plaquette loop and $|\\phi|$ is nonzero at the plaquette vertices, then the two methods produce the same integer winding on that plaquette, up to the same principal-branch rounding.**\n\nIn a gauge where $A_{\\mu}=0$ for all links $\\ell$ on the plaquette boundary, the summand for Method 2 becomes $[\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} - e a (0)]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]} = [\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]}$. This is identical to the summand for Method 1. Since the sums term-by-term are identical, the total sums $S_1$ and $S_2$ are identical. Consequently, the final integer winding deduced by rounding to the nearest multiple of $2\\pi$ will be the same for both methods. The existence of such a gauge is a separate question, but if the condition holds, the conclusion is sound.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The methods can disagree when the string core lies near the center of the plaquette and the continuous branch cut of $\\theta$ avoids all plaquette edges: the phase-winding sum of principal-branch differences can return approximately zero while the gauge-invariant method yields $2\\pi$ (i.e., $n=1$) due to the quantized gauge flux through the plaquette.**\n\nThis statement describes the fundamental reason for the failure of the naive phase-winding method. The total gauge-invariant phase change around the string is $2\\pi n$. This winding can be partitioned between the scalar phase $\\theta$ and the gauge potential $A_\\mu$. We have $\\oint \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} - e\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 2\\pi n$.\nIt is possible to choose a gauge (i.e., position the branch cut of the multi-valued phase $\\theta$) such that $\\theta$ is continuous and single-valued along the specific path of the plaquette boundary. In such a gauge, the line integral of its gradient is zero: $\\oint \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 0$. The sum of phase differences in Method 1 would be approximately $0$, yielding $n_1=0$.\nHowever, the physical string is still present. Its winding is now fully encoded in the gauge field. For the gauge-invariant relation to hold, we must have $-e\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 2\\pi n$. For $n=1$, this is a flux of $-2\\pi/e$. Method 2 computes the sum of $(\\Delta\\theta_\\ell - eaA_\\ell)$, which discretizes $\\oint (\\nabla \\theta - e \\mathbf{A}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$. In this gauge, this will sum to approximately $0 - (-2\\pi n) = 2\\pi n$. For $n=1$, the sum will be near $2\\pi$, correctly identifying the string. Thus, the methods disagree.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A nontrivial Wilson loop $W=\\exp\\!\\big(i e\\oint_{\\partial\\text{plaq}} A_{i}\\,dx^{i}\\big)\\neq 1$ around a plaquette is sufficient for the gauge-invariant method to report a nonzero winding even if $|\\phi|$ is everywhere smooth and nonvanishing on and inside the plaquette; this reflects pure-gauge winding without a zero of $|\\phi|$.**\n\nIf $|\\phi|$ is smooth and non-vanishing on and inside the plaquette, the field configuration is topologically trivial within that region. This physically means that there is no cosmic string piercing the plaquette, so the true winding number is $n=0$. The fundamental equation of flux quantization becomes $\\oint \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} - e\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 0$.\nSince $\\phi$ is single-valued within this region, its phase $\\theta$ must change by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ upon returning to the same point. Thus, $\\oint \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 2\\pi m$ for some integer $m$. This implies $e\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 2\\pi m$.\nThe Wilson loop is $W = \\exp\\big(i e\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}\\big)$. Substituting the result, we get $W = \\exp(i 2\\pi m) = 1$ for any integer $m$.\nThe statement's premise that the Wilson loop is non-trivial ($W \\neq 1$) is in direct contradiction with the other premise that $|\\phi|$ is non-vanishing everywhere inside the plaquette. Such a configuration is not a valid solution in the Abelian-Higgs model. Therefore, the conclusion that the gauge-invariant method would report a non-zero winding is based on a physically inconsistent scenario.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. On lattices with spacing $a$ comparable to the string core width, rapid field variation and principal-branch projection can cause the phase-winding method to overcount spurious $2\\pi$ windings relative to the gauge-invariant method, which incorporates $A_{\\mu}$ and can suppress such false positives, leading to systematic disagreement that diminishes as $a/\\xi\\to 0$, where $\\xi$ is the relevant core width.**\n\nThis describes a common numerical artifact in lattice simulations. When the lattice spacing $a$ is coarse (i.e., not much smaller than the physical length scale $\\xi$ over which fields vary, such as the string core width), the change in a field quantity across a single link can be large. The phase-winding method relies on summing principal-branch phase differences, $[\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell}]_{(-\\pi, \\pi]}$. If the true phase change $\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell}$ exceeds $\\pi$ in magnitude, its principal-branch value will \"wrap around\" (e.g., a true change of $1.2\\pi$ is recorded as $-0.8\\pi$). These aliasing errors, especially from random thermal or quantum fluctuations, can conspire around a plaquette to produce a sum close to $\\pm 2\\pi$ even when no true winding exists, leading to false positives (overcounting).\nThe gauge-invariant quantity $\\Delta\\theta_{\\ell} - e a A_{\\ell}$ is generally a \"smoother\" quantity. The rapid variation in $\\theta$ near a string is compensated by the variation in $A_{\\mu}$. Therefore, the change in this composite quantity across a single link is typically smaller and less prone to exceeding $\\pi$. This makes Method 2 more robust against such discretization errors. As the lattice spacing $a$ becomes smaller relative to the core width $\\xi$ ($a/\\xi \\to 0$), the continuum limit is approached, variations across a single link become small, aliasing errors vanish, and both methods (in a suitable gauge for Method 1) would yield more consistent results.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Fixing temporal gauge $A_{0}=0$ at all times is sufficient to guarantee agreement of the phase-winding and gauge-invariant Poincaré index methods on every spatial plaquette at each time slice.**\n\nThe temporal gauge condition $A_0=0$ only constrains the time component of the gauge potential. It is a partial gauge fixing. It does not eliminate the freedom to perform time-independent gauge transformations, $\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})$, which affect the spatial components of the gauge potential $A_i \\to A_i + \\partial_i \\alpha(\\mathbf{x})$ and the scalar phase $\\theta \\to \\theta + e\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})$. The disagreement between the two methods, as explained in the analysis of option B, stems precisely from this remaining spatial gauge freedom. One can still find a valid gauge satisfying $A_0=0$ where Method 1 and Method 2 produce different results on a given spatial plaquette. Therefore, fixing the temporal gauge is not a sufficient condition to ensure their agreement.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

I will proceed to analyze each option.\n\n### Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a periodic cubic domain of side `$\\,L\\,`\", the smallest nonzero wavenumber accessible to plane-wave modes is `$\\,k_{\\min} = 2\\pi/L\\,`\". Modes with `$\\,k  2\\pi/L\\,`\" are absent, directly limiting representation of the largest-scale fluctuations and potentially biasing the low-`$k$` tail of `$\\,C_{ab}(k,\\tau,\\tau')\\,`\".**\n\nFor a field `$\\varphi(\\mathbf{x})$` in a cubic domain of side `$L$` with periodic boundary conditions, the allowed plane-wave modes `$\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x})$` must satisfy `$\\varphi(\\mathbf{x} + L\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_i) = \\varphi(\\mathbf{x})$` for `$i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$`. This quantizes the components of the wavevector `$\\mathbf{k}$` as `$k_i = 2\\pi n_i/L$`, where `$n_i$` are integers. The wavevector is thus `$\\mathbf{k} = (2\\pi/L)(n_x, n_y, n_z)$`. The wavenumber (magnitude) is `$k = |\\mathbf{k}| = (2\\pi/L)\\sqrt{n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2}$`.\nThe mode with `$(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0,0,0)$` corresponds to `$k=0$` (the zero mode or DC component). The smallest *nonzero* wavenumber `$k_{\\min}$` corresponds to the smallest nonzero integer value of `$\\sqrt{n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2}$`, which is `$1$`. This occurs for configurations like `$(1,0,0)$`. Thus, `$k_{\\min} = (2\\pi/L) \\cdot 1 = 2\\pi/L$`. The corresponding maximum wavelength is `$\\lambda_{\\max} = 2\\pi/k_{\\min} = L$`.\nConsequently, the simulation cannot represent any fluctuations with wavelengths greater than `$L$`, i.e., wavenumbers `$k  2\\pi/L$`. This is a fundamental infrared cutoff imposed by the finite periodic volume. Any observable sensitive to these large scales, such as the low-`$k$` behavior of spectra and correlators like `$C_{ab}(k,\\tau,\\tau')`$, will be biased by this hard cutoff.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Fixed Dirichlet boundaries that pin the field to a vacuum value on the faces admit standing-wave normal modes with discrete wavenumbers `$\\,k_n = n\\pi/L\\,$` and reflect outgoing radiation. This construction removes the global zero mode and can pile power into the lowest resolved bin through standing waves, biasing large-scale estimators such as `$\\,\\xi\\,$` and `$\\,v\\,$` unless boundary regions are excluded.**\n\nFor fixed Dirichlet boundaries (`$\\varphi=0$` on all faces of the cube), the normal modes are standing waves. For separability, the solutions are of the form `$\\varphi(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) \\sin(k_z z)$`. The boundary conditions `$\\varphi=0$` at `$x=L, y=L, z=L$` require `$k_i L = n_i \\pi$` for positive integers `$n_i \\geq 1$`. The allowed wavevector components are `$k_i = n_i \\pi/L$`. The statement's formula `$k_n = n\\pi/L$` is a one-dimensional simplification, but correctly identifies the fundamental discreteness scale as `$\\pi/L$`, which is different from the periodic case.\nFixed boundaries are perfectly reflecting, so outgoing radiation is indeed reflected back into the domain. This causes interference and the formation of standing waves, trapping energy that would have otherwise escaped. This \"piles up\" power at the discrete wavenumbers of the allowed modes. Since the lowest allowed wavenumbers (e.g., `$k = (\\pi/L)\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3}\\pi/L$`) are typically smaller than the periodic `$k_{\\min}$`, this affects the infrared part of the spectrum. The non-trivial zero mode (`$\\varphi = \\text{const} \\neq 0$`) is incompatible with `$\\varphi=0$` boundaries and is thus removed. The artificial enhancement of power at large scales will bias estimators like the correlation length `$\\xi$` (making it appear larger) and RMS velocity `$v$`. Excluding the boundary regions from measurement is a standard technique to mitigate such biases.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Absorbing boundary layers strictly conserve the Hamiltonian energy within the computational domain at all times, ensuring unbiased estimates of scaling energy density `$\\,\\rho\\,$` and loop production rates independent of the fraction of the volume occupied by the absorber.**\n\nThe defining purpose of an absorbing boundary layer is to dissipate the energy of outgoing waves to prevent reflections, thereby emulating an open, infinite space. This is achieved by adding explicit dissipative (non-Hamiltonian) terms to the equations of motion in the layer region. For example, a damping term `$+\\gamma \\partial_t \\varphi$` in the wave equation causes the total energy of the system to decrease over time. Therefore, Hamiltonian energy is explicitly *not* conserved. The statement that energy is strictly conserved is fundamentally incorrect. Consequently, the conclusion that this ensures unbiased estimates of `$\\rho$` is also false; the total energy of the simulation domain is systematically drained. The effect is also certainly *dependent* on the properties and volume of the absorbing layer.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For estimating Fourier-space unequal time correlators of stress-energy, periodic boundaries are advantageous because they preserve discrete translational invariance and momentum conservation, but they can contaminate infrared bins if the light-crossing time `$\\,L/c\\,$` is shorter than the correlator time lag, allowing radiation to wrap around and re-enter the measurement.**\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions impose discrete translational invariance, which in the continuum limit leads to momentum conservation. This is highly advantageous for Fourier-space analysis. However, periodicity introduces an unphysical topology. A signal (like a packet of radiation) traveling at speed `$c$` can cross the entire box of side `$L$` in a time `$\\Delta t = L/c$`. In a periodic domain, this means the signal reappears on the opposite side, potentially influencing its point of origin. When computing a two-time correlator `$\\langle A(t) A(t+\\Delta t) \\rangle$`, if the time lag `$\\Delta t$` exceeds the light-crossing time `$L/c$`, a physical signal can travel around the box and create a spurious self-correlation. This artificial causality violates the physics of an infinite space. These wrap-around signals contaminate the measurement, introducing spurious power, particularly at the largest scales (infrared modes corresponding to `$k \\approx 2\\pi/L$`) which are commensurate with the box size.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In simulations with fixed or absorbing boundaries, restricting measurements to an inner masked subvolume of side `$\\,\\left(1-2\\epsilon\\right)L\\,$` and applying window-function deconvolution reduces boundary-induced infrared bias in spectra and correlators, at the cost of increased estimator variance.**\n\nBoundary conditions like fixed or absorbing introduce artifacts (reflections, dissipation) that are most pronounced near the boundaries. To obtain results that better approximate an infinite volume, it is a standard practice to define a \"fiducial volume\" or \"inner masked subvolume\" (e.g., a cube of side `$(1-2\\epsilon)L`$ for `$\\epsilon \\ll 1$`) and perform all measurements only on the data within this region. This reduces the systematic bias from boundary effects. However, this procedure has two main consequences. First, applying a sharp mask (a window function) in real space corresponds to a convolution in Fourier space, which can mix power between different `$k$`-modes. This effect can be corrected for, a process referred to as \"window-function deconvolution\". Second, by discarding the data in the outer shell of the volume, the statistical sample size for any estimator is reduced. A smaller sample size leads to a larger statistical uncertainty, i.e., an increased estimator variance. The statement correctly identifies this trade-off between reducing systematic bias and increasing statistical variance.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Changing from periodic to fixed boundaries leaves the infrared cutoff unchanged at `$\\,k_{\\min} = 2\\pi/L\\,`\", so any differences observed in the measured infrared spectrum must arise solely from nonlinear defect dynamics rather than from the boundary condition itself.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. As established in the analysis of option A, the infrared cutoff for periodic BCs is `$k_{\\min} = 2\\pi/L$`. As established for option B, for fixed Dirichlet BCs, the fundamental scale of the wavenumber is `$\\pi/L$`, and the smallest allowed wavenumber is `$k_{\\min} = \\sqrt{3}\\pi/L \\approx 1.732 \\pi/L$`. For fixed Neumann BCs (`$\\partial_n \\varphi = 0$`), the normal modes are cosines, and the smallest nonzero wavenumber is `$k_{\\min} = \\pi/L$`. In either case, the infrared cutoff `$k_{\\min}$` changes upon switching from periodic to fixed boundaries. The premise of the statement is false. The difference in the allowed linear mode structure is a direct and primary cause of differences in the measured infrared spectrum, independent of any nonlinear dynamics.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
