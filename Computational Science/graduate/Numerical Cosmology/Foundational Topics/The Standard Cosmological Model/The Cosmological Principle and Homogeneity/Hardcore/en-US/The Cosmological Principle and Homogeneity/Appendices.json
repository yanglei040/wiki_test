            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in physical cosmology, requiring the derivation and application of the Friedmann equation for a universe with multiple fluid components. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental equations governing a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric are derived from the Einstein field equations. These are the Friedmann equation and the fluid or continuity equation.\n\nThe first Friedmann equation is:\n$$\nH^2(t) \\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\nwhere $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter, $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $\\rho$ is the total energy density of all components in the universe, $k$ is the curvature parameter ($k=+1, 0, -1$ for closed, flat, or open geometries, respectively), $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of energy-momentum, for a single, non-interacting perfect fluid component `$i$` with energy density $\\rho_i$ and pressure $p_i$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_i + 3 H (\\rho_i + \\frac{p_i}{c^2}) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that each component has a constant equation-of-state parameter $w_i$, defined by the relation $p_i = w_i \\rho_i c^2$. Substituting this into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_i + 3 H (1 + w_i) \\rho_i = 0\n$$\nSince $H = \\dot{a}/a$, we can write $\\dot{\\rho}_i = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt} = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\dot{a}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\dot{a} + 3 \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} (1 + w_i) \\rho_i = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} = -3 (1 + w_i) \\frac{\\rho_i}{a}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. Integrating yields the scaling of the energy density for component $i$ with the scale factor $a$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d\\rho_i}{\\rho_i} = -3(1+w_i) \\int \\frac{da}{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\rho_i) = -3(1+w_i) \\ln(a) + \\text{constant}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_i(a) = \\rho_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{i0}$ is the energy density of component $i$ at the present time $t_0$, where the scale factor is normalized to $a(t_0) = 1$. The total energy density is the sum of the individual component densities: $\\rho(a) = \\sum_i \\rho_i(a)$.\n\n1) To express the Hubble parameter $H(a)$ in terms of present-day observables, we first introduce the critical density at the present time, $\\rho_{c0} = \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G}$, where $H_0 = H(t_0)$. The density parameter for each component today is defined as $\\Omega_{i0} = \\frac{\\rho_{i0}}{\\rho_{c0}}$. From this, we can express the present-day density as $\\rho_{i0} = \\Omega_{i0} \\rho_{c0} = \\Omega_{i0} \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho_i(a)$:\n$$\n\\rho_i(a) = \\left( \\Omega_{i0} \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\right) a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nThe total energy density at scale factor $a$ is then:\n$$\n\\rho(a) = \\sum_i \\rho_i(a) = \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nNow, substitute this total density $\\rho(a)$ back into the first Friedmann equation:\n$$\nH^2(a) = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\left( \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} \\right) - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\n$$\nH^2(a) = H_0^2 \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\nTo handle the curvature term, we evaluate the Friedmann equation at the present time $t_0$, where $a=1$ and $H=H_0$:\n$$\nH_0^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho_0 - k c^2\n$$\nDividing by $H_0^2$ gives $1 = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_{c0}} - \\frac{k c^2}{H_0^2}$. We define the total density parameter today as $\\Omega_0 = \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_{c0}}$, and the curvature density parameter as $\\Omega_{k0} = -\\frac{k c^2}{H_0^2}$. This gives the closure relation $1 = \\Omega_0 + \\Omega_{k0}$.\nUsing the definition of $\\Omega_{k0}$, we can rewrite the curvature term in the Friedmann equation: $-\\frac{k c^2}{a^2} = \\frac{\\Omega_{k0} H_0^2}{a^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this back gives the final expression for $H^2(a)$:\n$$\nH^2(a) = H_0^2 \\left( \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2} \\right)\n$$\nTaking the square root for the expansion rate:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2}}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for $H(a)$ purely in terms of $H_0$, $\\Omega_{i0}$, $\\Omega_{k0}$, and $a$.\n\n2) We now specialize to the given cosmological model with radiation (r), pressureless matter (m), and dark energy (de). The equation of state parameters are $w_r = \\frac{1}{3}$, $w_m = 0$, and $w_{\\mathrm{de}} = -1$.\nThe scaling exponents $-3(1+w_i)$ are:\nFor radiation: $-3(1+\\frac{1}{3}) = -4$.\nFor matter: $-3(1+0) = -3$.\nFor dark energy: $-3(1-1) = 0$.\nThe Hubble parameter for this model is:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0} a^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} a^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{0} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2}}\n$$\nWe are given the following present-day parameter values:\n$H_0 = 67.4\\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$\n$\\Omega_{m0} = 0.315$\n$\\Omega_{r0} = 9.2 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$\\Omega_{k0} = 0$ (a spatially flat universe)\nThe dark energy density parameter is given by the closure relation for a flat universe:\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} = 1 - \\Omega_{m0} - \\Omega_{r0} = 1 - 0.315 - 9.2 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.684908$.\n\nWe need to evaluate $H(a)$ at $a = 0.5$. The expression simplifies because $\\Omega_{k0}=0$:\n$$\nH(0.5) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0} (0.5)^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} (0.5)^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}}\n$$\nLet's substitute the numerical values:\n$(0.5)^{-4} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{-4} = 16$.\n$(0.5)^{-3} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{-3} = 8$.\nSo, the term inside the square root is:\n$$\n(9.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 16) + (0.315 \\times 8) + 0.684908\n$$\n$$\n= 0.001472 + 2.52 + 0.684908 = 3.20638\n$$\nNow we compute $H(0.5)$:\n$$\nH(0.5) = (67.4) \\times \\sqrt{3.20638} \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nH(0.5) \\approx (67.4) \\times 1.7906367 \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nH(0.5) \\approx 120.68891... \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $120.7\\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.\n\n3) For a numerically stable evaluation of $H(a)$ in a code, we must consider the behavior at extreme values of $a$. The expression is $H(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{ \\Omega_{r0} a^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} a^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2} }$.\n\nFor $a \\ll 1$ (early Universe): The terms with the most negative powers of $a$ dominate. In this model, the radiation term $\\Omega_{r0} a^{-4}$ dominates. A naive computation of $a^{-4}$ for very small $a$ (e.g., $a \\sim 10^{-20}$) would lead to floating-point overflow. A stable strategy is to factor out the dominant term:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{ a^{-4} \\left( \\Omega_{r0} + \\Omega_{m0} a + \\Omega_{k0} a^2 + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{4} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 a^{-2} \\sqrt{ \\Omega_{r0} + \\Omega_{m0} a + \\Omega_{k0} a^2 + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{4} }\n$$\nIn this form, for $a \\ll 1$, the terms inside the square root containing positive powers of $a$ become negligible, and the expression tends towards $H_0 a^{-2} \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0}}$. This avoids computing extremely large numbers inside the square root and is therefore resistant to overflow.\n\nFor $a \\gg 1$ (far future): The term with the algebraically largest power of $a$ dominates. In the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\\mathrm{de}} = -1$), this is the constant term $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}$. Naively adding very small numbers (from the matter and radiation terms, which decay as $a^{-3}$ and $a^{-4}$) to the dominant constant term $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}$ can lead to loss of significance (e.g., `1.0 + 1.0e-20` being evaluated as `1.0`). A stable strategy is to factor out the dominant term:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Omega_{r0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-4} + \\frac{\\Omega_{m0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-3} + \\frac{\\Omega_{k0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-2} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} \\sqrt{1 + \\delta(a)}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(a)$ is the sum of the small correction terms. This form is numerically stable as it isolates the small correction from the dominant constant. For high-precision needs, one could even use a binomial approximation for the square root, like $\\sqrt{1+\\delta} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta$, to compute the deviation from the asymptotic value $H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}}$ without loss of precision.\n\nIn summary, the key strategy is to identify the dominant term for a given range of $a$ and rewrite the expression by factoring it out, thus ensuring the remaining computed quantities are of order unity and avoiding both overflow and loss of significance.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the line-of-sight comoving distance $\\chi(z)$ and the transverse comoving distance $D_M(\\chi)$ for a matter-dominated universe with spatial curvature. The derivation must start from the specified fundamental equations and definitions.\n\nThe Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe. In spherical comoving coordinates $(\\chi, \\theta, \\phi)$ and with the speed of light $c=1$, the spacetime interval $ds$ is given by:\n$$ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 \\left[ d\\chi^2 + S_k^2(\\chi) (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2) \\right]$$\nHere, $a(t)$ is the scale factor, normalized to $a_0 = 1$ at the present time $t_0$. The parameter $k \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$ represents the sign of the spatial curvature. The function $S_k(\\chi)$ depends on $k$:\n$S_{+1}(\\chi) = \\sin(\\chi)$ for a closed universe ($k=+1$).\n$S_0(\\chi) = \\chi$ for a flat universe ($k=0$).\n$S_{-1}(\\chi) = \\sinh(\\chi)$ for an open universe ($k=-1$).\n\nThe line-of-sight comoving distance $\\chi$ to an object at redshift $z$ is the path length of a light ray from the object to the observer ($\\chi=0$), measured in comoving coordinates. Light travels along null geodesics, for which $ds^2 = 0$. For a radial path ($d\\theta=d\\phi=0$), the metric equation reduces to:\n$$0 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 d\\chi^2$$\nSince we are calculating a distance, we consider the magnitude, so $d\\chi = \\frac{dt}{a(t)}$. To find the total comoving distance from an object observed at time $t_0$ that emitted its light at time $t_e$, we integrate:\n$$\\chi = \\int_{t_e}^{t_0} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')}$$\nTo express this integral in terms of redshift $z$, we use the definition of the Hubble parameter, $H(t) = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dt}$, which gives $dt = \\frac{da}{aH}$. Substituting this into the expression for $d\\chi$ yields $d\\chi = \\frac{da}{a^2 H}$. The definition of redshift is $1+z = \\frac{a_0}{a(t)} = \\frac{1}{a(t)}$. Differentiating gives $da = -\\frac{dz}{(1+z)^2}$. Substituting for $da$ and $a$ results in:\n$$d\\chi = \\frac{-dz/(1+z)^2}{(1/(1+z))^2 H(z)} = \\frac{-dz}{H(z)}$$\nThe integration limits change from $(t_e, t_0)$ to $(z, 0)$. Thus, the comoving distance is:\n$$\\chi(z) = \\int_z^0 \\frac{-dz'}{H(z')} = \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$$\nThe next step is to find the expression for $H(z)$. The problem specifies a universe with pressureless matter and curvature, but no radiation or cosmological constant.

The Friedmann equation at $t_0$ becomes $H_0^2 = \\Omega_m H_0^2 + \\Omega_k H_0^2$, which simplifies to the given constraint $\\Omega_m + \\Omega_k = 1$.\n\nThe density of pressureless matter scales as $\\rho_m(a) = \\rho_{m,0} a^{-3}$.

Since $v=\\sqrt{1+\\Omega_m z'} \\ge 1$ and $b=\\sqrt{\\Omega_k} = \\sqrt{1-\\Omega_m}  1$ (for $\\Omega_m0$), we have $v  b$.

The problem states that due to the chosen FLRW normalization, this distance is given by $D_M(\\chi) = S_k(\\chi)$. The sign of the curvature index $k$ is related to the sign of $\\Omega_k = -k/H_0^2$. Therefore, $k=+1$ for $\\Omega_k  0$, $k=0$ for $\\Omega_k=0$, and $k=-1$ for $\\Omega_k  0$.

            "problem": "Consider a statistically isotropic, mean-zero Gaussian scalar field on the unit sphere, denoted by $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$, whose two-point statistics are completely characterized by the angular power spectrum $\\{C_{\\ell}\\}_{\\ell \\ge 0}$. Expand $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$ in spherical harmonics, $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})=\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} a_{\\ell m} Y_{\\ell m}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$, and assume full-sky coverage with no instrumental noise.

Then, treating this fractional uncertainty as the cosmic-variance limit for detecting deviations from exact statistical isotropy at low multipoles, evaluate its numerical value at $\\ell=2$. Express your final result as a pure number (dimensionless), rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is to derive the standard deviation $\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{\\ell})$ and the fractional uncertainty $\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{\\ell})/C_{\\ell}$ for the full-sky, noise-free estimator of the angular power spectrum, $\\hat{C}_{\\ell}$, and then to evaluate this fractional uncertainty for the case $\\ell=2$. The scalar field $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$ is assumed to be a statistically isotropic, mean-zero Gaussian random field.\n\nThe estimator is given by\n$$\n\\hat{C}_{\\ell} \\equiv \\frac{1}{2\\ell+1}\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^{2}\n$$\nThe spherical harmonic coefficients $a_{\\ell m}$ are complex Gaussian random variables with properties derived from the assumed statistics of the field $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$:\n$1$. $\\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell m}]=0$.\n$2$. $\\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell' m'}^{\\ast}]=C_{\\ell}\\,\\delta_{\\ell \\ell'}\\delta_{m m'}$.\n$3$. $a_{\\ell,-m}=(-1)^{m} a_{\\ell m}^{\\ast}$, which follows from the reality of $T(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the estimator is $\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{\\ell}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{C}_{\\ell})}$, where the variance is defined as $\\text{Var}(\\hat{C}_{\\ell}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}])^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of the estimator, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}]$, to confirm it is unbiased.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{2\\ell+1}\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^{2}\\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we can move the expectation operator inside the sum:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}] = \\frac{1}{2\\ell+1}\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} \\mathbb{E}[|a_{\\ell m}|^{2}]\n$$\nUsing the identity $|a_{\\ell m}|^2 = a_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m}^{\\ast}$ and a given property of the coefficients, we have $\\mathbb{E}[|a_{\\ell m}|^2] = \\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m}^{\\ast}] = C_{\\ell}$. This holds for any $m$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}] = \\frac{1}{2\\ell+1}\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} C_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell+1} (2\\ell+1)C_{\\ell} = C_{\\ell}\n$$\nThus, the estimator is unbiased, and $(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}])^2 = C_{\\ell}^2$.\n\nNext, we must calculate the variance. A direct calculation of $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_{\\ell}^2]$ would require evaluating fourth-order moments of $a_{\\ell m}$. A more elegant approach is to express $\\hat{C}_{\\ell}$ in terms of a sum of squares of independent real Gaussian random variables, which relates it to a chi-squared distribution.\n\nThe reality condition $a_{\\ell,-m}=(-1)^{m} a_{\\ell m}^{\\ast}$ imposes constraints on the $a_{\\ell m}$ coefficients.\nFor $m=0$, we have $a_{\\ell 0} = (-1)^0 a_{\\ell 0}^{\\ast} = a_{\\ell 0}^{\\ast}$, which implies that $a_{\\ell 0}$ is a real variable. Since it is a zero-mean Gaussian variable, $a_{\\ell 0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. Its variance is $\\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell 0}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell 0} a_{\\ell 0}^{\\ast}] = C_{\\ell}$. So, $a_{\\ell 0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, C_{\\ell})$.\n\nFor $m \\neq 0$, the $a_{\\ell m}$ are complex. Let us write $a_{\\ell m} = u_{\\ell m} + i v_{\\ell m}$ for $m  0$. The coefficients $u_{\\ell m}$ and $v_{\\ell m}$ are real Gaussian random variables. From $\\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell m}]=0$, we have $\\mathbbE}[u_{\\ell m}]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[v_{\\ell m}]=0$. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[a_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m'}^{\\ast}] = C_{\\ell}\\delta_{m m'}$ and the standard assumption of phase-invariance imply that $u_{\\ell m}$ and $v_{\\ell m}$ are independent and have equal variance.\n$\\mathbb{E}[|a_{\\ell m}|^2] = \\mathbb{E}[u_{\\ell m}^2 + v_{\\ell m}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[u_{\\ell m}^2] + \\mathbb{E}[v_{\\ell m}^2] = C_{\\ell}$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{E}[u_{\\ell m}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[v_{\\ell m}^2] = C_{\\ell}/2$. The set of variables $\\{a_{\\ell 0}, u_{\\ell 1}, v_{\\ell 1}, ..., u_{\\ell \\ell}, v_{\\ell \\ell}\\}$ constitutes a set of $1+2\\ell$ independent real Gaussian random variables.\n\nWe now rewrite the expression for $\\hat{C}_{\\ell}$ in terms of these independent variables.\n$$\n\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^{2} = |a_{\\ell 0}|^2 + \\sum_{m=1}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^2 + \\sum_{m=-1}^{-\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^2\n$$\nUsing the reality condition, $|a_{\\ell,-m}|^2 = |(-1)^m a_{\\ell m}^{\\ast}|^2 = |a_{\\ell m}|^2$. So, the sum over negative $m$ is equal to the sum over positive $m$:\n$$\n\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^{2} = a_{\\ell 0}^2 + 2\\sum_{m=1}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^2 = a_{\\ell 0}^2 + 2\\sum_{m=1}^{\\ell} (u_{\\ell m}^2 + v_{\\ell m}^2)\n$$\nLet's normalize these variables to have unit variance. Let $Z_0 = a_{\\ell 0}/\\sqrt{C_{\\ell}}$, $Z_{m,u} = u_{\\ell m}/\\sqrt{C_{\\ell}/2}$, and $Z_{m,v} = v_{\\ell m}/\\sqrt{C_{\\ell}/2}$. Each of these $1+2\\ell$ variables is a standard normal variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\nSubstituting back:\n$a_{\\ell 0}^2 = C_{\\ell}Z_0^2$.\n$u_{\\ell m}^2 = (C_{\\ell}/2)Z_{m,u}^2$ and $v_{\\ell m}^2 = (C_{\\ell}/2)Z_{m,v}^2$.\n$$\n\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |a_{\\ell m}|^{2} = C_{\\ell}Z_0^2 + 2\\sum_{m=1}^{\\ell} \\left(\\frac{C_{\\ell}}{2}Z_{m,u}^2 + \\frac{C_{\\ell}}{2}Z_{m,v}^2\\right) = C_{\\ell} \\left(Z_0^2 + \\sum_{m=1}^{\\ell} (Z_{m,u}^2 + Z_{m,v}^2)\\right)\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is a sum of the squares of $1+2\\ell$ independent standard normal random variables. By definition, this sum follows a chi-squared distribution with $k=2\\ell+1$ degrees of freedom, which we denote as $\\chi^2_{2\\ell+1}$.\nSo, we can write\n$$\n\\hat{C}_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell+1} \\cdot C_{\\ell} \\cdot S_\\ell\n$$\nwhere $S_\\ell \\sim \\chi^2_{2\\ell+1}$.\n\nNow we can compute the variance of $\\hat{C}_{\\ell}$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{C}_{\\ell}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\ell}}{2\\ell+1} S_\\ell \\right) = \\left(\\frac{C_{\\ell}}{2\\ell+1}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(S_\\ell)\n$$\nA key property of the chi-squared distribution is that for $k$ degrees of freedom, its variance is $2k$. In our case, $k=2\\ell+1$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(S_\\ell) = 2(2\\ell+1)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the variance of $\\hat{C}_{\\ell}$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{C}_{\\ell}) = \\frac{C_{\\ell}^2}{(2\\ell+1)^2} \\cdot 2(2\\ell+1) = \\frac{2C_{\\ell}^2}{2\\ell+1}\n$$\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{\\ell}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2C_{\\ell}^2}{2\\ell+1}} = C_{\\ell} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2\\ell+1}}\n$$\nThe fractional uncertainty, also known as the cosmic variance limit, is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{\\ell})}{C_{\\ell}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2\\ell+1}}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental limit on the precision with which we can measure $C_{\\ell}$ from a single realization of the sky, even with a perfect instrument.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to evaluate this fractional uncertainty for the quadrupole, $\\ell=2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(\\hat{C}_{2})}{C_{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2(2)+1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\sqrt{0.4}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.4} \\approx 0.6324555... \\approx 0.6325\n$$\nThis result signifies that a single-sky measurement of the quadrupole power has an intrinsic, irreducible uncertainty of approximately $63.25\\%$.",
