            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in physical cosmology, requiring the derivation and application of the Friedmann equation for a universe with multiple fluid components. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental equations governing a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric are derived from the Einstein field equations. These are the Friedmann equation and the fluid or continuity equation.\n\nThe first Friedmann equation is:\n$$\nH^2(t) \\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\nwhere $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter, $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $\\rho$ is the total energy density of all components in the universe, $k$ is the curvature parameter ($k=+1, 0, -1$ for closed, flat, or open geometries, respectively), $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of energy-momentum, for a single, non-interacting perfect fluid component `$i$` with energy density $\\rho_i$ and pressure $p_i$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho_i} + 3 H (\\rho_i + \\frac{p_i}{c^2}) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that each component has a constant equation-of-state parameter $w_i$, defined by the relation $p_i = w_i \\rho_i c^2$. Substituting this into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho_i} + 3 H (1 + w_i) \\rho_i = 0\n$$\nSince $H = \\dot{a}/a$, we can write $\\dot{\\rho_i} = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt} = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\dot{a}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} \\dot{a} + 3 \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} (1 + w_i) \\rho_i = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_i}{da} = -3 (1 + w_i) \\frac{\\rho_i}{a}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. Integrating yields the scaling of the energy density for component $i$ with the scale factor $a$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d\\rho_i}{\\rho_i} = -3(1+w_i) \\int \\frac{da}{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\rho_i) = -3(1+w_i) \\ln(a) + \\text{constant}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_i(a) = \\rho_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{i0}$ is the energy density of component $i$ at the present time $t_0$, where the scale factor is normalized to $a(t_0) = 1$. The total energy density is the sum of the individual component densities: $\\rho(a) = \\sum_i \\rho_i(a)$.\n\n1) To express the Hubble parameter $H(a)$ in terms of present-day observables, we first introduce the critical density at the present time, $\\rho_{c0} = \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G}$, where $H_0 = H(t_0)$. The density parameter for each component today is defined as $\\Omega_{i0} = \\frac{\\rho_{i0}}{\\rho_{c0}}$. From this, we can express the present-day density as $\\rho_{i0} = \\Omega_{i0} \\rho_{c0} = \\Omega_{i0} \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho_i(a)$:\n$$\n\\rho_i(a) = \\left( \\Omega_{i0} \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\right) a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nThe total energy density at scale factor $a$ is then:\n$$\n\\rho(a) = \\sum_i \\rho_i(a) = \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)}\n$$\nNow, substitute this total density $\\rho(a)$ back into the first Friedmann equation:\n$$\nH^2(a) = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\left( \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8\\pi G} \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} \\right) - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\n$$\nH^2(a) = H_0^2 \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} - \\frac{k c^2}{a^2}\n$$\nTo handle the curvature term, we evaluate the Friedmann equation at the present time $t_0$, where $a=1$ and $H=H_0$:\n$$\nH_0^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho_0 - k c^2\n$$\nDividing by $H_0^2$ gives $1 = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_{c0}} - \\frac{k c^2}{H_0^2}$. We define the total density parameter today as $\\Omega_0 = \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_{c0}}$, and the curvature density parameter as $\\Omega_{k0} = -\\frac{k c^2}{H_0^2}$. This gives the closure relation $1 = \\Omega_0 + \\Omega_{k0}$.\nUsing the definition of $\\Omega_{k0}$, we can rewrite the curvature term in the Friedmann equation: $-\\frac{k c^2}{a^2} = \\frac{\\Omega_{k0} H_0^2}{a^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this back gives the final expression for $H^2(a)$:\n$$\nH^2(a) = H_0^2 \\left( \\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2} \\right)\n$$\nTaking the square root for the expansion rate:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\Omega_{i0} a^{-3(1+w_i)} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2}}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for $H(a)$ purely in terms of $H_0$, $\\Omega_{i0}$, $\\Omega_{k0}$, and $a$.\n\n2) We now specialize to the given cosmological model with radiation (r), pressureless matter (m), and dark energy (de). The equation of state parameters are $w_r = \\frac{1}{3}$, $w_m = 0$, and $w_{\\mathrm{de}} = -1$.\nThe scaling exponents $-3(1+w_i)$ are:\nFor radiation: $-3(1+\\frac{1}{3}) = -4$.\nFor matter: $-3(1+0) = -3$.\nFor dark energy: $-3(1-1) = 0$.\nThe Hubble parameter for this model is:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0} a^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} a^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{0} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2}}\n$$\nWe are given the following present-day parameter values:\n$H_0 = 67.4\\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$\n$\\Omega_{m0} = 0.315$\n$\\Omega_{r0} = 9.2 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$\\Omega_{k0} = 0$ (a spatially flat universe)\nThe dark energy density parameter is given by the closure relation for a flat universe:\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} = 1 - \\Omega_{m0} - \\Omega_{r0} = 1 - 0.315 - 9.2 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.684908$.\n\nWe need to evaluate $H(a)$ at $a = 0.5$. The expression simplifies because $\\Omega_{k0}=0$:\n$$\nH(0.5) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0} (0.5)^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} (0.5)^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}}\n$$\nLet's substitute the numerical values:\n$(0.5)^{-4} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{-4} = 16$.\n$(0.5)^{-3} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{-3} = 8$.\nSo, the term inside the square root is:\n$$\n(9.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 16) + (0.315 \\times 8) + 0.684908\n$$\n$$\n= 0.001472 + 2.52 + 0.684908 = 3.20638\n$$\nNow we compute $H(0.5)$:\n$$\nH(0.5) = (67.4) \\times \\sqrt{3.20638} \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nH(0.5) \\approx (67.4) \\times 1.7906367 \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nH(0.5) \\approx 120.68891... \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $120.7\\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.\n\n3) For a numerically stable evaluation of $H(a)$ in a code, we must consider the behavior at extreme values of $a$. The expression is $H(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{ \\Omega_{r0} a^{-4} + \\Omega_{m0} a^{-3} + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} + \\Omega_{k0} a^{-2} }$.\n\nFor $a \\ll 1$ (early Universe): The terms with the most negative powers of $a$ dominate. In this model, the radiation term $\\Omega_{r0} a^{-4}$ dominates. A naive computation of $a^{-4}$ for very small $a$ (e.g., $a \\sim 10^{-20}$) would lead to floating-point overflow. A stable strategy is to factor out the dominant term:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{ a^{-4} \\left( \\Omega_{r0} + \\Omega_{m0} a + \\Omega_{k0} a^2 + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{4} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 a^{-2} \\sqrt{ \\Omega_{r0} + \\Omega_{m0} a + \\Omega_{k0} a^2 + \\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} a^{4} }\n$$\nIn this form, for $a \\ll 1$, the terms inside the square root containing positive powers of $a$ become negligible, and the expression tends towards $H_0 a^{-2} \\sqrt{\\Omega_{r0}}$. This avoids computing extremely large numbers inside the square root and is therefore resistant to overflow.\n\nFor $a \\gg 1$ (far future): The term with the algebraically largest power of $a$ dominates. In the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\\mathrm{de}} = -1$), this is the constant term $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}$. Naively adding very small numbers (from the matter and radiation terms, which decay as $a^{-3}$ and $a^{-4}$) to the dominant constant term $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}$ can lead to loss of significance (e.g., `1.0 + 1.0e-20` being evaluated as `1.0`). A stable strategy is to factor out the dominant term:\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Omega_{r0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-4} + \\frac{\\Omega_{m0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-3} + \\frac{\\Omega_{k0}}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} a^{-2} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nH(a) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}} \\sqrt{1 + \\delta(a)}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(a)$ is the sum of the small correction terms. This form is numerically stable as it isolates the small correction from the dominant constant. For high-precision needs, one could even use a binomial approximation for the square root, like $\\sqrt{1+\\delta} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta$, to compute the deviation from the asymptotic value $H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}0}}$ without loss of precision.\n\nIn summary, the key strategy is to identify the dominant term for a given range of $a$ and rewrite the expression by factoring it out, thus ensuring the remaining computed quantities are of order unity and avoiding both overflow and loss of significance.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the line-of-sight comoving distance $\\chi(z)$ and the transverse comoving distance $D_M(\\chi)$ for a matter-dominated universe with spatial curvature. The derivation must start from the specified fundamental equations and definitions.\n\nThe Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe. In spherical comoving coordinates $(\\chi, \\theta, \\phi)$ and with the speed of light $c=1$, the spacetime interval $ds$ is given by:\n$$ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 \\left[ d\\chi^2 + S_k^2(\\chi) (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2) \\right]$$\nHere, $a(t)$ is the scale factor, normalized to $a_0 = 1$ at the present time $t_0$. The parameter $k \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$ represents the sign of the spatial curvature. The function $S_k(\\chi)$ depends on $k$:\n$S_{+1}(\\chi) = \\sin(\\chi)$ for a closed universe ($k=+1$).\n$S_0(\\chi) = \\chi$ for a flat universe ($k=0$).\n$S_{-1}(\\chi) = \\sinh(\\chi)$ for an open universe ($k=-1$).\n\nThe line-of-sight comoving distance $\\chi$ to an object at redshift $z$ is the path length of a light ray from the object to the observer ($\\chi=0$), measured in comoving coordinates. Light travels along null geodesics, for which $ds^2 = 0$. For a radial path ($d\\theta=d\\phi=0$), the metric equation reduces to:\n$$0 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 d\\chi^2$$\nSince we are calculating a distance, we consider the magnitude, so $d\\chi = \\frac{dt}{a(t)}$. To find the total comoving distance from an object observed at time $t_0$ that emitted its light at time $t_e$, we integrate:\n$$\\chi = \\int_{t_e}^{t_0} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')}$$\nTo express this integral in terms of redshift $z$, we use the definition of the Hubble parameter, $H(t) = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dt}$, which gives $dt = \\frac{da}{aH}$. Substituting this into the expression for $d\\chi$ yields $d\\chi = \\frac{da}{a^2 H}$. The definition of redshift is $1+z = \\frac{a_0}{a(t)} = \\frac{1}{a(t)}$. Differentiating gives $da = -\\frac{dz}{(1+z)^2}$. Substituting for $da$ and $a$ results in:\n$$d\\chi = \\frac{-dz/(1+z)^2}{(1/(1+z))^2 H(z)} = \\frac{-dz}{H(z)}$$\nThe integration limits change from $(t_e, t_0)$ to $(z, 0)$. Thus, the comoving distance is:\n$$\\chi(z) = \\int_z^0 \\frac{-dz'}{H(z')} = \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$$\nThe next step is to find the expression for $H(z)$. The problem specifies a universe with pressureless matter and curvature, but no radiation or cosmological constant.

The Friedmann equation at $t_0$ becomes $H_0^2 = \\Omega_m H_0^2 + \\Omega_k H_0^2$, which simplifies to the given constraint $\\Omega_m + \\Omega_k = 1$.\n\nThe density of pressureless matter scales as $\\rho_m(a) = \\rho_{m,0} a^{-3}$.

The integral is:\n$$\\chi(z) = \\frac{1}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{(1+z')\\sqrt{1+\\Omega_m z'}}$$\nTo solve this integral, we make the substitution $v^2 = 1+\\Omega_m z'$, which implies $2v dv = \\Omega_m dz'$. The term $1+z'$ becomes $1+\\frac{v^2-1}{\\Omega_m} = \\frac{\\Omega_m+v^2-1}{\\Omega_m} = \\frac{v^2+\\Omega_k}{\\Omega_m}$.

The problem states that due to the chosen FLRW normalization, this distance is given by $D_M(\\chi) = S_k(\\chi)$. The sign of the curvature index $k$ is related to the sign of $\\Omega_k = -k/H_0^2$. Therefore, $k=+1$ for $\\Omega_k  0$, $k=0$ for $\\Omega_k=0$, and $k=-1$ for $\\Omega_k  0$. The expression for $D_M(\\chi)$ is thus a piecewise function depending on the sign of $\\Omega_k$, where $\\chi$ is the function of $z$ derived above.\n\n$D_M(\\chi) = \\begin{cases} S_{-1}(\\chi) = \\sinh(\\chi)  \\text{for } \\Omega_k  0 \\\\ S_{0}(\\chi) = \\chi  \\text{for } \\Omega_k = 0 \\\\ S_{+1}(\\chi) = \\sin(\\chi)  \\text{for } \\Omega_k  0 \\end{cases}$\n\nCombining these results provides the complete solution.",

The multifractal formalism defines the partition function $Z(q,R)$ over a covering of space by cells of linear size $R$ through the normalized mass fractions $p_{i}(R)$ in each cell, with\n$$\nZ(q,R) \\equiv \\sum_{i} p_{i}(R)^{q},\n$$\nand the scale-dependent generalized dimension $D_{q}(R)$ is inferred from the local slope\n$$\n(q-1)D_{q}(R) \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln Z(q,R)}{d \\ln R}.\n$$\nStatistical homogeneity is indicated when $D_{q}(R) \\to 3$. Define the generalized homogeneity scale $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$ for a given tolerance $0\\epsilon \\ll 1$ as the smallest scale $R$ at which the condition $D_{q}(R) \\ge 3 - \\epsilon$ is satisfied.\n\nYou are given a physically motivated, empirically calibrated parametric representation of the approach to homogeneity for the generalized dimensions,\n$$\nD_{q}(R) = 3 - \\frac{A_{q}}{1 + \\left(R / R_{q}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}}},\n$$\nwhere $A_{q}  0$, $R_{q}  0$, and $\\alpha_{q}  0$ may depend on $q$, and $D_{q}(R)$ increases monotonically toward $3$ as $R$ increases. Starting only from the multifractal definitions above and the cosmological principle, derive an explicit estimator $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$ in terms of the parameters $\\epsilon$, $A_{q}$, $R_{q}$, and $\\alpha_{q}$.\n\nThen, using the tolerance $\\epsilon = 0.01$ and the following parameter sets obtained from a large-volume numerical analysis:\n- for $q=2$: $A_{2} = 0.5$, $R_{2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, $\\alpha_{2} = 4$,\n- for $q=6$: $A_{6} = 1.2$, $R_{6} = 60\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, $\\alpha_{6} = 4$,\n\ncompute the ratio\n$$\n\\rho \\equiv \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(6;\\epsilon)}{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(2;\\epsilon)}.\n$$\nThis ratio quantitatively tests whether higher $q$ moments converge to $3$ at a different scale than $q=2$. Round your final value of $\\rho$ to four significant figures. Distances $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ should be understood in $\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, where $h$ denotes the reduced Hubble constant, but the ratio $\\rho$ is unitless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a two-step process: first, to derive an analytical expression for the generalized homogeneity scale, $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$, and second, to compute the ratio of these scales for two different moments, $q=6$ and $q=2$, using provided parameter values.\n\nThe problem statement establishes several definitions and a model. The scale-dependent generalized dimension is given by the parametric form:\n$$\nD_{q}(R) = 3 - \\frac{A_{q}}{1 + \\left(R / R_{q}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}}}\n$$\nThe parameters $A_{q}$, $R_{q}$, and $\\alpha_{q}$ are all positive, which ensures that $D_{q}(R)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the scale $R$. The function asymptotically approaches $3$ as $R \\to \\infty$, consistent with the cosmological principle.\n\nThe generalized homogeneity scale, $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$, is defined as the smallest scale $R$ at which the condition $D_{q}(R) \\ge 3 - \\epsilon$ is met for a given tolerance $\\epsilon$, where $0  \\epsilon \\ll 1$. Because $D_{q}(R)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $R$, this smallest scale is precisely the scale at which equality holds:\n$$\nD_{q}(R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)) = 3 - \\epsilon\n$$\nTo derive the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$, we substitute the parametric form of $D_{q}(R)$ into this defining equation:\n$$\n3 - \\frac{A_{q}}{1 + \\left(R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon) / R_{q}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}}} = 3 - \\epsilon\n$$\nWe can now proceed to solve this equation for $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$. First, we subtract $3$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{A_{q}}{1 + \\left(R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon) / R_{q}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}}} = -\\epsilon\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ on both sides yields:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{q}}{1 + \\left(R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon) / R_{q}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}}} = \\epsilon\n$$\nTo isolate the term containing $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides and multiply by $A_{q}$:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)}{R_{q}}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}} = \\frac{A_{q}}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nNext, we subtract $1$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)}{R_{q}}\\right)^{\\alpha_{q}} = \\frac{A_{q}}{\\epsilon} - 1\n$$\nFor a real, positive solution for $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ to exist, the right-hand side must be positive, which implies the condition $A_{q}  \\epsilon$. The given parameter values will be checked against this condition. To solve for the ratio inside the parentheses, we raise both sides to the power of $1/\\alpha_{q}$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon)}{R_{q}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{q}}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)^{1/\\alpha_{q}}\n$$\nFinally, multiplying by $R_{q}$ gives the explicit estimator for the generalized homogeneity scale:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{H}}(q;\\epsilon) = R_{q} \\left(\\frac{A_{q}}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)^{1/\\alpha_{q}}\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nThe second part is to compute the ratio $\\rho \\equiv \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(6;\\epsilon)}{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(2;\\epsilon)}$ using the given parameter values:\nTolerance: $\\epsilon = 0.01$.\nFor $q=2$: $A_{2} = 0.5$, $R_{2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, $\\alpha_{2} = 4$.\nFor $q=6$: $A_{6} = 1.2$, $R_{6} = 60\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, $\\alpha_{6} = 4$.\n\nFirst, let's verify the condition $A_q  \\epsilon$.\nFor $q=2$: $A_{2} = 0.5  0.01 = \\epsilon$. The condition is satisfied.\nFor $q=6$: $A_{6} = 1.2  0.01 = \\epsilon$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nNow we can apply the derived formula to calculate $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(2;\\epsilon)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{H}}(6;\\epsilon)$.\nFor $q=2$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{H}}(2;\\epsilon) = R_{2} \\left(\\frac{A_{2}}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)^{1/\\alpha_{2}} = 50 \\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.01} - 1\\right)^{1/4} = 50 \\left(50 - 1\\right)^{1/4} = 50 \\left(49\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nFor $q=6$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{H}}(6;\\epsilon) = R_{6} \\left(\\frac{A_{6}}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)^{1/\\alpha_{6}} = 60 \\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.01} - 1\\right)^{1/4} = 60 \\left(120 - 1\\right)^{1/4} = 60 \\left(119\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThe units of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are $\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,h^{-1}$, inherited from $R_q$.\n\nNow we compute the ratio $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(6;\\epsilon)}{R_{\\mathrm{H}}(2;\\epsilon)} = \\frac{60 \\left(119\\right)^{1/4}}{50 \\left(49\\right)^{1/4}}\n$$\nWe can simplify the numerical pre-factor and combine the terms raised to the power of $1/4$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{6}{5} \\left(\\frac{119}{49}\\right)^{1/4} = 1.2 \\left(\\frac{119}{49}\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nNow we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$\n\\frac{119}{49} \\approx 2.4285714\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{119}{49}\\right)^{1/4} \\approx (2.4285714)^{0.25} \\approx 1.2482384\n$$\n$$\n\\rho \\approx 1.2 \\times 1.2482384 \\approx 1.497886\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final value to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $8$, so we round up the fourth.\n$$\n\\rho \\approx 1.498\n$$",
