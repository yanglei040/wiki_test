A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires us to determine the degrees of the vertices of the sparsity graph $G(A)$ corresponding to a given symmetric sparsity pattern.\n\nThe sparsity graph $G(A)$ has a vertex for each row/column of the matrix $A$. Here, the vertex set is $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. An undirected edge $\\{i, j\\}$ exists between two distinct vertices $i$ and $j$ if the entry $A_{ij}$ (and by symmetry, $A_{ji}$) is structurally nonzero.\n\nThe given set $S$ specifies the nonzero entries in the lower triangle of $A$, i.e., pairs $(i,j)$ with $i \\ge j$. To find the edges of the graph, we need to identify the off-diagonal nonzero entries. These correspond to pairs $(i,j) \\in S$ where $i > j$.\n\nLet's list the pairs $(i,j)$ from $S$ with $i > j$:\n- $(2,1) \\in S \\implies$ There is a nonzero entry at position $(2,1)$. By symmetry, $(1,2)$ is also nonzero. This corresponds to an edge $\\{1,2\\}$ in $G(A)$.\n- $(3,1) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(3,1)$ and $(1,3)$. This gives the edge $\\{1,3\\}$.\n- $(3,2) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(3,2)$ and $(2,3)$. This gives the edge $\\{2,3\\}$.\n- $(4,2) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(4,2)$ and $(2,4)$. This gives the edge $\\{2,4\\}$.\n- $(4,3) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(4,3)$ and $(3,4)$. This gives the edge $\\{3,4\\}$.\n- $(5,1) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(5,1)$ and $(1,5)$. This gives the edge $\\{1,5\\}$.\n- $(5,4) \\in S \\implies$ Nonzero at $(5,4)$ and $(4,5)$. This gives the edge $\\{4,5\\}$.\n\nThe diagonal entries in $S$, such as $(1,1), (2,2), \\dots$, do not correspond to edges in the graph, as edges only connect distinct vertices.\n\nThe complete edge set $E$ of the graph $G(A)$ is the collection of all such undirected edges:\n$$\nE = \\left\\{ \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{1,5\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,5\\} \\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe degree of a vertex, denoted $\\deg(v)$, is the number of edges incident to it. We can compute the degree of each vertex by counting its occurrences in the edge set $E$.\n\n- **Vertex 1**: Is connected to vertices $2$, $3$, and $5$. The edges are $\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{1,5\\}$.\n  Therefore, $\\deg(1) = 3$.\n\n- **Vertex 2**: Is connected to vertices $1$, $3$, and $4$. The edges are $\\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}$.\n  Therefore, $\\deg(2) = 3$.\n\n- **Vertex 3**: Is connected to vertices $1$, $2$, and $4$. The edges are $\\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}$.\n  Therefore, $\\deg(3) = 3$.\n\n- **Vertex 4**: Is connected to vertices $2$, $3$, and $5$. The edges are $\\{2,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,5\\}$.\n  Therefore, $\\deg(4) = 3$.\n\n- **Vertex 5**: Is connected to vertices $1$ and $4$. The edges are $\\{1,5\\}, \\{4,5\\}$.\n  Therefore, $\\deg(5) = 2$.\n\nThe degrees of all vertices are now computed. The problem asks for the result to be expressed as the ordered row vector $(\\deg(1),\\deg(2),\\deg(3),\\deg(4),\\deg(5))$.\n\nThis vector is $(3, 3, 3, 3, 2)$.",

After adding the fill edges, the vertex $v$ and all its incident edges are removed from the graph. This process is repeated for all vertices in $\\pi$.\n\nLet $G^{(0)} = G$.

The degree $d_0(v)$ of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges connected to it. By inspecting the edge set $E$, we compile the adjacency list for each vertex and find its degree:\n- Neighbors of vertex $1$: $N_0(1) = \\{3, 4\\}$, so $d_0(1) = 2$.\n- Neighbors of vertex $2$: $N_0(2) = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, so $d_0(2) = 4$.\n- Neighbors of vertex $3$: $N_0(3) = \\{1, 2, 4, 5\\}$, so $d_0(3) = 4$.\n- Neighbors of vertex $4$: $N_0(4) = \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$, so $d_0(4) = 4$.\n- Neighbors of vertex $5$: $N_0(5) = \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, so $d_0(5) = 3$.\n- Neighbors of vertex $6$: $N_0(6) = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$, so $d_0(6) = 3$.\n\nThe initial degrees are $d_0(1)=2$, $d_0(2)=4$, $d_0(3)=4$, $d_0(4)=4$, $d_0(5)=3$, $d_0(6)=3$.\n\nBoth MD and AMD strategies begin by selecting the vertex with the minimum current degree.\nThe minimum degree is $\\min(\\{2, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3\\}) = 2$, which uniquely corresponds to vertex $1$.\nTherefore, the first pivot selected is $p_1 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Pivot Selection using Exact Minimum Degree (MD)**\n\nTo find the second pivot, we simulate the elimination of $p_1=1$ and compute the exact degrees in the resulting elimination graph $G_1$.\nThe elimination process involves two actions:\n1.  Removing the pivot $p_1=1$ and all its incident edges, which are $(1,3)$ and $(1,4)$.\n2.  Adding \"fill-in\" edges to form a clique on the neighbor set of the pivot, $N_0(1) = \\{3, 4\\}$. A clique on $\\{3, 4\\}$ requires the edge $(3,4)$ to be present.\n\nWe check if the edge $(3,4)$ exists in the original graph $G_0$. The edge set $E$ contains $(3,4)$. Thus, the neighbor set $N_0(1)$ is already a clique, and no fill-in edges are generated.\n\nThe new graph $G_1$ has vertex set $V_1 = V \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We calculate the new degrees, $d_1(v)$, for all $v \\in V_1$:\n- For a vertex $v \\in N_0(1) = \\{3, 4\\}$, its degree is reduced by $1$ due to the removal of the edge to $p_1$. Since there is no fill-in, this is the only change.\n  - $d_1(3) = d_0(3) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n  - $d_1(4) = d_0(4) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n- For a vertex $v \\notin N_0(1) \\cup \\{1\\}$, its adjacency is unaffected by the elimination of $1$ because no fill-in edges were created.\n  - $d_1(2) = d_0(2) = 4$.\n  - $d_1(5) = d_0(5) = 3$.\n  - $d_1(6) = d_0(6) = 3$.\n\nThe degrees in the elimination graph $G_1$ are:\n$d_1(2)=4$, $d_1(3)=3$, $d_1(4)=3$, $d_1(5)=3$, $d_1(6)=3$.\n\nTo find the second pivot, $p_2^{MD}$, we apply the minimum degree rule to the vertices in $V_1$.\nThe minimum degree in $G_1$ is $\\min(\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}) = 3$.\nThe set of vertices with this minimum degree is $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nAccording to the tie-breaking rule, we select the vertex with the smallest index.\n$p_2^{MD} = \\min(\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}) = 3$.\n\n**Step 3: Second Pivot Selection using Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD)**\n\nWe again start with $p_1 = 1$. The AMD strategy selects the next pivot by minimizing an *approximate* degree, or score. The problem defines a specific rule for this score calculation after eliminating a pivot $p$:\n- For each neighbor $w \\in N(p)$, its score is an upper bound on its new degree. This bound is computed by assuming every other vertex in $N(p) \\setminus \\{w\\}$ becomes a new neighbor, regardless of pre-existing connections. The degree of $w$ decreases by $1$ (for the lost edge to $p$) and is assumed to increase by $|N(p)| - 1$. The resulting score is $d'_{AMD}(w) = d_0(w) - 1 + (|N(p)| - 1) = d_0(w) + |N(p)| - 2$.\n- For non-neighbors $z \\notin N(p) \\cup \\{p\\}$, their degrees are retained. This is because their adjacencies are not affected by the elimination of $p$. So, $d'_{AMD}(z) = d_0(z)$.\n\nWe apply this rule for the elimination of $p_1 = 1$. The initial degrees $d_0(v)$ are as computed in Step 1. The neighbor set is $N_0(1) = \\{3, 4\\}$, so its size is $|N_0(1)| = 2$.\n\nWe calculate the scores for the remaining vertices $v \\in V_1 = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$:\n- For the neighbors of $p_1$, which are $w \\in \\{3, 4\\}$:\n  The score is $d_0(w) + |N_0(1)| - 2 = d_0(w) + 2 - 2 = d_0(w)$.\n  - $d'_{AMD}(3) = d_0(3) = 4$.\n  - $d'_{AMD}(4) = d_0(4) = 4$.\n- For the non-neighbors of $p_1$, which are $z \\in \\{2, 5, 6\\}$:\n  Their scores are their original degrees.\n  - $d'_{AMD}(2) = d_0(2) = 4$.\n  - $d'_{AMD}(5) = d_0(5) = 3$.\n  - $d'_{AMD}(6) = d_0(6) = 3$.\n\nThe set of approximate degrees (scores) for the vertices in $V_1$ is:\n$d'_{AMD}(2)=4$, $d'_{AMD}(3)=4$, $d'_{AMD}(4)=4$, $d'_{AMD}(5)=3$, $d'_{AMD}(6)=3$.\n\nTo find the second pivot, $p_2^{AMD}$, we apply the minimum degree rule to these scores.\nThe minimum score is $\\min(\\{4, 4, 4, 3, 3\\}) = 3$.\nThe set of vertices with this minimum score is $\\{5, 6\\}$.\nApplying the tie-breaking rule (smallest index), we select:\n$p_2^{AMD} = \\min(\\{5, 6\\}) = 5$.\n\nIn summary, the second pivot selected by the exact minimum degree strategy is $3$, and the second pivot selected by the specified approximate minimum degree strategy is $5$.",
