For a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix $A$, the number of eigenvalues strictly less than a given value $\\lambda$, denoted $\\nu(\\lambda)$, is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence $\\{p_0(\\lambda), p_1(\\lambda), \\dots, p_n(\\lambda)\\}$.

The polynomials $p_k(\\lambda) = \\det(A_k - \\lambda I_k)$ satisfy the three-term recurrence relation:\n$p_k(\\lambda) = (d_k - \\lambda) p_{k-1}(\\lambda) - e_{k-1}^2 p_{k-2}(\\lambda)$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n\nThe sequence of polynomials is defined as follows:\n$p_0(\\lambda) = 1$\n$p_1(\\lambda) = d_1 - \\lambda = 4 - \\lambda$\nFor $k=2,3,4$, we use the recurrence with $e_k=1$ for all $k$: $p_k(\\lambda) = (d_k - \\lambda) p_{k-1}(\\lambda) - p_{k-2}(\\lambda)$.\n\n$p_2(\\lambda) = (d_2 - \\lambda)p_1(\\lambda) - p_0(\\lambda) = (2 - \\lambda)(4 - \\lambda) - 1 = \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 8 - 1 = \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 7$\n\n$p_3(\\lambda) = (d_3 - \\lambda)p_2(\\lambda) - p_1(\\lambda) = (2 - \\lambda)(\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 7) - (4 - \\lambda) = (2\\lambda^2 - 12\\lambda + 14 - \\lambda^3 + 6\\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda) - (4 - \\lambda) = -\\lambda^3 + 8\\lambda^2 - 19\\lambda + 14 - 4 + \\lambda = -\\lambda^3 + 8\\lambda^2 - 18\\lambda + 10$\n\n$p_4(\\lambda) = (d_4 - \\lambda)p_3(\\lambda) - p_2(\\lambda) = (3 - \\lambda)(-\\lambda^3 + 8\\lambda^2 - 18\\lambda + 10) - (\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 7) = (-3\\lambda^3 + 24\\lambda^2 - 54\\lambda + 30 + \\lambda^4 - 8\\lambda^3 + 18\\lambda^2 - 10\\lambda) - (\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 7) = \\lambda^4 - 11\\lambda^3 + 42\\lambda^2 - 64\\lambda + 30 - \\lambda^2 + 6\\lambda - 7 = \\lambda^4 - 11\\lambda^3 + 41\\lambda^2 - 58\\lambda + 23$\n\nNow, we evaluate this sequence at the two given shifts, $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n**Evaluation at $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{3}{2}$:**\n$p_0(\\frac{3}{2}) = 1$\n$p_1(\\frac{3}{2}) = 4 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$\n$p_2(\\frac{3}{2}) = (\\frac{3}{2})^2 - 6(\\frac{3}{2}) + 7 = \\frac{9}{4} - 9 + 7 = \\frac{9}{4} - 2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$p_3(\\frac{3}{2}) = -(\\frac{3}{2})^3 + 8(\\frac{3}{2})^2 - 18(\\frac{3}{2}) + 10 = -\\frac{27}{8} + 8(\\frac{9}{4}) - 27 + 10 = -\\frac{27}{8} + 18 - 17 = 1 - \\frac{27}{8} = -\\frac{19}{8}$\n$p_4(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\lambda_1^4 - 11\\lambda_1^3 + 41\\lambda_1^2 - 58\\lambda_1 + 23 = (\\frac{3}{2})^4 - 11(\\frac{3}{2})^3 + 41(\\frac{3}{2})^2 - 58(\\frac{3}{2}) + 23 = \\frac{81}{16} - \\frac{297}{8} + \\frac{369}{4} - 87 + 23 = \\frac{81 - 594 + 1476 - 1024}{16} = \\frac{1557 - 1618}{16} = -\\frac{61}{16}$\n\nThe signs of the sequence $\\{p_k(\\frac{3}{2})\\}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ are $\\{+, +, +, -, -\\}$.\nThe number of sign changes in this sequence is the count of successions of non-like signs. There is one sign change between $p_2(\\frac{3}{2})$ and $p_3(\\frac{3}{2})$.\nThus, the number of eigenvalues of $A$ strictly less than $\\frac{3}{2}$ is $\\nu(\\lambda_1) = \\nu(\\frac{3}{2}) = 1$.\n\n**Evaluation at $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{5}{2}$:**\n$p_0(\\frac{5}{2}) = 1$\n$p_1(\\frac{5}{2}) = 4 - \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n$p_2(\\frac{5}{2}) = (\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 6(\\frac{5}{2}) + 7 = \\frac{25}{4} - 15 + 7 = \\frac{25}{4} - 8 = -\\frac{7}{4}$\n$p_3(\\frac{5}{2}) = -(\\frac{5}{2})^3 + 8(\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 18(\\frac{5}{2}) + 10 = -\\frac{125}{8} + 8(\\frac{25}{4}) - 45 + 10 = -\\frac{125}{8} + 50 - 35 = 15 - \\frac{125}{8} = \\frac{120-125}{8} = -\\frac{5}{8}$\n$p_4(\\frac{5}{2}) = (\\frac{5}{2})^4 - 11(\\frac{5}{2})^3 + 41(\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 58(\\frac{5}{2}) + 23 = \\frac{625}{16} - \\frac{1375}{8} + \\frac{1025}{4} - 145 + 23 = \\frac{625 - 2750 + 4100 - 1952}{16} = \\frac{4725 - 4702}{16} = \\frac{23}{16}$\n\nThe signs of the sequence $\\{p_k(\\frac{5}{2})\\}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ are $\\{+, +, -, -, +\\}$.\nThere is a sign change from $p_1(\\frac{5}{2})$ to $p_2(\\frac{5}{2})$ and another from $p_3(\\frac{5}{2})$ to $p_4(\\frac{5}{2})$.\nThus, the number of eigenvalues of $A$ strictly less than $\\frac{5}{2}$ is $\\nu(\\lambda_2) = \\nu(\\frac{5}{2}) = 2$.\n\n**Interpretation of the Difference**\nThe quantity $\\nu(\\lambda_2) - \\nu(\\lambda_1)$ counts the number of eigenvalues of $A$ in the interval $[\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$. As $p_4(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I)$, the roots of $p_4(\\lambda)$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Since $p_4(\\lambda_1) = -\\frac{61}{16} \\neq 0$ and $p_4(\\lambda_2) = \\frac{23}{16} \\neq 0$, neither $\\lambda_1$ nor $\\lambda_2$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. Therefore, the number of eigenvalues in the half-open interval $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2]$ is the same as the number of eigenvalues in the open interval $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$, which is given by $\\nu(\\lambda_2) - \\nu(\\lambda_1)$.\n\nThe number of eigenvalues in $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2] = (\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}]$ is:\n$\\nu(\\lambda_2) - \\nu(\\lambda_1) = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, there is exactly one eigenvalue of $A$ in the interval $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}]$.",

The task involves constructing the sequence, explaining how the root multiplicity is handled, and using the sequence to count the number of roots in the open intervals $(-\\infty, 1)$ and $(1, +\\infty)$.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem is mathematically well-defined and scientifically grounded. It concerns the application of Sturm's theorem, a classical result in real algebraic geometry, to count the real roots of a given polynomial. The context, eigenvalue counting for a real symmetric matrix, is a standard application in numerical linear algebra. The polynomial has a multiple root, which is a key feature that a rigorous application of the theorem must address. The problem provides all necessary information and is free from ambiguity or contradiction. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Solution**\n\nFirst, we expand the polynomial $p(x)$:\n$$p(x) = (x^{2} - 2x + 1)(x + 2) = x^{3} - 2x^{2} + x + 2x^{2} - 4x + 2 = x^{3} - 3x + 2$$\nA Sturm sequence is generated from a polynomial and its derivative. Let $p_0(x) = p(x)$ and $p_1(x) = p'(x)$. The subsequent polynomials $p_{i+1}(x)$ are the negatives of the remainders from the Euclidean algorithm division of $p_{i-1}(x)$ by $p_i(x)$.\n\n**Handling of Multiple Roots**\n\nSturm's theorem, in its standard form, counts the number of *distinct* real roots in an interval. A polynomial $p(x)$ has multiple roots if and only if $p(x)$ and its derivative $p'(x)$ share a common factor, i.e., $\\text{gcd}(p(x), p'(x))$ is a non-constant polynomial. To correctly apply the theorem, we must work with the square-free part of $p(x)$, which is given by the polynomial $q(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{\\text{gcd}(p(x), p'(x))}$. The polynomial $q(x)$ has the same distinct roots as $p(x)$, but each with multiplicity one.\n\nWe now find the a Sturm sequence for $p(x)$ to identify the GCD.\nLet $p_0(x) = p(x) = x^{3} - 3x + 2$.\nLet $p_1(x) = p'(x) = 3x^{2} - 3$.\n\nWe perform polynomial division of $p_0(x)$ by $p_1(x)$:\n$$x^{3} - 3x + 2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x\\right)(3x^{2} - 3) + (-2x + 2)$$\nThe remainder is $r_1(x) = -2x + 2$. The next polynomial in the sequence is $p_2(x) = -r_1(x) = 2x - 2$.\n\nNext, we divide $p_1(x)$ by $p_2(x)$:\n$$3x^{2} - 3 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)(2x - 2) + 0$$\nThe remainder is $r_2(x) = 0$. The sequence terminates. The last non-zero polynomial in this sequence is $p_2(x)$, which is therefore proportional to $\\text{gcd}(p(x), p'(x))$.\n$$\\text{gcd}(p(x), p'(x)) = p_2(x) = 2x - 2 = 2(x - 1)$$\nThe existence of a non-constant GCD confirms that $x=1$ is a multiple root, as expected from the factored form of $p(x)$.\n\nNow, we define the square-free polynomial $q(x)$:\n$$q(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{x-1} = \\frac{x^{3} - 3x + 2}{x-1} = x^{2} + x - 2$$\nThe distinct roots of $p(x)$ are the roots of $q(x) = x^{2} + x - 2 = (x+2)(x-1)$, which are $x = -2$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**Constructing the Sturm Sequence for $q(x)$**\n\nWe build the Sturm sequence for $q(x)$. Let's denote this sequence by $\\{P_i(x)\\}$.\n$P_0(x) = q(x) = x^{2} + x - 2$\n$P_1(x) = q'(x) = 2x + 1$\n\nDivide $P_0(x)$ by $P_1(x)$:\n$$x^{2} + x - 2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)(2x + 1) - \\frac{9}{4}$$\nThe remainder is $R_1(x) = -\\frac{9}{4}$. The next polynomial is $P_2(x) = -R_1(x) = \\frac{9}{4}$.\nSince $P_2(x)$ is a non-zero constant, the sequence terminates here. The Sturm sequence for counting the distinct roots of $p(x)$ is:\n$$ \\begin{cases} P_0(x) = x^{2} + x - 2 \\\\ P_1(x) = 2x + 1 \\\\ P_2(x) = \\frac{9}{4} \\end{cases} $$\n\n**Applying Sturm's Theorem**\n\nLet $V(c)$ be the number of sign variations in the sequence $\\{P_0(c), P_1(c), P_2(c)\\}$. Sturm's theorem states that the number of distinct real roots of $q(x)$ in the half-open interval $(a, b]$ is $V(a) - V(b)$.\n\nWe need to count roots in the open intervals $(-\\infty, 1)$ and $(1, +\\infty)$.\n\n**1.

Sign: $+$.\nThe sequence of signs at $-\\infty$ is $(+, -, +)$. The number of sign variations is $V(-\\infty) = 2$.\n\nTo find $V(1)$, we evaluate the polynomials at $x=1$:\n- $P_0(1) = 1^{2} + 1 - 2 = 0$.\n- $P_1(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Sign: $+$.\n- $P_2(1) = \\frac{9}{4}$. Sign: $+$.\nThe sequence of values is $(0, 3, \\frac{9}{4})$. When a term is zero, it is ignored for the sign count. The sequence of signs is $(+, +)$. The number of sign variations is $V(1) = 0$.\n\nThe number of distinct roots in the interval $(-\\infty, 1]$ is $V(-\\infty) - V(1) = 2 - 0 = 2$. These roots are $x=-2$ and $x=1$.\nThe problem asks for the number of roots in the *open* interval $(-\\infty, 1)$. Since we know $x=1$ is a root, we must exclude it from the count for $(-\\infty, 1]$.\nNumber of roots in $(-\\infty, 1) = (\\text{Number of roots in } (-\\infty, 1]) - (\\text{Number of roots at } x=1) = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n**2. Counting roots in $(1, +\\infty)$**\n\nWe can find the number of roots in $(1, +\\infty)$ using the formula for the interval $(1, b]$ as $b \\to +\\infty$, which is $V(1) - V(+\\infty)$.\nWe already know $V(1)=0$.\nTo find $V(+\\infty)$, we examine the signs of the leading terms of the polynomials as $x \\to +\\infty$:\n- $P_0(x) = x^{2} + x - 2$: Leading term $x^{2}$ is positive. Sign: $+$.\n- $P_1(x) = 2x + 1$: Leading term $2x$ is positive. Sign: $+$.\n- $P_2(x) = \\frac{9}{4}$: Positive constant. Sign: $+$.\nThe sequence of signs at $+\\infty$ is $(+, +, +)$. The number of sign variations is $V(+\\infty) = 0$.\n\nThe number of distinct roots in the interval $(1, +\\infty]$ is $V(1) - V(+\\infty) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nSince the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ contains the same roots as $(1, +\\infty]$ (as $x=1$ is not in the interior), the number of roots is $0$.\n\nThus, there is $1$ root in $(-\\infty, 1)$ and $0$ roots in $(1, +\\infty)$.

A special feature of the given matrix $T$ is that it is block-diagonal, which simplifies the eigenvalue problem.\n\n**Part 1: The Additive Decomposition Principle**\n\nLet $T$ be a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix of size $n \\times n$ with diagonal entries $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ and sub/super-diagonal entries $b_1, \\dots, b_{n-1}$. Let $p_k(\\lambda)$ be the characteristic polynomial of the leading $k \\times k$ principal submatrix of $T$.

When $b_k=0$, the recurrence relation for $p_{k+1}(\\lambda)$ becomes:\n$$p_{k+1}(\\lambda) = (a_{k+1} - \\lambda)p_k(\\lambda) - b_k^2 p_{k-1}(\\lambda) = (a_{k+1} - \\lambda)p_k(\\lambda)$$\nRecognizing that $q_1(\\lambda) = (a_{k+1} - \\lambda)$, we have $p_{k+1}(\\lambda) = q_1(\\lambda) p_k(\\lambda)$. By induction, it can be shown that for $j=1, \\dots, n-k$:\n$$p_{k+j}(\\lambda) = q_j(\\lambda) p_k(\\lambda)$$\nThus, the full Sturm sequence for $T$ evaluated at $\\sigma$ is:\n$$\\{ p_0(\\sigma), \\dots, p_k(\\sigma), q_1(\\sigma)p_k(\\sigma), \\dots, q_{n-k}(\\sigma)p_k(\\sigma) \\}$$\nThe total number of sign changes, $N(\\sigma)$, is the sum of sign changes in the first part of the sequence, $\\{p_0(\\sigma), \\dots, p_k(\\sigma)\\}$, and the second part, $\\{p_k(\\sigma), q_1(\\sigma)p_k(\\sigma), \\dots, q_{n-k}(\\sigma)p_k(\\sigma)\\}$. The first count is $N_1(\\sigma)$. For the second part, assuming $p_k(\\sigma) \\neq 0$, the number of sign changes is identical to the number of sign changes in $\\{1, q_1(\\sigma), \\dots, q_{n-k}(\\sigma)\\}$, which, since $q_0(\\sigma)=1$, is exactly $N_2(\\sigma)$. Therefore, $N(\\sigma) = N_1(\\sigma) + N_2(\\sigma)$. This confirms the additive decomposition.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for the Given Matrix and Shift**\n\nThe given matrix $T$ is a $7 \\times 7$ real symmetric tridiagonal matrix:\n$$\nT =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  1  0  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n1  -2  -1  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  -1  5  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  2  2  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  2  0  -1  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  -1  3  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  1  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe off-diagonal entry $b_3 = T_{3,4} = 0$, so the matrix splits into a $3 \\times 3$ block $T_1$ and a $4 \\times 4$ block $T_2$.\n$$T_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1  0 \\\\ 1  -2  -1 \\\\ 0  -1  5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad T_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2  0  0 \\\\ 2  0  -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1  3  1 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe need to find the number of eigenvalues of $T$ strictly less than the shift $\\sigma = 1$. We compute the Sturm sequence counts for each block separately and add them.\n\n**Block $T_1$:**\nThe diagonal entries are $a_1=4, a_2=-2, a_3=5$. The subdiagonal entries are $b_1=1, b_2=-1$. The shift is $\\sigma=1$.\n- $p_0(1) = 1$\n- $p_1(1) = (a_1 - \\sigma) = 4 - 1 = 3$\n- $p_2(1) = (a_2 - \\sigma)p_1(1) - b_1^2 p_0(1) = (-2 - 1)(3) - (1)^2(1) = -9 - 1 = -10$\n- $p_3(1) = (a_3 - \\sigma)p_2(1) - b_2^2 p_1(1) = (5 - 1)(-10) - (-1)^2(3) = 4(-10) - 3 = -43$\n\nThe sequence of values is $\\{1, 3, -10, -43\\}$.\nThe sequence of signs is $\\{+, +, -, -\\}$.\nThere is one sign change (from $3$ to $-10$). So, $N_1(1) = 1$.\n\n**Block $T_2$:**\nThe diagonal entries are $a_1'=2, a_2'=0, a_3'=3, a_4'=-1$. The subdiagonal entries are $b_1'=2, b_2'=-1, b_3'=1$. The shift is $\\sigma=1$. Let its Sturm sequence polynomials be $q_k$.\n- $q_0(1) = 1$\n- $q_1(1) = (a_1' - \\sigma) = 2 - 1 = 1$\n- $q_2(1) = (a_2' - \\sigma)q_1(1) - (b_1')^2 q_0(1) = (0 - 1)(1) - (2)^2(1) = -1 - 4 = -5$\n- $q_3(1) = (a_3' - \\sigma)q_2(1) - (b_2')^2 q_1(1) = (3 - 1)(-5) - (-1)^2(1) = 2(-5) - 1 = -11$\n- $q_4(1) = (a_4' - \\sigma)q_3(1) - (b_3')^2 q_2(1) = (-1 - 1)(-11) - (1)^2(-5) = (-2)(-11) + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27$\n\nThe sequence of values is $\\{1, 1, -5, -11, 27\\}$.\nThe sequence of signs is $\\{+, +, -, -, +\\}$.\nThere are two sign changes (from $1$ to $-5$, and from $-11$ to $27$). So, $N_2(1) = 2$.\n\n**Total Count:**\nThe total number $N$ of eigenvalues of $T$ strictly less than $\\sigma=1$ is the sum of the counts for the two blocks:\n$$N = N_1(1) + N_2(1) = 1 + 2 = 3$$\n\n**Part 3: Exploitation for Deflation**\n\nThe decomposition of the eigenvalue problem when an off-diagonal element $b_k$ is zero is known as deflation. Eigenvalue algorithms like the QR algorithm, bisection, or Multiple Relatively Robust Representations (MRRR) exploit this property to significantly enhance efficiency. Instead of solving a single large $n \\times n$ problem, the algorithm can solve two smaller, independent problems for the blocks $T_1$ (size $k \\times k$) and $T_2$ (size $(n-k) \\times (n-k)$). Since the complexity of many eigenvalue algorithms scales with the cube of the matrix size, this decomposition leads to a substantial reduction in computational cost, from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(k^3 + (n-k)^3)$.\n\nIn the context of algorithms that use inertia (counts of eigenvalues greater than, less than, or equal to a shift $\\sigma$), such as bisection and MRRR, this structural decomposition is fundamental. The inertia of a block-diagonal matrix is the sum of the inertias of its blocks. Our calculation of $N(\\sigma) = N_1(\\sigma)+N_2(\\sigma)$ is a direct application of this principle. In practice, if an iterative method causes an off-diagonal element to become numerically negligible (i.e., smaller than a certain tolerance), it is set to zero, and the problem is deflated, with the subproblems being solved recursively. This is a critical strategy for the practical performance of modern eigenvalue software.",
