A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the dimensions of a tensor $Y$ resulting from a Tensor-Times-Matrix (TTM) product, and then to find the dimensions of the mode-$3$ unfolding of $Y$.\n\nLet the tensor $X$ have dimensions $I_1 \\times I_2 \\times I_3$. From the problem statement, we have $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 4 \\times 2}$, so $I_1 = 3$, $I_2 = 4$, and $I_3 = 2$.\nLet the matrix $U$ have dimensions $J \\times K$. From the problem statement, we have $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 3}$, so $J = 5$ and $K = 3$.\n\n**Part 1: Determine the dimensions of $Y$**\n\nThe tensor $Y$ is defined by the mode-$1$ TTM product with matrix $U$:\n$$Y = X \\times_{1} U$$\nThe mode-$n$ product of a tensor $\\mathcal{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{I_1 \\times \\dots \\times I_n \\times \\dots \\times I_N}$ with a matrix $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{J \\times I_n}$ results in a tensor $\\mathcal{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{I_1 \\times \\dots \\times I_{n-1} \\times J \\times I_{n+1} \\times \\dots \\times I_N}$. The operation replaces the dimension $I_n$ of the $n$-th mode with the dimension $J$ from the matrix $U$.\n\nIn our case, $n=1$. The tensor $X$ has dimensions $I_1 \\times I_2 \\times I_3$, and the matrix $U$ has dimensions $J \\times I_1$. The condition for the product to be well-defined is that the number of columns of $U$ must be equal to the size of the first mode of $X$. Here, the number of columns of $U$ is $K=3$, and the size of the first mode of $X$ is $I_1=3$. Since $K=I_1$, the operation is well-defined.\n\nThe resulting tensor $Y$ will have dimensions $J \\times I_2 \\times I_3$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n- The first dimension of $Y$ is $J = 5$.\n- The second dimension of $Y$ is $I_2 = 4$.\n- The third dimension of $Y$ is $I_3 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the tensor $Y$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 4 \\times 2}$, and its dimensions are $(5, 4, 2)$.\n\n**Part 2: Determine the dimensions of $Y_{(3)}$**\n\nThe notation $Y_{(3)}$ represents the mode-$3$ unfolding of the tensor $Y$. The tensor $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 4 \\times 2}$ has dimensions we can denote as $J_1 \\times J_2 \\times J_3$, where $J_1 = 5$, $J_2 = 4$, and $J_3 = 2$.\n\nThe mode-$n$ unfolding of a tensor $\\mathcal{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{J_1 \\times J_2 \\times \\dots \\times J_N}$ is a matrix, denoted $\\mathcal{Y}_{(n)}$, which reshapes the tensor's elements. According to the Kolda–Bader convention, the columns of the matrix $\\mathcal{Y}_{(n)}$ are the mode-$n$ fibers of the tensor $\\mathcal{Y}$.\n\nA mode-$n$ fiber is a vector obtained by fixing all indices except the $n$-th index. For a third-order tensor $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{J_1 \\times J_2 \\times J_3}$, a mode-$3$ fiber is a column vector of length $J_3$, obtained by fixing the first two indices, i.e., $Y_{j_1, j_2, :}$ for some fixed $j_1$ and $j_2$.\n\nThe mode-$3$ unfolding $Y_{(3)}$ arranges these mode-$3$ fibers as its columns.\n- The number of rows of $Y_{(3)}$ is the length of each mode-$3$ fiber, which is the size of the $3$-rd mode of $Y$. This is $J_3 = 2$.\n- The number of columns of $Y_{(3)}$ is the total number of mode-$3$ fibers. This is determined by the number of possible combinations of the other indices, which is the product of the sizes of the other modes. In this case, it is $J_1 \\times J_2$.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the matrix $Y_{(3)}$ are $J_3 \\times (J_1 \\times J_2)$.\nSubstituting the dimensions of $Y$:\n- The number of rows is $J_3 = 2$.\n- The number of columns is $J_1 \\times J_2 = 5 \\times 4 = 20$.\n\nTherefore, the matrix $Y_{(3)}$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 20}$, and its dimensions are $(2, 20)$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three dimensions of the tensor $Y$ are $5, 4, 2$.\nThe two dimensions of the matrix $Y_{(3)}$ are $2, 20$.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a single row matrix listing these five numbers in order.",

Use the following foundational definitions: a mode-$n$ fiber of a tensor is obtained by fixing all indices except $i_n$, a slice is obtained by fixing one index and varying the other two, and the mode-$n$ unfolding of a tensor is the matrix whose columns are the mode-$n$ fibers arranged according to a specified ordering of the remaining indices.

No rounding is required, and the final answer must be expressed as two integers giving the shape followed by the single integer column index, reported together as a row vector.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and data to arrive at a unique solution. We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem centers on the concept of tensor unfolding, a fundamental operation in multilinear algebra. We are given a third-order tensor $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 3 \\times 4}$. The dimensions of the tensor along each mode are $I_1=2$, $I_2=3$, and $I_3=4$. The indices for each mode are $i_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$, $i_2 \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and $i_3 \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. We are asked to determine the shape of the mode-$2$ unfolding, denoted $X_{(2)}$, and to find a specific column index within this unfolding.\n\nFirst, we determine the shape of the mode-$2$ unfolding, $X_{(2)}$. By the definition of mode-$n$ unfolding of a tensor of order $N$, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{I_1 \\times I_2 \\times \\dots \\times I_N}$, the resulting matrix $X_{(n)}$ has dimensions $I_n \\times (I_{n+1} \\times \\dots \\times I_N \\times I_1 \\times \\dots \\times I_{n-1})$. More generally, the number of rows of $X_{(n)}$ is the dimension of the $n$-th mode, $I_n$. The number of columns is the product of the dimensions of all other modes, $\\prod_{k \\neq n} I_k$.\n\nIn our case, the tensor $X$ is of order $3$ and we are interested in the mode-$2$ unfolding, so $n=2$.\nThe number of rows of $X_{(2)}$ is equal to the dimension of the second mode, which is $I_2=3$.\nThe number of columns of $X_{(2)}$ is the product of the dimensions of the other modes, which are mode $1$ and mode $3$. Thus, the number of columns is $I_1 \\times I_3 = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\nTherefore, the shape of the matrix $X_{(2)}$ is $3 \\times 8$.\n\nNext, we must determine the column index in $X_{(2)}$ corresponding to the index pair $(i_1, i_3)=(2,3)$. The columns of the mode-$2$ unfolding $X_{(2)}$ are the mode-$2$ fibers of the tensor $X$. A mode-$2$ fiber is obtained by fixing the indices $i_1$ and $i_3$ and letting the index $i_2$ vary. Each fiber is a vector of length $I_2=3$, specifically $X(i_1, :, i_3)$. There are $I_1 \\times I_3 = 8$ such fibers.\n\nThe problem states that these fibers are arranged as columns of $X_{(2)}$ according to the lexicographic ordering of the index pair $(i_1, i_3)$, where $i_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $i_3 \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The lexicographic ordering $(a,b) \\prec (c,d)$ is defined as occurring if and only if $ac$ or ($a=c$ and $bd$). This implies that the index $i_1$ is the primary (most significant) index and $i_3$ is the secondary (least significant) index. So, we list all pairs $(i_1, i_3)$ in increasing order:\n1.  For $i_1=1$: $(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)$\n2.  For $i_1=2$: $(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)$\n\nCombining these lists gives the complete ordered sequence of index pairs that correspond to the columns of $X_{(2)}$ from left to right:\nColumn 1: $(1,1)$\nColumn 2: $(1,2)$\nColumn 3: $(1,3)$\nColumn 4: $(1,4)$\nColumn 5: $(2,1)$\nColumn 6: $(2,2)$\nColumn 7: $(2,3)$\nColumn 8: $(2,4)$\n\nFrom this explicit enumeration, the index pair $(i_1, i_3) = (2,3)$ corresponds to the $7$-th column of the matrix $X_{(2)}$.\n\nWe can also derive this result using a general formula. For a given pair $(j_1, j_3)$ where $j_1 \\in \\{1, \\dots, I_1\\}$ and $j_3 \\in \\{1, \\dots, I_3\\}$, the $1$-based column index $k$ in the lexicographically ordered unfolding is given by the mapping:\n$$k = (j_1 - 1) \\times I_3 + j_3$$\nThis formula maps the two-dimensional index $(j_1, j_3)$ to a one-dimensional index $k$. The term $(j_1 - 1) \\times I_3$ counts the number of columns contributed by all preceding values of the primary index $i_1$. The term $j_3$ gives the position within the block corresponding to the current primary index $j_1$.\n\nApplying this formula to our specific case, where $(i_1, i_3) = (2,3)$ and $I_3=4$:\n$$k = (2 - 1) \\times 4 + 3 = 1 \\times 4 + 3 = 7$$\nThis confirms that the column index is $7$.\n\nThe final answer requires the shape of the matrix ($3$ rows, $8$ columns) and the computed column index ($7$), presented as a row vector.\nThe components of the vector are: number of rows of $X_{(2)}$, number of columns of $X_{(2)}$, and the column index for $(i_1, i_3)=(2,3)$.\nThese values are $3$, $8$, and $7$, respectively.",

While the *set* of mode-$3$ slices $\\{X(:,:,1), X(:,:,2)\\}$ is identical to the set $\\{Y(:,:,1), Y(:,:,2)\\}$, the tensors $X$ and $Y$ are distinct because the slices appear in a different order.\n\nOur first task is to compute the mode-$1$ unfoldings $X_{(1)}$ and $Y_{(1)}$. The mode-$1$ unfolding, $X_{(1)}$, is a matrix of size $I \\times (JK)$, which is $2 \\times (3 \\times 2) = 2 \\times 6$. Its columns are the mode-$1$ fibers $X(:,j,k)$, arranged according to the lexicographic order of the index pair $(j,k)$, where the first index $j$ varies fastest. The order of the columns is determined by the index pairs $(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)$.\n\nLet's extract the mode-$1$ fibers of $X$:\nThe first $J=3$ fibers are from the slice $k=1$:\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(1,1)$: $X(:,1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(2,1)$: $X(:,2,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(3,1)$: $X(:,3,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe next $J=3$ fibers are from the slice $k=2$:\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(1,2)$: $X(:,1,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(2,2)$: $X(:,2,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(3,2)$: $X(:,3,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAssembling these column vectors in the specified order gives the mode-$1$ unfolding of $X$:\n$$\nX_{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  4  7  3  6  9 \\\\ 2  5  8  0  1  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we construct $Y_{(1)}$ using the same procedure. The mode-$1$ fibers of $Y$ are $Y(:,j,k)$. From the definition of $Y$, we have $Y(:,j,1) = X(:,j,2)$ and $Y(:,j,2) = X(:,j,1)$.\nThe first $J=3$ fibers for $Y_{(1)}$ are from its slice $k=1$:\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(1,1)$: $Y(:,1,1) = X(:,1,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(2,1)$: $Y(:,2,1) = X(:,2,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(3,1)$: $Y(:,3,1) = X(:,3,2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe next $J=3$ fibers for $Y_{(1)}$ are from its slice $k=2$:\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(1,2)$: $Y(:,1,2) = X(:,1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(2,2)$: $Y(:,2,2) = X(:,2,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Fiber for $(j,k)=(3,2)$: $Y(:,3,2) = X(:,3,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAssembling these fibers gives the mode-$1$ unfolding of $Y$:\n$$\nY_{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  6  9  1  4  7 \\\\ 0  1  2  2  5  8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to find a unique column permutation matrix $\\Pi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{JK \\times JK} = \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 6}$ such that $Y_{(1)} = X_{(1)} \\Pi$.\nBy comparing the columns of $Y_{(1)}$ with the columns of $X_{(1)}$, we can identify the permutation. Let $x_p$ and $y_q$ be the $p$-th and $q$-th columns of $X_{(1)}$ and $Y_{(1)}$ respectively.\n- $y_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = x_4$\n- $y_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = x_5$\n- $y_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_6$\n- $y_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1$\n- $y_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} = x_2$\n- $y_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} = x_3$\n\nThis shows that the columns of $Y_{(1)}$ are a permutation of the columns of $X_{(1)}$. The first block of $J=3$ columns of $X_{(1)}$ (corresponding to slice $X(:,:,1)$) has moved to become the second block of columns in $Y_{(1)}$, and the second block of $J=3$ columns of $X_{(1)}$ (from slice $X(:,:,2)$) has become the first block in $Y_{(1)}$. This column shuffling is the \"implicit permutation\" that is not apparent when only considering the set of slices. The rigid fiber ordering rule of the unfolding process makes the operation sensitive to the slice ordering along modes not being unfolded.\n\nThe permutation of column indices $\\sigma: \\{1, ..., 6\\} \\to \\{1, ..., 6\\}$ is given by the mapping from the new position to the old position: $y_q = x_{\\sigma(q)}$.\n$\\sigma(1) = 4, \\sigma(2) = 5, \\sigma(3) = 6, \\sigma(4) = 1, \\sigma(5) = 2, \\sigma(6) = 3$.\nThe permutation matrix $\\Pi$ is constructed such that right-multiplication by $\\Pi$ permutes the columns of a matrix according to $\\sigma$. This means the $q$-th column of $\\Pi$ is the standard basis vector $e_{\\sigma(q)}$.\n$$\n\\Pi = \\begin{pmatrix} e_{\\sigma(1)}  e_{\\sigma(2)}  e_{\\sigma(3)}  e_{\\sigma(4)}  e_{\\sigma(5)}  e_{\\sigma(6)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} e_4  e_5  e_6  e_1  e_2  e_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExplicitly, this gives the $6 \\times 6$ matrix:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  0  1  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  1 \\\\\n1  0  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has a block structure $\\Pi = \\begin{pmatrix} 0_{3 \\times 3}  I_{3 \\times 3} \\\\ I_{3 \\times 3}  0_{3 \\times 3} \\end{pmatrix}$, where $I_{3 \\times 3}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix and $0_{3 \\times 3}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ zero matrix. This structure directly reflects the swapping of the two blocks of $J=3$ columns. Since all columns of $X_{(1)}$ are distinct, this permutation matrix is unique.\n\nThe third task is to compute the determinant of $\\Pi$. The determinant of a permutation matrix is equal to the sign of the corresponding permutation, $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$. The permutation $\\sigma$ can be decomposed into disjoint cycles: $\\sigma = (1 \\ 4)(2 \\ 5)(3 \\ 6)$. This is a product of $3$ transpositions (swaps). The sign of the permutation is $(-1)^k$, where $k$ is the number of transpositions.\nThus, $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = (-1)^3 = -1$.\nTherefore, the determinant of the permutation matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(\\Pi) = -1\n$$\nAlternatively, for a block matrix of the form $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  B \\\\ C  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $B$ and $C$ are square matrices of the same size, say $n \\times n$, its determinant is $\\det(M) = (-1)^{n} \\det(B)\\det(C)$. In our case, $B=I_{3 \\times 3}$ and $C=I_{3 \\times 3}$, so $n=3$.\n$$\n\\det(\\Pi) = (-1)^{3} \\det(I_{3 \\times 3}) \\det(I_{3 \\times 3}) = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = -1\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The final answer is the value of the determinant.",
