            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of numerical linear algebra, specifically the Gershgorin circle theorem. It is well-posed, with a complete and consistent set of data and clear, objective tasks that admit a unique solution. The problem is a standard exercise in applying and verifying the consequences of the theorem for a given matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -3 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Gershgorin disks for the rows and columns.\nFor the rows of $A$:\nThe first row disk, $R_1$, is centered at $a_{11} = 5$ and has a radius equal to the sum of the absolute values of the other entries in the first row, which is $r_1 = |-3| = 3$. So, $R_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 3\\}$.\nThe second row disk, $R_2$, is centered at $a_{22} = 0$ and has a radius equal to the sum of the absolute values of the other entries in the second row, which is $r_2 = |1| = 1$. So, $R_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\le 1\\}$.\nThe union of these disks is $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) = R_1 \\cup R_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 3\\} \\cup \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\le 1\\}$.\n\nFor the columns of $A$:\nThe first column disk, $C_1$, is centered at $a_{11} = 5$ and has a radius equal to the sum of the absolute values of the other entries in the first column, which is $c_1 = |1| = 1$. So, $C_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 1\\}$.\nThe second column disk, $C_2$, is centered at $a_{22} = 0$ and has a radius equal to the sum of the absolute values of the other entries in the second column, which is $c_2 = |-3| = 3$. So, $C_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\le 3\\}$.\nThe union of these disks is $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A) = C_1 \\cup C_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 1\\} \\cup \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\le 3\\}$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$ is a proper subset of both $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\nTo show $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A) \\subsetneq \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$, we need to find a point $z \\in \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$ such that $z \\notin \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\nLet us choose the point $z = 8$.\nFor this point, $|z - 5| = |8 - 5| = 3$, so $z=8$ is in $R_1$ because $3 \\le 3$. Thus, $z=8 \\in \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$.\nNow we check if $z=8$ is in $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A) = C_1 \\cup C_2$.\nFor $C_1$, we check $|z - 5| = |8 - 5| = 3$. Since $3 > 1$, $z=8 \\notin C_1$.\nFor $C_2$, we check $|z| = |8| = 8$. Since $8 > 3$, $z=8 \\notin C_2$.\nSince $z=8$ is not in $C_1$ or $C_2$, it is not in their union $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\nTherefore, we have found a point $z=8$ that is in $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$ but not in $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$, proving the proper subset relation.\n\nTo show $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A) \\subsetneq \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$, we need to find a point $z \\in \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$ such that $z \\notin \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$.\nLet us choose the point $z = -3$.\nFor this point, $|z| = |-3| = 3$, so $z=-3$ is in $C_2$ because $3 \\le 3$. Thus, $z=-3 \\in \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\nNow we check if $z=-3$ is in $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) = R_1 \\cup R_2$.\nFor $R_1$, we check $|z - 5| = |-3 - 5| = |-8| = 8$. Since $8 > 3$, $z=-3 \\notin R_1$.\nFor $R_2$, we check $|z| = |-3| = 3$. Since $3 > 1$, $z=-3 \\notin R_2$.\nSince $z=-3$ is not in $R_1$ or $R_2$, it is not in their union $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$.\nTherefore, we have found a point $z=-3$ that is in $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$ but not in $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$, proving the proper subset relation.\n\nNext, we compute the eigenvalues of $A$ and justify the containment in the intersection of the Gershgorin regions.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 5-\\lambda & -3 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (5-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(-3) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda(5-\\lambda) + 3 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 5\\lambda + 3 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 12}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}$. The spectrum is $\\sigma(A) = \\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\}$.\n\nThe Gershgorin circle theorem states that all eigenvalues of a matrix are located in the union of its Gershgorin disks, $\\sigma(A) \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$. Since the eigenvalues of $A$ and its transpose $A^T$ are identical, and the column disks of $A$ are the row disks of $A^T$, the theorem also implies $\\sigma(A) \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$. As the spectrum $\\sigma(A)$ is a subset of both $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A)$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$, it must be a subset of their intersection, i.e., $\\sigma(A) \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$. This provides the general justification.\n\nWe can verify this for our specific eigenvalues.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$: We know $3 < \\sqrt{13} < 4$, so $4 < \\frac{5+3}{2} < \\lambda_1 < \\frac{5+4}{2} = 4.5$.\nWe check if $\\lambda_1$ is in $\\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$. We test the tighter bounds from the intersection. A refinement of the theorem notes that since the row disks $R_1$ and $R_2$ are disjoint (distance between centers is $5$, sum of radii is $3+1=4$), and the column disks $C_1$ and $C_2$ are disjoint (distance between centers is $5$, sum of radii is $1+3=4$), there is one eigenvalue in the intersection $R_1 \\cap C_1$ and another in $R_2 \\cap C_2$, because $R_1 \\cap C_2$ and $R_2 \\cap C_1$ do not form a connecting chain. More concretely, $R_2 \\cap C_1$ is empty.\nLet's check if $\\lambda_1 \\in C_1 = \\{z: |z-5|\\le 1\\}$.\n$|\\lambda_1 - 5| = |\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} - 5| = |\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13} - 10}{2}| = |\\frac{\\sqrt{13} - 5}{2}| = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}$.\nAs $9 < 13$, we have $3 < \\sqrt{13}$. And as $13 < 16$, we have $\\sqrt{13} < 4$.\nSo, $1 < 5 - \\sqrt{13} < 2$, which means $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} < 1$.\nSince $|\\lambda_1-5| < 1$, $\\lambda_1$ is in $C_1$. Since $C_1 \\subset R_1$, $\\lambda_1$ is also in $R_1$. Thus $\\lambda_1 \\in R_1 \\cap C_1 \\subset \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}$: From the inequalities above, $\\frac{1}{2} < \\lambda_2 < 1$.\nLet's check if $\\lambda_2 \\in R_2 = \\{z: |z|\\le 1\\}$.\n$|\\lambda_2| = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} < 1$. So $\\lambda_2$ is in $R_2$. As $R_2 \\subset C_2$, $\\lambda_2$ is also in $C_2$. Thus $\\lambda_2 \\in R_2 \\cap C_2 \\subset \\mathcal{D}_{row}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{col}(A)$.\nThe check confirms the theorem's conclusion.\n\nFinally, we compute the spectral radius $\\rho(A)$.\nThe spectral radius is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues: $\\rho(A) = \\max(|\\lambda_1|, |\\lambda_2|)$.\nBoth eigenvalues are real and positive since $5 > \\sqrt{13}$ (as $25 > 13$).\nWe compare $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{13} > 0$, it is clear that $5 + \\sqrt{13} > 5 - \\sqrt{13}$, which implies $\\lambda_1 > \\lambda_2$.\nTherefore, the spectral radius is the larger eigenvalue.\n$$\n\\rho(A) = \\lambda_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the required exact expression.",

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in numerical linear algebra with no missing information or contradictions.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four specified tasks in order.\n\n1. Determination of the exact eigenvalues of $A$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is a $6 \\times 6$ real symmetric matrix with all diagonal entries equal to $0$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $v = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6)^T$. The eigenvalue equation is $Av = \\lambda v$.\n\nLet us search for an eigenvector of a specific form, motivated by the structure of the first row of $A$. Let us try a vector $v$ with $x_2=x_3=x_4=x_5=x_6=c$ for some constant $c$, and $x_1=k$. Without loss of generality, we can set $c=1$, so $v=(k, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)^T$.\nThe first row of the equation $Av = \\lambda v$ gives:\n$$A_{11}x_1 + \\sum_{j=2}^6 A_{1j}x_j = (0)k + \\sum_{j=2}^6 (1)(1) = 5 = \\lambda x_1 = \\lambda k$$\nThe second row gives:\n$$A_{21}x_1 + \\sum_{j=2, j \\neq 2}^6 A_{2j}x_j = (1)k + (1)x_3 + (-1)x_4 + (1)x_5 + (-1)x_6 = k + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = k = \\lambda x_2 = \\lambda(1)$$\nFrom the second equation, we have $k = \\lambda$. Substituting this into the first equation, $5 = \\lambda(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2$. This yields two possible eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\sqrt{5}$ and $\\lambda = -\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nLet's check if these are indeed eigenvalues for the remaining rows. For $\\lambda = \\sqrt{5}$, the eigenvector would be $v_1 = (\\sqrt{5}, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)^T$.\nRow $3$: $(Av_1)_3 = (\\sqrt{5}) + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = \\sqrt{5} = \\lambda v_{1,3}$.\nRow $4$: $(Av_1)_4 = (\\sqrt{5}) - 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = \\sqrt{5} = \\lambda v_{1,4}$.\nRow $5$: $(Av_1)_5 = (\\sqrt{5}) + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = \\sqrt{5} = \\lambda v_{1,5}$.\nRow $6$: $(Av_1)_6 = (\\sqrt{5}) - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = \\sqrt{5} = \\lambda v_{1,6}$.\nAll equations are satisfied, so $\\lambda_1 = \\sqrt{5}$ is an eigenvalue with eigenvector $v_1 = (\\sqrt{5}, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)^T$.\n\nFor $\\lambda = -\\sqrt{5}$, the eigenvector would be $v_2 = (-\\sqrt{5}, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)^T$.\nThe calculations are analogous. For instance, for row $2$:\n$(Av_2)_2 = (-\\sqrt{5}) + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = -\\sqrt{5} = \\lambda v_{2,2}$.\nThis also holds for all other rows. So, $\\lambda_2 = -\\sqrt{5}$ is an eigenvalue with eigenvector $v_2 = (-\\sqrt{5}, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)^T$.\n\nSince $A$ is symmetric, its eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. The remaining $6-2=4$ eigenvectors must be orthogonal to both $v_1$ and $v_2$. Let $v=(x_1, \\dots, x_6)^T$ be such a vector.\n$v \\cdot v_1 = \\sqrt{5}x_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^6 x_i = 0$.\n$v \\cdot v_2 = -\\sqrt{5}x_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^6 x_i = 0$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $2\\sqrt{5}x_1 = 0$, which implies $x_1=0$.\nSubstituting $x_1=0$ into either equation gives $\\sum_{i=2}^6 x_i = 0$.\n\nSo, the remaining four linearly independent eigenvectors lie in the subspace $S = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^6 \\mid x_1=0 \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=2}^6 x_i=0 \\}$. This subspace is invariant under $A$. For any $v \\in S$:\n$$(Av)_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^6 A_{1j}x_j = \\sum_{j=2}^6 x_j = 0 = \\lambda x_1$$\nThis shows that if $v\\in S$, then $Av \\in S$. The action of $A$ on $S$ is determined by the principal submatrix $B$ obtained by removing the first row and column of $A$:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe need to find the eigenvalues of $B$ for eigenvectors $x'=(x_2, \\dots, x_6)^T$ that satisfy $\\sum_{i=1}^5 x'_i = 0$.\nLet's analyze the structure of $B$ by computing $B^2$. Each row of $B$ has two $1$s and two $-1$s.\nThe diagonal entries of $B^2$ are $(B^2)_{ii} = \\sum_k B_{ik}^2 = 0^2+1^2+(-1)^2+1^2+(-1)^2 = 4$ for all $i$ (by permutation of columns).\nThe off-diagonal entries are, for example, $(B^2)_{12} = \\sum_k B_{1k}B_{2k} = (0)(1) + (1)(0) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) = 0+0+1-1-1 = -1$.\nA similar calculation shows all off-diagonal entries of $B^2$ are $-1$. Thus, $B^2 = 4I + (-1)(J-I) = 5I-J$, where $I$ is the $5 \\times 5$ identity matrix and $J$ is the $5 \\times 5$ all-ones matrix.\n\nThe matrix $J$ has eigenvalues $5$ (with eigenvector $(1,1,1,1,1)^T$) and $0$ (with multiplicity $4$, for the subspace of vectors whose components sum to $0$).\nThe eigenvalues of $B^2=5I-J$ are therefore $5-5=0$ (multiplicity $1$) and $5-0=5$ (multiplicity $4$).\nThe eigenvalues of $B$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $B^2$. Hence, the eigenvalues of $B$ are $\\sqrt{0}=0$ (multiplicity $1$), and $\\pm\\sqrt{5}$ (total multiplicity $4$).\nThe eigenvector for $\\mu=0$ is the same as for the eigenvalue $5$ of $J$, which is $u=(1,1,1,1,1)^T$. For this vector, $\\sum u_i = 5 \\neq 0$, so it is not in the subspace of interest for our eigenvectors of $A$.\nThe other four eigenvectors of $B$ are orthogonal to $u$, so they satisfy the condition $\\sum x'_i = 0$. The corresponding eigenvalues of $B^2$ are all $5$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $B$ for this subspace must be $\\pm \\sqrt{5}$. Let $m_+$ be the multiplicity of $\\sqrt{5}$ and $m_-$ be the multiplicity of $-\\sqrt{5}$. We have $m_+ + m_- = 4$.\nThe trace of $B$ is $\\text{Tr}(B) = \\sum \\mu_i = 0$. The sum of all five eigenvalues of $B$ is $0 + m_+\\sqrt{5} - m_-\\sqrt{5} = 0$. This implies $(m_+ - m_-)\\sqrt{5}=0$, so $m_+=m_-$.\nSince $m_+ + m_- = 4$, we must have $m_+=2$ and $m_-=2$.\nSo, the four eigenvalues of $A$ from the invariant subspace $S$ are $\\sqrt{5}$ (multiplicity $2$) and $-\\sqrt{5}$ (multiplicity $2$).\n\nCombining all results, the complete set of eigenvalues for $A$ is:\n- $\\sqrt{5}$ (from $v_1$) + $\\sqrt{5}$ (multiplicity $2$ from $S$) $\\implies$ Eigenvalue $\\sqrt{5}$ has multiplicity $3$.\n- $-\\sqrt{5}$ (from $v_2$) + $-\\sqrt{5}$ (multiplicity $2$ from $S$) $\\implies$ Eigenvalue $-\\sqrt{5}$ has multiplicity $3$.\n\n2. Determination of the Gershgorin intervals.\n\nThe Gershgorin Circle Theorem states that every eigenvalue of $A$ lies in the union of the disks $G_i = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |z - A_{ii}| \\le R_i\\}$, where $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}|$.\nSince $A$ is real symmetric, its eigenvalues are real, and the disks are intervals on the real line.\nThe diagonal entries are $A_{ii} = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\nThe radii $R_i$ are the sums of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements in each row. All off-diagonal elements are either $1$ or $-1$, so their absolute value is $1$. Each row has $5$ off-diagonal elements.\n$$R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}| = 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, 6.$$\nThus, all six Gershgorin intervals are identical:\n$$ G_i = [A_{ii} - R_i, A_{ii} + R_i] = [0 - 5, 0 + 5] = [-5, 5] $$\nThe union of these intervals is $\\bigcup_{i=1}^6 G_i = [-5, 5]$.\nThe total width of this union is $5 - (-5) = 10$.\n\n3. Computation of the overestimation factor $\\kappa$.\n\nThe overestimation factor $\\kappa$ is the ratio of the Gershgorin union width to the actual eigenvalue spread.\nGershgorin union width $= 10$.\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\sqrt{5}$ and $-\\sqrt{5}$.\nSo, $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\sqrt{5}$ and $\\lambda_{\\min} = -\\sqrt{5}$.\nActual eigenvalue spread $= \\lambda_{\\max} - \\lambda_{\\min} = \\sqrt{5} - (-\\sqrt{5}) = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe overestimation factor is:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{10}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5} $$\n\n4. Structural reason for the overestimation.\n\nThe Gershgorin Circle Theorem provides a bound on an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ derived from the eigenvalue equation $(\\lambda I - A)v = 0$. For any row $i$, we have $(\\lambda - A_{ii})v_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} A_{ij}v_j$. Taking absolute values gives $|\\lambda - A_{ii}||v_i| = |\\sum_{j \\neq i} A_{ij}v_j| \\le \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}||v_j|$. For the row $i$ where $|v_i|$ is maximal, we can divide by $|v_i|$ to get $|\\lambda - A_{ii}| \\le \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}| \\frac{|v_j|}{|v_i|} \\le \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}| = R_i$.\n\nThe overestimation by the Gershgorin bound arises because the inequality $|\\sum z_j| \\le \\sum |z_j|$ is used. The bound $R_i$ is achieved only in the \"worst-case\" scenario where all complex numbers $A_{ij}v_j$ (for $j \\neq i$) have the same phase, preventing any cancellation in the sum.\n\nIn the given matrix $A$, the off-diagonal entries in rows $2$ through $6$ are a mix of $+1$ and $-1$. For instance, row $2$ has off-diagonal entries $(1, 1, -1, 1, -1)$ for columns $j \\neq 2$. For the GCT bound of $R_2=5$ to be close to the true eigenvalue modulus, the vector $(A_{2j}v_j)_{j \\neq 2}$ would need to have components that do not cancel. However, the specific sign pattern in the matrix $A$ is highly structured and forces significant cancellation for any possible eigenvector. No eigenvector can align with this mixed-sign pattern to prevent cancellation across all rows simultaneously.\n\nThis structure is not arbitrary; it is algebraically encoded. As shown in part 1, the lower-right $5 \\times 5$ submatrix $B$ satisfies the property $B^2 = 5I - J$. This stringent algebraic constraint is a direct consequence of the specific arrangement of $+1$s and $-1$s, which can be related to the properties of a conference matrix. This constraint forces the eigenvalues of $B$ on the relevant subspace to have a modulus of exactly $\\sqrt{5}$. The GCT, by only summing the absolute values of entries, is completely blind to this rich algebraic structure and the cancellations it implies. It treats the matrix $B$ as if it were a matrix with the same entry magnitudes but no special sign pattern, leading to a much larger predicted eigenvalue spread ($[-4, 4]$ for $B$, and $[-5, 5]$ for $A$) than what the underlying structure permits ($|\\lambda| = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$). The discrepancy is therefore due to the high degree of structured cancellation enforced by the off-diagonal sign pattern, a feature to which the $L_1$-norm-based GCT is insensitive.",

            "solution": "We begin with the definition of the Gershgorin disks. For a given matrix $A(\\varepsilon)$, the $i$-th row disk is defined by\n$$\nD_{i}(\\varepsilon) = \\left\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - a_{ii}(\\varepsilon)| \\le R_{i}(\\varepsilon) \\right\\}, \\quad R_{i}(\\varepsilon) \\equiv \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}(\\varepsilon)|.\n$$\nIn our construction, $A(\\varepsilon) = \\operatorname{diag}(0,1,10,11,12) + \\varepsilon\\,(J - I)$ has diagonal entries $a_{11}=0$, $a_{22}=1$, $a_{33}=10$, $a_{44}=11$, $a_{55}=12$, and every off-diagonal entry equals $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, for each row $i$, the sum of absolute values of the off-diagonal entries equals\n$$\nR_{i}(\\varepsilon) = \\sum_{j \\ne i} |\\varepsilon| = 4 \\varepsilon,\n$$\nand the centers of the disks are the real numbers $0$, $1$, $10$, $11$, $12$. Hence the five Gershgorin disks are\n$$\nD_{1}(\\varepsilon) = \\{ z : |z - 0| \\le 4\\varepsilon \\}, \\quad\nD_{2}(\\varepsilon) = \\{ z : |z - 1| \\le 4\\varepsilon \\},\n$$\n$$\nD_{3}(\\varepsilon) = \\{ z : |z - 10| \\le 4\\varepsilon \\}, \\quad\nD_{4}(\\varepsilon) = \\{ z : |z - 11| \\le 4\\varepsilon \\}, \\quad\nD_{5}(\\varepsilon) = \\{ z : |z - 12| \\le 4\\varepsilon \\}.\n$$\n\nWe analyze connectivity of the union using these explicitly known centers and equal radii.\n\nFirst, we determine when the disks within each cluster $\\{0, 1\\}$ and $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$ are internally connected. Two closed disks in $\\mathbb{C}$ with centers on the real axis and equal radius $4\\varepsilon$ overlap if and only if the distance between their centers is at most $8\\varepsilon$. The distance between $0$ and $1$ is $1$, hence $D_{1}(\\varepsilon)$ and $D_{2}(\\varepsilon)$ overlap if and only if\n$$\n1 \\le 8\\varepsilon \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\varepsilon \\ge \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nLikewise, within the right cluster, the distances between consecutive centers $10$ and $11$, and $11$ and $12$, are each $1$, so $D_{3}(\\varepsilon)$ and $D_{4}(\\varepsilon)$ overlap if and only if $\\varepsilon \\ge \\frac{1}{8}$, and $D_{4}(\\varepsilon)$ and $D_{5}(\\varepsilon)$ overlap if and only if $\\varepsilon \\ge \\frac{1}{8}$. Consequently, for $\\varepsilon \\ge \\frac{1}{8}$, the three right-cluster disks form a single connected component via chain overlap, and the two left-cluster disks form a single connected component.\n\nSecond, we determine when the left-cluster and right-cluster unions remain disjoint. The rightmost extent of the left cluster is at most $1 + 4\\varepsilon$ (the rightmost boundary of $D_{2}(\\varepsilon)$), while the leftmost extent of the right cluster is at least $10 - 4\\varepsilon$ (the leftmost boundary of $D_{3}(\\varepsilon)$). These two unions are disjoint precisely when\n$$\n1 + 4\\varepsilon < 10 - 4\\varepsilon \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 8\\varepsilon < 9 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\varepsilon < \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$\nTherefore, the union $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} D_{i}(\\varepsilon)$ consists of exactly two connected components if and only if\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} \\le \\varepsilon < \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$\nIn that regime, the two components are explicitly:\n- The left component $C_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\varepsilon) = D_{1}(\\varepsilon) \\cup D_{2}(\\varepsilon)$, centered around the real interval from $-4\\varepsilon$ up to $1 + 4\\varepsilon$.\n- The right component $C_{\\mathrm{R}}(\\varepsilon) = D_{3}(\\varepsilon) \\cup D_{4}(\\varepsilon) \\cup D_{5}(\\varepsilon)$, centered around the real interval from $10 - 4\\varepsilon$ up to $12 + 4\\varepsilon$.\n\nWe now count eigenvalues in each connected component of the union. A refined form of the Gershgorin circle theorem (often attributed to Alexander Markowich Ostrowski) states that if the union of Gershgorin disks has $k$ connected components, then each connected component contains as many eigenvalues as there are disks whose centers lie in that component, counting algebraic multiplicities. In our setting, for every $\\varepsilon$ with $\\frac{1}{8} \\le \\varepsilon < \\frac{9}{8}$, the left component $C_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\varepsilon)$ contains exactly $2$ disks, hence exactly $2$ eigenvalues of $A(\\varepsilon)$; the right component $C_{\\mathrm{R}}(\\varepsilon)$ contains exactly $3$ disks, hence exactly $3$ eigenvalues of $A(\\varepsilon)$. While the precise eigenvalues move continuously with $\\varepsilon$ (by standard results on continuity of eigenvalues with respect to matrix entries), the count within each disjoint component is invariant as long as the components remain disjoint.\n\nWe next discuss perturbation-induced transfers as $\\varepsilon$ varies. As $\\varepsilon$ increases within $\\left[\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{9}{8}\\right)$, the two connected components remain disjoint, and therefore the count of eigenvalues in each component is topologically protected by the connected-component version of Gershgorin: no eigenvalue can leave its component without crossing out of the union of disks in that component, which is prevented by the disjointness and the inclusion property of Gershgorin regions. At the critical value where the two components first touch, the barrier between components disappears. The first coalescence occurs at the smallest $\\varepsilon$ for which the rightmost point of $C_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\varepsilon)$ meets the leftmost point of $C_{\\mathrm{R}}(\\varepsilon)$:\n$$\n1 + 4\\varepsilon = 10 - 4\\varepsilon \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\varepsilon = \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$\nAt $\\varepsilon = \\frac{9}{8}$, the two components touch at the real point $z = \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$. For any $\\varepsilon > \\frac{9}{8}$, the two components merge into a single connected set, and the Gershgorin connected-component count constraint no longer applies. Consequently, as $\\varepsilon$ passes through $\\varepsilon_{\\star} = \\frac{9}{8}$, eigenvalues may transfer between the previously separate regions; before this merging, such transfers are prohibited by the disjointness of the Gershgorin components together with the localization guarantee.\n\nFinally, we report the exact critical threshold at which the two connected components of $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} D_{i}(\\varepsilon)$ first coalesce. Solving $1 + 4\\varepsilon = 10 - 4\\varepsilon$ gives\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\star} = \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$",
