The smaller distance corresponds to the expression where $d$ and $\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$ are subtracted. This depends on the sign of $d$.\n-   If $d > 0$, then $|d - \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}| = \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}-d$ is smaller than $|d + \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}| = d+\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. The closer eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2$.\n-   If $d < 0$, then $|d + \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}| = \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}-|d|$ is smaller than $|d - \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}| = |d|+\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. The closer eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1$.\n-   If $d = 0$, both eigenvalues are equidistant from $c$. By convention (e.g., as in the original work by Wilkinson), one may choose a specific branch.\n\nWe can unify this choice using the sign function, $\\operatorname{sgn}(d)$, where we define $\\operatorname{sgn}(0)=1$. The term with the smaller magnitude is always $d - \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. Thus, the Wilkinson shift, $\\mu$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mu = c + \\left(d - \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, consider the case where $|d| \\gg |b|$ and $d>0$. The Wilkinson shift is $\\mu = c+d-\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$.\nIn this regime, $\\sqrt{d^2+b^2} = d\\sqrt{1+(b/d)^2}$. Using a binomial approximation, since $(b/d)^2$ is very small:\n$$\n\\sqrt{d^2+b^2} \\approx d\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{b}{d}\\right)^2\\right) = d + \\frac{b^2}{2d}\n$$\nThe value of $\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$ is very close to $d$. When the expression $\\mu = c + (d - \\sqrt{d^2+b^2})$ is evaluated in finite-precision arithmetic, the subtraction $d - \\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$ involves two nearly equal numbers. This leads to a massive loss of significant figures in the result, an effect known as catastrophic cancellation. The computed result for the shift will have very low relative accuracy.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of a Numerically Stable Expression\n\nTo avoid the catastrophic cancellation in $d - \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$, we can use an algebraic manipulation based on \"rationalizing the numerator\".\nLet the term causing instability be $T = d - \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. We multiply and divide by its conjugate, $d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$.\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\left(d - \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}\\right) \\left(d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}\\right)}{d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{d^2 - (\\operatorname{sgn}(d))^2(d^2+b^2)}{d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}}\n$$\nSince $(\\operatorname{sgn}(d))^2=1$ for $d \\neq 0$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{d^2 - (d^2+b^2)}{d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}} = \\frac{-b^2}{d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}}\n$$\nThe denominator, $d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$, involves the addition of two terms with the same sign ($d$ and $\\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{...}$), thus avoiding cancellation.\nSubstituting this stable expression for $T$ back into the formula for the shift $\\mu = c+T$, we get the numerically stable form:\n$$\n\\mu = c - \\frac{b^2}{d + \\operatorname{sgn}(d)\\sqrt{d^2+b^2}}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the matrix:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 10^{8} & 10^{-4} \\\\ 10^{-4} & 10^{-8} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe parameters are $a = 10^8$, $b = 10^{-4}$, and $c = 10^{-8}$.\nFirst, we compute $d$.\n$$\nd = \\frac{a-c}{2} = \\frac{10^8 - 10^{-8}}{2} = 5 \\times 10^7 - 5 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nSince $d > 0$, $\\operatorname{sgn}(d) = 1$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two things: first, to derive the deflation test for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix in the context of the QR algorithm, based on backward stability principles; second, to compute a specific value $\\delta$ based on this test for the given data.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the deflation test. The QR algorithm for finding eigenvalues iteratively applies orthogonal similarity transformations to a matrix $T$ to produce a sequence of matrices $T^{(k)}$ that converges to a diagonal (or block-diagonal) form. For a symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, each step produces a new symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T^{(k+1)} = (Q^{(k)})^T T^{(k)} Q^{(k)}$.\n\nThe core principle for justifying deflation is backward stability. An algorithm is considered backward stable if the solution it computes in finite-precision arithmetic is the exact solution to a slightly perturbed version of the original problem. For the symmetric eigenvalue problem, this means the computed eigenvalues of a matrix $T$ are the exact eigenvalues of some matrix $T+E$, where the perturbation $E$ is \"small.\"\n\nA single implicit QR step involves a sequence of Givens rotations. Due to floating-point roundoff errors, the computed matrix, let's call it $\\hat{T}^{(1)}$, is not exactly orthogonally similar to the starting matrix $T$. However, backward error analysis, pioneered by J.H. Wilkinson, shows that $\\hat{T}^{(1)}$ is exactly orthogonally similar to a perturbed matrix $T+E$. That is, $\\hat{T}^{(1)} = \\hat{Q}^T (T+E) \\hat{Q}$ for some exact orthogonal matrix $\\hat{Q}$. The norm of the backward error matrix $E$ is small, typically bounded by $\\|E\\|_2 \\approx c \\cdot n \\cdot \\epsilon \\cdot \\|T\\|_2$, where $n$ is the matrix dimension, $\\epsilon$ is the machine epsilon, and $c$ is a small constant.\n\nDeflation is the process of setting a subdiagonal entry $b_{k-1}$ to zero when its magnitude is considered negligible. This action splits the matrix into two smaller, independent tridiagonal subproblems, simplifying the overall computation. Let us consider the computed matrix after one step, which we denote as $T^{(1)}$ for simplicity, with diagonal entries $a_i^{(1)}$ and subdiagonal entries $b_i^{(1)}$. Setting the entry $b_{k-1}^{(1)}$ to zero is a deliberate perturbation of the matrix $T^{(1)}$. If we call the resulting matrix $T'$, then $T' = T^{(1)} + F$, where $F$ is a perturbation matrix with only two non-zero entries: $F_{k-1, k} = F_{k, k-1} = -b_{k-1}^{(1)}$.\n\nThis deliberate perturbation $F$ is justified if it can be conceptually absorbed into the inherent backward error $E$ of the QR step. In other words, the error we introduce by setting $b_{k-1}^{(1)}$ to zero should be no larger than the errors we have already committed due to floating-point arithmetic. The magnitude of this perturbation is measured by its norm, $\\|F\\|_2 = |b_{k-1}^{(1)}|$.\n\nThe condition for deflation is therefore $|b_{k-1}^{(1)}| \\le \\text{tol}$, where $\\text{tol}$ is a tolerance representing the scale of acceptable error. While a global tolerance like $\\epsilon \\|T^{(1)}\\|_2$ could be used, a more practical, local, and widely adopted criterion is used in high-quality numerical libraries like LAPACK. This criterion compares $|b_{k-1}^{(1)}|$ to the uncertainty in the adjacent diagonal entries, $a_{k-1}^{(1)}$ and $a_k^{(1)}$. The uncertainty in storing a number like $a_k^{(1)}$ in floating-point arithmetic is on the order of $\\epsilon |a_k^{(1)}|$. Summing the uncertainties for the two adjacent diagonal entries gives a sensible local scale of numerical noise.\n\nThus, the standard deflation test is to declare $b_{k-1}^{(1)}$ negligible if its magnitude is on the order of, or smaller than, the machine precision times the sum of the magnitudes of the adjacent diagonal elements. This is formally stated as:\n$$\n|b_{k-1}^{(1)}| \\le \\epsilon \\left( |a_{k-1}^{(1)}| + |a_k^{(1)}| \\right)\n$$\nIf this inequality holds, setting $b_{k-1}^{(1)}$ to zero is a backward stable operation, as the introduced error is \"in the noise\" of the representation of the local $2 \\times 2$ block.\n\nNext, we compute the quantity $\\delta$ for the specific data provided in the problem. The problem is set at the trailing end of the matrix, so we are interested in the subdiagonal entry $b_4^{(1)}$ and the adjacent diagonal entries $a_4^{(1)}$ and $a_5^{(1)}$. The quantity to compute is:\n$$\n\\delta = |b_{4}^{(1)}| - \\epsilon\\big(|a_{4}^{(1)}|+|a_{5}^{(1)}|\\big)\n$$\nThe sign of $\\delta$ directly indicates whether the deflation criterion is met (criterion is met if $\\delta \\le 0$).\n\nThe given values are:\n- $|b_{4}^{(1)}| = 4.2 \\times 10^{-16}$\n- $|a_{4}^{(1)}| = 2.103$\n- $|a_{5}^{(1)}| = 2.050$\n- $\\epsilon = 2^{-52}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the magnitudes of the diagonal entries:\n$$\n|a_{4}^{(1)}|+|a_{5}^{(1)}| = 2.103 + 2.050 = 4.153\n$$\nNext, we calculate the deflation tolerance term, $\\epsilon(|a_{4}^{(1)}|+|a_{5}^{(1)}|)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon(|a_{4}^{(1)}|+|a_{5}^{(1)}|) = 2^{-52} \\times 4.153\n$$\nThe value of machine epsilon for IEEE 754 double precision is $\\epsilon = 2^{-52} \\approx 2.220446049250313 \\times 10^{-16}$.\n$$\n\\text{tol} = (2.220446049250313 \\times 10^{-16}) \\times 4.153 \\approx 9.22151325333190 \\times 10^{-16}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\delta$ by substituting the values:\n$$\n\\delta = 4.2 \\times 10^{-16} - 9.22151325333190 \\times 10^{-16}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = (4.2 - 9.22151325333190) \\times 10^{-16}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = -5.02151325333190 \\times 10^{-16}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta \\approx -5.022 \\times 10^{-16}\n$$\nThe negative value of $\\delta$ confirms that the deflation criterion $|b_{4}^{(1)}| \\le \\epsilon(|a_{4}^{(1)}|+|a_{5}^{(1)}|)$ is satisfied, so the subdiagonal element $b_{4}^{(1)}$ would be set to zero.",
