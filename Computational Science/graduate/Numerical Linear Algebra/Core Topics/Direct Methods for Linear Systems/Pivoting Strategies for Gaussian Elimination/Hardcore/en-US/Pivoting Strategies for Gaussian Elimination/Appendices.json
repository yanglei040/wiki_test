Begin from the core definitions: GE seeks to transform $A$ into an upper-triangular matrix by a sequence of elementary row operations equivalent to left-multiplication by unit lower-triangular elimination matrices, and PP augments GE by selecting at each step a pivot of maximal magnitude from the current column among rows at or below the pivot row, implemented via permutation matrices so that $PA=LU$ with $P$ a permutation matrix, $L$ unit lower-triangular, and $U$ upper-triangular.\n\nTasks:\n- Attempt the first elimination step without pivoting: determine whether the step is possible, and report the resulting $P$, the multipliers that would populate the first column of $L$, and the updated matrix $U$ after this step.\n- Perform the first elimination step with partial pivoting: explicitly determine the permutation $P$ applied at the first step, the multipliers inserted into the first column of $L$, and the updated $U$ after this step.\n- Let $m$ denote the vector formed by the multipliers used in the partial pivoting step to annihilate the subdiagonal entries in the first column.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to analyze the first step of Gaussian elimination (GE) applied to a given matrix $A$, both with and without partial pivoting (PP). We must then compute the Euclidean norm of the vector of multipliers used in the partial pivoting step.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n$$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nLet's address each task sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: First elimination step without pivoting**\n\nGaussian elimination without pivoting proceeds by using the diagonal elements as pivots to create zeros in the column below. The first pivot element is the entry in the first row and first column, $a_{11}$.\nFor the given matrix $A$, the initial pivot element is $a_{11} = 0$.\n\nThe first step of GE involves computing multipliers $m_{i1} = \\frac{a_{i1}}{a_{11}}$ for $i > 1$, and then performing the row operations $R_i \\leftarrow R_i - m_{i1} R_1$ to eliminate the subdiagonal entries in the first column.\n\nIn this case, the calculation of the multipliers requires division by the pivot $a_{11} = 0$. Since division by zero is an undefined operation, the first step of Gaussian elimination without pivoting cannot be performed. The algorithm fails at the outset.\n\n-   **Possibility:** The step is not possible.\n-   **Permutation Matrix $P$:** In the absence of any pivoting, the permutation matrix is the identity matrix, $P = I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n-   **Multipliers:** The multipliers cannot be computed due to the division by the zero pivot.\n-   **Updated Matrix $U$:** Since the elimination step cannot be performed, the matrix $A$ cannot be updated.\n\n**Task 2: First elimination step with partial pivoting**\n\nPartial pivoting at step $k$ requires selecting the entry with the largest absolute value in the current pivot column (column $k$), from the pivot row $k$ downwards. This entry is then moved to the pivot position $(k, k)$ by a row interchange.\n\nFor the first step ($k=1$), we examine the first column of $A$:\n$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe entries are $a_{11} = 0$, $a_{21} = 3$, and $a_{31} = 2$. We find the maximum absolute value: $\\max(|0|, |3|, |2|) = 3$. This maximum value occurs in the second row (i.e., at position $(2, 1)$).\n\nTherefore, we must swap row $1$ and row $2$ to bring the largest element to the pivot position.\n\n-   **Permutation Matrix $P$:** The permutation that swaps row $1$ and row $2$ is given by the matrix $P_1$:\n    $$P_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    This is the permutation $P$ applied at the first step.\n\n-   **Apply Permutation:** We apply this permutation to the matrix $A$ to obtain the new matrix, let's call it $A'$:\n    $$A' = P_1 A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    The new pivot element is $a'_{11} = 3$.\n\n-   **Multipliers:** We now compute the multipliers to eliminate the subdiagonal entries in the first column of $A'$. The pivot is $a'_{11} = 3$.\n    -   The entry to eliminate in row $2$ is $a'_{21} = 0$. The multiplier is $m_{21} = \\frac{a'_{21}}{a'_{11}} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0$.\n    -   The entry to eliminate in row $3$ is $a'_{31} = 2$.

The row is unchanged.\n    -   For row $3$: $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - m_{31} R_1 = R_3 - \\frac{2}{3} R_1$.\n        $$ \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\frac{2}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 - \\frac{2}{3}(3) & 0 - \\frac{2}{3}(1) & 1 - \\frac{2}{3}(4) \\end{bmatrix} $$\n        $$ = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 - 2 & -\\frac{2}{3} & 1 - \\frac{8}{3} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{5}{3} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    The matrix after this first elimination step is:\n    $$ U_{\\text{updated}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{5}{3} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n**Task 3: Compute the Euclidean norm of the multiplier vector**\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the vector formed by the multipliers used in the partial pivoting step to annihilate the subdiagonal entries in the first column. Based on our calculations above, these multipliers are $m_{21}=0$ and $m_{31}=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe vector of multipliers is:\n$$m = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{3} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe Euclidean norm, or $2$-norm, of a vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $\\|v\\|_2 = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$.\nFor our multiplier vector $m$, the norm is:\n$$ \\|m\\|_2 = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} $$\n$$ \\|m\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0 + \\frac{4}{9}} $$\n$$ \\|m\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{9}} $$\n$$ \\|m\\|_2 = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe final answer is required in exact form, which is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the first step of Gaussian elimination for a given $3 \\times 3$ matrix $A$ under two different pivoting strategies: ordinary partial pivoting (PP) and scaled partial pivoting (SPP).

Analysis with Ordinary Partial Pivoting (PP)**\n\nFor the first column ($k=1$), ordinary partial pivoting requires us to select the pivot as the entry with the largest absolute value in that column. The entries in the first column are $a_{11} = 10$, $a_{21} = 9$, and $a_{31} = 8$.\n\nWe compare their absolute values:\n$$\n\\max \\left( |a_{11}|, |a_{21}|, |a_{31}| \\right) = \\max \\left( |10|, |9|, |8| \\right) = 10.\n$$\nThe maximum value is $|a_{11}|=10$. Therefore, the pivot row is the first row, and the pivot element is $a_{11} = 10$. No row permutation is necessary.\n\nThe elimination multipliers $m_{i1}$ are calculated to create zeros in the first column below the pivot. They are given by $m_{i1} = a_{i1} / a_{11}$ for $i > 1$.\nFor row $2$:\n$$\nm_{21}^{(\\mathrm{PP})} = \\frac{a_{21}}{a_{11}} = \\frac{9}{10}.\n$$\nFor row $3$:\n$$\nm_{31}^{(\\mathrm{PP})} = \\frac{a_{31}}{a_{11}} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}.\n$$\nThe pivot chosen under ordinary partial pivoting is $10$.\n\n**2. Analysis with Scaled Partial Pivoting (SPP)**\n\nFor scaled partial pivoting, we first compute the scale factor $s_i$ for each row, which is the maximum absolute value of the entries in that row.\nFor row $1$: $s_1 = \\max \\left( |10|, |10^6|, |1| \\right) = 10^6$.\nFor row $2$: $s_2 = \\max \\left( |9|, |1|, |1| \\right) = 9$.\nFor row $3$: $s_3 = \\max \\left( |8|, |-1|, |1| \\right) = 8$.\n\nNext, for the first column ($k=1$), we select the pivot row by finding the row $i$ that maximizes the ratio $|a_{i1}|/s_i$.\nFor row $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{|a_{11}|}{s_1} = \\frac{10}{10^6} = 10^{-5}.\n$$\nFor row $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{|a_{21}|}{s_2} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1.\n$$\nFor row $3$:\n$$\n\\frac{|a_{31}|}{s_3} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1.\n$$\nWe seek the maximum of these ratios: $\\max \\left( 10^{-5}, 1, 1 \\right) = 1$. The maximum value is achieved by both row $2$ and row $3$. By convention, in case of a tie, we choose the row with the smallest index. Therefore, we select row $2$ as the pivot row.\n\nThe pivot element is $a_{21} = 9$. Scaled partial pivoting requires swapping row $1$ and row $2$. The permuted matrix, which we will call $A'$, becomes:\n$$\nA' = \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n10 & 10^{6} & 1 \\\\\n8 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe new pivot is $a'_{11} = 9$. The elimination multipliers for this permuted system are calculated as $m_{i1} = a'_{i1} / a'_{11}$ for $i > 1$.\nFor row $2$ of $A'$:\n$$\nm_{21}^{(\\mathrm{SPP})} = \\frac{a'_{21}}{a'_{11}} = \\frac{10}{9}.\n$$\nFor row $3$ of $A'$:\n$$\nm_{31}^{(\\mathrm{SPP})} = \\frac{a'_{31}}{a'_{11}} = \\frac{8}{9}.\n$$\nThe pivot chosen under scaled partial pivoting is $9$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Stability Indicator $\\rho$**\n\nThe stability indicator $\\rho$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\bigl(|\\text{pivot under SPP}|\\bigr)/\\bigl(s_{\\text{pivot row under SPP}}\\bigr)}{\\bigl(|\\text{pivot under PP}|\\bigr)/\\bigl(s_{\\text{pivot row under PP}}\\bigr)}.\n$$\nWe gather the necessary components from our previous analysis.\n\nFor the numerator (SPP):\n- The pivot was selected from row $2$ of the original matrix $A$. The pivot element is $a_{21} = 9$. So, $|\\text{pivot under SPP}| = 9$.\n- The scale factor for this pivot row (row $2$) is $s_2 = 9$. So, $s_{\\text{pivot row under SPP}} = 9$.\n- The numerator is $\\frac{9}{9} = 1$. This is the value of the ratio we computed for row $2$ in the SPP selection process.\n\nFor the denominator (PP):\n- The pivot was selected from row $1$ of the original matrix $A$. The pivot element is $a_{11} = 10$. So, $|\\text{pivot under PP}| = 10$.\n- The scale factor for this pivot row (row $1$) is $s_1 = 10^6$. So, $s_{\\text{pivot row under PP}} = 10^6$.\n- The denominator is $\\frac{10}{10^6} = 10^{-5}$. This is the value of the ratio for row $1$ calculated during the SPP analysis.\n\nNow, we compute $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{10^{-5}} = 10^5.\n$$\nThe large value of $\\rho$ indicates that scaled partial pivoting selected a pivot that is much larger relative to its row's scale factor compared to the pivot selected by ordinary partial pivoting. This suggests that SPP made a more stable choice for this particular matrix, avoiding the potential for large element growth that can be caused by a pivot that is small in a relative sense.",

Not a fill-in.\nSo, choosing row $4$ as the pivot results in $3$ fill-ins.\n\nSummary of fill-in counts for potential pivots:\n- Row $1$ ($|a_{11}|=0.35$): $1$ fill-in.\n- Row $2$ ($|a_{21}|=3$): $2$ fill-ins.\n- Row $4$ ($|a_{41}|=1.6$): $3$ fill-ins.\n\nNow we apply the selection rule for each $\\tau$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\tau = 0.1$**\nThe threshold for admissibility is $0.1 \\times 3 = 0.3$.\nThe admissible pivot rows are those $i$ where $|a_{i1}| \\ge 0.3$.\n- Row $1$: $|a_{11}|=0.35 \\ge 0.3$. Admissible.\n- Row $2$: $|a_{21}|=3 \\ge 0.3$. Admissible.\n- Row $4$: $|a_{41}|=1.6 \\ge 0.3$. Admissible.\nThe admissible candidates are rows $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\nWe compare their fill-in counts: row $1$ gives $1$ fill-in, row $2$ gives $2$, and row $4$ gives $3$.\nThe rule is to select the pivot that minimizes the fill-in count. Row $1$ gives the minimum fill-in of $1$.\nSo, for $\\tau=0.1$, the chosen pivot row is $1$ and the fill-in count is $1$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\tau = 0.5$**\nThe threshold for admissibility is $0.5 \\times 3 = 1.5$.\nThe admissible pivot rows are those $i$ where $|a_{i1}| \\ge 1.5$.\n- Row $1$: $|a_{11}|=0.35 < 1.5$. Not admissible.\n- Row $2$: $|a_{21}|=3 \\ge 1.5$. Admissible.\n- Row $4$: $|a_{41}|=1.6 \\ge 1.5$. Admissible.\nThe admissible candidates are rows $\\{2, 4\\}$.\nWe compare their fill-in counts: row $2$ gives $2$ fill-ins, row $4$ gives $3$.\nMinimizing fill-in, we select row $2$, which has a fill-in count of $2$.\nSo, for $\\tau=0.5$, the chosen pivot row is $2$ and the fill-in count is $2$.\n\n**Case 3: $\\tau = 1$**\nThe threshold for admissibility is $1 \\times 3 = 3$. This corresponds to standard partial pivoting.\nThe admissible pivot rows are those $i$ where $|a_{i1}| \\ge 3$.\n- Row $1$: $|a_{11}|=0.35 < 3$. Not admissible.\n- Row $2$: $|a_{21}|=3 \\ge 3$. Admissible.\n- Row $4$: $|a_{41}|=1.6 < 3$. Not admissible.\nThe only admissible candidate is row $2$.\nThe fill-in count for row $2$ is $2$. No comparison is needed.\nSo, for $\\tau=1$, the chosen pivot row is $2$ and the fill-in count is $2$.\n\nThe final results are:\n- For $\\tau=0.1$: pivot row is $1$, fill-in count is $1$.\n- For $\\tau=0.5$: pivot row is $2$, fill-in count is $2$.\n- For $\\tau=1$: pivot row is $2$, fill-in count is $2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a row matrix of six numbers in the specified order.\nThe sequence is $(\\text{pivot for } \\tau=0.1, \\text{fill-in for } \\tau=0.1, \\text{pivot for } \\tau=0.5, \\text{fill-in for } \\tau=0.5, \\text{pivot for } \\tau=1, \\text{fill-in for } \\tau=1)$.\nThis corresponds to $(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$.",
