It provides a self-contained, consistent set of definitions and constraints to derive the requested quantities. The physical model, based on harmonic analysis and a linearized impedance representation, is a standard and appropriate simplification used in the study of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and the numerical stability of partitioned coupling algorithms. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to a time delay in a simplified FSI coupling model: the phase error in the fluid traction and the ratio of cycle-averaged power transfer. We will use complex-valued analysis for harmonic signals.\n\nGiven the structural displacement $d(t) = \\Re\\{D\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$, where we use scalar notation as per the problem's allowance for collinear motion. The corresponding complex displacement is $\\tilde{d}(t) = D\\exp(i\\omega t)$. The structural velocity is the time derivative, $\\dot{d}(t)$. Its complex representation is $\\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\tilde{d}(t) = i\\omega D\\exp(i\\omega t)$. Let us define the complex velocity amplitude as $V_s = i\\omega D$, so that $\\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t) = V_s\\exp(i\\omega t)$.\n\nThe fluid traction, $\\sigma_f(t)$, is related to the fluid velocity at the interface, $u_f(t)$, by the complex impedance $Z_f = R + iX$. The complex relationship is $\\tilde{\\sigma}_f(t) = Z_f \\tilde{u}_f(t)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the ideal case where there is no time delay ($\\delta t = 0$). The kinematic continuity condition is $\\tilde{u}_f(t) = \\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t)$.\nThe fluid traction in the ideal case, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{ideal}}(t)$, is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{ideal}}(t) = Z_f \\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t) = (R+iX) V_s \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the delayed case where the fluid velocity is evaluated at a past time, $\\tilde{u}_f(t) = \\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t-\\delta t)$.\nSubstituting $t-\\delta t$ into the expression for $\\tilde{\\dot{d}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{u}_{f, \\text{delayed}}(t) = V_s \\exp(i\\omega(t-\\delta t)) = V_s \\exp(i\\omega t)\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)\n$$\nThe fluid traction in the delayed case, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{delayed}}(t)$, is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{delayed}}(t) = Z_f \\tilde{u}_{f, \\text{delayed}}(t) = (R+iX) V_s \\exp(i\\omega t)\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)\n$$\nBy comparing the expressions for the ideal and delayed traction, we find:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{delayed}}(t) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_{f, \\text{ideal}}(t) \\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)\n$$\n\n**1) Phase Error Derivation**\nThe phase error is the phase difference between the delayed traction and the ideal traction. The relationship above shows that the delayed traction is the ideal traction multiplied by the complex phasor $\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)$. The phase (or argument) of this complex number is the phase shift introduced.\n$$\n\\text{Phase Error} = \\arg(\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)) = -\\omega\\delta t\n$$\nThe phase error is $-\\omega\\delta t$ radians.\n\n**2) Power Ratio Derivation**\nThe cycle-averaged power $P$ transferred from the fluid to the structure is given by the time average of the product of the fluid traction $\\sigma_f(t)$ and the structural velocity $\\dot{d}(t)$: $P = \\langle \\sigma_f(t) \\dot{d}(t) \\rangle$. For two harmonic signals $a(t) = \\Re\\{\\tilde{A}\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$ and $b(t) = \\Re\\{\\tilde{B}\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$, this average is calculated as $P = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\tilde{A}\\tilde{B}^*\\}$, where $\\tilde{B}^*$ is the complex conjugate of $\\tilde{B}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the power in the ideal case, $P_{\\text{ideal}}$. Here, the complex amplitude of the traction is $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{\\text{ideal}} = (R+iX)V_s$ and the complex amplitude of the structural velocity is $V_s$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{\\text{ideal}} V_s^*\\} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{(R+iX)V_s V_s^*\\}\n$$\nSince $V_sV_s^* = |V_s|^2$, which is real and non-negative, and given $R0$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{(R+iX)|V_s|^2\\} = \\frac{1}{2}R|V_s|^2\n$$\nNext, we calculate the power in the delayed case, $P_{\\text{delayed}}$. The power is the work done by the delayed fluid traction on the structure moving with its actual velocity. The complex amplitude of the delayed traction is $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{\\text{delayed}} = (R+iX)V_s\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)$, and the complex amplitude of the structural velocity is still $V_s$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{delayed}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{\\text{delayed}} V_s^*\\} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{(R+iX)V_s\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t) V_s^*\\} = \\frac{1}{2}|V_s|^2 \\Re\\{(R+iX)\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t)\\}\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\exp(-i\\omega\\delta t) = \\cos(\\omega\\delta t) - i\\sin(\\omega\\delta t)$, we find the real part of the product:\n$$\n\\Re\\{(R+iX)(\\cos(\\omega\\delta t) - i\\sin(\\omega\\delta t))\\} = R\\cos(\\omega\\delta t) + X\\sin(\\omega\\delta t)\n$$\nTherefore, the power in the delayed case is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{delayed}} = \\frac{1}{2}|V_s|^2(R\\cos(\\omega\\delta t) + X\\sin(\\omega\\delta t))\n$$\nThe exact ratio $\\mathcal{R}_P$ is the ratio of $P_{\\text{delayed}}$ to $P_{\\text{ideal}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_P = \\frac{P_{\\text{delayed}}}{P_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}|V_s|^2(R\\cos(\\omega\\delta t) + X\\sin(\\omega\\delta t))}{\\frac{1}{2}R|V_s|^2} = \\frac{R\\cos(\\omega\\delta t) + X\\sin(\\omega\\delta t)}{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_P(\\omega, \\delta t, R, X) = \\cos(\\omega\\delta t) + \\frac{X}{R}\\sin(\\omega\\delta t)\n$$\nFinally, we find the first-order approximation of $\\mathcal{R}_P$ for the small parameter $\\theta = \\omega\\delta t$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Dispersion Relation\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed linear evolution equation for the plate deflection $w(x,t)$ and subsequently find the dispersion relation $\\sigma(k)$. The derivation proceeds by linearizing the governing equations about the quiescent base state and combining them.\n\nThe base state is defined by $w(x,t) = 0$, which implies $h(x,t) = h_0$. Substituting $w=0$ into the plate equation, $D\\,\\partial_x^4 (0) = 0$, yields a base pressure of $p(x,t)=0$. This state is static, so $\\partial_t h = 0$, which satisfies the Reynolds equation for $p=0$.\n\nWe now consider small perturbations around this base state. Let the perturbation in pressure be $p(x,t)$ and the perturbation in deflection be $w(x,t)$. The film thickness is then given by the kinematic condition:\n$$\nh(x,t) = h_0 + w(x,t)\n$$\nIts time derivative is:\n$$\n\\partial_t h = \\partial_t w\n$$\nThe problem is to be linearized for infinitesimal perturbations $w$ and $p$. We begin with the Reynolds equation:\n$$\n\\partial_x\\!\\left(\\frac{h^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,\\partial_x p\\right) \\;=\\; \\partial_t h\n$$\nSubstituting $h = h_0 + w$ gives:\n$$\n\\partial_x\\!\\left(\\frac{(h_0+w)^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,\\partial_x p\\right) \\;=\\; \\partial_t w\n$$\nFor small $w$, we expand the term $(h_0+w)^3 = h_0^3 + 3h_0^2 w + O(w^2)$. Since $p$ is also a first-order perturbation term, the product $w (\\partial_x p)$ is a second-order term. In a linear analysis, we retain only first-order terms. Thus, the coefficient $(h_0+w)^3$ is approximated by its zeroth-order part, $h_0^3$. The linearized Reynolds equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{h_0^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,\\partial_x^2 p \\;=\\; \\partial_t w\n\\quad\\quad\\text{(1)}\n$$\nThis equation relates the curvature of the pressure field to the rate of change of the film thickness, representing the squeeze-film effect.\n\nThe plate deflection is related to the pressure field by the quasi-static Kirchhoff–Love plate equation, which is already linear:\n$$\nD\\,\\partial_x^4 w \\;=\\; p\n\\quad\\quad\\text{(2)}\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear partial differential equations for the two unknown fields $p(x,t)$ and $w(x,t)$. To obtain a single evolution equation for $w$, we substitute the expression for $p$ from equation ($2$) into equation ($1$):\n$$\n\\frac{h_0^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,\\partial_x^2 \\!\\left( D\\,\\partial_x^4 w \\right) \\;=\\; \\partial_t w\n$$\nSince $D$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the derivative. This yields the closed linear evolution equation for the plate deflection $w(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{D h_0^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,\\partial_x^6 w \\;=\\; \\partial_t w\n\\quad\\quad\\text{(3)}\n$$\nTo find the dispersion relation, we substitute the normal-mode ansatz $w(x,t) = \\Re\\{\\widehat{w} e^{\\sigma t + i k x}\\}$ into this equation. It is sufficient to use the complex form $w_c(x,t) = \\widehat{w} e^{\\sigma t + i k x}$ and assume a non-trivial amplitude $\\widehat{w} \\ne 0$. The required derivatives are:\n$$\n\\partial_t w_c = \\sigma w_c\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_x w_c = ik w_c \\implies \\partial_x^6 w_c = (ik)^6 w_c = i^6 k^6 w_c = (-1) k^6 w_c = -k^6 w_c\n$$\nSubstituting these into the evolution equation ($3$):\n$$\n\\frac{D h_0^3}{12\\,\\mu}\\,(-k^6 w_c) \\;=\\; \\sigma w_c\n$$\nDividing by $w_c$ (for a non-trivial solution), we arrive at the dispersion relation for the growth rate $\\sigma$ as a function of the wavenumber $k$ and system parameters:\n$$\n\\sigma(k) = -\\frac{D h_0^3 k^6}{12\\mu}\n$$\n\n### Task 2: Assessment of Self-Excited Oscillations\n\nSelf-excited oscillations correspond to solutions where the growth rate $\\sigma$ has a non-zero imaginary part, i.e., $\\Im(\\sigma) \\ne 0$, which would represent an oscillatory frequency. The complex growth rate is generally written as $\\sigma = \\sigma_r + i\\sigma_i$, where $\\sigma_r$ is the real growth rate and $\\sigma_i$ is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nFrom the derived dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\sigma(k) = -\\frac{D h_0^3 k^6}{12\\mu}\n$$\nWe analyze the nature of this expression based on the physical properties of the parameters:\n- The bending stiffness $D$ must be positive ($D  0$).\n- The base film thickness $h_0$ is given as a positive constant ($h_0  0$).\n- The dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is a physical property of the fluid and must be positive ($\\mu  0$).\n- The wavenumber $k$ is a real number, so its sixth power $k^6$ is real and non-negative ($k^6 \\ge 0$).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression for $\\sigma(k)$ is a product and ratio of real, non-negative quantities, multiplied by $-1$.\n$$\n\\sigma(k) = - \\frac{(\\text{positive}) \\cdot (\\text{positive}) \\cdot (\\text{non-negative})}{(\\text{positive})} \\le 0\n$$\nThe growth rate $\\sigma$ is always a real, non-positive number. The imaginary part of $\\sigma$ is identically zero for all valid parameters and for all wavenumbers $k$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\Im(\\sigma) = 0\n$$\n**Conclusion**: Since the imaginary part of the growth rate is always zero, self-excited oscillations are **not possible** in this model. The system is purely dissipative. Any perturbation will decay exponentially towards the flat base state, with a decay rate given by $\\sigma_r = \\sigma(k) \\le 0$. The mechanism is one of viscous damping: any structural deflection creates pressure, which drives a viscous flow that acts to level the deflection, dissipating energy. The absence of inertia (e.g., $\\rho \\partial_t^2 w$ for the plate or $\\rho D\\mathbf{u}/Dt$ for the fluid) or any other energy-injecting mechanism precludes oscillatory behavior. For $k=0$, $\\sigma=0$, meaning a uniform displacement is neutrally stable as it induces no bending and hence no pressure or flow. For any $k \\ne 0$, the system is stable as $\\sigma  0$.",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional fluid–structure interaction (FSI) interface separates a compressible fluid and a compliant structure. The normal direction is defined by the unit vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ pointing from the structure into the fluid. The structure has displacement $d(t)$ along $\\boldsymbol{n}$, velocity $\\dot{d}(t)$, areal mass $\\mu_{s}$, areal damping $c_{s}$, and areal stiffness $k_{s}$, modeled by Newton’s second law per unit area:\n$$\n\\mu_{s}\\,\\ddot{d}(t) + c_{s}\\,\\dot{d}(t) + k_{s}\\,d(t) = t_{\\text{int}}(t),\n$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{int}}(t)$ is the interfacial traction acting on the structure in the $+\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction. The fluid near the interface is represented by a lumped linear acoustic element with interface displacement $y(t)$, velocity $u(t)=\\dot{y}(t)$, inertance per unit area $m_{f}$, resistance per unit area $r_{f}$, and stiffness per unit area $k_{f}$, governed by\n$$\nm_{f}\\,\\ddot{y}(t) + r_{f}\\,\\dot{y}(t) + k_{f}\\,y(t) = -\\,t_{\\text{int}}(t).\n$$\nTo suppress numerically induced limit-cycle oscillations while preserving traction equilibrium, an interfacial feedback law is added to the fluid-side traction:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n} + \\alpha\\left(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f} - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{d}}\\right) = -\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n},\n$$\nwhich, in the scalar normal direction, corresponds to the interaction traction\n$$\nt_{\\text{int}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(u(t) - \\dot{d}(t)\\right),\n$$\nwith $\\alpha$ the feedback coefficient (units $\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s})$). Assume all parameters $\\mu_{s}$, $c_{s}$, $k_{s}$, $m_{f}$, $r_{f}$, $k_{f}$ are positive constants, and consider the homogeneous free-decay dynamics (no external forcing). Working from first principles (Newton’s second law and linear constitutive relations above), set up the coupled linear system in the Laplace domain with complex frequency $s$, derive the closed-loop characteristic equation, and determine the value of $\\alpha$ that ensures the linearized decay rate equals $-\\lambda$ with $\\lambda0$ (i.e., $s=-\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the coupled system). Express your final result for $\\alpha$ as a single closed-form algebraic expression in terms of $\\mu_{s}$, $c_{s}$, $k_{s}$, $m_{f}$, $r_{f}$, $k_{f}$, and $\\lambda$. Use International System of Units (SI) for all quantities; give $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s})$. No numerical substitution or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded system of linear ordinary differential equations modeling a simplified fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) interface and asks for a parameter value that places a system eigenvalue at a specified location. This is a standard problem in linear systems theory and control.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing equations for the one-dimensional system provided. The structure's dynamics are described by Newton's second law per unit area:\n$$\n\\mu_{s}\\,\\ddot{d}(t) + c_{s}\\,\\dot{d}(t) + k_{s}\\,d(t) = t_{\\text{int}}(t)\n\\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\nwhere $d(t)$ is the structural displacement, $\\mu_{s}$ is the areal mass, $c_{s}$ is the areal damping, $k_{s}$ is the areal stiffness, and $t_{\\text{int}}(t)$ is the interfacial traction from the fluid acting on the structure.\n\nThe fluid's dynamics are modeled by an analogous lumped-parameter equation:\n$$\nm_{f}\\,\\ddot{y}(t) + r_{f}\\,\\dot{y}(t) + k_{f}\\,y(t) = -\\,t_{\\text{int}}(t)\n\\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\nwhere $y(t)$ is the fluid displacement at the interface, $m_{f}$ is the fluid inertance, $r_{f}$ is the fluid resistance, $k_{f}$ is the fluid stiffness (all per unit area), and $-\\,t_{\\text{int}}(t)$ is the reaction force from the structure acting on the fluid.\n\nThe coupling between the fluid and the structure is defined by the interfacial feedback law, which relates the traction to the velocity difference at the interface:\n$$\nt_{\\text{int}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(u(t) - \\dot{d}(t)\\right)\n\\quad \\quad (3)\n$$\nwhere $u(t) = \\dot{y}(t)$ is the fluid velocity at the interface, and $\\alpha$ is the feedback coefficient.\n\nTo determine the characteristic equation of the coupled system, we transform the governing equations into the Laplace domain. Let $s$ be the complex frequency. We denote the Laplace transforms of the time-domain variables as $D(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{d(t)\\}$, $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$, $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$, and $T_{\\text{int}}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t_{\\text{int}}(t)\\}$. The problem concerns the homogeneous free-decay dynamics, which correspond to the system's natural modes. The characteristic equation is independent of initial conditions, so for simplicity we assume zero initial conditions. The Laplace transform of the derivatives are then $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{f}(t)\\} = sF(s)$ and $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\ddot{f}(t)\\} = s^{2}F(s)$.\n\nApplying the Laplace transform to equations $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$, we obtain the system in the frequency domain:\n$$\n(\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s})D(s) = T_{\\text{int}}(s)\n\\quad \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\n(m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f})Y(s) = -T_{\\text{int}}(s)\n\\quad \\quad (5)\n$$\nThe relationship $u(t) = \\dot{y}(t)$ becomes $U(s) = sY(s)$. Substituting this into the transform of equation $(3)$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{int}}(s) = \\alpha\\left(sY(s) - sD(s)\\right) = \\alpha s \\left(Y(s) - D(s)\\right)\n\\quad \\quad (6)\n$$\nWe now have a system of three algebraic equations for $D(s)$, $Y(s)$, and $T_{\\text{int}}(s)$. We can find the characteristic equation by finding a condition on $s$ for which a non-trivial solution (i.e., not all variables are zero) exists. We express $D(s)$ and $Y(s)$ in terms of $T_{\\text{int}}(s)$ from equations $(4)$ and $(5)$:\n$$\nD(s) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s}} T_{\\text{int}}(s)\n\\quad \\quad (7)\n$$\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{-1}{m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f}} T_{\\text{int}}(s)\n\\quad \\quad (8)\n$$\nSubstitute these expressions for $D(s)$ and $Y(s)$ into equation $(6)$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{int}}(s) = \\alpha s \\left( \\frac{-1}{m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f}} - \\frac{1}{\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s}} \\right) T_{\\text{int}}(s)\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, $T_{\\text{int}}(s) \\neq 0$. We can divide both sides by $T_{\\text{int}}(s)$ to obtain the characteristic equation:\n$$\n1 = \\alpha s \\left( \\frac{-1}{m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f}} - \\frac{1}{\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n1 = -\\alpha s \\left( \\frac{1}{m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s}} \\right)\n$$\nTo clear the denominators, we combine the fractions:\n$$\n1 = -\\alpha s \\frac{(\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s}) + (m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f})}{(\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s})(m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f})}\n$$\nRearranging gives the characteristic equation in polynomial form. The roots of this equation are the eigenvalues (poles) of the coupled system.\n$$\n(\\mu_{s}s^{2} + c_{s}s + k_{s})(m_{f}s^{2} + r_{f}s + k_{f}) + \\alpha s \\left[ (\\mu_{s} + m_{f})s^{2} + (c_{s} + r_{f})s + (k_{s} + k_{f}) \\right] = 0\n\\quad \\quad (9)\n$$\nThe problem requires that a real-valued decay mode with rate $\\lambda  0$ exists, which means that $s = -\\lambda$ must be an eigenvalue of the system, and therefore a root of the characteristic equation $(9)$. We substitute $s = -\\lambda$ into this equation:\n$$\n(\\mu_{s}(-\\lambda)^{2} + c_{s}(-\\lambda) + k_{s})(m_{f}(-\\lambda)^{2} + r_{f}(-\\lambda) + k_{f}) + \\alpha (-\\lambda) \\left[ (\\mu_{s} + m_{f})(-\\lambda)^{2} + (c_{s} + r_{f})(-\\lambda) + (k_{s} + k_{f}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\n(\\mu_{s}\\lambda^{2} - c_{s}\\lambda + k_{s})(m_{f}\\lambda^{2} - r_{f}\\lambda + k_{f}) - \\alpha \\lambda \\left[ (\\mu_{s} + m_{f})\\lambda^{2} - (c_{s} + r_{f})\\lambda + (k_{s} + k_{f}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$. Assuming that the term multiplying $\\alpha$ is non-zero, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\alpha \\lambda \\left[ (\\mu_{s} + m_{f})\\lambda^{2} - (c_{s} + r_{f})\\lambda + (k_{s} + k_{f}) \\right] = (\\mu_{s}\\lambda^{2} - c_{s}\\lambda + k_{s})(m_{f}\\lambda^{2} - r_{f}\\lambda + k_{f})\n$$\nIsolating $\\alpha$ yields the final expression:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{(\\mu_{s}\\lambda^{2} - c_{s}\\lambda + k_{s})(m_{f}\\lambda^{2} - r_{f}\\lambda + k_{f})}{\\lambda \\left[ (\\mu_{s} + m_{f})\\lambda^{2} - (c_{s} + r_{f})\\lambda + (k_{s} + k_{f}) \\right]}\n$$\nThe denominator can be recognized as the sum of the two polynomials in the numerator. Let $P_{s}(\\lambda) = \\mu_{s}\\lambda^{2} - c_{s}\\lambda + k_{s}$ and $P_{f}(\\lambda) = m_{f}\\lambda^{2} - r_{f}\\lambda + k_{f}$. Then the expression for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{P_{s}(\\lambda) P_{f}(\\lambda)}{\\lambda \\left[ P_{s}(\\lambda) + P_{f}(\\lambda) \\right]}\n$$\nThis expression gives the value of the feedback coefficient $\\alpha$ required to place one of the system's eigenvalues at $s = -\\lambda$. The units of each term in the polynomials $P_{s}(\\lambda)$ and $P_{f}(\\lambda)$ are $\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{2})$. The numerator thus has units $(\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{2}))^{2}$. The denominator has units $(\\mathrm{1/s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{2})) = \\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{3})$. The resulting units for $\\alpha$ are $(\\mathrm{kg}^{2}/(\\mathrm{m}^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{4})) / (\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{3})) = \\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s})$, which is consistent with the problem statement.",
