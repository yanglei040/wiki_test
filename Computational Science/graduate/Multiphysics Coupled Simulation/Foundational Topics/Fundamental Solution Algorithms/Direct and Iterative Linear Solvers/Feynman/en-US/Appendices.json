            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The context is a monolithic implicit time-integration of a two-field multiphysics model (thermal-mechanical).\n- The resulting linear system is symmetric positive definite (SPD).\n- The linear system is given by $A x = b$.\n- The system matrix is $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4  2 \\\\ 2  3 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- The right-hand side vector is $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- The task is to factor $A$ as $A = L L^{\\top}$, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries.\n- The solution method is specified as using forward and backward substitution with the Cholesky factors.\n- All intermediate and final quantities must be expressed exactly.\n- The final solution vector $x$ is to be reported as a row vector.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded.\n1.  **Scientific Soundness**: The problem describes a standard procedure in computational mechanics where the linearization of a variational problem based on a convex energy functional leads to a symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear system. We verify the SPD property of the given matrix $A$.\n    -   Symmetry: The matrix $A$ is symmetric since $A_{12} = A_{21} = 2$.\n    -   Positive Definiteness: We check the leading principal minors. The first minor is $\\det([4]) = 4  0$. The second minor is $\\det(A) = (4)(3) - (2)(2) = 12 - 4 = 8  0$. Since all leading principal minors are positive, the matrix $A$ is indeed positive definite.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: Since $A$ is SPD, it is non-singular ($\\det(A) \\neq 0$), which guarantees that a unique solution $x$ to the system $A x = b$ exists. The Cholesky factorization for a real SPD matrix is unique, ensuring a well-defined solution path.\n3.  **Completeness**: All necessary components ($A$ and $b$) are provided. The instructions are clear and unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem requires solving the linear system $A x = b$ using Cholesky factorization. The given matrix $A$ is symmetric and positive definite, which guarantees the existence of a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with strictly positive diagonal entries such that $A = L L^{\\top}$.\n\nThe system to solve is:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 4  2 \\\\ 2  3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the Cholesky factorization $A = L L^{\\top}$. Let the lower triangular matrix $L$ be\n$$\nL = \\begin{bmatrix} L_{11}  0 \\\\ L_{21}  L_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $L_{11}  0$ and $L_{22}  0$.\n\nThen $L L^{\\top}$ is:\n$$\nL L^{\\top} = \\begin{bmatrix} L_{11}  0 \\\\ L_{21}  L_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} L_{11}  L_{21} \\\\ 0  L_{22} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} L_{11}^2  L_{11}L_{21} \\\\ L_{21}L_{11}  L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nEquating the components of $L L^{\\top}$ with the components of $A$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} L_{11}^2  L_{11}L_{21} \\\\ L_{21}L_{11}  L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 4  2 \\\\ 2  3 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWe solve for the elements of $L$ sequentially:\n1.  From the $(1,1)$ element: $L_{11}^2 = 4$. Since $L_{11}$ must be positive, $L_{11} = 2$.\n2.  From the $(2,1)$ element: $L_{21}L_{11} = 2$. Substituting $L_{11}=2$, we get $2 L_{21} = 2$, which gives $L_{21} = 1$.\n3.  From the $(2,2)$ element: $L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2 = 3$. Substituting $L_{21}=1$, we get $1^2 + L_{22}^2 = 3$, so $L_{22}^2 = 2$. Since $L_{22}$ must be positive, $L_{22} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThus, the Cholesky factor $L$ is:\n$$\nL = \\begin{bmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 1  \\sqrt{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe original system $A x = b$ is now rewritten as $L L^{\\top} x = b$. This is solved in two steps:\n1.  Solve $L y = b$ for an intermediate vector $y$ (forward substitution).\n2.  Solve $L^{\\top} x = y$ for the final solution vector $x$ (backward substitution).\n\n**Step 1: Forward Substitution**\nWe solve the system $L y = b$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 1  \\sqrt{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the first row:\n$$\n2 y_1 = 6 \\implies y_1 = 3\n$$\nFrom the second row:\n$$\ny_1 + \\sqrt{2} y_2 = 5\n$$\nSubstituting $y_1=3$:\n$$\n3 + \\sqrt{2} y_2 = 5 \\implies \\sqrt{2} y_2 = 2 \\implies y_2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe intermediate vector is $y = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 2: Backward Substitution**\nWe solve the system $L^{\\top} x = y$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the second row (solving backwards from the last variable):\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} x_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\implies x_2 = 1\n$$\nFrom the first row:\n$$\n2 x_1 + x_2 = 3\n$$\nSubstituting $x_2=1$:\n$$\n2 x_1 + 1 = 3 \\implies 2 x_1 = 2 \\implies x_1 = 1\n$$\nThe solution vector is $x = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nAs requested, the final solution is reported as a row vector.",

These conditions ensure that the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is applicable and guaranteed to converge.\n\nFirst, we derive the PCG algorithm from the specified first principles. The solution to the linear system $Ax=b$ is equivalent to the unique minimizer of the quadratic energy functional $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{\\mathsf{T}} A x - b^{\\mathsf{T}} x$. The gradient of this functional is $\\nabla \\phi(x) = Ax - b$, which we define as the negative of the residual, $-r(x)$.\n\nThe PCG method is an iterative procedure that generates a sequence of approximations $x_k$ that minimize $\\phi(x)$ over expanding affine subspaces.

This is a one-dimensional minimization problem (a line search).

This property guarantees that the minimization over the expanded search space at step $k$ does not spoil the minimization from previous steps.\n\nIn the preconditioned version of the algorithm, the search directions are constructed using the preconditioned residual, $z_k = M^{-1}r_k$. The initial search direction is $p_0 = z_0$. Subsequent directions are constructed by making the new preconditioned residual $z_{k+1}$ $A$-conjugate to the previous search direction $p_k$. This is achieved via a Gram-Schmidt-like process:\n$$\np_{k+1} = z_{k+1} + \\beta_{k+1} p_k\n$$\nWe enforce the $A$-conjugacy condition $p_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k = 0$:\n$$\n(z_{k+1} + \\beta_{k+1} p_k)^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k = 0 \\implies z_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k + \\beta_{k+1} p_k^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k = 0\n$$\nThis gives the coefficient $\\beta_{k+1} = -\\frac{z_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k}{p_k^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k}$.\n\nFor computational efficiency, these expressions for $\\alpha_k$ and $\\beta_k$ are simplified. The residuals have the property that $r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_j = 0$ for $j  k$. From $p_j = z_j + \\beta_j p_{j-1}$, it follows that $p_j$ is in the span of $\\{z_0, \\dots, z_j\\}$, and therefore $r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} p_j = 0$ for $j  k$.\nUsing this, the numerator of $\\alpha_k$ becomes:\n$p_k^{\\mathsf{T}} r_k = (z_k + \\beta_k p_{k-1})^{\\mathsf{T}} r_k = z_k^{\\mathsf{T}} r_k + \\beta_k p_{k-1}^{\\mathsf{T}} r_k = z_k^{\\mathsf{T}} r_k + 0 = r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_k$.\nSo, $\\alpha_k = \\frac{r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_k}{p_k^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k}$.\n\nFor $\\beta_{k+1}$, we use the residual update formula $r_{k+1} = r_k - \\alpha_k A p_k$, which implies $A p_k = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k}(r_k - r_{k+1})$.\nThe numerator of the expression for $\\beta_{k+1}$ becomes:\n$z_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k = z_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k}(r_k - r_{k+1}) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} (r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} M^{-1} r_k - r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} M^{-1} r_{k+1})$.\nThe $z_j$ are $M$-self-adjoint, and the residuals are $M^{-1}$-orthogonal, $r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} M^{-1} r_k =0$. So the numerator simplifies to $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} z_{k+1}$.\nThe denominator is $p_k^{\\mathsf{T}} A p_k = \\frac{r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_k}{\\alpha_k}$.\nThus, $\\beta_{k+1} = \\frac{-r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} z_{k+1} / \\alpha_k}{r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_k / \\alpha_k} = \\frac{r_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{T}} z_{k+1}}{r_k^{\\mathsf{T}} z_k}$.\n\nThe PCG algorithm to be implemented is:\n1. $r_0 = b - Ax_0$\n2. $z_0 = M^{-1}r_0$\n3. $p_0 = z_0$\n4.
