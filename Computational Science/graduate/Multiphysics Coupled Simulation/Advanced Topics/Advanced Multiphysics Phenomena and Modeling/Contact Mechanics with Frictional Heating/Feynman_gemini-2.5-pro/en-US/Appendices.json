            "problem": "An isotropic, homogeneous elastic block of thickness $h$ and in-plane area $A$ is pressed between a rigid upper platen and a rigid lower substrate, both perfectly flat. A normal preload is applied by imposing a fixed total approach between the rigid bodies, after which the machine frame locks the gap so that the mean normal separation remains fixed. The initial macroscopic contact is complete and uniform, with compressive normal stress component $\\sigma_{yy}(0)$ everywhere in the block and corresponding normal contact pressure magnitude $p_0$, defined by $p_0 = -\\sigma_{yy}(0)$. The lateral sides of the block are confined by a rigid frame so that macroscopic in-plane strains are suppressed. During steady sliding of the block over the substrate, frictional heating raises the temperature of the block uniformly by $\\Delta T$ relative to the locked, preloaded reference state.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires finding the change in contact pressure on an elastic block due to a uniform temperature increase under conditions of complete kinematic confinement. We will use the theory of linear thermoelasticity for an isotropic material.\n\nThe fundamental constitutive relation connecting strain $\\epsilon_{ij}$, stress $\\sigma_{ij}$, and temperature change $\\Delta T$ for a linear, isotropic, elastic material is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu \\delta_{ij} \\sigma_{kk} \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta_{ij} $$\nHere, $E$ is Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}$ is the trace of the stress tensor (sum of normal stresses).\n\nLet's define two states:\n-   **State 1**: The initial, preloaded state at the reference temperature. Here, $\\Delta T = 0$. The normal stress is $\\sigma_{yy,1} = -p_0$.\n-   **State 2**: The final state after heating. The temperature has increased by $\\Delta T$.\n\nThe problem states that after the initial preload, the machine frame locks the gap, and the lateral sides are confined. This means the block is kinematically constrained in all three dimensions. Any change in dimension is prevented. Therefore, the strain tensor must remain constant during the heating process from State 1 to State 2.\nLet $\\Delta \\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon_{ij,2} - \\epsilon_{ij,1}$ be the change in the strain components. The constraints imply:\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{yy} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{zz} = 0 $$\nThis means that the change in strain in all three normal directions is zero.\n\nBecause the underlying theory is linear, we can apply the principle of superposition. The change in strain is related to the change in stress, $\\Delta\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij,2} - \\sigma_{ij,1}$, and the change in temperature, $\\Delta T$. The constitutive relation for these *changes* is:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\Delta\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu \\delta_{ij} \\Delta\\sigma_{kk} \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta_{ij} $$\nLet's write this out for the three normal components ($i=j$):\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\Delta\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\Delta\\sigma_{yy} + \\Delta\\sigma_{zz}) \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\Delta\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu (\\Delta\\sigma_{xx} + \\Delta\\sigma_{zz}) \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\Delta\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\Delta\\sigma_{xx} + \\Delta\\sigma_{yy}) \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\nDue to the symmetry of the problem (uniform heating and isotropic material properties under symmetric confinement), the change in stress will be the same in all three directions. Let $\\Delta\\sigma_{xx} = \\Delta\\sigma_{yy} = \\Delta\\sigma_{zz} = \\Delta\\sigma$. The three equations become identical. We can use any one of them to solve for $\\Delta\\sigma$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\Delta\\sigma - \\nu (\\Delta\\sigma + \\Delta\\sigma) \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\Delta\\sigma (1 - 2\\nu) \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T = 0 $$\nRearranging to solve for the change in stress $\\Delta\\sigma$:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma (1 - 2\\nu) = -E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma = - \\frac{E \\alpha \\Delta T}{1 - 2\\nu} $$\nThis is the compressive stress generated in each direction to counteract the thermal expansion that is being prevented by the rigid confinement.\n\nThe final normal stress in the $y$-direction, $\\sigma_{yy,2}$, is the sum of the initial stress and the change in stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy,2} = \\sigma_{yy,1} + \\Delta\\sigma_{yy} $$\nThe problem states the initial normal pressure magnitude is $p_0$, which corresponds to an initial compressive stress $\\sigma_{yy,1} = -p_0$. The change in normal stress is $\\Delta\\sigma_{yy} = \\Delta\\sigma$.\n$$ \\sigma_{yy,2} = -p_0 - \\frac{E \\alpha \\Delta T}{1 - 2\\nu} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy,2} = - \\left( p_0 + \\frac{E \\alpha \\Delta T}{1 - 2\\nu} \\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the new normal contact stress, $|\\sigma_n|$. The normal contact stress is equal to the normal stress component on the contact surface, $\\sigma_n = \\sigma_{yy,2}$. Since $p_0$, $E$, $\\alpha$, and $\\Delta T$ are positive quantities, and for physical materials $1-2\\nu > 0$, the final stress $\\sigma_{yy,2}$ is negative (compressive). Its magnitude is therefore:\n$$ |\\sigma_n| = |\\sigma_{yy,2}| = p_0 + \\frac{E \\alpha \\Delta T}{1 - 2\\nu} $$\nThis expression represents the final contact pressure, which is the sum of the initial mechanical preload pressure and the thermally induced pressure from confined heating.",

            "problem": "A rigid rough flat with many statistically similar asperities is pressed against a rigid rough counterface under a constant normal load. Sliding at a constant speed produces frictional heating. You must build a simplified but mechanistically consistent coupled model for contact mechanics and heat transfer under the following assumptions, starting strictly from fundamental balances and well-tested facts: (i) local microcontacts deform plastically at a uniform hardness, (ii) the total normal load equals the sum of microcontact forces, (iii) the interfacial friction force equals the interfacial shear strength times the true contact area, (iv) steady state interfacial temperature is governed by an energy balance between frictional heat generation and conduction across microcontacts, and (v) thermal constriction resistance of a circular microcontact on a semi-infinite body is the dominant thermal resistance. The bodies are made of different homogeneous isotropic materials with different thermal conductivities, but they share the same far-field bulk temperature.\n\nDerive, from these bases only and without invoking any pre-derived shortcut formulae, expressions for the following quantities in terms of the given parameters: the plastic microcontact radius, the thermal contact conductance, the friction coefficient including its temperature dependence, and the steady interfacial temperature. Use the following definitions and assumptions throughout:\n\n- Let the total normal load be $W$, the nominal (apparent) contact area be $A_0$, the number of identical load-sharing asperities be $N$, and the material hardness (assumed temperature independent in this problem) be $H$. Under fully plastic microcontacts, take the local mean contact pressure equal to $H$.\n- Let the interfacial shear strength at a reference temperature be $\\tau_0$, with linear thermal softening $\\tau_s(T) = \\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta \\left(T - T_0\\right)\\right]$, where $T$ is the interfacial temperature, $T_0$ is the reference temperature, and $\\beta$ is a positive softening slope. Enforce non-negative shear strength by truncation only if needed by your derivation.\n- Let the sliding speed be $V$ and the nominal pressure be $p_{\\text{nom}} = W/A_0$. Take the steady frictional heat flux per nominal area to be $q^{\\prime\\prime} = f(T)\\, p_{\\text{nom}}\\, V$, where $f(T)$ is the friction coefficient defined by $f(T) = \\tau_s(T)/H$ under fully plastic junctions.\n- Let the two bodies have thermal conductivities $k_1$ and $k_2$. For a single circular microcontact of radius $a$, assume the thermal constriction resistance on each side is $R_{c,i} = \\left(2\\,k_i\\,a\\right)^{-1}$ for body $i$ and the two are in series. The total conductance of one microcontact is then the reciprocal of the sum of these two resistances. The overall thermal contact conductance $h_c$ is the sum of all microcontact conductances divided by $A_0$.\n- Let both bodies have the same far-field bulk temperature $T_b$, and treat the heat flow pathway as lumped into $h_c$ so that the steady interfacial temperature rise $\\Delta T = T - T_b$ satisfies $q^{\\prime\\prime} = h_c\\,\\Delta T$.\n\nTasks:\n\n$1.$ From force balance and the plastic microcontact assumption, derive the microcontact radius $a$ in terms of $W$, $N$, $H$, and constants.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of contact mechanics and heat transfer, internally consistent, and well-posed. The provided parameters are physically plausible. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe solution is structured into two main parts as requested: first, the derivation of the mechanical and thermal contact parameters, and second, the derivation of the steady-state interfacial temperature and friction coefficient from the coupled thermomechanical energy balance.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Microcontact Radius and Thermal Contact conductance**\n\nThe first task is to derive expressions for the individual microcontact radius, $a$, and the overall thermal contact conductance per unit nominal area, $h_c$.\n\n**Microcontact Radius, $a$**\nThe model is based on the following principles and assumptions:\n1.  The total normal load, $W$, is supported by $N$ identical asperities, so the load on a single asperity is $W_{\\text{asp}} = W/N$.\n2.  Each microcontact deforms plastically, meaning the local contact pressure is equal to the material's hardness, $H$.\n3.  Microcontacts are circular with radius $a$, so the area of a single microcontact is $A_{\\text{asp}} = \\pi a^2$.\n\nFrom the plastic contact assumption, the force supported by a single asperity is the product of its area and the hardness:\n$$W_{\\text{asp}} = H \\cdot A_{\\text{asp}} = H (\\pi a^2)$$\nEquating this with the load per asperity gives:\n$$\\frac{W}{N} = H \\pi a^2$$\nSolving for the microcontact radius $a$ yields:\n$$a^2 = \\frac{W}{N \\pi H}$$\n$$a = \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{N \\pi H}}$$\n\n**Thermal Contact Conductance, $h_c$**\nThe derivation of $h_c$ is based on the principles of thermal resistance networks:\n1.  The thermal resistance of a single microcontact is the sum of the series constriction resistances from each of the two contacting bodies.\n2.  The total thermal conductance of the interface is the sum of the parallel conductances of all $N$ microcontacts, normalized by the nominal contact area $A_0$.\n\nThe problem provides the thermal constriction resistance for a single circular contact on body $i$ as $R_{c,i} = (2 k_i a)^{-1}$. Since the two resistances are in series, the total resistance for one microcontact, $R_{c, \\text{single}}$, is:\n$$R_{c, \\text{single}} = R_{c,1} + R_{c,2} = \\frac{1}{2 k_1 a} + \\frac{1}{2 k_2 a} = \\frac{1}{2a} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\frac{1}{k_2}\\right) = \\frac{k_1 + k_2}{2a k_1 k_2}$$\nThe conductance of a single microcontact, $h_{c, \\text{single}}$, is the reciprocal of its resistance:\n$$h_{c, \\text{single}} = \\frac{1}{R_{c, \\text{single}}} = \\frac{2a k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$$\nThe overall thermal contact conductance, $h_c$, is the total conductance of $N$ identical microcontacts distributed over the nominal area $A_0$:\n$$h_c = \\frac{N \\cdot h_{c, \\text{single}}}{A_0} = \\frac{N}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{2a k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $a$:\n$$h_c = \\frac{N}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{2 k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{N \\pi H}} = \\frac{2 k_1 k_2 \\sqrt{N}}{(k_1 + k_2) A_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{\\pi H}}$$\nThis concludes the derivations for the first task.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Interfacial Temperature and Friction Coefficient**\n\nThe second task is to derive a closed-form expression for the steady interfacial temperature, $T$, and the corresponding friction coefficient, $f(T)$. This requires coupling the mechanical and thermal models through an energy balance at the sliding interface.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the first law of thermodynamics applied to the interface at steady state: the rate of heat generated by friction must equal the rate of heat conducted away from the interface. On a per-unit-nominal-area basis, this balance is expressed as:\n$$q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{gen}} = q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}}$$\nThe problem provides expressions for these heat fluxes:\n1.  Frictional heat generation: $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{gen}} = f(T) \\, p_{\\text{nom}} \\, V$, where $p_{\\text{nom}} = W/A_0$.\n2.  Heat conduction: $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = h_c (T - T_b)$, where $T_b$ is the far-field bulk temperature.\n\nEquating these gives the governing equation for the system:\n$$f(T) \\, \\frac{W}{A_0} \\, V = h_c (T - T_b)$$\nThe friction coefficient $f(T)$ is defined by the ratio of interfacial shear strength $\\tau_s(T)$ to hardness $H$, consistent with plastic junction theory: $f(T) = \\tau_s(T)/H$. The shear strength is given to have a linear thermal softening relation:\n$$\\tau_s(T) = \\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]$$\nwhere $T_0$ is a reference temperature and $\\beta$ is the thermal softening coefficient. Substituting these definitions into the energy balance equation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]}{H} \\frac{W}{A_0} V = h_c (T - T_b)$$\nThis is an algebraic equation that is linear in the unknown temperature $T$. We can solve for $T$ by rearranging the terms. First, expand the left side:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} \\left(1 - \\beta T + \\beta T_0\\right) = h_c T - h_c T_b$$\nNext, group all terms containing $T$ on one side and all constant terms on the other:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} + \\frac{\\tau_0 W V \\beta T_0}{H A_0} + h_c T_b = h_c T + \\frac{\\tau_0 W V \\beta}{H A_0} T$$\nFactor out $T$:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} (1 + \\beta T_0) + h_c T_b = T \\left(h_c + \\frac{\\tau_0 \\beta W V}{H A_0}\\right)$$\nFinally, solve for the steady interfacial temperature $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} (1 + \\beta T_0) + h_c T_b}{h_c + \\frac{\\tau_0 \\beta W V}{H A_0}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $T$. All quantities on the right-hand side are given parameters or have been derived in Part 1 (namely $h_c$).\n\nOnce the steady-state temperature $T$ is calculated using this formula, the corresponding steady-state friction coefficient $f(T)$ is found by substituting this temperature back into its definition:\n$$f(T) = \\frac{\\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]}{H}$$\nWe must enforce the physical constraint that shear strength cannot be negative, which implies the friction coefficient also cannot be negative. Therefore, if the calculated $T$ is high enough to make the term $(1 - \\beta(T-T_0))$ negative, the friction coefficient should be set to zero.

            "problem": "Consider two deformable bodies in frictional contact along an interface $\\Gamma_c$, modeled with a multiphysics finite element method (FEM). The thermomechanical coupling arises from interfacial frictional heating, which contributes a boundary heat source to the thermal balance. The interfacial tangential traction is modeled by a regularized rate-dependent Coulomb law. Assume the following:\n\n- The interfacial frictional heating per unit area is given by the mechanical power density $q_{\\Gamma}$ transferred to heat, defined as $q_{\\Gamma} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_t$ is the tangential traction and $\\mathbf{v}_t$ is the tangential slip rate.\n- The regularized tangential traction is given by\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_t = \\mu(T)\\,\\lambda_n\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu(T)$ is the temperature-dependent friction coefficient, $\\lambda_n$ is the normal contact pressure (represented by a Lagrange multiplier), and $\\delta0$ is a small regularization parameter.\n- The discrete tangential slip rate at a single quadrature point on $\\Gamma_c$ is computed by a backward Euler time discretization from the displacement increment, $\\mathbf{v}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^n}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\mathbf{B}_t$ is the tangential kinematic mapping evaluated at the quadrature point, $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$ and $\\mathbf{u}^n$ are the current and previous nodal displacement vectors, and $\\Delta t$ is the time step. The variation of the slip rate with respect to the current displacement is $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}}{\\Delta t}$.\n- The interfacial contribution to the thermal residual vector at that quadrature point is\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma} = \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top}\\,q_{\\Gamma},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{N}_T$ are the temperature shape functions evaluated at the quadrature point.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles of conservation of energy (mechanical power dissipated into heat at the contact interface) and the given constitutive description of tangential traction, derive the exact Gateaux linearization (directional derivative) of the interfacial thermal residual contribution $\\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma}$ with respect to the discrete unknown variations $(\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}, \\delta T, \\delta \\lambda_n)$ at a single quadrature point. Express your final result in closed form in terms of $\\mu(T)$, $\\mu'(T)$, $\\lambda_n$, $\\Delta t$, $\\mathbf{v}_t$, $\\delta$, $\\mathbf{N}_T$, and $\\mathbf{B}_t$. Do not perform any numerical evaluation. Provide the expression for the linearization at the quadrature point only (ignore the surface integration over $\\Gamma_c$).\n\nYour final answer must be a single analytic expression.

The Gateaux linearization, or directional derivative, is the variation $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma}$ which is linear in the variations of the unknowns.\n\nThe interfacial thermal residual at a quadrature point is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma} = \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top}\\,q_{\\Gamma}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{N}_T$ are the temperature shape functions, which are evaluated at a fixed material point and do not depend on the unknown fields $(\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}, T, \\lambda_n)$. Therefore, the variation of $\\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma}$ is:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma} = \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top}\\,\\delta q_{\\Gamma}\n$$\nThe next step is to find the variation of the frictional heating per unit area, $q_{\\Gamma}$. We are given:\n$$\nq_{\\Gamma} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t\n$$\nBy substituting the provided regularized expression for the tangential traction $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_t$, we obtain a more direct expression for $q_{\\Gamma}$ in terms of the primary fields:\n$$\nq_{\\Gamma} = \\left( \\mu(T)\\,\\lambda_n\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2}} \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t = \\mu(T)\\,\\lambda_n\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2}}\n$$\nHere, $q_{\\Gamma}$ is a function of the temperature $T$ (through $\\mu(T)$), the normal contact pressure $\\lambda_n$, and the tangential slip rate $\\mathbf{v}_t$. The slip rate $\\mathbf{v}_t$ in turn depends on the nodal displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$.\nThe total variation $\\delta q_{\\Gamma}$ is found by applying the chain rule:\n$$\n\\delta q_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial T} \\delta T + \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial \\lambda_n} \\delta \\lambda_n + \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{v}_t\n$$\nWe now compute each partial derivative.

Partial derivative with respect to the tangential slip rate vector $\\mathbf{v}_t$:\n    To compute this, we can let $x = \\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t$ and use the chain rule: $\\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t} = \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t}$. We know $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t} = \\frac{\\partial (\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t)}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t} = 2\\mathbf{v}_t$.\n    The expression for $q_{\\Gamma}$ is $q_{\\Gamma} = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{x}{(x+\\delta^2)^{1/2}}$. Using the quotient rule to differentiate with respect to $x$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial x} = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{1 \\cdot (x+\\delta^2)^{1/2} - x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(x+\\delta^2)^{-1/2}}{x+\\delta^2}\n    $$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(x+\\delta^2)^{1/2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial x} = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{(x+\\delta^2) - \\frac{1}{2}x}{(x+\\delta^2)^{3/2}} = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x+\\delta^2}{(x+\\delta^2)^{3/2}} = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{x+2\\delta^2}{2(x+\\delta^2)^{3/2}}\n    $$\n    Substituting back $x = \\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial q_{\\Gamma}}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_t} = \\left( \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + 2\\delta^2}{2(\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2)^{3/2}} \\right) (2\\mathbf{v}_t) = \\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + 2\\delta^2}{(\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2)^{3/2}} \\mathbf{v}_t\n    $$\nThe problem states that the variation of the slip rate is $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}}{\\Delta t}$. We can now assemble the expression for $\\delta q_{\\Gamma}$:\n$$\n\\delta q_{\\Gamma} = \\left(\\mu'(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t}{v_{eff}}\\right) \\delta T + \\left(\\mu(T) \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t}{v_{eff}}\\right) \\delta \\lambda_n + \\left(\\mu(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + 2\\delta^2}{v_{eff}^3} \\mathbf{v}_t\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{B}_t \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}}{\\Delta t}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma} = \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top}\\,\\delta q_{\\Gamma}$ yields the full linearization. The term involving $\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$ represents the thermomechanical coupling tangent contribution. In matrix notation appropriate for a finite element code, the dot product term $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{b})$ is written as $\\mathbf{a}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{b}$. Thus, the final term becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top} \\left( \\frac{\\mu(T)\\lambda_n}{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + 2\\delta^2}{(\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2)^{3/2}} \\right) \\mathbf{v}_t^{\\top} \\mathbf{B}_t \\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\n$$\nThe product $\\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_t^{\\top} \\mathbf{B}_t$ forms a matrix, which when multiplied by the vector $\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$ results in a vector contribution to the thermal residual.\n\nCombining all parts, the full Gateaux linearization of the interfacial thermal residual contribution is the sum of the contributions from each variation:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathbf{r}_T^{\\Gamma} =\n\\underbrace{\\left( \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top} \\mu'(T)\\lambda_n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2}} \\right) \\delta T}_{\\text{_T-T coupling_}}\n+ \\underbrace{\\left( \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top} \\mu(T) \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2}} \\right) \\delta \\lambda_n}_{\\text{_T-$\\lambda$ coupling_}}\n+ \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{\\mu(T)\\lambda_n}{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + 2\\delta^2}{(\\mathbf{v}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t + \\delta^2)^{3/2}} \\mathbf{N}_T^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_t^{\\top} \\mathbf{B}_t \\right) \\delta \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}}_{\\text{_T-u coupling_}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the complete linearization at the quadrature point.",
