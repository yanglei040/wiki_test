            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and solution of the governing equation for the electrostatic potential profile $\\phi(y)$ in a semi-infinite symmetric electrolyte adjacent to a charged flat wall, and then the derivation of the corresponding wall surface charge density $\\sigma$. The solution proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; second, its solution subject to the given boundary conditions; and third, the calculation of the surface charge density.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation for the potential $\\phi(y)$. The net local volume charge density, $\\rho_e(y)$, is the sum of the charge contributions from the cations and anions. Given that cations have charge $+ze$ and concentration $c_+(y)$, and anions have charge $-ze$ and concentration $c_-(y)$, the charge density is:\n$$\n\\rho_e(y) = (+ze)c_+(y) + (-ze)c_-(y) = ze[c_+(y) - c_-(y)]\n$$\nThe problem states that the ion concentrations follow Boltzmann distributions due to being in electrochemical equilibrium in the potential field $\\phi(y)$:\n$$\nc_{\\pm}(y) = c_0 \\exp\\left(\\mp \\frac{ze\\phi(y)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $e$ is the elementary charge.

A standard technique for an equation of the form $\\phi'' = f(\\phi)$ is to multiply by $2\\phi'$ and integrate. Let's multiply both sides by $2\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$:\n$$\n2\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dy^2} = \\frac{4ze c_0}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of $(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy})^2$ with respect to $y$, i.e., $\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2$. We can integrate both sides with respect to $y$ from a position $y$ to infinity:\n$$\n\\int_y^\\infty \\frac{d}{d\\tilde{y}}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tilde{y}}\\right)^2 d\\tilde{y} = \\int_y^\\infty \\frac{4ze c_0}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tilde{y}} d\\tilde{y}\n$$\nThe left side evaluates to $\\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2\\right]_{y=\\infty} - \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2$. For the right side, we change the integration variable from $\\tilde{y}$ to $\\phi$. The limits become $\\phi(y)$ and $\\phi(\\infty)=0$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=\\infty}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\int_{\\phi(y)}^{\\phi(\\infty)=0} \\frac{4ze c_0}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi'}{k_B T}\\right) d\\phi'\n$$\nThe boundary condition $\\phi(y) \\to 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$ implies that the electric field must also vanish, so $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} \\to 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$. Thus, the first term on the left is $0$.\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4ze c_0}{\\epsilon} \\int_{\\phi(y)}^{0} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi'}{k_B T}\\right) d\\phi'\n$$\nThe integral of $\\sinh(ax)$ is $\\frac{1}{a}\\cosh(ax)$. Therefore:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4ze c_0}{\\epsilon} \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{ze} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi'}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]_{\\phi(y)}^{0}\n$$\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon} \\left[\\cosh(0) - \\cosh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(y)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\cosh(0)=1$, we get:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon} \\left[\\cosh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]\n$$\nNow, we use the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(2x) - 1 = 2\\sinh^2(x)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon} \\left[2\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{8c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon} \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the square root, we obtain a first-order differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dphi}{dy} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{8c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe sign must be chosen based on physical reasoning. If $\\phi_0 > 0$, the potential must decrease from the wall towards the bulk solution, so $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} < 0$. Since $\\phi > 0$ in this case, the term $\\sinh(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T})$ is positive. To make $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$ negative, we must choose the minus sign. If $\\phi_0 < 0$, the potential must increase from the wall, so $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} > 0$. Since $\\phi < 0$, the sinh term is negative, so we must again choose the minus sign to make the product positive. Thus, the correct choice is always the negative sign:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{8c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We rearrange it for integration:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{8c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon}} \\, dy\n$$\nLet us define the inverse Debye length, $\\kappa$, as $\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2z^2 e^2 c_0}{\\epsilon k_B T}}$. The constant on the right can be simplified as $\\sqrt{\\frac{8c_0 k_B T}{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{2k_B T}{ze} \\kappa$.\nThe ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi}{2k_B T}\\right)} = - \\frac{2k_B T}{ze} \\kappa \\, dy\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from $y'=0$ to $y'=y$, with corresponding potentials from $\\phi'=\\phi_0$ to $\\phi'=\\phi(y)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi_0}^{\\phi(y)} \\frac{d\\phi'}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi'}{2k_B T}\\right)} = - \\int_0^y \\frac{2k_B T}{ze} \\kappa \\, dy'\n$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{\\sinh(ax)}$ is $\\frac{1}{a} \\ln\\left[\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ax}{2}\\right)\\right]$. Applying this, with $a = \\frac{ze}{2k_B T}$:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{2k_B T}{ze} \\ln\\left(\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi'}{4k_B T}\\right)\\right)\\right]_{\\phi_0}^{\\phi(y)} = -\\frac{2k_B T}{ze} \\kappa y\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(y)}{4k_B T}\\right)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi_0}{4k_B T}\\right)\\right) = -\\kappa y\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(y)}{4k_B T}\\right)}{\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi_0}{4k_B T}\\right)}\\right) = -\\kappa y\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(y)}{4k_B T}\\right) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi_0}{4k_B T}\\right) \\exp(-\\kappa y)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $\\phi(y)$ using the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, $\\arctanh$:\n$$\n\\phi(y) = \\frac{4k_B T}{ze} \\arctanh\\left[ \\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi_0}{4k_B T}\\right) \\exp(-\\kappa y) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\kappa$, we obtain the first required expression for the potential profile.\n\nLastly, we find the surface charge density on the wall, $\\sigma$, defined by Gauss's law as $\\sigma = -\\epsilon \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\big|_{y=0}$.

This is the total electrical conductance of the capillary, $G_{total}$, multiplied by its length $L$. The total current is the sum of the current through the bulk electrolyte and the surface conduction current.\n\nThe bulk conductance, $G_b$, is given by Ohm's law for a cylinder of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A = \\pi a^2$:\n$$ G_b = \\frac{\\sigma_b A}{L} = \\frac{\\sigma_b \\pi a^2}{L} $$\nThe surface conductance, $G_s$, is given by the surface conductivity $K_s$ multiplied by the perimeter-to-length ratio:\n$$ G_s = \\frac{K_s (2 \\pi a)}{L} $$\nThe total conductance is $G_{total} = G_b + G_s$.

This streaming current, $I_s$, arises from the convection of net charge within the EDL by the pressure-driven flow.\n$$ I_s = \\int_A \\rho_e(r) u_z(r) dA $$\nwhere $\\rho_e(r)$ is the volumetric charge density and $u_z(r)$ is the axial velocity profile.\nFor a pressure-driven flow (Poiseuille flow) in a cylinder, the velocity is:\n$$ u_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4 \\eta L} (a^2 - r^2) $$\nThe thin EDL approximation ($\\kappa a \\gg 1$) implies that the charge density $\\rho_e$ is non-zero only in a very thin layer near the wall, where $r \\approx a$. The integral for the streaming current is taken over the cross-section, which in the thin EDL limit simplifies to an integral over the wall-normal coordinate $y = a-r$:\n$$ I_s = \\int_0^a \\rho_e(r) u_z(r) 2 \\pi r dr \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_e(y) u_z(y) 2 \\pi a dy $$\nAs $u_z(r)$ is nearly zero at the wall where $\\rho_e$ is large, this is not the right approach. It is better to use the reciprocity. From Onsager's relations, $L_{21} = L_{12}$. The coefficient $L_{12}$ relates the volumetric flow $Q$ to the electric field $\\Delta \\phi / L$ when $\\Delta p = 0$. This is the electro-osmotic flow.\n\nIn the thin EDL limit, an applied electric field $E_z = -\\Delta\\phi/L$ induces an electro-osmotic slip velocity at the edge of the EDL, given by the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation:\n$$ u_{eo} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon\\zeta}{\\eta} E_z = \\frac{\\varepsilon\\zeta}{\\eta} \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{L} $$\nThis slip velocity creates a plug-like flow across the capillary cross-section. The total volumetric flow rate is then:\n$$ Q_{eo} = A \\cdot u_{eo} = (\\pi a^2) \\frac{\\varepsilon\\zeta}{\\eta} \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{L} $$\nFrom the phenomenological equation $Q = L_{12} (\\Delta \\phi / L)$, we identify $L_{12}$:\n$$ L_{12} = \\frac{\\pi a^2 \\varepsilon \\zeta}{\\eta} $$\nBy Onsager reciprocity, $L_{21} = L_{12}$, so:\n$$ L_{21} = \\frac{\\pi a^2 \\varepsilon \\zeta}{\\eta} $$\n\n**Calculation of the Streaming Potential, $\\Delta \\phi$**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $L_{21}$ and $L_{22}$ into the equation for the streaming potential:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = -\\frac{L_{21}}{L_{22}} \\Delta p $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = - \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^2 \\varepsilon \\zeta}{\\eta}}{\\pi a^2 \\sigma_b (1 + 2 Du)} \\Delta p $$\nThe term $\\pi a^2$ cancels out.\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = - \\frac{\\frac{\\varepsilon \\zeta}{\\eta}}{\\sigma_b (1 + 2 Du)} \\Delta p $$\nThe streaming potential opposes the pressure drop, so there's a sign convention issue. The pressure drop $\\Delta p = p_1-p_2$ drives flow. The streaming current is in the direction of flow. The streaming potential $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_1 - \\phi_2$ builds up to oppose this current. A positive pressure drop should lead to a positive streaming potential. Let's recheck the signs. $I_s$ should be positive for a positive $\\Delta p$. My derivation of $L_{12}$ assumed $E_z = -\\Delta\\phi/L$. Let's use $E_z = \\Delta\\phi/L$. Then $Q_{eo} = (\\pi a^2) (-\\varepsilon\\zeta/\\eta) (\\Delta\\phi/L)$. So $L_{12} = -\\pi a^2 \\varepsilon \\zeta/\\eta$. Then $L_{21}$ is also negative.\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = - \\frac{-\\frac{\\pi a^2 \\varepsilon \\zeta}{\\eta}}{\\pi a^2 \\sigma_b (1 + 2 Du)} \\Delta p = \\frac{\\varepsilon \\zeta \\Delta p}{\\eta \\sigma_b (1 + 2 Du)} $$\nThis is the standard result. The expression includes all specified parameters and represents the streaming potential that builds up to counteract the pressure-driven transport of charge, resulting in zero net current. The denominator term $(1 + 2Du)$ accounts for the increased electrical conductance of the channel due to mobile ions in the EDL, which reduces the magnitude of the streaming potential compared to a case with only bulk conduction.",

            "solution": "The derivation of the temperature profile $T(y)$ begins by integrating the governing equation, $k \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} = -q$, twice with respect to $y$:\nFirst integration yields the temperature gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\frac{q}{k} y + C_1\n$$\nSecond integration yields the general temperature profile:\n$$\nT(y) = -\\frac{q}{2k} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\nThe physical problem is symmetric about the centerline $y=0$. The geometry, boundary conditions, and internal heat generation are all symmetric. Consequently, the temperature profile $T(y)$ must be an even function of $y$, which implies that the temperature gradient at the centerline is zero: $\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = 0$. Applying this to the first integral:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{q}{k}(0) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0\n$$\nThus, the temperature profile simplifies to:\n$$\nT(y) = -\\frac{q}{2k} y^2 + C_2\n$$\nand the gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\frac{q}{k} y\n$$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by applying one of the boundary conditions, for instance, at $y=H/2$:\n$$\n-k \\left.\\frac{d T}{d y}\\right|_{y=H/2} = h \\left(T(H/2) - T_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T(y)$ and its derivative:\n$$\n-k \\left(-\\frac{q}{k} \\frac{H}{2}\\right) = h \\left( \\left(-\\frac{q}{2k} \\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2\\right) - T_{\\infty} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{qH}{2} = h \\left(-\\frac{qH^2}{8k} + C_2 - T_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{qH}{2h} = -\\frac{qH^2}{8k} + C_2 - T_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nC_2 = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{qH}{2h} + \\frac{qH^2}{8k}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the temperature profile equation provides the complete solution for $T(y)$:\n$$\nT(y) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{qH}{2h} + \\frac{qH^2}{8k} - \\frac{q}{2k} y^2\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nT(y) - T_{\\infty} = q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} - \\frac{y^2}{2k} \\right)\n$$\nThe wall temperature $T_w$ is evaluated at $y = H/2$:\n$$\nT_w = T(H/2) = T_{\\infty} + q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} - \\frac{(H/2)^2}{2k} \\right) = T_{\\infty} + q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} - \\frac{H^2}{8k} \\right) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{qH}{2h}\n$$\nThe temperature rise at the wall, $\\Delta T_w$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta T_w = T_w - T_{\\infty} = \\frac{qH}{2h}\n$$\nThe centerline temperature $T_c$ is evaluated at $y=0$:\n$$\nT_c = T(0) = T_{\\infty} + q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} - 0 \\right) = T_{\\infty} + q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} \\right)\n$$\nThe temperature rise at the centerline, $\\Delta T_c$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_c = T_c - T_{\\infty} = q \\left( \\frac{H}{2h} + \\frac{H^2}{8k} \\right) = \\Delta T_w + \\frac{qH^2}{8k}\n$$\nWith the Joule heating term $q=\\sigma E^2$, these expressions become:\n$$\n\\Delta T_w = \\frac{\\sigma E^2 H}{2h}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_c = \\frac{\\sigma E^2 H}{2h} + \\frac{\\sigma E^2 H^2}{8k}\n$$\nThe electroosmotic slip velocity $u_{\\mathrm{HS}}$ depends on the viscosity at the wall temperature, $\\mu(T_w)$. First, the absolute wall temperature must be computed: $T_w = T_{\\infty} + \\Delta T_w$. This value is then used in the viscosity law:\n$$\n\\mu(T_w) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\exp\\left[\\frac{E_{\\mu}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_w} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nFinally, the slip velocity is calculated using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski relation, with $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{HS}} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 \\zeta E}{\\mu(T_w)}\n$$\nThe calculation procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. Calculate the volumetric heat generation $q = \\sigma E^2$.\n$2$. Calculate the wall temperature rise $\\Delta T_w = \\frac{qH}{2h}$.\n$3$. Calculate the centerline temperature rise $\\Delta T_c = \\Delta T_w + \\frac{qH^2}{8k}$.\n$4$. Calculate the absolute wall temperature $T_w = T_{\\infty} + \\Delta T_w$.\n$5$. Calculate the viscosity at the wall, $\\mu(T_w)$, using the Arrhenius-like law.\n$6$. Calculate the electroosmotic slip velocity $u_{\\mathrm{HS}}$ using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski relation with the calculated $\\mu(T_w)$.\n$7$. Round the three quantities of interest, $\\Delta T_w$, $\\Delta T_c$, and $u_{\\mathrm{HS}}$, to six decimal places.\nThe implementation will follow this sequence for each provided set of parameters.",
