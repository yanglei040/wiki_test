The advective velocity $U$ is a positive constant ($U>0$).\n- **Boundary Condition**: An inflow boundary condition is prescribed at $x=0$: $c(0,t) = g(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n- **Initial Condition**: An initial concentration profile is given: $c(x,0) = c_{0}(x)$ for $x \\in [0,L]$.\n- **Regularity**: The functions $g(t)$ and $c_{0}(x)$ are assumed to be sufficiently regular.\n- **Definition of Total Mass**: The total mass in the domain at time $t$ is $M(t) = \\int_{0}^{L} c(x,t)\\,dx$.\n- **Specific Data for Part 3**:\n  - Initial condition function: $c_{0}(x) = A\\,\\exp(-\\alpha x)$\n  - Boundary condition function: $g(t) = C\\,\\exp(-\\beta t)$\n  - Parameter values: $A=1.5$, $C=1.5$, $\\alpha=3$, $\\beta=2$, $U=0.4$, $L=1$.\n  - All constants ($A, C, \\alpha, \\beta, U, L$) are specified as positive.\n- **Tasks**:\n  1.

Specialize the expression for $M(t)$ using the given data and parameters for $0 \\le t \\le L/U$ and provide a final closed-form expression.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The advection equation is a fundamental and canonical PDE in transport phenomena, representing the transport of a conserved scalar quantity by a constant velocity field. The method of characteristics is the standard mathematical technique for its solution. The concept of local and global mass conservation is central to physics and engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a first-order hyperbolic initial-boundary value problem. For a positive velocity $U>0$, information propagates from left to right ($x$ increasing). A boundary condition at the inflow boundary ($x=0$) and an initial condition are required and provided. This constitutes a well-posed setup. Note that for consistency at the point $(x,t) = (0,0)$, the initial and boundary data must agree, i.e., $c_0(0) = g(0)$. For the specific data given in part $3$, we have $c_0(0) = A\\,\\exp(0) = A = 1.5$ and $g(0) = C\\,\\exp(0) = C = 1.5$. Since $A=C$, the data are consistent.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language. It is free from subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary elements (PDE, domain, initial/boundary conditions, definitions) to proceed with a unique solution. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Other Criteria**: The problem is not unrealistic, ill-structured, trivial, or reliant on unverifiable claims. It is a standard, solvable problem in applied mathematics and physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. A full solution is developed below, addressing each part of the problem sequentially.\n\n### Part 1: General Solution via Method of Characteristics\nThe governing PDE is a first-order linear hyperbolic equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} c + U \\,\\partial_{x} c = 0\n$$\nThe method of characteristics seeks curves $(x(s), t(s))$ in the space-time domain along which the PDE simplifies to an ordinary differential equation. The characteristic equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1, \\quad \\frac{dx}{ds} = U, \\quad \\frac{dc}{ds} = \\partial_{t} c \\frac{dt}{ds} + \\partial_{x} c \\frac{dx}{ds} = \\partial_{t} c + U \\partial_{x} c = 0\n$$\nFrom these, we deduce that $c$ is constant along the characteristic curves. The characteristics themselves are straight lines defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = U$, which integrates to $x - Ut = \\xi$, where $\\xi$ is a constant. Each characteristic is uniquely identified by its parameter $\\xi$.\n\nTo find the solution $c(x,t)$ at a point $(x,t)$, we trace the characteristic line $X(\\tau) - U \\tau = x - Ut$ back until it intersects the boundary of the domain, which for $t>0$ consists of the initial line ($t=0$, $x \\ge 0$) and the inflow boundary ($x=0$, $t \\ge 0$).\n\n**Case 1: Characteristic originates from the initial line ($t=0$)**\nThe characteristic through $(x,t)$ intersects the initial line at time $\\tau=0$ at position $X(0) = x - Ut$. This intersection point is within the physical domain $[0,L]$ only if $x - Ut \\ge 0$, or $x \\ge Ut$. In this region, the concentration $c$ remains constant and equal to its initial value at that point.\n$$\nc(x,t) = c(x-Ut, 0) = c_0(x-Ut) \\quad \\text{for } x \\ge Ut\n$$\nThis region of the space-time domain is influenced by the initial condition $c_0(x)$.\n\n**Case 2: Characteristic originates from the inflow boundary ($x=0$)**\nThe characteristic through $(x,t)$ intersects the inflow boundary $X(\\tau) = 0$ at time $\\tau_0$ such that $0 - U\\tau_0 = x - Ut$, which gives $\\tau_0 = t - x/U$. This intersection occurs for $\\tau_0 \\ge 0$, which implies $t - x/U \\ge 0$, or $x \\le Ut$. In this region, the concentration $c$ remains constant and equal to the value prescribed at the boundary at the time of entry.\n$$\nc(x,t) = c(0, t - x/U) = g(t - x/U) \\quad \\text{for } x < Ut\n$$\nThis region of the space-time domain is influenced by the inflow boundary condition $g(t)$.\n\nCombining these two cases, the general solution is:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\begin{cases}\ng(t-x/U) & \\text{if } x < Ut \\\\\nc_0(x-Ut) & \\text{if } x \\ge Ut\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe domain is partitioned by the characteristic line $x=Ut$ emanating from the origin.\n\n### Part 2: Global Mass Balance and Evaluation of $M(t)$\nThe total mass in the domain is $M(t) = \\int_{0}^{L} c(x,t)\\,dx$. To find the global mass balance, we differentiate $M(t)$ with respect to time and use the governing PDE. Assuming sufficient regularity to interchange differentiation and integration (Leibniz rule):\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} c(x,t)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\partial_{t} c(x,t)\\,dx\n$$\nSubstitute $\\partial_{t} c = -U \\partial_{x} c$ from the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\int_{0}^{L} -U \\partial_{x} c(x,t)\\,dx = -U \\int_{0}^{L} \\partial_{x} c(x,t)\\,dx\n$$\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = -U [c(x,t)]_{x=0}^{x=L} = -U(c(L,t) - c(0,t)) = U(c(0,t) - c(L,t))\n$$\nThis is the global mass balance relation. The rate of change of total mass is the net flux of mass into the domain, which is the mass flux in at $x=0$ ($U c(0,t)$) minus the mass flux out at $x=L$ ($U c(L,t)$).\n\nNext, we evaluate $M(t)$ for the time interval $0 \\le t \\le L/U$. In this interval, the dividing characteristic $x=Ut$ lies within the spatial domain, i.e., $0 \\le Ut \\le L$. We must split the integral for $M(t)$ at $x=Ut$:\n$$\nM(t) = \\int_{0}^{L} c(x,t)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{Ut} c(x,t)\\,dx + \\int_{Ut}^{L} c(x,t)\\,dx\n$$\nSubstituting the piecewise solution for $c(x,t)$ from Part 1:\n$$\nM(t) = \\int_{0}^{Ut} g\\left(t-\\frac{x}{U}\\right)\\,dx + \\int_{Ut}^{L} c_0(x-Ut)\\,dx\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral using a change of variables.\nFor the first integral, let $s = t - x/U$. Then $ds = -dx/U$, implying $dx = -U\\,ds$. The limits of integration become $s=t$ for $x=0$, and $s=t - (Ut)/U = 0$ for $x=Ut$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{Ut} g\\left(t-\\frac{x}{U}\\right)\\,dx = \\int_{t}^{0} g(s)(-U\\,ds) = U \\int_{0}^{t} g(s)\\,ds\n$$\nFor the second integral, let $y = x - Ut$. Then $dy = dx$. The limits become $y=0$ for $x=Ut$, and $y=L-Ut$ for $x=L$.\n$$\n\\int_{Ut}^{L} c_0(x-Ut)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{L-Ut} c_0(y)\\,dy\n$$\nCombining these results gives the explicit expression for the total mass for $0 \\le t \\le L/U$:\n$$\nM(t) = U \\int_{0}^{t} g(s)\\,ds + \\int_{0}^{L-Ut} c_0(y)\\,dy\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Specialization for Given Data\nWe are given $c_{0}(x) = A\\,\\exp(-\\alpha x)$ and $g(t) = C\\,\\exp(-\\beta t)$. We substitute these into the integral expression for $M(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = U \\int_{0}^{t} C\\,\\exp(-\\beta s)\\,ds + \\int_{0}^{L-Ut} A\\,\\exp(-\\alpha y)\\,dy\n$$\nPerforming the integrations:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} C\\,\\exp(-\\beta s)\\,ds = C \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\exp(-\\beta s) \\right]_{0}^{t} = -\\frac{C}{\\beta}(\\exp(-\\beta t) - 1) = \\frac{C}{\\beta}(1-\\exp(-\\beta t))\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L-Ut} A\\,\\exp(-\\alpha y)\\,dy = A \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha y) \\right]_{0}^{L-Ut} = -\\frac{A}{\\alpha}(\\exp(-\\alpha(L-Ut)) - 1) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}(1-\\exp(-\\alpha(L-Ut)))\n$$\nCombining these, the symbolic expression for $M(t)$ is:\n$$\nM(t) = \\frac{UC}{\\beta}(1-\\exp(-\\beta t)) + \\frac{A}{\\alpha}(1-\\exp(-\\alpha(L-Ut)))\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical parameter values: $A=1.5$, $C=1.5$, $\\alpha=3$, $\\beta=2$, $U=0.4$, and $L=1$. The expression is valid for $0 \\le t \\le L/U = 1/0.4 = 2.5$.\nFirst, calculate the constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{UC}{\\beta} = \\frac{(0.4)(1.5)}{2} = \\frac{0.6}{2} = 0.3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{A}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $M(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = 0.3(1 - \\exp(-2t)) + 0.5(1 - \\exp(-3(1-0.4t)))\n$$\nExpanding and simplifying the expression:\n$$\nM(t) = 0.3 - 0.3\\exp(-2t) + 0.5 - 0.5\\exp(-3 + 1.2t)\n$$\n$$\nM(t) = 0.8 - 0.3\\exp(-2t) - 0.5\\exp(1.2t-3)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the total mass $M(t)$ in the specified time interval.",

            "problem": "A dilute solute diffuses in a quiescent liquid occupying the one-dimensional region $0 \\le x \\le L$ adjacent to a planar, catalytically active wall located at $x=0$. The solute has bulk concentration $c(x,t)$ and molecular diffusivity $D$, which can be taken as constant. There is no advection and no homogeneous (bulk) chemical reaction in the liquid. At the wall, the solute undergoes a first-order surface reaction with intrinsic surface rate constant $k_{s}$, consuming solute at a rate proportional to the wall concentration.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into three parts: first, the derivation of the boundary condition at the catalytic wall; second, the solution for the steady-state concentration profile; and third, the calculation of the steady-state flux into the wall.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Radiation Boundary Condition\n\nWe begin with the integral form of the species conservation law for a constant-volume system without homogeneous reaction:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{V} c \\, dV = -\\oint_{S} \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS $$\nwhere $c$ is the molar concentration of the solute, $V$ is the control volume, $S$ is the surface enclosing the volume, $\\mathbf{N}$ is the molar flux vector, and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the surface $S$.\n\nThe problem states there is no advection, so the molar flux $\\mathbf{N}$ is purely diffusive and is described by Fick's first law. For a one-dimensional system along the $x$-axis, the flux vector is:\n$$ \\mathbf{N} = N_x \\mathbf{i}_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i}_x $$\nwhere $D$ is the constant molecular diffusivity and $\\mathbf{i}_x$ is the unit vector in the positive $x$-direction.\n\nTo derive the boundary condition at the catalytic wall at $x=0$, we apply the conservation law to a \"pillbox\" control volume. A rigorous approach involves considering a thin control volume within the fluid domain, adjacent to the boundary, and then taking the limit as the thickness of this volume approaches zero. Let the control volume be a thin slab of cross-sectional area $A$ extending from $x=0$ to $x=\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive length. The liquid occupies the domain $x \\ge 0$.\n\nFor this control volume, the surface $S$ consists of three parts: a face at $x=0$, a face at $x=\\epsilon$, and the side walls. We assume no flux through the side walls. The outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is $-\\mathbf{i}_x$ at the face $x=0$ and $+\\mathbf{i}_x$ at the face $x=\\epsilon$.\n\nThe surface integral of the flux becomes:\n$$ \\oint_{S} \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{A_{\\epsilon}} (\\mathbf{N}|_{x=\\epsilon}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{i}_x) \\, dA + \\int_{A_0} (\\mathbf{N}|_{x=0}) \\cdot (-\\mathbf{i}_x) \\, dA $$\n$$ \\oint_{S} \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = (N_x|_{x=\\epsilon}) A - (N_x|_{x=0}) A $$\nHere, $N_x|_{x=0}$ represents the flux from the boundary surface *into* the fluid control volume. At this surface, there is a first-order reaction that consumes the solute. The rate of consumption per unit area is given as $k_s c(0,t)$. This consumption of solute at the wall constitutes a flux of solute *out of* the fluid. Therefore, the flux entering the fluid from the boundary at $x=0$ is the negative of the reaction rate.\n$$ N_x|_{x=0} = -k_s c(0,t) $$\nThe term $N_x|_{x=\\epsilon}$ is the flux within the fluid at position $x=\\epsilon$.\n\nThe conservation equation for our control volume is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} c(x,t) A \\, dx = - \\left[ (N_x|_{x=\\epsilon}) A - (N_x|_{x=0}) A \\right] $$\nDividing by the area $A$ and substituting the expression for $N_x|_{x=0}$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} c(x,t) \\, dx = - N_x|_{x=\\epsilon} + (-k_s c(0,t)) $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} c(x,t) \\, dx = -N_x|_{x=\\epsilon} - k_s c(0,t) $$\nNow, we take the limit as the thickness of the pillbox goes to zero, $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Assuming the concentration $c(x,t)$ is a continuous function, the integral on the left-hand side vanishes:\n$$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} c(x,t) \\, dx = 0 $$\nThe flux $N_x(x,t)$ is also assumed to be continuous for $x > 0$, so $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} N_x|_{x=\\epsilon} = N_x|_{x=0^+}$, which is the flux at the fluid side of the boundary. The equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = -N_x|_{x=0^+} - k_s c(0,t) \\implies N_x|_{x=0^+} = -k_s c(0,t) $$\nSubstituting Fick's law, $N_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, we obtain the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{x=0} = -k_s c(0,t) $$\n$$ D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{x=0} = k_s c(0,t) $$\nThis is the required partially absorbing or \"radiation\" boundary condition (more commonly known as a Robin boundary condition in this context).\n\n### Part 2: Steady-State Concentration Profile\n\nUnder steady conditions, all time derivatives are zero. The governing equation for the concentration in the bulk liquid ($0 < x < L$) is the steady, one-dimensional diffusion equation with no homogeneous reaction:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $D$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is obtained by integrating twice with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} = C_1 $$\n$$ c(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. These are determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the steady-state problem are:\n1. At $x=0$: $D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=0} = k_s c(0)$\n2. At $x=L$: $c(L) = c_L$\n\nApplying these to the general solution $c(x) = C_1 x + C_2$:\nFrom the solution, we have $\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_1$ and $c(0) = C_2$.\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$ D(C_1) = k_s(C_2) \\implies C_1 = \\frac{k_s}{D} C_2 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$ c(L) = C_1 L + C_2 = c_L $$\nNow we have a system of two algebraic equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$. Substitute the expression for $C_1$ into the second equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_s}{D} C_2\\right) L + C_2 = c_L $$\n$$ C_2 \\left( \\frac{k_s L}{D} + 1 \\right) = c_L $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{c_L}{1 + \\frac{k_s L}{D}} = \\frac{D c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\nNow solve for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{k_s}{D} C_2 = \\frac{k_s}{D} \\left( \\frac{D c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) = \\frac{k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\nSubstituting the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution gives the steady-state concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = \\left( \\frac{k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) x + \\left( \\frac{D c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) $$\n$$ c(x) = \\frac{c_L (k_s x + D)}{D + k_s L} $$\n\n### Part 3: Steady Molar Flux into the Wall\n\nThe steady molar flux of the solute is given by $N_x = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$. Since $\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_1$ is constant, the flux $N_x$ is independent of position $x$, as expected for a steady 1D diffusion problem without bulk reaction.\n$$ N_x = -D C_1 = -D \\left( \\frac{k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) = -\\frac{D k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\nThe question asks for the \"molar flux of solute *into* the wall\". The wall is at $x=0$, and the liquid is in $x>0$. Therefore, the direction \"into the wall\" corresponds to the $-x$ direction. The scalar flux into the wall, let's call it $J_{wall}$, is the projection of the flux vector $\\mathbf{N} = N_x \\mathbf{i}_x$ onto the inward normal vector $(-\\mathbf{i}_x)$:\n$$ J_{wall} = \\mathbf{N}|_{x=0} \\cdot (-\\mathbf{i}_x) = (N_x \\mathbf{i}_x) \\cdot (-\\mathbf{i}_x) = -N_x $$\n$$ J_{wall} = - \\left( -\\frac{D k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) = \\frac{D k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\nAlternatively, at steady state, the flux of solute to the wall must equal the rate of consumption by the surface reaction. The rate of consumption is $k_s c(0)$.\n$$ c(0) = C_2 = \\frac{D c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\n$$ J_{wall} = k_s c(0) = k_s \\left( \\frac{D c_L}{D + k_s L} \\right) = \\frac{D k_s c_L}{D + k_s L} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The expression is positive, indicating a net flux of solute from the liquid into the wall, consistent with consumption. The units are $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data for the derivation and calculation are provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested: derivation of the weak form, derivation of the element matrix expressions, and evaluation of a specific matrix entry.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Weak Form**\n\nThe local conservation law for a chemical species at steady state with no reaction is given by $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J} = 0$, where $\\boldsymbol{J}$ is the total flux vector. The problem states that the flux is composed of diffusive and advective components: $\\boldsymbol{J} = -D \\nabla c + \\boldsymbol{v}c$. Here, $c$ is the species concentration, $D$ is the constant diffusivity, and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is the constant velocity field.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{J}$ into the conservation law gives the governing partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla c + \\boldsymbol{v}c) = 0 $$\nSince $D$ is a constant, the diffusive term is $-D \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla c) = -D \\nabla^2 c$. Since $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is a constant vector field, the advective term can be expanded using the product rule: $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{v}c) = c(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}) + \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c$. For a constant vector field $\\boldsymbol{v}$, its divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$ is $0$. Thus, the governing PDE simplifies to:\n$$ -D \\nabla^2 c + \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c = 0 \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega $$\nTo derive the weak form, we multiply the PDE by an arbitrary test function $w$ from a suitable function space (e.g., $H^1_0(\\Omega)$) and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} w (-D \\nabla^2 c + \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega = 0 $$\nWe separate the terms:\n$$ -\\int_{\\Omega} w D \\nabla^2 c \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} w (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega = 0 $$\nTo reduce the order of the highest derivative, we apply integration by parts (Green's first identity) to the diffusion term. The identity states $\\int_{\\Omega} u \\nabla^2 v \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u (\\nabla v \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, d\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega$. Let $u=w$ and $v=c$:\n$$ -D \\left( \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} w(\\nabla c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, d\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla c \\, d\\Omega \\right) + \\int_{\\Omega} w (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega = 0 $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} D (\\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} w (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} w D (\\nabla c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, d\\Gamma $$\nThe weak form of the boundary value problem consists of finding a function $c$ that satisfies this equation for all test functions $w$. The right-hand side incorporates the boundary conditions. The left-hand side defines the bilinear form $a(w,c)$. This form can be split into two contributions:\n1.  **Diffusion Bilinear Form**: $a_D(w, c) = \\int_{\\Omega} D (\\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega$\n2.  **Advection Bilinear Form**: $a_{adv}(w, c) = \\int_{\\Omega} w (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla c) \\, d\\Omega$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Element Matrices**\n\nIn the Galerkin finite element method, the domain $\\Omega$ is discretized into elements $\\Omega_e$. Within each element, the concentration field $c$ is approximated by a linear combination of nodal values $c_j$ and shape functions $N_j(\\boldsymbol{x})$:\n$$ c(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\approx c^h_e(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} c_j N_j(\\boldsymbol{x}) $$\nThe test functions $w$ are chosen from the same set of functions, i.e., $w = N_i(\\boldsymbol{x})$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The element matrices are obtained by substituting these approximations into the bilinear forms and integrating over a single element $\\Omega_e$.\n\nThe element diffusion matrix entry $(i, j)$ is:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{diff}}_{e\\,(i,j)} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} D (\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j) \\, d\\Omega_e $$\nThe element advection matrix entry $(i, j)$ is:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(i,j)} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_j) \\, d\\Omega_e $$\n\nFor a linear triangular element, the shape functions $N_j(x,y) = a_j + b_j x + d_j y$ are linear. Their gradients, $\\nabla N_j = (b_j, d_j)^T$, are constant vectors over the element. Since $D$ is also constant, the integrand of the diffusion term is constant:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{diff}}_{e\\,(i,j)} = D (\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j) \\int_{\\Omega_e} d\\Omega_e = D A_e (\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j) $$\nwhere $A_e$ is the area of the element.\n\nFor the advection matrix, the term $\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_j$ is a constant scalar value because both $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\nabla N_j$ are constant over the element. Therefore, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(i,j)} = (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_j) \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i \\, d\\Omega_e $$\nThe integral of a linear shape function $N_i$ over the area of a triangular element is a standard result. The average value of a linear function over a triangle is its value at the centroid. For a barycentric coordinate system, the shape functions $N_i$ are the barycentric coordinates. The centroid has coordinates $(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$. Thus, the value of any shape function $N_i$ at the centroid is $1/3$. The integral is the area multiplied by the average value:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i \\, d\\Omega_e = A_e \\times (\\text{average value of } N_i) = A_e \\times \\frac{1}{3} $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the advection matrix gives:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(i,j)} = \\frac{A_e}{3} (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_j) $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(1,3)}$**\n\nWe need to compute the specific element matrix entry $K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(1,3)}$ for the given element and data. The formula is:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(1,3)} = \\frac{A_e}{3} (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_3) $$\nThe given data are:\n- Element vertices: $\\boldsymbol{x}_{1} = (0,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{2} = (2,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{3} = (0,3)$.\n- Velocity field: $\\boldsymbol{v} = (0.6, -0.3)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of the element, $A_e$. The element is a right-angled triangle with base $2$ and height $3$.\n$$ A_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 3 = 3 $$\n\nNext, we determine the gradient of the shape function $N_3$. The shape function $N_3(x,y)$ is linear and defined by the conditions $N_3(\\boldsymbol{x}_1)=0$, $N_3(\\boldsymbol{x}_2)=0$, and $N_3(\\boldsymbol{x}_3)=1$. Let $N_3(x,y) = a_3 + b_3 x + d_3 y$.\n- $N_3(0,0) = a_3 = 0$\n- $N_3(2,0) = a_3 + 2b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 0$\n- $N_3(0,3) = a_3 + 3d_3 = 1 \\implies d_3 = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo, $N_3(x,y) = \\frac{1}{3}y$. The gradient is therefore:\n$$ \\nabla N_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we compute the dot product $\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_3$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ -0.3 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = (0.6)(0) + (-0.3)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 0 - 0.1 = -0.1 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute these values into the formula for the matrix entry:\n$$ K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(1,3)} = \\frac{A_e}{3} (\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla N_3) = \\frac{3}{3}(-0.1) = 1 \\times (-0.1) = -0.1 $$\nThe units of the element matrix entries are length squared per time, which in this case are $\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$. The numerical value of the advection element matrix entry $K^{\\mathrm{adv}}_{e\\,(1,3)}$ is $-0.1$.",
