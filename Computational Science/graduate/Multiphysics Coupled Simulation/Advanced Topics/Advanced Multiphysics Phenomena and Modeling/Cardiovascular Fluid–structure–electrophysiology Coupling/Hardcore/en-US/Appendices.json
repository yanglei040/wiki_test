A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe propagation of the transmembrane potential $V$ in cardiac tissue can be described by a reaction-diffusion equation. In its simplified, monodomain form, it is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla V) - I_{\\text{ion}}(V) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is the diffusion tensor and $I_{\\text{ion}}(V)$ represents the ionic currents (the reaction term), scaled by membrane capacitance which is omitted here for simplicity in scaling.\n\n**Leading-Order Scaling for Wavefront Speed**\n\nThe problem asks for a dimensional analysis based on the balance between temporal change and diffusion during the steep upstroke of the action potential. We consider a planar wave traveling with speed $c$. Let the characteristic length scale of the wavefront's leading edge be $L$. The temporal rate of change during the upstroke, which occurs over a time $\\tau_{\\text{up}}$, scales as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta V$ is the amplitude of the action potential. The diffusive term scales as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla V) \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta V}{L^2} $$\nwhere $D$ is a characteristic diffusion coefficient. A point on the wavefront travels a distance $L$ in a time related to the upstroke phase, which we can approximate as $\\tau_{\\text{up}}$. Therefore, the speed $c$ relates to these scales as $c \\sim L/\\tau_{\\text{up}}$, which implies $L \\sim c \\tau_{\\text{up}}$.\n\nBy balancing the temporal and diffusive terms as instructed, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}} \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta V}{L^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}} \\sim \\frac{D}{L^2} $$\nSubstituting $L \\sim c \\tau_{\\text{up}}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}} \\sim \\frac{D}{(c \\tau_{\\text{up}})^2} $$\n$$ c^2 \\tau_{\\text{up}}^2 \\sim D \\tau_{\\text{up}} $$\n$$ c^2 \\sim \\frac{D}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}} $$\nThis gives the leading-order scaling for the conduction speed:\n$$ c \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}}} $$\n\n**1) Conduction Speed Along Fibers ($c_{\\ell}$)**\n\nFor a one-dimensional cable aligned with the myocardial fibers, the relevant diffusion coefficient is the longitudinal one, $D = D_{\\ell}$.\n$$ c_{\\ell} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\ell}}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}}} $$\nGiven $D_{\\ell} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{up}} = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{ms}$:\n$$ c_{\\ell} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}}{0.8\\ \\mathrm{ms}}} = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}^2} \\approx 0.03873\\ \\mathrm{cm/ms} $$\nTo convert to $\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{ms}} = \\frac{10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 10\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} $$\n$$ c_{\\ell} \\approx 0.03873 \\times 10\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = 0.3873\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**2) Conduction Speed at an Angle $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$**\n\nIn a two-dimensional slab, the diffusion tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ in the local fiber coordinate system (where the $x_1$-axis is along the fibers) is:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} D_{\\ell} & 0 \\\\ 0 & D_{t} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor a planar wave propagating in a direction defined by the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$, forming an angle $\\theta$ with the fiber direction, we have:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\\text{eff}}(\\theta)$ in the direction of propagation is given by the projection $\\mathbf{n}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{n}$:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} D_{\\ell} & 0 \\\\ 0 & D_{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} D_{\\ell}\\cos\\theta \\\\ D_{t}\\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}(\\theta) = D_{\\ell}\\cos^2\\theta + D_{t}\\sin^2\\theta $$\nThis is the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient.\n\nFor $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, we have $\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\sin^2(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nUsing the given data, $D_{\\ell} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}$ and $D_{t} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}$:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}(30^{\\circ}) = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3})\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + (3.0 \\times 10^{-4})\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}(30^{\\circ}) = 0.9 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.75 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.9 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.075 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}(30^{\\circ}) = 0.975 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe resulting speed $c(30^{\\circ})$ is:\n$$ c(30^{\\circ}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\text{eff}}(30^{\\circ})}{\\tau_{\\text{up}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.975 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}}{0.8\\ \\mathrm{ms}}} = \\sqrt{1.21875 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{ms}^2} $$\n$$ c(30^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.0349106\\ \\mathrm{cm/ms} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ c(30^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.0349106 \\times 10\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = 0.349106\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $c(30^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.349\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n**Qualitative Explanation of Anisotropy Effects**\n\nAnisotropic conductivity, where $D_{\\ell} > D_{t}$, has profound effects on wavefront propagation.\n- **Effective Diffusion and Speed**: The effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{eff}}(\\theta) = D_{\\ell}\\cos^2\\theta + D_{t}\\sin^2\\theta$, is not constant but varies with the angle $\\theta$ of propagation relative to the fiber direction. Since $D_{\\ell}$ is the largest coefficient, $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is maximal when $\\cos^2\\theta = 1$ (i.e., $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$ or $180^{\\circ}$), corresponding to propagation purely along the fibers. It is minimal when $\\sin^2\\theta = 1$ (i.e., $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$ or $270^{\\circ}$), for propagation transverse to the fibers. As the speed scales with $\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}}$, the propagation speed is fastest along the fibers and slowest transverse to them.\n- **Wavefront Curvature**: In an isotropic medium ($D_{\\ell} = D_{t}$), the diffusion operator is the Laplacian, $D\\nabla^2 V$. Diffusive current flows perpendicular to the wavefront (i.e., along the gradient $\\nabla V$). This leads to a symmetric relationship between curvature and speed (e.g., a point stimulus generates a circular wave). In an anisotropic medium, the diffusion operator is $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{D} \\nabla V)$. The diffusive current flux is $\\mathbf{j} = -\\mathbf{D}\\nabla V$. Because $\\mathbf{D}$ is a tensor, the flux vector $\\mathbf{j}$ is generally not parallel to the potential gradient $\\nabla V$. Instead, it is rotated toward the direction of higher diffusivity (the fiber axis). This means that even if a wavefront has a certain curvature, the diffusive currents that smooth it are skewed. A consequence is that a wavefront initiated from a point stimulus will not be circular; it will be elongated in the fiber direction, forming an elliptical shape, as propagation is faster along this axis. The interplay between local wavefront curvature and local speed becomes dependent on the orientation of the wavefront segment with respect to the fibers, breaking the simple isotropic relationship.",

            "problem": "A simplified but mechanistically consistent left-ventricular model is considered to capture cardiovascular fluid–structure–electrophysiology coupling during one cardiac cycle. The left-ventricular pressure obeys the time-varying elastance relation $P(t) = E(t)\\,\\big(V(t)-V_{0}\\big)$, where $P(t)$ is pressure, $V(t)$ is chamber volume, $V_{0}$ is the volume-axis intercept, and $E(t)$ is the instantaneous elastance. The structural (myocardial) state is driven by the electrophysiology through the active myocyte tension $T_{\\mathrm{act}}(t)$ via the linear constitutive coupling $E(t) = E_{\\min} + \\gamma\\,T_{\\mathrm{act}}(t)$. Assume that $T_{\\mathrm{act}}(t)$ rises from $0$ to its peak $T_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\max}$ during systolic activation and then falls back to $0$ during relaxation, so that $E(t)$ rises from $E_{\\min}$ to $E_{\\max} = E_{\\min} + \\gamma\\,T_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\max}$ and then falls back to $E_{\\min}$.\n\nHemodynamics are modeled with ideal diodes for the mitral and aortic valves, negligible valvular resistance, and large atrial and aortic compliances that maintain constant upstream and downstream pressures: the left atrium is a reservoir at pressure $P_{v}$ (preload) and the proximal aorta is a reservoir at pressure $P_{a}$ (afterload). With negligible resistance, when a valve is open the chamber pressure equals the connected reservoir pressure. The mitral valve opens when $P(t) \\le P_{v}$ and the aortic valve opens when $P(t) \\ge P_{a}$. Both valves are closed otherwise. Neglect inertial and viscous effects in the blood columns.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the definitions of pressure, volume, and work in continuum mechanics, and treating $T_{\\mathrm{act}}(t)$ as the driver of $E(t)$, derive the piecewise path of the pressure–volume loop over one beat and compute the stroke work (the enclosed area) for the following three cases:\n- Baseline: $E_{\\min} = 0.08$ mmHg/mL, $\\gamma = 1.74$ mmHg/(mL $\\cdot$ unit tension), $T_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\max} = 1$ (dimensionless), $P_{v} = 10$ mmHg, $P_{a} = 100$ mmHg.\n- Increased preload: same parameters as baseline except $P_{v} = 12$ mmHg.\n- Increased afterload: same parameters as baseline except $P_{a} = 120$ mmHg.\n\nAssume the activation is sufficiently slow that the transitions between valve states occur quasi-statically as $E(t)$ rises and falls, and assume the cycle is periodic so that the end-diastolic and end-systolic states repeat each beat. You may take $V_{0}$ as a constant that does not need to be specified numerically.\n\nReport your three stroke-work values as a single row vector in the order (baseline, increased preload, increased afterload). Express the final results in mmHg·mL, and round each entry to four significant figures.",

Increased preload: Same as baseline, but $P_{v} = 12$ mmHg.\n    3.  Increased afterload: Same as baseline, but $P_{a} = 120$ mmHg.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is based on the standard and well-established time-varying elastance framework of cardiovascular mechanics, a simplification but not a violation of principles. The parameters are defined, the goals are clear, and the assumptions (e.g., quasi-static behavior, ideal valves) render the problem well-posed and algebraically solvable. The use of $V_0$ as an unspecified constant is acceptable as it will be shown to cancel out.\n\nThe pressure-volume (PV) loop describes the work done by the ventricle in one cardiac cycle. The problem's assumptions simplify the four phases of the cardiac cycle into four distinct segments in the PV plane:\n1.  **Isovolumetric Contraction**: Both valves are closed. Volume is constant at the end-diastolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ED}}$. Pressure rises from the preload $P_{v}$ to the afterload $P_{a}$. This is a vertical line segment in the PV plane.\n2.  **Ejection**: The aortic valve opens. Pressure is held constant at the afterload, $P_{a}$. Volume decreases from $V_{\\mathrm{ED}}$ to the end-systolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$. This is a horizontal line segment.\n3.  **Isovolumetric Relaxation**: Both valves are closed. Volume is constant at $V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$. Pressure falls from $P_{a}$ to $P_{v}$. This is a vertical line segment.\n4.  **Filling**: The mitral valve opens. Pressure is held constant at the preload, $P_{v}$. Volume increases from $V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$ back to $V_{\\mathrm{ED}}$. This is a horizontal line segment.\n\nThese four segments form a rectangle in the PV plane, with vertices at $(V_{\\mathrm{ED}}, P_{v})$, $(V_{\\mathrm{ED}}, P_{a})$, $(V_{\\mathrm{ES}}, P_{a})$, and $(V_{\\mathrm{ES}}, P_{v})$. The stroke work, $W_{\\mathrm{stroke}}$, is the area enclosed by this loop.\n\nThe volumes $V_{\\mathrm{ED}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$ are determined by the state of the ventricle at the boundaries of the filling and ejection phases.\nThe end of the filling phase (end-diastole) occurs when the ventricle is maximally relaxed, so its elastance is at its minimum, $E_{\\min}$. At this point, the pressure is the preload, $P_v$. Using the pressure-volume relation:\n$$P_{v} = E_{\\min}(V_{\\mathrm{ED}} - V_{0})$$\nSolving for the end-diastolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ED}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ED}} = V_{0} + \\frac{P_{v}}{E_{\\min}}$$\n\nThe end of the ejection phase (end-systole) occurs when the ventricle is maximally contracted, so its elastance is at its peak, $E_{\\max}$. At this point, the pressure is the afterload, $P_a$. Using the pressure-volume relation:\n$$P_{a} = E_{\\max}(V_{\\mathrm{ES}} - V_{0})$$\nSolving for the end-systolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ES}} = V_{0} + \\frac{P_{a}}{E_{\\max}}$$\nNote that for ejection to occur, it must be that $V_{\\mathrm{ED}} > V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$, which implies $\\frac{P_{v}}{E_{\\min}} > \\frac{P_{a}}{E_{\\max}}$.\n\nThe stroke work is the area of the PV rectangle, which is the product of the change in pressure and the change in volume (stroke volume, $SV$).\n$$W_{\\mathrm{stroke}} = (P_{a} - P_{v}) \\times (V_{\\mathrm{ED}} - V_{\\mathrm{ES}})$$\nThe stroke volume, $SV = V_{\\mathrm{ED}} - V_{\\mathrm{ES}}$, can be computed by substituting the expressions for the volumes:\n$$SV = \\left(V_{0} + \\frac{P_{v}}{E_{\\min}}\\right) - \\left(V_{0} + \\frac{P_{a}}{E_{\\max}}\\right) = \\frac{P_{v}}{E_{\\min}} - \\frac{P_{a}}{E_{\\max}}$$\nThe unknown constant $V_{0}$ cancels out, as anticipated.\nThe final expression for stroke work is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{stroke}} = (P_{a} - P_{v})\\left(\\frac{P_{v}}{E_{\\min}} - \\frac{P_{a}}{E_{\\max}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical values for the three requested cases.

Let $V_j^n$ denote the numerical approximation of the potential $V(x, t)$ at grid point $x_j = j h$ and time $t_n = n \\Delta t$.\n\nThe time derivative is approximated using the forward Euler method (first-order explicit):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{V_j^{n+1} - V_j^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe spatial second derivative is approximated using a second-order central difference scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx \\frac{V_{j+1}^n - 2V_j^n + V_{j-1}^n}{h^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the diffusion equation yields the explicit finite difference scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{V_j^{n+1} - V_j^n}{\\Delta t} = D\\,\\frac{V_{j+1}^n - 2V_j^n + V_{j-1}^n}{h^2}\n$$\nRearranging for $V_j^{n+1}$, we obtain the update rule:\n$$\nV_j^{n+1} = V_j^n + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\left( V_{j+1}^n - 2V_j^n + V_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nTo perform von Neumann stability analysis, we consider a single Fourier mode of the solution for the error, $E_j^n$, at grid point $j$ and time level $n$:\n$$\nE_j^n = G(k)^n e^{i k j h}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wavenumber, $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, and $G(k)$ is the amplification factor for that mode. For the scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for all possible wavenumbers, i.e., $|G(k)| \\le 1$.\n\nSubstituting the Fourier mode into the difference equation (which the error must also satisfy):\n$$\nG^{n+1} e^{i k j h} = G^n e^{i k j h} + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\left( G^n e^{i k (j+1) h} - 2G^n e^{i k j h} + G^n e^{i k (j-1) h} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $G^n e^{i k j h}$ gives the amplification factor $G(k)$:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\left( e^{i k h} - 2 + e^{-i k h} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\left( 2\\cos(kh) - 2 \\right) = 1 - \\frac{2 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\left( 1 - \\cos(kh) \\right)\n$$\nFurther simplification using the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe stability condition $|G(k)| \\le 1$ translates to $-1 \\le G(k) \\le 1$.\nThe right-hand inequality, $G(k) \\le 1$, is always satisfied because $D$, $\\Delta t$, and $h^2$ are positive, so the term being subtracted from $1$ is always non-negative.\nThe left-hand inequality provides the stability constraint:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - \\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{4 D \\Delta t}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right) \\le 2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2 h^2}{4 D \\sin^2(kh/2)} = \\frac{h^2}{2 D \\sin^2(kh/2)}\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all wavenumbers $k$. The most stringent constraint occurs when the denominator is minimized, which corresponds to maximizing the $\\sin^2(kh/2)$ term. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(kh/2)$ is $1$. This leads to the sufficient condition for stability:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{h^2}{2D}\n$$\nLet this bound be denoted $\\Delta t_{\\text{diff}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Sampling-based Restriction for the Action Potential Upstroke**\n\nThe problem requires that the action potential upstroke, which has a duration of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}}$, be resolved by at least $N$ time steps. If the time step size is $\\Delta t$, the number of steps covering this duration is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}} / \\Delta t$. The constraint is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}}}{\\Delta t} \\ge N\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$, we find the upper bound based on temporal resolution:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}}}{N}\n$$\nLet this bound be denoted $\\Delta t_{\\text{samp}}$.\n\n**Part 3: Combined Constraint and Final Calculation**\n\nTo ensure both numerical stability and adequate temporal resolution, the chosen time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy both derived inequalities:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\text{diff}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\text{samp}}\n$$\nThis means that $\\Delta t$ must be no larger than the minimum of the two bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\min\\left( \\frac{h^2}{2D}, \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}}}{N} \\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values. It is crucial to work with consistent units, so we convert all parameters to SI units (meters, seconds).\nGiven:\n- $h = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $D = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $N = 12$ (dimensionless)\n\nFirst, calculate the diffusion stability bound, $\\Delta t_{\\text{diff}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{h^2}{2D} = \\frac{\\left(1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\right)^2}{2 \\left(1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{2.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.9375 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nIn milliseconds, this is $\\Delta t_{\\text{diff}} = 0.09375\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNext, calculate the sampling resolution bound, $\\Delta t_{\\text{samp}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{samp}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{up}}}{N} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{12} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.6666... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nIn milliseconds, this is $\\Delta t_{\\text{samp}} \\approx 0.06666...\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe overall constraint on $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\min(0.09375\\,\\mathrm{ms}, 0.06666...\\,\\mathrm{ms})\n$$\nThe more restrictive (smaller) of the two bounds is the one imposed by the upstroke resolution requirement: $\\Delta t \\le 0.06666...\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe problem asks to choose a single $\\Delta t$ that satisfies both conditions. The most appropriate choice is the largest possible value, which is the upper limit itself.\n$$\n\\Delta t = 0.06666...\\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.06667\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThus, the chosen time step is $\\Delta t = 0.06667\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This choice satisfies the diffusion stability limit ($0.06667 \\le 0.09375$) and the upstroke resolution limit ($0.06667 \\le 0.06666...$ is satisfied by the unrounded value).",
