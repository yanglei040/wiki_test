It is a self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed question in numerical analysis. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested: derivation of the weight, determination of the degree of exactness, and derivation of the leading error term.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Weight ($w$)**\n\nThe quadrature rule is defined as $Q[f] = w\\,f(x_{1})$ with the node at the midpoint $x_{1} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. A Newton-Cotes rule is constructed to be exact for polynomials up to the highest possible degree. To determine the weight $w$, we enforce the condition of exactness for the simplest polynomial, $f(x)=1$ (a polynomial of degree $0$).\n\nThe exact integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} 1 \\,dx = [x]_{a}^{b} = b-a\n$$\nThe quadrature rule gives:\n$$\nQ[1] = w \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) = w \\cdot 1 = w\n$$\nFor the rule to be exact, the integral must equal the quadrature approximation:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} 1 \\,dx = Q[1] \\implies b-a = w\n$$\nThus, the weight is $w=b-a$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Degree of Exactness ($r$)**\n\nThe degree of exactness, $r$, is the highest integer such that the rule is exact for all polynomials of degree less than or equal to $r$. We have already shown it is exact for degree $0$.\n\nLet's test for a polynomial of degree $1$, $f(x)=x$.\nThe exact integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} x \\,dx = \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_{a}^{b} = \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{2} = \\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2}\n$$\nThe quadrature rule, with $w=b-a$ and $x_{1}=(a+b)/2$, gives:\n$$\nQ[x] = (b-a) \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) = (b-a) \\cdot \\frac{a+b}{2}\n$$\nSince the integral and the quadrature result are identical, the rule is exact for $f(x)=x$. By linearity, it is exact for any polynomial of degree $1$, so $r \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, let's test for a polynomial of degree $2$, $f(x)=x^2$.\nThe exact integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\,dx = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{a}^{b} = \\frac{b^3 - a^3}{3} = \\frac{(b-a)(a^2+ab+b^2)}{3}\n$$\nThe quadrature rule gives:\n$$\nQ[x^2] = (b-a) \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) = (b-a) \\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(b-a)(a^2+2ab+b^2)}{4}\n$$\nFor the rule to be exact for $f(x)=x^2$, we would require:\n$$\n\\frac{(b-a)(a^2+ab+b^2)}{3} = \\frac{(b-a)(a^2+2ab+b^2)}{4}\n$$\nAssuming $b \\neq a$, we can divide by $(b-a)$:\n$$\n4(a^2+ab+b^2) = 3(a^2+2ab+b^2)\n$$\n$$\n4a^2+4ab+4b^2 = 3a^2+6ab+3b^2\n$$\n$$\na^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 0 \\implies (a-b)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equality holds only if $a=b$, which corresponds to a trivial integration interval. For any non-trivial interval ($a < b$), the rule is not exact for $f(x)=x^2$.\nTherefore, the highest degree of polynomial for which the rule is exact is $1$. The degree of exactness is $r=1$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Leading Error Term ($E_{\\text{lead}}[f]$)**\n\nThe quadrature error is defined as $E[f] = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx - Q[f]$. The problem requires its derivation using the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ about the midpoint $x_{1} = (a+b)/2$. Since $f \\in C^4[a,b]$, we can write the expansion:\n$$\nf(x) = f(x_{1}) + f'(x_{1})(x-x_{1}) + \\frac{f''(x_{1})}{2!}(x-x_{1})^2 + \\frac{f'''(x_{1})}{3!}(x-x_{1})^3 + \\dots\n$$\nWe integrate this series over the interval $[a, b]$:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left( f(x_{1}) + f'(x_{1})(x-x_{1}) + \\frac{f''(x_{1})}{2}(x-x_{1})^2 + \\dots \\right) dx\n$$\nLet's integrate term by term. We introduce $h = (b-a)/2$, which means $a = x_{1}-h$ and $b=x_{1}+h$.\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x_{1}) \\,dx = f(x_{1})[x]_{a}^{b} = f(x_{1})(b-a)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f'(x_{1})(x-x_{1}) \\,dx = f'(x_{1})\\left[\\frac{(x-x_{1})^2}{2}\\right]_{x_{1}-h}^{x_{1}+h} = f'(x_{1})\\left(\\frac{h^2}{2} - \\frac{(-h)^2}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{f''(x_{1})}{2}(x-x_{1})^2 \\,dx = \\frac{f''(x_{1})}{2}\\left[\\frac{(x-x_{1})^3}{3}\\right]_{x_{1}-h}^{x_{1}+h} = \\frac{f''(x_{1})}{6}(h^3 - (-h)^3) = \\frac{2h^3 f''(x_{1})}{6} = \\frac{h^3 f''(x_{1})}{3}\n$$\nAll integrals of odd powers of $(x-x_{1})$ over the symmetric interval $[x_{1}-h, x_{1}+h]$ are zero. Thus, the term with $f'''(x_1)$ vanishes.\nThe integral of $f(x)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = f(x_{1})(b-a) + \\frac{h^3}{3}f''(x_{1}) + O(h^5)\n$$\nThe quadrature rule is $Q[f] = w f(x_{1}) = (b-a)f(x_{1})$.\nThe error is:\n$$\nE[f] = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx - Q[f] = \\left( (b-a)f(x_{1}) + \\frac{h^3}{3}f''(x_{1}) + \\dots \\right) - (b-a)f(x_{1}) = \\frac{h^3}{3}f''(x_{1}) + \\dots\n$$\nThe leading term of the error is the first non-zero term in this expansion:\n$$\nE_{\\text{lead}}[f] = \\frac{h^3}{3}f''(x_{1})\n$$\nSubstituting $h=\\frac{b-a}{2}$ and $x_{1}=\\frac{a+b}{2}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{lead}}[f] = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{b-a}{2}\\right)^3 f''\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(b-a)^3}{24}f''\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe required quantities are:\n- Weight $w = b-a$.\n- Degree of exactness $r = 1$.\n- Leading error term $E_{\\text{lead}}[f] = \\frac{(b-a)^3}{24}f''\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThese are combined into the specified row matrix for the final answer.",

No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an affine transformation to map a reference interval for numerical quadrature to a target interval, and the subsequent transformation of the integral and its quadrature approximation.\n\nFirst, we must find the unique affine transformation $x = \\varphi(t)$ that maps the reference interval $[a,b]$ onto the target interval $[\\alpha,\\beta]$. An affine transformation in one dimension is a linear function of the form:\n$$\n\\varphi(t) = mt + c\n$$\nwhere $m$ and $c$ are constants. The condition that this transformation maps $[a,b]$ to $[\\alpha,\\beta]$ implies a mapping of the endpoints. We assume an orientation-preserving mapping, such that $\\varphi(a)=\\alpha$ and $\\varphi(b)=\\beta$. This provides a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns $m$ and $c$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nma + c = \\alpha \\\\\nmb + c = \\beta\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo solve for $m$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$\nm(b - a) = \\beta - \\alpha\n$$\nAssuming $a \\neq b$, which is a necessary condition for a non-degenerate interval, we can solve for $m$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\n$$\nThis constant $m$ is the slope of the affine map. To find the intercept $c$, we substitute the expression for $m$ back into the first equation:\n$$\nc = \\alpha - ma = \\alpha - \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) a\n$$\nBy placing the terms over a common denominator, we get:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\alpha(b - a) - a(\\beta - \\alpha)}{b - a} = \\frac{\\alpha b - \\alpha a - a \\beta + a \\alpha}{b - a} = \\frac{\\alpha b - a \\beta}{b - a}\n$$\nTherefore, the unique affine transformation is:\n$$\nx = \\varphi(t) = \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) t + \\frac{\\alpha b - a \\beta}{b - a}\n$$\nThis transformation is unique because the system of linear equations for $m$ and $c$ has a unique solution when $b-a \\neq 0$.\n\nNext, we apply the change-of-variables theorem for one-dimensional integrals. The theorem states that if $x = \\varphi(t)$, then $dx = \\varphi'(t) \\, dt$. The integral of a function $f(x)$ over $[\\alpha,\\beta]$ can be transformed into an integral over $[a,b]$ as follows:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{a}^{b} f(\\varphi(t)) \\varphi'(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe term $\\varphi'(t)$ is the Jacobian of the transformation.

Substituting this into the transformed integral expression, we make the Jacobian factor explicit:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{a}^{b} f(\\varphi(t)) \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nNow, we consider the quadrature rule provided for the reference interval $[a,b]$.

The integrand function on the reference interval is $g(t) = f(\\varphi(t)) \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right)$.\nApplying the quadrature rule to this $g(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(\\varphi(t)) \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) \\, dt \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\left[ f(\\varphi(t_i)) \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince the Jacobian factor $\\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right)$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha}{b - a}\\right) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\, f(\\varphi(t_i))\n$$\nThis expression shows how the given quadrature rule on $[a,b]$ induces an approximation for the integral on $[\\alpha,\\beta]$.

These can be chosen to make the rule exact for all polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$. The problem demands exactness for polynomials of degree up to $5$. Therefore, we must have $2n-1 \\geq 5$, which implies $2n \\geq 6$, so the minimum number of nodes is $n=3$. We will construct a $3$-point rule.\n\nThe rule must be exact for $f(x) = x^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. This gives the system of equations:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} W_i x_i^k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^2) x^k \\, dx\n$$\nwhere the right-hand side is the $k$-th moment of the Gaussian weight function, $M_k$.\n\nThe weight function $w(x) = \\exp(-x^2)$ is an even function, and the integration interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is symmetric about $x=0$. For a Gaussian quadrature rule, this symmetry implies that the nodes must be symmetric about the origin and the weights of symmetric nodes must be equal. For $n=3$, this means one node must be at the center, $x_2=0$, and the other two must be opposites, $x_1 = -x_0$ and $x_3 = x_0$ for some $x_0 > 0$. The corresponding weights must be $W_1 = W_3$.

The three nodes are $x_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$, $x_2=0$, and $x_3=\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nSubstitute $x_0^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$ into equation (2):\n$$\n2W_A \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies 3W_A = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies W_A = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}\n$$\nThis gives the outer weights: $W_1 = W_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}$.\n\nSubstitute $W_A = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}$ into equation (1):\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}\\right) + W_B = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3} + W_B = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\implies W_B = \\sqrt{\\pi} - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3}\n$$\nThis gives the central weight: $W_2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3}$.\n\nThe constructed $3$-point Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule is:\nNodes: $x_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$\nWeights: $W_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}$, $W_2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3}$, $W_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}$\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the integral $I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^{2}) x^{4} dx$.\nIn this case, the function $f(x)$ is $x^4$. The degree of this polynomial is $4$. Since our rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to $5$, the value given by the quadrature rule will be the exact value of the integral.\n\nApplying the rule:\n$$\nI = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} W_i f(x_i) = W_1 f(x_1) + W_2 f(x_2) + W_3 f(x_3)\n$$\nThe function values at the nodes are:\n$f(x_1) = f(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}) = \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$\n$f(x_2) = f(0) = 0^4 = 0$\n$f(x_3) = f(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$\n\nSubstituting these values and the weights into the quadrature sum:\n$$\nI = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6} \\cdot \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{\\pi}}{12} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4}\n$$\nThis result is identical to the moment $M_4$ we calculated analytically, which serves as a verification of our derived rule. The problem asks for the value obtained by applying the rule, which is this exact value.",
