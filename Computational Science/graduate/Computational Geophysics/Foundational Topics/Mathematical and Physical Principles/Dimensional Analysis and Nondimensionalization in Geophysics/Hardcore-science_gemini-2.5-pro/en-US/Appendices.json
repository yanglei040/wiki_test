            "problem": "In computational geophysics, dimensional analysis is used to reduce the complexity of governing relationships in fluid–solid interactions pertinent to sediment transport and particle settling. Consider the drag on a rigid sphere moving steadily through a Newtonian viscous fluid, a canonical problem relevant to geophysical flows of particulate suspensions. \n\nState the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem precisely in terms of the count of variables and base dimensions, and apply it to the drag problem as follows. Let the drag force be denoted by $F_{D}$ and assume the drag depends on the characteristic flow speed $U$, the characteristic sphere length $L$, the fluid mass density $\\rho$, and the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. Treat the set of relevant variables as $\\{F_{D}, U, L, \\rho, \\mu\\}$, and use the standard mechanical base dimensions mass $M$, length $L$, and time $T$. Determine the number of independent dimensionless groups that characterize this drag problem. Your final answer must be a single integer. Do not provide any additional derivations in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the number of independent dimensionless groups for the drag on a sphere using the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem.\n\nFirst, we state the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem as requested. The theorem provides a method for reducing the number of variables in a physical problem. It states that if a physically meaningful relationship among $n$ physical variables exists, and these variables can be described using $k$ independent fundamental dimensions, then the relationship can be expressed in terms of $p = n - k$ independent dimensionless groups, often denoted as $\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2, \\dots, \\Pi_p$. The functional relationship can be written as $f(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2, \\dots, \\Pi_p) = 0$.\n\nThe steps to apply the theorem are as follows:\n1.  Identify and count the number of relevant physical variables, $n$.\n2.  Determine the dimensions of each variable in terms of a set of fundamental base dimensions.\n3.  Determine the number of independent fundamental dimensions, $k$, required to describe the variables. This is equivalent to finding the rank of the dimensional matrix.\n4.  Calculate the number of independent dimensionless groups, $p = n - k$.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to the given problem.\n\nStep 1: Identify the variables.\nThe problem provides the set of relevant variables: $\\{F_{D}, U, L, \\rho, \\mu\\}$.\n-   $F_{D}$: drag force\n-   $U$: characteristic flow speed\n-   $L$: characteristic sphere length\n-   $\\rho$: fluid mass density\n-   $\\mu$: dynamic viscosity\nThe total number of variables is $n=5$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the dimensions of each variable.\nThe specified base dimensions are mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). We express the dimensions of each of the $n=5$ variables in terms of these base dimensions.\n-   The dimension of drag force, $F_{D}$, which is mass times acceleration, is $[F_{D}] = M L T^{-2}$.\n-   The dimension of speed, $U$, is $[U] = L T^{-1}$.\n-   The dimension of length, $L$, is $[L] = L$.\n-   The dimension of density, $\\rho$, which is mass per unit volume, is $[\\rho] = M L^{-3}$.\n-   The dimension of dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, is derived from the relation for shear stress $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. Thus, $[\\mu] = \\frac{[\\tau]}{[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}]} = \\frac{[Force/Area]}{[Speed/Length]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2} / L^2}{L T^{-1} / L} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{T^{-1}} = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of independent fundamental dimensions.\nThe base dimensions are given as $M$, $L$, and $T$. To find the number of independent dimensions, $k$, we construct the dimensional matrix. The columns correspond to the variables $\\{F_{D}, U, L, \\rho, \\mu\\}$ and the rows correspond to the base dimensions $\\{M, L, T\\}$. The entries of the matrix are the exponents of the dimensions for each variable.\n\nThe dimensional matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n   F_{D}  U  L  \\rho  \\mu \\\\\nM  1  0  0  1  1 \\\\\nL  1  1  1  -3  -1 \\\\\nT  -2  -1  0  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe number of independent dimensions, $k$, is the rank of this $3 \\times 5$ matrix. We can determine the rank by finding a submatrix with a non-zero determinant. Let's select the square submatrix formed by the columns corresponding to the variables $U$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1 \\\\\n1  -3  -1 \\\\\n-1  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this $3 \\times 3$ submatrix is calculated as:\n$0 \\cdot ((-3)(-1) - (0)(-1)) - 1 \\cdot ((1)(-1) - (-1)(-1)) + 1 \\cdot ((1)(0) - (-3)(-1))$\n$= 0 - 1 \\cdot (-1 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (0 - 3)$\n$= -1 \\cdot (-2) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1$.\nSince the determinant is non-zero (it is $-1$), the three column vectors are linearly independent. This implies that the rank of the submatrix is $3$. Therefore, the rank of the full $3 \\times 5$ dimensional matrix is $3$.\nThis confirms that all three base dimensions, $M$, $L$, and $T$, are independent for this set of variables.\nThus, the number of independent dimensions is $k=3$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of dimensionless groups.\nUsing the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups, $p$, is given by:\n$$p = n - k$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$p = 5 - 3 = 2$$\nTherefore, the drag problem as stated is characterized by $2$ independent dimensionless groups. These are commonly known as the drag coefficient, $C_D = \\frac{F_D}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 A}$ (where $A$ is a characteristic area, proportional to $L^2$), and the Reynolds number, $Re = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$.\n\nThe final answer is the integer value for the number of independent dimensionless groups.",

The internal resistance to heat conduction across the slab of characteristic length $L$ and thermal conductivity $k$ is, per unit area, $R_{cond} = \\frac{L}{k}$. The external resistance to heat convection from the surface to the surrounding fluid with a heat transfer coefficient $h$ is, per unit area, $R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{h}$. The ratio is:\n$$\nBi = \\frac{R_{cond}}{R_{conv}} = \\frac{L/k}{1/h} = \\frac{hL}{k}\n$$\nThis ratio also compares the characteristic timescales for heat transport. The timescale for heat to diffuse across the slab is $\\tau_{diff} \\sim \\frac{L^{2}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{L^{2}\\rho c}{k}$. The timescale for heat to be removed from the body by convection is $\\tau_{conv} \\sim \\frac{\\rho c V}{h A}$, where $V/A \\sim L$ is the volume-to-surface-area ratio, so $\\tau_{conv} \\sim \\frac{\\rho c L}{h}$. The ratio of these timescales is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{conv}} = \\frac{L^{2}\\rho c/k}{\\rho c L/h} = \\frac{hL}{k} = Bi\n$$\nThe lumped-capacitance approximation assumes the temperature within the body is spatially uniform, $T(x,t) \\approx T(t)$. This is valid when the internal resistance to heat flow is negligible compared to the external resistance, meaning heat diffuses throughout the body much faster than it is removed from the surface. This corresponds to the condition $Bi \\ll 1$ (typically $Bi  0.1$). When $Bi \\ll 1$, any temperature gradients within the body relax quickly, and the internal temperature remains nearly uniform as the body cools. When $Bi \\ge 1$, internal conduction is the rate-limiting step, and significant temperature gradients develop within the body, invalidating the lumped-capacitance approximation.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the Biot number for the given geophysical scenario:\n$h = 1500\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$L = 0.040\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$k = 2.8\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\n$$\nBi = \\frac{hL}{k} = \\frac{(1500\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}})(0.040\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2.8\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{60}{2.8} = \\frac{150}{7} \\approx 21.42857\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the value is $21.43$. Since $Bi \\gg 1$, the lumped-capacitance model would be grossly inaccurate for this scenario, and the full PDE solution is required to accurately model the cooling of the xenolith.",
