A solution will now be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement. The final answer will be the expression requested.\n\n**1. Computation of the Displacement Gradient and Strain Tensor**\n\nThe displacement field $u(x)$ is given in component form as a function of the coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$. Let the position vector be $x = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + x_3 e_3$, where $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$. The displacement vector $u$ is given by:\n$$\nu(x,y,z) = u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2 + u_3 e_3 = (\\alpha x) e_1 + (\\beta y) e_2 + (\\gamma z) e_3\n$$\nThe displacement gradient tensor, $\\nabla u$, is a second-order tensor whose components in Cartesian coordinates are $(\\nabla u)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. We compute these components:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial (\\alpha x)}{\\partial x} = \\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial (\\beta y)}{\\partial y} = \\beta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_3} = \\frac{\\partial (\\gamma z)}{\\partial z} = \\gamma\n$$\nAll other partial derivatives are zero, e.g., $\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial (\\alpha x)}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nThus, the matrix representation of the displacement gradient tensor $\\nabla u$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla u = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\varepsilon(u)$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^T \\right)\n$$\nThe transpose of $\\nabla u$ is:\n$$\n(\\nabla u)^T = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}^T\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\nabla u$ is a diagonal matrix, it is symmetric, so $(\\nabla u)^T = \\nabla u$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\varepsilon(u)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\nabla u + \\nabla u \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2 \\nabla u) = \\nabla u\n$$\nTherefore, the infinitesimal strain tensor is identical to the displacement gradient for this specific affine displacement field:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(u) = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Linearized Volume Change and the Isochoric Condition**\n\nThe local change in volume is described by the Jacobian determinant of the deformation map, $J = \\det(F)$, where $F$ is the deformation gradient. The deformation gradient is defined as $F = I + \\nabla u$, where $I$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n$$\nF = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1+\\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1+\\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Jacobian determinant is:\n$$\nJ = \\det(F) = (1+\\alpha)(1+\\beta)(1+\\gamma) = 1 + (\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma) + (\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\gamma+\\gamma\\alpha) + \\alpha\\beta\\gamma\n$$\nThe relative volume change $\\Delta V / V_0$ is given by $J-1$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0} = J-1 = (\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma) + (\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\gamma+\\gamma\\alpha) + \\alpha\\beta\\gamma\n$$\nThe problem is set in the context of linearized kinematics for small strains. This implies that the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are small (i.e., $|\\alpha| \\ll 1$, $|\\beta| \\ll 1$, $|\\gamma| \\ll 1$). Consequently, we can neglect terms of second order and higher, such as $\\alpha\\beta$, $\\beta\\gamma$, $\\gamma\\alpha$, and $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma$. The linearized relative volume change is therefore:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}\\right)_{\\text{linearized}} \\approx \\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma\n$$\nA general result in continuum mechanics states that for small strains, the relative volume change is equal to the trace of the strain tensor, also known as the volumetric strain. Let's verify this for our specific case. The trace of $\\varepsilon(u)$ is the sum of its diagonal components:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon(u)) = \\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22} + \\varepsilon_{33} = \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon(u))$ represents the linearized volumetric strain. The problem states that volume preservation (isochoric deformation) is enforced by a constraint that sets the volumetric strain to zero. This is the condition that emerges from the variational formulation. Therefore, the condition required for volume preservation in the small-strain sense is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon(u)) = 0\n$$\n\n**3. Condition on $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$**\n\nFrom the previous step, the volume-preservation condition is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon(u)) = 0$. Using the expression derived for the trace in terms of the coefficients, we find the condition imposed on $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the analytic expression for the volumetric strain, which is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon(u))$. Based on our calculations, this expression is $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma$.",

We compute the required second partial derivatives of $\\Phi$:\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} = A\\,y^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} = 2\\,A\\,x\\,y\n$$\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2\\,A\\,x\\,y) = 2\\,A\\,x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(A\\,y^{2}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2\\,A\\,x\\,y) = 2\\,A\\,y\n$$\nUsing these derivatives, we obtain the stress components in terms of the constant $A$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = 2\\,A\\,x\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(x,y) = -2\\,A\\,y\n$$\nThis stress field satisfies the equilibrium equations for any value of $A$. Next, we enforce the traction boundary condition on the boundary $\\Gamma_t = \\{y=H\\}$. The outward unit normal vector to this boundary is $\\boldsymbol{n} = (0, 1)$. The traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ on a boundary is given by Cauchy's formula, $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$. In component form, this is:\n$$\nt_x = \\sigma_{xx}n_x + \\sigma_{xy}n_y = \\sigma_{xx}(0) + \\sigma_{xy}(1) = \\sigma_{xy}\n$$\n$$\nt_y = \\sigma_{xy}n_x + \\sigma_{yy}n_y = \\sigma_{xy}(0) + \\sigma_{yy}(1) = \\sigma_{yy}\n$$\nSo, on the boundary $y=H$, the traction vector is $(\\sigma_{xy}(x,H), \\sigma_{yy}(x,H))$. The problem prescribes the traction as $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{t}}(x,H) = (\\tau_{0}, 0)$. Equating the components of the computed traction with the prescribed traction:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(x,H) = \\tau_{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(x,H) = 0\n$$\nWe substitute our derived stress expressions into these conditions.\nThe second condition is $\\sigma_{yy}(x,H) = 0$. Since we found $\\sigma_{yy}(x,y)=0$ for all $(x,y)$, this condition is automatically satisfied.\nThe first condition gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(x,H) = -2\\,A\\,H = \\tau_{0}\n$$\nWe solve this equation for the unknown constant $A$:\n$$\nA = -\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{2H}\n$$\nNow we substitute this value of $A$ back into the expressions for the stress components to obtain the final stress field:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = 2\\,A\\,x = 2 \\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{2H}\\right) x = -\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{H} x\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(x,y) = -2\\,A\\,y = -2 \\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{2H}\\right) y = \\frac{\\tau_{0}}{H} y\n$$\nThe resulting stress field is $(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{xy}) = \\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{H}x, 0, \\frac{\\tau_{0}}{H}y\\right)$. This field satisfies both the equilibrium equations and the specified traction boundary condition on $\\Gamma_t$, and is therefore the required admissible stress field.",
