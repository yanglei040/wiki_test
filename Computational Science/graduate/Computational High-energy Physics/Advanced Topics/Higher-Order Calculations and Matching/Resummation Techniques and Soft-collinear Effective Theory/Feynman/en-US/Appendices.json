            "introduction": "Our journey into the practical application of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) begins with a cornerstone calculation: the resummation of the thrust distribution in electron-positron collisions. In the dijet limit, where the thrust variable $\\tau \\to 0$, large logarithms of $\\tau$ spoil the convergence of fixed-order perturbative expansions. This exercise () guides you through the process of using SCET to factorize the cross section into hard, jet, and soft functions and then applying renormalization group (RG) evolution to systematically resum these large logarithms to all orders, providing a powerful tool for precision predictions at colliders.",

            "problem": "Consider the dijet limit of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons characterized by the thrust variable $\\tau = 1 - T$, where $T$ is the thrust. In the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) framework, the differential thrust distribution in the small-$\\tau$ limit factorizes into a hard function $H(Q,\\mu)$, two identical jet functions $J(p^2,\\mu)$, and a soft function $S(k,\\mu)$, with $Q$ the center-of-mass energy. The Renormalization Group (RG) equations governing the scale dependence of these functions at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NLL), using one-loop expressions for the anomalous dimensions, are of the generic form\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln F = \\gamma_F(\\mu),\n$$\nwhere $F \\in \\{H,J,S\\}$ and $\\gamma_F(\\mu)$ are anomalous dimensions consisting of a cusp part and a non-cusp part. Assume the following one-loop inputs:\n- The quark cusp anomalous dimension is $\\Gamma_{\\text{cusp}}(\\alpha_s) = \\Gamma_0 \\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}$ with $\\Gamma_0 = 4 C_F$.\n- The non-cusp anomalous dimensions at one loop satisfy RG consistency $\\gamma_H^0 + 2 \\gamma_J^0 + \\gamma_S^0 = 0$, and are taken as $\\gamma_H^0 = -12 C_F$, $\\gamma_J^0 = 6 C_F$, and $\\gamma_S^0 = 0$.\n- The one-loop Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) $\\beta$-function for the strong coupling is $\\beta(\\alpha_s) = \\mu \\frac{d\\alpha_s}{d\\mu} = - \\beta_0 \\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{2\\pi}$ with $\\beta_0 = \\frac{11 C_A}{3} - \\frac{4 T_F n_f}{3}$. Use $C_F = \\frac{4}{3}$, $C_A = 3$, $T_F = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $n_f = 5$, and the boundary condition $\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.118$ at $M_Z = 91.1876\\,\\text{GeV}$.\n\nFor thrust $\\tau$ in the dijet limit, take the characteristic variables of the jet and soft functions to be $p^2 \\sim Q^2 \\tau$ and $k \\sim Q \\tau$, respectively. Using one-loop expressions for the jet and soft functions, and canonical scales chosen to minimize large logarithms,\n$$\n\\mu_H = Q, \\quad \\mu_J = Q \\sqrt{\\tau}, \\quad \\mu_S = Q \\tau,\n$$\nset up and solve the RG equations to evolve $H$, $J$, and $S$ from their canonical scales to a common scale $\\mu = Q$. Treat the one-loop matching values at the canonical scales as unity, $H(Q,\\mu_H)=1$, $J(Q^2 \\tau,\\mu_J)=1$, and $S(Q \\tau,\\mu_S)=1$, so that the resummed content enters entirely through the RG evolution kernels. To avoid unphysical Landau pole behavior, impose a lower scale cutoff $\\mu_{\\text{min}} = 1\\,\\text{GeV}$, and freeze the running of $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ and the canonical scales by replacing any $\\mu < \\mu_{\\text{min}}$ with $\\mu_{\\text{min}}$ in all logarithms and running-coupling evaluations.\n\nUse the following explicit one-loop anomalous dimensions in differential form for evolution to $\\mu = Q$:\n- Hard function:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln H = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{4\\pi} \\left[ 4 \\Gamma_0 \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\mu} \\right) + \\gamma_H^0 \\right].\n$$\n- Jet function (for a single jet):\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln J = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{4\\pi} \\left[ -2 \\Gamma_0 \\left( 2 \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\mu} \\right) + \\ln \\tau \\right) + \\gamma_J^0 \\right].\n$$\n- Soft function:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln S = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{4\\pi} \\left[ 4 \\Gamma_0 \\left( \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\mu} \\right) + \\ln \\tau \\right) + \\gamma_S^0 \\right].\n$$\n\nDefine the NLL-resummed thrust distribution as the product of the evolved functions evaluated at the common scale $\\mu=Q$,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\tau}\\right)_{\\text{NLL}}(\\tau;Q) \\equiv H(Q,\\mu=Q) \\left[J(Q^2 \\tau,\\mu=Q)\\right]^2 S(Q \\tau,\\mu=Q),\n$$\nwhich is dimensionless. Numerically integrate the RG equations over $\\ln\\mu$ from the canonical starting scales $(\\mu_H,\\mu_J,\\mu_S)$ to $Q$, using the one-loop running coupling\n$$\n\\alpha_s(\\mu) = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)}{1 + \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)\\beta_0}{2\\pi} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0}\\right)},\n$$\nwith $\\mu_0 = M_Z$ as the reference scale.\n\nYour program must compute the resummed values for the following test suite of $(Q,\\tau)$ pairs:\n- $Q = 91.1876\\,\\text{GeV}$ with $\\tau \\in \\{0.001, 0.010, 0.050, 0.100, 0.250\\}$,\n- $Q = 500\\,\\text{GeV}$ with $\\tau \\in \\{0.010, 0.100\\}$.\n\nAll outputs are dimensionless floats. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[r_1,r_2,\\dots]$), ordered in the same sequence as the parameter sets above. Use radians for any implicit angular quantities, although none are directly required here. Ensure numerical stability by implementing the $\\mu_{\\text{min}}$ freeze as specified.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe NLL-resummed thrust distribution is given by the product of the hard, jet, and soft functions evolved to a common scale $\\mu=Q$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\tau}\\right)_{\\text{NLL}}(\\tau;Q) = H(Q,\\mu=Q) \\left[J(Q^2 \\tau,\\mu=Q)\\right]^2 S(Q \\tau,\\mu=Q)\n$$\nThe functions are evolved from their canonical scales $\\mu_H$, $\\mu_J$, $\\mu_S$, where their values are fixed to unity. The evolution is governed by the RG equations. The solution for a generic function $F$ evolved from an initial scale $\\mu_i$ to a final scale $\\mu_f$ is:\n$$\nF(\\mu_f) = F(\\mu_i) \\exp\\left( \\int_{\\mu_i}^{\\mu_f} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} \\gamma_F(\\mu) \\right)\n$$\nGiven the initial conditions $H(Q,\\mu_H)=1$, $J(Q^2\\tau,\\mu_J)=1$, and $S(Q\\tau,\\mu_S)=1$, we can determine the factors at $\\mu=Q$.\n\n1.  **Hard Function**: The canonical scale is $\\mu_H = Q$. The evolution is from $\\mu_i = Q$ to $\\mu_f = Q$. The integration interval is zero, so there is no evolution.\n    $$ H(Q,\\mu=Q) = H(Q,\\mu_H) \\exp(0) = 1 $$\n\n2.  **Jet and Soft Functions**: The jet and soft functions are evolved from their canonical scales, $\\mu_J = Q\\sqrt{\\tau}$ and $\\mu_S = Q\\tau$, to the final scale $\\mu=Q$. The problem specifies an infrared cutoff $\\mu_{\\text{min}}=1\\,\\text{GeV}$, which prevents the evolution from starting at a scale where perturbation theory is invalid. The effective starting scales for integration are therefore:\n    $$ \\mu_{J,\\text{start}} = \\max(\\mu_J, \\mu_{\\text{min}}) = \\max(Q\\sqrt{\\tau}, 1\\,\\text{GeV}) $$\n    $$ \\mu_{S,\\text{start}} = \\max(\\mu_S, \\mu_{\\text{min}}) = \\max(Q\\tau, 1\\,\\text{GeV}) $$\n    The evolved functions at $\\mu = Q$ are thus given by:\n    $$ J(Q^2\\tau, Q) = \\exp\\left( \\int_{\\mu_{J,\\text{start}}}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} \\gamma_J(\\mu) \\right) $$\n    $$ S(Q\\tau, Q) = \\exp\\left( \\int_{\\mu_{S,\\text{start}}}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} \\gamma_S(\\mu) \\right) $$\n    where $\\gamma_J(\\mu)$ and $\\gamma_S(\\mu)$ are the anomalous dimensions provided in the problem statement.\n\nCombining these results, the final expression for the resummed distribution is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\tau}\\right)_{\\text{NLL}} = \\exp\\left( 2 \\int_{\\mu_{J,\\text{start}}}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} \\gamma_J(\\mu) + \\int_{\\mu_{S,\\text{start}}}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} \\gamma_S(\\mu) \\right)\n$$\nThe integrands are defined as follows, with the given anomalous dimensions:\n$$\n\\gamma_J(\\mu) = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{4\\pi} \\left[ -2 \\Gamma_0 \\left( 2 \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\mu} \\right) + \\ln \\tau \\right) + \\gamma_J^0 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_S(\\mu) = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{4\\pi} \\left[ 4 \\Gamma_0 \\left( \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\mu} \\right) + \\ln \\tau \\right) + \\gamma_S^0 \\right]\n$$\nThe strong coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ runs according to the one-loop RG equation:\n$$\n\\alpha_s(\\mu) = \\frac{\\alpha_s(M_Z)}{1 + \\frac{\\alpha_s(M_Z)\\beta_0}{2\\pi} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{M_Z}\\right)}\n$$\nThe parameters are calculated from the given color factors and $n_f=5$:\n- $C_F = 4/3$, $C_A = 3$, $T_F = 1/2$, $n_f = 5$.\n- $\\beta_0 = \\frac{11 C_A}{3} - \\frac{4 T_F n_f}{3} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 3}{3} - \\frac{4 \\cdot (1/2) \\cdot 5}{3} = 11 - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{23}{3}$.\n- $\\Gamma_0 = 4 C_F = 16/3$.\n- $\\gamma_J^0 = 6 C_F = 8$.\n- $\\gamma_S^0 = 0$.\n\nThe computation requires numerical integration of the exponent term. For each test case $(Q, \\tau)$, we will:\n1.  Calculate the starting scales $\\mu_{J,\\text{start}}$ and $\\mu_{S,\\text{start}}$.\n2.  Numerically evaluate the two definite integrals for the jet and soft functions using a standard quadrature method.\n3.  Combine the results to compute the final value of the resummed distribution.\nThe integration variable $\\mu$ in both integrals runs from a starting scale (always $\\ge \\mu_{\\text{min}}$) to $Q$. Thus, the argument of the running coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ is always in the perturbative domain where the formula is valid.\nThe implementation will define functions for the running coupling and the integrands, then use `scipy.integrate.quad` to perform the numerical integration.",

The result is numerically verifiable.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe objective is to numerically verify the basis independence of the renormalization group evolution of the SCET soft function for a model $2 \\to 2$ process. The core principle is that physical observables, here represented by the evolved soft function $S(\\mu_f)$, must be independent of the choice of basis used to represent the color states. We will perform the RG evolution in two different bases—the original basis and a rotated basis—and demonstrate that the final physical result is the same, up to numerical precision.\n\nThe computational procedure is structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Constants and Initial Setup**: We begin by defining the fundamental constants of the theory: the number of colors $N_c=3$, and the associated color factors $C_A = 3$ and $C_F = 4/3$. The initial condition for the evolution, the soft function matrix $S(\\mu_0)$, is also defined as a fixed symmetric positive-definite matrix.\n\n2.  **Evolution Kernel Calculation**: For each test case, we compute the scalar evolution kernel $K(\\mu_f, \\mu_0)$, which encapsulates the integrated effect of the running strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ between the initial scale $\\mu_0$ and the final scale $\\mu_f$. This requires first calculating the one-loop QCD beta function coefficient $\\beta_0$ for the given number of active quark flavors $n_f$. Then, we use the one-loop solution to the RGE for $\\alpha_s$ to find its value at the final scale, $\\alpha_s(\\mu_f)$. With both $\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)$ and $\\alpha_s(\\mu_f)$, we compute $K(\\mu_f, \\mu_0) = \\frac{2}{\\beta_0} \\ln(\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)/\\alpha_s(\\mu_f))$. A special case arises if $\\mu_f = \\mu_0$, which correctly yields $K=0$ and no evolution.\n\n3.  **Anomalous Dimension Matrix Construction**: We construct the $2 \\times 2$ one-loop anomalous dimension matrix $\\Gamma_S^{(1)}$ using the provided formula. This matrix depends on the kinematic invariants $s$, $t$, and $u$, and the initial scale $\\mu_0$ through the logarithms $L_s$, $L_t$, and $L_u$.\n\n4.  **RG Evolution in the Original Basis**:\n    - The evolution operator is a matrix exponential, $U(\\mu_f, \\mu_0) = \\exp(K(\\mu_f, \\mu_0) \\Gamma_S^{(1)})$.\n    - We compute this efficiently by first diagonalizing the anomalous dimension matrix: $\\Gamma_S^{(1)} = V \\Lambda V^{-1}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and $V$ is the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors.\n    - The evolution operator is then $U = V \\exp(K\\Lambda) V^{-1}$. Since $\\Gamma_S^{(1)}$ is real and symmetric, its eigenvectors are orthogonal, so $V^{-1} = V^T$.\n    - The evolved soft function is calculated as $S(\\mu_f) = U^\\dagger S(\\mu_0) U$. As all quantities are real, this simplifies to $S(\\mu_f) = U^T S(\\mu_0) U$.\n\n5.  **RG Evolution in the Rotated Basis**:\n    - We define an orthogonal rotation matrix $R(\\theta)$ for a given angle $\\theta$.\n    - We transform the initial problem into the new ('primed') basis:\n      - Anomalous dimension: $\\Gamma_S^{(1)\\prime} = R \\Gamma_S^{(1)} R^T$.\n      - Initial soft function: $S(\\mu_0)^\\prime = R S(\\mu_0) R^T$.\n    - We perform the evolution entirely in this primed basis. A new evolution operator $U'$ is computed by diagonalizing $\\Gamma_S^{(1)\\prime}$ and exponentiating: $U' = \\exp(K \\Gamma_S^{(1)\\prime})$.\n    - The evolved soft function in the primed basis is $S(\\mu_f)^\\prime = U'^T S(\\mu_0)^\\prime U'$.\n\n6.  **Basis-Independence Verification**:\n    - To compare the results, we rotate $S(\\mu_f)^\\prime$ back to the original basis: $\\widetilde{S}(\\mu_f) = R^T S(\\mu_f)^\\prime R$.\n    - Theoretical consistency demands that $\\widetilde{S}(\\mu_f) = S(\\mu_f)$. We quantify the numerical deviation by computing the Frobenius norm of the difference matrix: $\\Delta = \\left\\| \\widetilde{S}(\\mu_f) - S(\\mu_f) \\right\\|_F$. A value of $\\Delta$ close to machine epsilon confirms the basis independence of the implementation.\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for robust handling of matrix algebra and linear algebra operations, ensuring calculations are performed with double-precision floating-point numbers.",

            "introduction": "Precision calculations in high-energy physics are incomplete without a robust assessment of their theoretical uncertainties. This final practice () addresses this crucial aspect by investigating the sensitivity of resummed predictions to higher-order effects in the running of the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s$. By comparing results obtained using the QCD beta function at three- and four-loop accuracy, you will gain a concrete understanding of how uncalculated higher-order terms contribute to the uncertainty budget of a theoretical prediction. This is an essential skill for any theorist or phenomenologist aiming to make meaningful comparisons between theory and high-precision experimental data.",

            "problem": "You are asked to implement a numerical study of the sensitivity of resummed exponents to the running of the strong coupling constant in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) within the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). The study must compare results obtained with a three-loop and a four-loop truncation of the QCD beta function. Your program must compute, for specified test cases, the Sudakov exponent and a simple resummed distribution, and then quantify the shift induced by changing the loop order of the running.\n\nBegin from the following foundational elements:\n\n1. The renormalization group equation for the strong coupling constant is given by the differential equation in the renormalization scale:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{d\\ln \\mu} \\equiv \\beta(\\alpha_s) \\, ,\n$$\nwith the perturbative expansion for the beta function truncated at loop order $N \\in \\{3,4\\}$,\n$$\n\\beta(\\alpha_s) = -2\\,\\alpha_s \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\beta_n \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{n+1},\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $\\beta_n$ are those of the Modified Minimal Subtraction scheme (denoted $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$) in QCD. You must use a fixed number of active quark flavors $n_f = 5$ for all scales in this problem. The coefficients are:\n- $ \\beta_0 = 11 - \\frac{2}{3} n_f $,\n- $ \\beta_1 = 102 - \\frac{38}{3} n_f $,\n- $ \\beta_2 = \\frac{2857}{2} - \\frac{5033}{18} n_f + \\frac{325}{54} n_f^2 $,\n- $ \\beta_3 = \\frac{149753}{6} + 3564\\,\\zeta_3 - \\left(\\frac{1078361}{162} + \\frac{6508}{27}\\,\\zeta_3\\right) n_f + \\left(\\frac{50065}{162} + \\frac{6472}{81}\\,\\zeta_3\\right) n_f^2 + \\frac{1093}{729} n_f^3 $,\nwhere $\\zeta_3$ is the Apéry’s constant, the Riemann zeta at $3$.\n\n2. The Sudakov radiator for a generic global event-shape logarithm $L \\equiv \\ln(1/v)$ is defined, for this problem, by the integral\n$$\nR(L;Q) = 2 \\int_{\\mu_L}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu'}{\\mu'} \\, \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(\\mu')) \\, \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{\\mu'}\\right),\n$$\nwith the lower scale given by $\\mu_L \\equiv Q e^{-L}$ and the hard scale $Q$ specified in the test cases. The cusp anomalous dimension is expanded as\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s) = \\sum_{n=0}^{2} \\Gamma_n \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{n+1},\n$$\nusing the Quantum Chromodynamics color factors $C_A = 3$, $C_F = 4/3$, $T_F = 1/2$, and $n_f = 5$. The coefficients through three loops are\n- $ \\Gamma_0 = 4 C_F $,\n- $ \\Gamma_1 = 4 C_F \\left[ \\left(\\frac{67}{9} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}\\right) C_A - \\frac{20}{9} T_F n_f \\right] $,\n- $ \\Gamma_2 = 4 C_F \\left[ C_A^2 \\left(\\frac{245}{6} - \\frac{134\\pi^2}{27} + \\frac{11\\pi^4}{45} + \\frac{22}{3}\\zeta_3\\right) + C_A T_F n_f \\left(-\\frac{418}{27} + \\frac{40\\pi^2}{27} - \\frac{56}{3}\\zeta_3\\right) + C_F T_F n_f \\left(-\\frac{55}{3} + 16 \\zeta_3\\right) - \\frac{16}{27} T_F^2 n_f^2 \\right].\n$\n\n3. Define the Sudakov exponent for this problem as $S(Q,L) \\equiv R(L;Q)$, and define a simple resummed distribution\n$$\nD(v;Q) = \\frac{1}{v} \\, \\exp\\left[-R(L;Q)\\right] \\, \\frac{dR(L;Q)}{dL},\n$$\nwith $L \\equiv \\ln(1/v)$ and the derivative computed from the definition of $R(L;Q)$ and the relation for $\\mu_L$ to $L$.\n\n4. Boundary condition for the coupling: use $ \\alpha_s(\\mu_0) = 0.118 $ at $ \\mu_0 = M_Z = 91.1876 \\, \\mathrm{GeV} $. All energies in this problem are to be treated in the unit of $\\mathrm{GeV}$. The outputs $S$ and $D$ are dimensionless.\n\n5. Assumptions for this task: neglect quark-threshold matching and treat $n_f = 5$ as fixed for all scales; use the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme; use the definitions exactly as stated. Angles are not involved. You must solve the running coupling differential equation numerically in $\\ln \\mu$ and evaluate the integrals numerically. No closed-form \"shortcut\" expressions for $R(L;Q)$ or for the running coupling are permitted; you must implement the definitions directly.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- Implement both the three-loop and four-loop versions of the running coupling by truncating the beta function at $N=3$ and $N=4$, respectively, while keeping the cusp anomalous dimension fixed at three loops. This isolates the sensitivity to the running.\n- For each test case, compute $S_3 \\equiv S(Q,L)$ and $D_3 \\equiv D(v;Q)$ using the three-loop beta function, and $S_4$ and $D_4$ using the four-loop beta function. Then compute the shifts $\\Delta S \\equiv S_4 - S_3$ and $\\Delta D \\equiv D_4 - D_3$.\n\nNumerical details:\n- Evaluate all integrals with respect to $\\ln \\mu$ or $\\mu$ using reliable numerical quadrature with absolute and relative tolerances sufficient to obtain stable results to at least six decimal places in the final outputs.\n- Ensure that the integration range for the running coupling solution covers the entire domain needed by all test cases, that is, from the smallest $ \\mu_L $ to the largest $ Q $ across the test suite.\n- The program must round each reported float to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following list of test cases, each specified by $(Q, v)$ with $Q$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $v$ dimensionless:\n- Test $1$: $Q = 91.1876$, $v = 0.1$.\n- Test $2$: $Q = 30.0$, $v = 0.1$.\n- Test $3$: $Q = 91.1876$, $v = 0.9$.\n- Test $4$: $Q = 30.0$, $v = 0.3$.\n\nFor each test case, your program must output a list with six entries in this order:\n$[\\Delta S, \\Delta D, S_3, S_4, D_3, D_4]$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the list of results for all four test cases, in order, as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, for example:\n$[[\\Delta S_1,\\Delta D_1,S_{3,1},S_{4,1},D_{3,1},D_{4,1}],[\\Delta S_2,\\Delta D_2,S_{3,2},S_{4,2},D_{3,2},D_{4,2}],\\ldots]$.\nAll floats must be rounded to six decimal places. No additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical study of the sensitivity of resummed observables in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to the loop order of the running strong coupling constant, $\\alpha_s$. Specifically, we are to compare the results for a Sudakov exponent $S$ and a resummed distribution $D$ when $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ is evolved using the three-loop versus the four-loop QCD beta function. The framework is Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), and all definitions, constants, and parameters are provided and must be used as stated.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the interplay between three components:\n1.  The running of the strong coupling constant, $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$, governed by the renormalization group equation (RGE).\n2.  The Sudakov radiator, $R(L;Q)$, which resums large logarithms $L$ and is defined by an integral involving $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ and the cusp anomalous dimension, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s)$.\n3.  A resummed differential distribution, $D(v;Q)$, which involves the Sudakov exponent and its derivative with respect to the logarithm $L$.\n\nThe computational strategy is to implement these components numerically, adhering strictly to the provided theoretical formulas.\n\nFirst, we address the running of the strong coupling constant, $\\alpha_s$. Its evolution with the renormalization scale $\\mu$ is described by the RGE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{d\\ln \\mu} = \\beta(\\alpha_s)\n$$\nThe $\\beta$-function is given as a perturbative series in $\\alpha_s$:\n$$\n\\beta(\\alpha_s) = -2\\,\\alpha_s \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\beta_n \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{n+1}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we must perform calculations for two different truncations of this series: $N=3$ (three-loop) and $N=4$ (four-loop). The coefficients $\\beta_n$ for a fixed number of active quark flavors $n_f=5$ are provided. This first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) is solved numerically using the initial condition $\\alpha_s(\\mu_0) = 0.118$ at $\\mu_0 = M_Z = 91.1876 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$. We use an ODE solver, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to obtain two continuous, interpolating functions for the coupling, $\\alpha_{s,3\\text{-loop}}(\\mu)$ and $\\alpha_{s,4\\text{-loop}}(\\mu)$, over the range of scales relevant to the test cases.\n\nNext, we define the Sudakov radiator, $R(L;Q)$, for a generic event-shape logarithm $L = \\ln(1/v)$. Its definition is:\n$$\nR(L;Q) = 2 \\int_{\\mu_L}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu'}{\\mu'} \\, \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(\\mu')) \\, \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{\\mu'}\\right)\n$$\nwhere the lower integration bound is the soft scale $\\mu_L = Q e^{-L} = Qv$. The cusp anomalous dimension, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s)$, is given by its three-loop expansion:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s) = \\sum_{n=0}^{2} \\Gamma_n \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{n+1}\n$$\nThe coefficients $\\Gamma_n$ depend on the QCD color factors $C_A=3$, $C_F=4/3$, $T_F=1/2$, and $n_f=5$. To facilitate numerical evaluation, we perform a change of variables in the integral for $R(L;Q)$. Letting $t = \\ln \\mu'$, we have $d\\mu'/\\mu' = dt$, and the integral becomes:\n$$\nR(L;Q) = 2 \\int_{\\ln \\mu_L}^{\\ln Q} dt \\, \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(e^t)) \\, (\\ln Q - t)\n$$\nThis form is suitable for numerical quadrature, for which we use `scipy.integrate.quad`. The Sudakov exponent is then defined as $S(Q,L) = R(L;Q)$.\n\nThe final observable is the resummed distribution $D(v;Q)$:\n$$\nD(v;Q) = \\frac{1}{v} \\, \\exp\\left[-R(L;Q)\\right] \\, \\frac{dR(L;Q)}{dL}\n$$\nA crucial step is to compute the derivative $\\frac{dR}{dL}$. A naive numerical differentiation of the integral a bad practice. Instead, we can apply the Leibniz integral rule to the definition of $R(L;Q)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dL} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left( 2 \\int_{Q e^{-L}}^{Q} \\frac{d\\mu'}{\\mu'} \\, \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(\\mu')) \\, \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{\\mu'}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe upper limit $Q$ is independent of $L$, so only the lower limit contributes:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dL} = -2 \\left( \\frac{d(Q e^{-L})}{dL} \\right) \\frac{1}{Q e^{-L}} \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(Q e^{-L})) \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{Q e^{-L}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dL} = -2 (-Q e^{-L}) \\frac{1}{Q e^{-L}} \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(\\mu_L)) \\ln(e^L) = 2 L \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_s(\\mu_L))\n$$\nThis analytical result provides a direct and highly accurate method for calculating the derivative, requiring only the evaluation of $\\alpha_s$ at the single scale $\\mu_L = Qv$.\n\nThe overall computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define all physical constants ($\\pi$, $\\zeta_3$, color factors).\n2.  Implement functions to calculate the $\\beta_n$ and $\\Gamma_n$ coefficients for $n_f=5$.\n3.  Construct the three-loop and four-loop $\\beta$-functions and the three-loop $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}$ function.\n4.  Numerically solve the RGE for $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ from the initial condition at $\\mu_0 = M_Z$, generating two interpolating functions, $\\alpha_{s,3}$ and $\\alpha_{s,4}$, valid over the required energy range.\n5.  For each test case pair $(Q, v)$:\n    a. Calculate $L=\\ln(1/v)$ and $\\mu_L=Qv$.\n    b. Compute $S_3 = R(L;Q)$ and $S_4 = R(L;Q)$ by numerically integrating their respective integrands containing $\\alpha_{s,3}(e^t)$ and $\\alpha_{s,4}(e^t)$.\n    c. Compute $(\\frac{dR}{dL})_3 = 2L \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_{s,3}(\\mu_L))$ and $(\\frac{dR}{dL})_4 = 2L \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{cusp}}(\\alpha_{s,4}(\\mu_L))$.\n    d. Compute $D_3 = \\frac{1}{v} e^{-S_3} (\\frac{dR}{dL})_3$ and $D_4 = \\frac{1}{v} e^{-S_4} (\\frac{dR}{dL})_4$.\n    e. Calculate the differences $\\Delta S = S_4 - S_3$ and $\\Delta D = D_4 - D_3$.\n    f. Store the six results, rounded to six decimal places, in the specified order.\n6.  Finally, format the collected results for all test cases into a single line of output as requested.\nThis robust procedure ensures all constraints of the problem are met and provides a precise quantification of the theoretical uncertainty under study.",
