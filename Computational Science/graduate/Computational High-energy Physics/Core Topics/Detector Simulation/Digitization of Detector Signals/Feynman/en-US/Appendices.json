This exercise explores the sample-and-hold circuit, a fundamental component that performs this capture, but whose non-ideal behavior introduces errors.

            "problem": "A sample-and-hold (S/H) front end in a computational high-energy physics readout digitizes shaped detector pulses. The S/H consists of a sampling capacitor with capacitance $C_{s}$ charged from a source at constant amplitude $v_{0}$ through a series resistance $R_{s}$ during an acquisition (track) interval of duration $t_{a}$. At the end of acquisition, the circuit switches to hold, isolating the capacitor except for an effective leakage resistance $R_{\\text{leak}}$ that causes the held voltage to decay.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum allowable hold time, $t_{h,\\max}$, for a sample-and-hold circuit, and its numerical value for a given set of parameters. The solution involves solving two first-order linear ordinary differential equations sequentially and then applying an error constraint.\n\nThe process is divided into three stages:\n1.  **Acquisition phase:** A capacitor with capacitance $C_s$ is charged towards a voltage $v_0$ through a resistor $R_s$. This phase lasts for a duration $t_a$.\n2.  **Hold phase:** The capacitor is isolated and slowly discharges through a large leakage resistance $R_{\\text{leak}}$.\n3.  **ADC conversion:** The analog-to-digital converter measures the capacitor voltage at a time $t_h$ into the hold phase.\n\nWe start by analyzing the acquisition phase. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{c}}{d t}=\\frac{v_{0}-v_{c}}{R_{s} C_{s}}\n$$\nWe define the charging time constant as $\\tau_s = R_s C_s$. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{c}}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s} v_c = \\frac{v_0}{\\tau_s}\n$$\nThis is a standard first-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $A \\exp(-t/\\tau_s)$, and a particular solution, which is $v_0$ by inspection.\n$$\nv_c(t) = v_0 + A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_s}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the input steps from $0$ to $v_0$ at the start of acquisition, which implies the initial condition $v_c(0) = 0$. We use this to find the constant $A$:\n$$\n0 = v_0 + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = -v_0\n$$\nThus, the voltage across the capacitor during the acquisition phase is:\n$$\nv_c(t) = v_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_s}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nAt the end of the acquisition interval $t_a$, the voltage on the capacitor is:\n$$\nv_c(t_a) = v_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis voltage serves as the initial condition for the subsequent hold phase. Let us denote this voltage as $v_{\\text{hold},0} = v_c(t_a)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the hold phase. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d v_{c}}{d t}=-\\frac{v_{c}}{R_{\\text{leak}} C_{s}}\n$$\nWe define the leakage time constant as $\\tau_{\\text{leak}} = R_{\\text{leak}} C_s$.

Let's measure time from the beginning of the hold phase. The solution is of the form:\n$$\nv_c(t) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe initial condition for this phase is $v_c(0) = v_{\\text{hold},0} = v_c(t_a)$. So, $B=v_c(t_a)$, and the voltage during the hold phase is:\n$$\nv_c(t) = v_c(t_a) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe ADC samples this voltage at time $t_h$ into the hold.

During the hold phase, the voltage only decays further. Therefore, $v_{\\text{ADC}}(t_h) \\leq v_c(t_a) < v_0$, which means the term $v_0 - v_{\\text{ADC}}(t_h)$ is always positive. We can drop the absolute value:\n$$\nv_{0}-v_{\\text{ADC}}(t_{h}) \\leq \\epsilon\\, v_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{\\text{ADC}}(t_h)$:\n$$\nv_0 - v_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_h}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right) \\leq \\epsilon v_0\n$$\nDividing by $v_0$ (which is a positive amplitude):\n$$\n1 - \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_h}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right) \\leq \\epsilon\n$$\nWe rearrange the inequality to solve for $t_h$:\n$$\n1 - \\epsilon \\leq \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_h}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_h}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}}\\right) \\geq \\frac{1-\\epsilon}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{t_h}{\\tau_{\\text{leak}}} \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-\\tau_{\\text{leak}}$ (a positive quantity) reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\nt_h \\leq -\\tau_{\\text{leak}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$:\n$$\nt_h \\leq \\tau_{\\text{leak}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)}{1-\\epsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThe maximum allowable hold time, $t_{h,\\max}$, corresponds to the equality:\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} = \\tau_{\\text{leak}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s}\\right)}{1-\\epsilon}\\right) = R_{\\text{leak}} C_s \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_a}{R_s C_s}\\right)}{1-\\epsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate $t_{h,\\max}$ for the given numerical values:\n$R_{s}=1.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$\n$C_{s}=50\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}$\n$R_{\\text{leak}}=1.0\\times 10^{8}\\ \\Omega$\n$t_{a}=400\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$\n$\\epsilon=0.010$\n\nFirst, calculate the time constants:\nThe charging time constant is $\\tau_s = R_s C_s = (1.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\Omega) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}) = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}$.\nThe leakage time constant is $\\tau_{\\text{leak}} = R_{\\text{leak}} C_s = (1.0 \\times 10^8\\ \\Omega) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$.\n\nNext, calculate the exponent's argument for the acquisition phase:\n$$\n\\frac{t_a}{\\tau_s} = \\frac{400 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{s}} = 8\n$$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $t_{h,\\max}$:\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-8)}{1-0.010}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-8)}{0.99}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$1 - \\exp(-8) \\approx 1 - 0.0003354626 = 0.9996645374$\n$$\n\\frac{0.9996645374}{0.99} \\approx 1.009762159\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(1.009762159) \\approx 0.009714710\n$$\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} \\approx (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 0.009714710 \\approx 4.857355 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in microseconds ($\\mu\\text{s}$). $1\\ \\mu\\text{s} = 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$.\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} \\approx 48.57355\\ \\mu\\text{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nt_{h,\\max} \\approx 48.57\\ \\mu\\text{s}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the bias of two different amplitude estimators for a digitized calorimeter signal. The bias of an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ for a parameter $\\theta$ is defined as $B(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[\\hat{\\theta}] - \\theta$. Here, the parameter is the true pulse amplitude $A$. The analysis will be based on the expectation of the estimators. The signal model is given by $x[n] = A\\,h[n] + b_0 + s\\,n + w[n]$. The expectation of the signal is $E[x[n]] = A\\,h[n] + b_0 + s\\,n$, since the noise $w[n]$ is zero-mean. We will use the linearity of the expectation operator.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the pedestal subtraction method.\nThe estimator for the amplitude is $\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{ped}} = x[0] - \\hat{b}$, where the pedestal estimate is $\\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^{M} x[-k]$.\nThe expectation of the amplitude estimator is:\n$$E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{ped}}] = E[x[0] - \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^{M} x[-k]]$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{ped}}] = E[x[0]] - \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^{M} E[x[-k]]$$\nWe evaluate the individual expectations using $E[x[n]] = A\\,h[n] + b_0 + s\\,n$.\nFor the sample at the peak, $n=0$:\n$E[x[0]] = A\\,h[0] + b_0 + s \\cdot 0$.

Due to linearity, the total output is the sum of the outputs for each component of the input signal $x[n] = A\\,h[n] + b_0 + s\\,n + w[n]$. The amplitude estimator is $\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}} = y[0]/K(\\alpha)$.\nThe expectation of the estimator is $E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}] = E[y[0]]/K(\\alpha)$.\n$E[y[0]]$ is the filter's output at $n=0$ to the expected input signal $E[x[n]] = A\\,h[n] + b_0 + s\\,n$.\nLet $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cdot\\}$ denote the operation of the LTI filter. The output at $n=0$ is:\n$$E[y[0]] = \\mathcal{L}\\{A\\,h[n]\\}_0 + \\mathcal{L}\\{b_0\\}_0 + \\mathcal{L}\\{s\\,n\\}_0$$\nThe calibration factor $K(\\alpha)$ is determined for a zero-drift ($s=0$) pulse. For an input $x'[n] = A\\,h[n]+b_0$, the filtered output is $y'[n]$, and the estimate $y'[0]/K(\\alpha)$ must equal $A$.\n$E[y'[0]] = \\mathcal{L}\\{A\\,h[n]\\}_0 + \\mathcal{L}\\{b_0\\}_0$.\nLet's find the response to a constant pedestal $b_0$. The input to the filter's differencing stage is $x[n]-x[n-1] = b_0 - b_0 = 0$. The filter recursion becomes $y[n] = \\alpha y[n-1]$. The steady-state response to a constant input is thus $y_{ss}=0$. So, $\\mathcal{L}\\{b_0\\}_0 = 0$.\nThe calibration condition becomes $A = E[y'[0]]/K(\\alpha) = (\\mathcal{L}\\{A\\,h[n]\\}_0)/K(\\alpha) = A(\\mathcal{L}\\{h[n]\\}_0)/K(\\alpha)$. This implies $K(\\alpha) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h[n]\\}_0$. Let's compute this value. The response to $h[n]$ starts from rest, so $y_h[n]=0$ for $n<0$. At $n=0$:\n$y_h[0] = \\alpha(y_h[-1] + h[0] - h[-1]) = \\alpha(0 + 1 - 0) = \\alpha$.\nSo, the calibration constant is $K(\\alpha) = \\alpha$.\n\nNow, we find the response to the linear drift component, $u[n] = s\\,n$. The input to the differencing stage is $u[n]-u[n-1] = s\\,n - s(n-1) = s$. The filter recursion for this component is $y_s[n] = \\alpha y_s[n-1] + \\alpha s$.\nThe problem states the filter is in steady state for $n<0$. The steady state value $y_{ss}$ satisfies $y_{ss} = \\alpha y_{ss} + \\alpha s$, which gives $y_{ss}(1-\\alpha) = \\alpha s$, or $y_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}$.\nSo, for $n<0$, the output is constant at this value. In particular, $y_s[-1] = \\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}$.\nThe output at $n=0$ is then:\n$y_s[0] = \\mathcal{L}\\{s\\,n\\}_0 = \\alpha y_s[-1] + \\alpha s = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}\\right) + \\alpha s = \\frac{\\alpha^2 s + \\alpha s(1-\\alpha)}{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}$.\n\nCombining all components for the total expected output at $n=0$:\n$$E[y[0]] = A\\,\\mathcal{L}\\{h[n]\\}_0 + \\mathcal{L}\\{b_0\\}_0 + \\mathcal{L}\\{s\\,n\\}_0 = A\\,K(\\alpha) + 0 + \\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}$$\nThe expectation of the amplitude estimator is:\n$$E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}] = \\frac{E[y[0]]}{K(\\alpha)} = \\frac{A\\,K(\\alpha) + \\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}}{K(\\alpha)} = A + \\frac{1}{K(\\alpha)}\\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting $K(\\alpha)=\\alpha$:\n$$E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}] = A + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{\\alpha s}{1-\\alpha} = A + \\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}$$\nThe bias is:\n$$B(\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}) = E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}] - A = \\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}$$\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. With event-by-event pedestal subtraction using $M$ pre-samples and the peak-sample estimator $\\hat A_{\\mathrm{ped}} = x[0] - \\hat b$, the expected amplitude bias is $+\\; s\\,\\frac{M+1}{2}$, and the estimator is unbiased if and only if $s = 0$.\nOur derived bias for this method is $B(\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{ped}}) = s \\frac{M+1}{2}$. This matches the expression in the option. Since $M \\ge 1$, the term $\\frac{M+1}{2}$ is always non-zero. Therefore, the bias is zero if and only if $s=0$. This statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. With the first-order high-pass filter $y[n] = \\alpha\\left(y[n-1] + x[n] - x[n-1]\\right)$ and calibrated single-sample estimator $\\hat A_{\\mathrm{HP}} = y[0]/K(\\alpha)$, the linear drift is completely removed by the differencing operation so the estimator is unbiased for any $s$ and $\\alpha$.\nOur derived bias for this method is $B(\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}) = \\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}$. Since $0 < \\alpha < 1$, the bias is non-zero whenever $s \\ne 0$. The differencing operation $x[n]-x[n-1]$ turns the linear drift $s\\,n$ into a constant step $s$, but the recursive nature of the filter results in a non-zero steady-state response to this step. The statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. Under the same high-pass scheme and steady-state initialization before the pulse, a linear drift $s$ produces an additive contribution at the output sample used for amplitude of magnitude $s/(1-\\alpha)$ after calibration, so the estimator is biased whenever $s \\ne 0$, with the bias increasing as $\\alpha \\to 1$.\nThe \"additive contribution...after calibration\" is precisely the bias term we calculated, $B(\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{HP}}) = \\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}$. This term is non-zero for $s \\ne 0$. As $\\alpha \\to 1$ from below, the denominator $1-\\alpha$ approaches $0$ from above, so the magnitude of the bias $|\\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}|$ increases towards infinity. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nD. Choosing the high-pass cutoff angular frequency sufficiently below the dominant spectral content of $h[n]$ guarantees unbiased amplitude for any nonzero $s$ when using a single filtered sample for amplitude.\nA low cutoff frequency is intended to pass the signal pulse $h[n]$ with little attenuation. A low cutoff frequency corresponds to a long time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{HP}}$, which means $\\alpha = e^{-T_s/\\tau_{\\mathrm{HP}}}$ approaches $1$. As shown in the analysis of option C, when $\\alpha \\to 1$, the bias $\\frac{s}{1-\\alpha}$ becomes very large, not zero. This statement claims the opposite of what is true.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nE. If the pedestal is computed from $M_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ pre-samples and $M_{\\mathrm{post}}$ post-samples with $M_{\\mathrm{pre}} = M_{\\mathrm{post}}$ symmetrically bracketing the peak and the amplitude is estimated as the peak sample minus this symmetric average, the expected bias due to any linear drift is zero, provided the pedestal samples are uncontaminated by the pulse.\nThis option proposes a new estimator. Let $M_{\\mathrm{pre}} = M_{\\mathrm{post}} = M_s$. The new pedestal estimate is $\\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{sym}} = \\frac{1}{2M_s}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{M_s} x[-k] + \\sum_{k=1}^{M_s} x[k]\\right)$. The amplitude estimate is $\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{sym}} = x[0] - \\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{sym}}$. We compute its expectation.\n$E[\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{sym}}] = E[x[0]] - E[\\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{sym}}]$.\nAs before, $E[x[0]] = A+b_0$.

            "introduction": "Extracting a signal's precise arrival time is as important as measuring its amplitude, and this process is fundamentally limited by electronic noise. This practice focuses on the core principles of time digitization, where a voltage noise is converted into a timing jitter depending on the signal's slew rate. You will derive the overall time resolution by combining various independent error sources and quantitatively compare a simple Leading-Edge Discriminator (LED) with a more advanced Constant-Fraction Discriminator (CFD) to see how clever circuit design can improve timing precision .",

            "problem": "A fast silicon sensor in a collider detector produces current pulses that, after front-end amplification with a single-pole response, appear at the discriminator input as voltage pulses modeled by $v(t) = A \\bigl(1 - \\exp(-(t - t_{0})/\\tau_{r})\\bigr) u(t - t_{0})$, where $A$ is the pulse amplitude, $\\tau_{r}$ is the rise time constant, $t_{0}$ is the true arrival time, and $u(\\cdot)$ is the unit step. The front-end contributes additive, stationary, zero-mean Gaussian electronic noise with root-mean-square (RMS) $\\sigma_{n}$ referred to the discriminator input. Two timing architectures are considered: a Leading-Edge Discriminator (LED) with a fixed threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and a Constant-Fraction Discriminator (CFD) implemented as a subtraction of a delayed and scaled copy, $v_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t) = v(t) - f\\,v(t - \\Delta)$, followed by a zero-crossing comparator. Assume the noise at the inputs of the CFD subtraction is uncorrelated and has the same RMS $\\sigma_{n}$ in each branch. The comparator in either architecture exhibits intrinsic timing jitter with RMS $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{disc}}$ that is independent of the input slew rate, and the Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) sampling clock contributes independent RMS jitter $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{clk}}$. All jitters are zero-mean Gaussian and mutually independent.\n\nStarting from first principles that connect a time pickoff defined by an implicit crossing condition to the effect of a small additive voltage perturbation on the inferred time, and using only core definitions and linearization, derive a general expression for the overall time resolution $\\sigma_{t}$ that combines the contributions of additive electronic noise, comparator intrinsic jitter, and TDC clock jitter for:\n- the LED, which defines $t_{\\ast}$ by $v(t_{\\ast}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and\n- the CFD, which defines $t_{\\ast}$ by $v_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t_{\\ast}) = 0$.\n\nFor the CFD, specialize your derivation to the given rising-exponential pulse and show explicitly how the effective slew rate and effective RMS noise at the zero-crossing depend on the fraction $f$ and the delay $\\Delta$, and identify any constraint on $\\Delta$ required for a valid zero crossing on the rising edge.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested time resolutions. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle connecting a small voltage perturbation (noise) $\\delta v$ to a small timing error (jitter) $\\delta t$ is derived by linearizing the signal $v(t)$ around the timing pickoff point $t_{\\ast}$. Let the pickoff time $t_{\\ast}$ be defined by an implicit condition $F(v(t_{\\ast})) = C$, where $C$ is a constant. In the presence of a small additive noise voltage $n(t)$, the condition is met at a slightly different time $t_{\\ast} + \\delta t$, so $F(v(t_{\\ast} + \\delta t) + n(t_{\\ast})) = C$.\n\nFor a simple threshold crossing, like in a Leading-Edge Discriminator (LED), the condition is $v(t_{\\ast}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. With noise, this becomes $v(t_{\\ast} + \\delta t) + n(t_{\\ast}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Taylor expanding $v(t)$ around $t_{\\ast}$ to first order gives $v(t_{\\ast} + \\delta t) \\approx v(t_{\\ast}) + \\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}} \\delta t$. Substituting this and the original condition $v(t_{\\ast}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ into the perturbed equation, we get $V_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}} \\delta t + n(t_{\\ast}) \\approx V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This simplifies to $\\delta t \\approx - \\frac{n(t_{\\ast})}{\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}}$.\n\nThe variance of the timing jitter, $\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise}}^2$, is the expectation value of $(\\delta t)^2$. Since the noise $n(t)$ is a stationairy zero-mean process with RMS value $\\sigma_n$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[n(t_{\\ast})^2] = \\sigma_n^2$. Therefore, the jitter contribution from electronic noise is given by\n$$\n\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise}}^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(\\delta t)^2] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[n(t_{\\ast})^2]}{\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_n}{\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}$ is the slew rate of the signal at the crossing time. The same principle applies to more complex timing signals, such as in a Constant-Fraction Discriminator (CFD), by using the effective slew rate and effective noise of the timing signal at its zero-crossing.\n\nThe total time resolution $\\sigma_t$ is the quadratic sum of all independent jitter sources. The problem specifies three such sources: electronic noise ($\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise}}$), intrinsic discriminator jitter ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{disc}}$), and TDC clock jitter ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{clk}}$). Thus, the total time resolution is:\n$$\n\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{disc}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{clk}}^2}\n$$\n\nWe now apply this framework to the LED and CFD architectures. The voltage pulse is given by $v(t) = A \\bigl(1 - \\exp(-(t - t_{0})/\\tau_{r})\\bigr) u(t - t_{0})$, where we can set $t_0=0$ without loss of generality for the calculation.\n\n**1. Leading-Edge Discriminator (LED)**\n\nFor the LED, the timing pickoff $t_{\\ast}$ is defined by $v(t_{\\ast}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$\nA \\bigl(1 - \\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_{r})\\bigr) = V_{\\mathrm{th}} \\implies \\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_{r}) = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{A} = \\frac{A - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{A}\n$$\nThe slew rate of the signal is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[A(1-\\exp(-t/\\tau_r))\\right] = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\exp(-t/\\tau_r)$.\nEvaluating the slew rate at the crossing time $t_{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r) = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\left(\\frac{A - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{A}\\right) = \\frac{A - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\tau_r}\n$$\nThe jitter contribution from noise is then:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise, LED}} = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{(A - V_{\\mathrm{th}})/\\tau_r} = \\frac{\\sigma_n \\tau_r}{A - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nThe total time resolution for the LED is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t, \\text{LED}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_n \\tau_r}{A - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{disc}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{clk}}^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Constant-Fraction Discriminator (CFD)**\n\nThe CFD forms a bipolar signal $v_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t) = v(t) - f\\,v(t - \\Delta)$, and the timing pickoff $t_{\\ast}$ is at its zero-crossing, $v_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t_{\\ast}) = 0$. This implies $v(t_{\\ast}) = f\\,v(t_{\\ast} - \\Delta)$.\n\nThe jitter is determined by the effective slew rate of $v_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t)$ and the effective noise on this signal. The effective slew rate at $t_{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{dv_{\\mathrm{CFD}}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} - f \\frac{d v(t - \\Delta)}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} - f \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}-\\Delta}\n$$\nThe noise on the CFD signal is $n_{\\mathrm{CFD}}(t) = n_1(t) - f n_2(t)$, where $n_1(t)$ and $n_2(t)$ are the noise contributions from the non-delayed and delayed branches, respectively. The problem states these are uncorrelated and each has RMS $\\sigma_n$. The variance of the effective noise is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{n, \\text{eff}}^2 = \\mathbb{E}[n_{\\mathrm{CFD}}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(n_1 - fn_2)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[n_1^2] - 2f\\mathbb{E}[n_1 n_2] + f^2\\mathbb{E}[n_2^2] = \\sigma_n^2 + f^2\\sigma_n^2 = (1+f^2)\\sigma_n^2\n$$\nSo, the effective RMS noise is $\\sigma_{n, \\text{eff}} = \\sigma_n \\sqrt{1+f^2}$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given pulse shape for a more explicit expression of $S_{\\text{eff}}$. The zero-crossing condition is:\n$$\nA(1-\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r)) = f A(1-\\exp(-(t_{\\ast}-\\Delta)/\\tau_r))\n$$\n$$\n1-\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r) = f(1-\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r)\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r))\n$$\nLetting $x = \\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r)$, we solve for $x$: $1-x = f(1-x\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)) \\implies 1-f = x(1-f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r))$, which gives\n$$\nx = \\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r) = \\frac{1-f}{1-f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)}\n$$\nFor a physically meaningful solution ($t_{\\ast}>0$), we need $0 < x < 1$. The numerator $1-f$ is positive since $f<1$. For the denominator to be positive, we require $1-f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r) > 0$, which yields the constraint on the delay $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta < \\tau_r \\ln(1/f)\n$$\nThe condition $x<1$ is always satisfied for $\\Delta>0$ and $f<1$.\n\nThe slew rate terms are:\n$\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}} = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r) = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r} \\frac{1-f}{1-f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)}$.\n$\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}-\\Delta} = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\exp(-(t_{\\ast}-\\Delta)/\\tau_r) = \\frac{A}{\\tau_r}\\exp(-t_{\\ast}/\\tau_r)\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r) = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)$.\n\nThe effective slew rate is thus:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} - f \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}}\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)\\right) = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\bigg|_{t_{\\ast}} \\left(1 - f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{dv}{dt}\\big|_{t_{\\ast}}$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{A}{\\tau_r} \\frac{1-f}{1-f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)}\\right) \\left(1 - f\\exp(\\Delta/\\tau_r)\\right) = \\frac{A(1-f)}{\\tau_r}\n$$\nThis is the explicit dependence of the effective slew rate. It depends on $f$ but not on $\\Delta$. The effective RMS noise, $\\sigma_{n, \\text{eff}} = \\sigma_n\\sqrt{1+f^2}$, depends on $f$ but not on $\\Delta$.\n\nThe jitter contribution from noise for the CFD is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t, \\text{noise, CFD}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{n, \\text{eff}}}{S_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_n \\sqrt{1+f^2}}{A(1-f)/\\tau_r} = \\frac{\\tau_r \\sigma_n \\sqrt{1+f^2}}{A(1-f)}\n$$\nThe total time resolution for the CFD is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t, \\text{CFD}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\tau_r \\sigma_n \\sqrt{1+f^2}}{A(1-f)}\\right)^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{disc}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{clk}}^2}\n$$\n\n**3.
