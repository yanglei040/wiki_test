We will calculate these quantities using standard models under the specified approximations.\n\n**1. Mean Collisional Energy Loss**\n\nThe mean rate of energy loss by ionization and excitation for a charged particle traversing a medium is given by the Bethe formula. The problem specifies to neglect shell and density-effect corrections. The formula for the mean energy loss per unit path length, $-\\frac{dE}{dx}$, is:\n$$\n-\\frac{dE}{dx} = K z^2 \\frac{Z}{A} \\rho \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{2 m_e c^2 \\beta^2 \\gamma^2 T_{\\text{max}}}{I^2}\\right) - \\beta^2 \\right]\n$$\nHere, $K$ is a constant, $z$ is the charge number of the incident particle, $Z$ and $A$ are the atomic number and molar mass of the absorber material, $\\rho$ is the density of the absorber, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the relativistic factors of the incident particle, $m_e c^2$ is the electron rest energy, $I$ is the mean excitation energy of the absorber, and $T_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum kinetic energy transferable to an electron in a single collision.\n\nFirst, we determine the relativistic parameters for the $50\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ muon.\nThe muon rest energy is $m_\\mu c^2 = 105.658\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. The total energy is $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{GeV} = 50000\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\nThe Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_\\mu c^2} = \\frac{50000\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{105.658\\,\\mathrm{MeV}} \\approx 473.25\n$$\nThe relativistic velocity $\\beta$ is given by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.

It is a self-contained, scientifically-grounded, and well-posed problem that can be solved using fundamental kinematic principles.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the maximum drift time, $t_{max}$, and the corresponding Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) count, $C_{max}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum drift time. The maximum drift time corresponds to the longest possible path an electron must travel to reach the sense wire. The drift cell has a total width of $W = 2.5~\\mathrm{cm}$. The sense wire is located at the center of the cell. Therefore, the farthest point from which an electron can drift to the wire is the cell boundary.\n\nLet us set up a one-dimensional coordinate system with the origin $x=0$ at the location of the sense wire. The cell boundaries are then at $x = \\pm \\frac{W}{2}$. An electron is created by an ionizing particle passing through the gas. The maximum distance, $d_{max}$, an electron can be from the sense wire is half the cell width.\n$$d_{max} = \\frac{W}{2} = \\frac{2.5~\\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 1.25~\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe problem states a constant electron drift velocity, $v_d = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{m/ns}$. To calculate the drift time, we must ensure the units of distance and velocity are consistent. We convert $d_{max}$ from centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) to micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n$$1~\\mathrm{cm} = 10^4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$d_{max} = 1.25~\\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{10^4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1~\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.25 \\times 10^4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nUsing the fundamental kinematic relation for constant velocity, time $t$ is the ratio of distance $d$ to velocity $v$. The maximum drift time $t_{max}$ is therefore:\n$$t_{max} = \\frac{d_{max}}{v_d}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$t_{max} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{50~\\mu\\mathrm{m/ns}} = \\frac{12500}{50}~\\mathrm{ns} = 250~\\mathrm{ns}$$\nThis is the first required value. The provided electric field strength, $E$, is not needed for this calculation because the drift velocity $v_d$ is already specified.\n\nNext, we compute the corresponding TDC count. The TDC converts the measured time into a digital value (a count). The relationship is given as linear: the count $C$ is the time $t$ divided by the TDC bin width $\\tau$.\n$$C = \\frac{t}{\\tau}$$\nThe bin width is given as $\\tau = 0.78~\\mathrm{ns/bin}$. We need to find the count, $C_{max}$, that corresponds to the maximum drift time, $t_{max}$.\n$$C_{max} = \\frac{t_{max}}{\\tau} = \\frac{250~\\mathrm{ns}}{0.78~\\mathrm{ns/bin}}$$\n$$C_{max} \\approx 320.51282...$$\n\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $3$, $2$, and $0$. The fourth significant digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the last significant digit. Thus, $320$ is rounded up to $321$.\n$$C_{max} \\approx 321$$\n\nThe two computed quantities are the maximum drift time, $t_{max} = 250~\\mathrm{ns}$, and the corresponding TDC count, $C_{max} \\approx 321$.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe evolution of the electron cloud's number density, $n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, is described by the drift-diffusion equation. In the absence of sources or sinks, this is a continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by the sum of a drift term and a diffusion term (Fick's law): $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{v}_d n - D \\nabla n$. Let's assume the drift is along the $z$-axis, so the drift velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v}_d = (0, 0, v_d)$. The diffusion is assumed to be isotropic with coefficient $D$, as implied by the \"thermal regime\" condition. The drift-diffusion equation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + v_d \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z} = D \\nabla^2 n = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe consider a single ionization event at the origin at time $t=0$, which can be modeled as a delta function initial condition: $n(\\mathbf{r}, 0) = \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta(x)\\delta(y)\\delta(z)$. The solution to the drift-diffusion equation with this initial condition is a drifting Gaussian function:\n$$\nn(x, y, z, t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi D t)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + (z-v_d t)^2}{4Dt} \\right)\n$$\nThis function represents the probability density of finding an electron at position $(x, y, z)$ at time $t$.\n\nTo find the transverse spread, we consider the distribution in one of the transverse dimensions, for instance, $x$. We obtain the marginal probability density $P(x, t)$ by integrating $n(x, y, z, t)$ over the other coordinates, $y$ and $z$:\n$$\nP(x, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n(x, y, z, t) \\,dy \\,dz\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n$:\n$$\nP(x, t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi D t)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\,dy \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-v_d t)^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\,dz\n$$\nThe integrals are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.\nThe integral over $y$ yields $\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}$. The integral over $z$ also yields $\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $P(x,t)$:\n$$\nP(x, t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi D t)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) (\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}) (\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution for the position $x$ of the form $P(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$, with a mean $\\mu = 0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the variance $\\sigma_T^2$ of the transverse distribution:\n$$\n2\\sigma_T^2 = 4Dt \\implies \\sigma_T^2 = 2Dt\n$$\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) transverse width is the standard deviation, $\\sigma_T$. This completes the first part of the derivation:\n$$\n\\sigma_T(t, D) = \\sqrt{2Dt}\n$$\nFor the second part, we need to express $\\sigma_T$ in terms of the drift length $L$ and the tabulated parameter $D_T$. The drift length $L$ is the distance covered in time $t$ at a constant drift velocity $v_d$, so $L = v_d t$, which implies $t = L/v_d$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\sigma_T$:\n$$\n\\sigma_T = \\sqrt{2D \\left(\\frac{L}{v_d}\\right)} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{v_d}}\\right) \\sqrt{L}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the transverse RMS width $\\sigma_T$ scales as the square root of the drift length $L$. The problem defines the tabulated transverse diffusion parameter, which we here denote as $D_{T, \\text{tab}}$, as the constant of proportionality in this relationship. Thus, we have the definitional relation:\n$$\n\\sigma_T = D_{T, \\text{tab}} \\sqrt{L}\n$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\sigma_T$, we can relate the fundamental diffusion coefficient $D$ to the tabulated parameter $D_{T, \\text{tab}}$ as $D_{T, \\text{tab}} = \\sqrt{2D/v_d}$. The problem asks to express $\\sigma_T$ solely in terms of $L$ and this tabulated parameter, which is the equation $\\sigma_T = D_{T, \\text{tab}} \\sqrt{L}$. For the remainder of the solution, we will use $D_T$ to represent this tabulated value.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the transverse RMS width using the provided data:\n$D_{T} = 200~\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{cm}}$ and $L = 2~\\mathrm{cm}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_T = \\left(200~\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{cm}}}\\right) \\times \\sqrt{2~\\mathrm{cm}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_T = 200 \\times \\sqrt{2} ~\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_T \\approx 200 \\times 1.41421356 ~\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 282.842712 ~\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma_T \\approx 282.8 ~\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe final answer is the numerical value expressed in micrometers.",
