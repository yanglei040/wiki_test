We will calculate these quantities using standard models under the specified approximations.\n\n**1. Mean Collisional Energy Loss**\n\nThe mean rate of energy loss by ionization and excitation for a charged particle traversing a medium is given by the Bethe formula.

            "solution": "The evolution of the electron cloud's number density, $n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, is described by the drift-diffusion equation. In the absence of sources or sinks, this is a continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by the sum of a drift term and a diffusion term (Fick's law): $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{v}_d n - D \\nabla n$. Let's assume the drift is along the $z$-axis, so the drift velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v}_d = (0, 0, v_d)$. The diffusion is assumed to be isotropic with coefficient $D$, as implied by the \"thermal regime\" condition. The drift-diffusion equation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + v_d \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z} = D \\nabla^2 n = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe consider a single ionization event at the origin at time $t=0$, which can be modeled as a delta function initial condition: $n(\\mathbf{r}, 0) = \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta(x)\\delta(y)\\delta(z)$. The solution to the drift-diffusion equation with this initial condition is a drifting Gaussian function:\n$$\nn(x, y, z, t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi D t)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + (z-v_d t)^2}{4Dt} \\right)\n$$\nThis function represents the probability density of finding an electron at position $(x, y, z)$ at time $t$.\n\nTo find the transverse spread, we consider the distribution in one of the transverse dimensions, for instance, $x$. We obtain the marginal probability density $P(x, t)$ by integrating $n(x, y, z, t)$ over the other coordinates, $y$ and $z$:\n$$\nP(x, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n(x, y, z, t) \\,dy \\,dz\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n$:\n$$\nP(x, t) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi D t)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\,dy \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-v_d t)^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\,dz\n$$\nThe integrals are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.\nThe integral over $y$ yields $\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}$.

This completes the first part of the derivation:\n$$\n\\sigma_T(t, D) = \\sqrt{2Dt}\n$$\nFor the second part, we need to express $\\sigma_T$ in terms of the drift length $L$ and the tabulated parameter $D_T$. The drift length $L$ is the distance covered in time $t$ at a constant drift velocity $v_d$, so $L = v_d t$, which implies $t = L/v_d$.

The ideal crossing time, let's call it $t_0$, is defined by the condition $V(t_0) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nIn the presence of noise $n$, the measured crossing time $t$ will deviate from $t_0$. We can write $t = t_0 + \\delta t$, where $\\delta t$ represents the timing jitter or error we wish to characterize. Substituting this into the threshold condition gives:\n$$V(t_0 + \\delta t) + n = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the use of small-signal linearization. This corresponds to performing a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $V(t)$ around the ideal crossing time $t_0$.

The standard deviation of the time, $\\sigma_t$, is the standard deviation of the distribution of $\\delta t$ values. The noise $n$ is a random variable with mean $\\mu_n = 0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_n$. The slew rate, $S = \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right|_{t_0}$, is treated as a constant for a given signal shape at the threshold.\n\nUsing the standard formula for the propagation of uncertainty, for a function $f(x) = ax$, the variance is given by $\\sigma_f^2 = a^2 \\sigma_x^2$, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma_f = |a| \\sigma_x$. In our case, the timing error $\\delta t$ is a linear function of the noise $n$, with the constant of proportionality being $-1/S$.\n\nThe variance of the timing jitter, $\\sigma_t^2$, is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_t^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(\\delta t) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}\\left(-\\frac{n}{S}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{S}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(n) = \\frac{\\sigma_n^2}{S^2}$$\n\nTaking the square root gives the standard deviation of the timing jitter:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_n^2}{S^2}} = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{|S|}$$\nSince the problem states that $V(t)$ is a monotonically rising function, its derivative (the slew rate $S$) is positive, so the absolute value is not necessary. The final leading-order expression for the timing jitter is:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}}$$\nThis result shows that the timing jitter is directly proportional to the voltage noise and inversely proportional to the slew rate of the signal at the threshold-crossing point. A faster signal (larger $\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t$) results in better timing resolution.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\sigma_t$ for the given numerical values:\n- Noise standard deviation: $\\sigma_n = 1 \\text{ mV}$\n- Slew rate: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 50 \\text{ mV/ns}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\frac{1 \\text{ mV}}{50 \\text{ mV/ns}} = \\frac{1}{50} \\text{ ns} = 0.02 \\text{ ns}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in nanoseconds and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_t = 0.02000 \\text{ ns}$$\n\nFinally, we comment on the implications for bunch-crossing assignment at the LHC. The nominal bunch spacing at the LHC is $T_{\\mathrm{bunch}} = 25 \\text{ ns}$. The calculated timing jitter due to electronic noise is $\\sigma_t = 0.02 \\text{ ns}$. To assess the probability of mis-assignment, we consider the spread of the measured times. A vast majority of events will have their times measured within a few standard deviations of the mean. For instance, the interval $\\pm 3\\sigma_t$ covers approximately $99.7\\%$ of events, assuming the jitter follows a Gaussian distribution (a reasonable assumption since it arises from a sum of many small noise contributions). This interval corresponds to a width of $6\\sigma_t = 6 \\times 0.02 \\text{ ns} = 0.12 \\text{ ns}$. Even a more conservative interval of $\\pm 5\\sigma_t$ corresponds to a width of $10\\sigma_t = 0.2 \\text{ ns}$.\n\nBoth of these time windows ($0.12 \\text{ ns}$ and $0.2 \\text{ ns}$) are exceptionally small compared to the $25 \\text{ ns}$ bunch spacing. The ratio of the jitter spread to the bunch spacing is on the order of $0.2 / 25 = 0.008$, or less than $1\\%$. This means that the probability of the timing measurement fluctuating so much that it falls into an adjacent bunch crossing window is negligible. Therefore, based on this analysis of electronic noise, the front-end electronics are more than adequate for correctly assigning muon events to their parent bunch crossing. Other effects, such as the time-of-flight of the muon itself from the interaction point to the detector, would contribute a much larger, albeit systematic, component to the overall timing budget.",
