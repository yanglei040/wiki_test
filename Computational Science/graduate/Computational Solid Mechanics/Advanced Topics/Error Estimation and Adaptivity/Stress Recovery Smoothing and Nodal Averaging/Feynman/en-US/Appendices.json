The patch is the union of the four elements, $\\mathcal{S}(i) = \\bigcup_{e=1}^{4} e$. The stress field $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})$ is defined as $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)}$ for any point $\\mathbf{x}$ in element $e$.\n\nThe least-squares principle requires minimizing the squared $L^{2}$-norm of the error, which is the integral of the squared difference between the fields over the patch. The objective function to minimize is $J(\\sigma^{\\star})$:\n$$\nJ(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\int_{\\mathcal{S}(i)} (\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) - \\sigma^{\\star})^2 \\, dA\n$$\nSince the patch $\\mathcal{S}(i)$ is composed of the four elements, and assuming negligible overlap (i.e., they meet only at boundaries), the integral over the patch can be written as the sum of integrals over each element:\n$$\nJ(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\sum_{e=1}^{4} \\int_{e} (\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) - \\sigma^{\\star})^2 \\, dA\n$$\nWithin each element $e$, the stress $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})$ is the constant $\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)}$. Therefore, the integrand $(\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star})^2$ is constant over the domain of integration for each term in the summation. The integral over an element $e$ is simply this constant value multiplied by the area of the element, $A_e$:\n$$\nJ(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star})^2\n$$\nTo find the value of $\\sigma^{\\star}$ that minimizes this functional, we must find the stationary point by taking the derivative of $J$ with respect to $\\sigma^{\\star}$ and setting it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{d\\sigma^{\\star}} = 0\n$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{d\\sigma^{\\star}} = \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\cdot 2 (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\sigma^{\\star}}(\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star}) = \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\cdot 2 (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star}) \\cdot (-1) = -2 \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star})\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n-2 \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star}) = 0 \\implies \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e (\\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star}) = 0\n$$\nDistributing the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma^{\\star} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\sigma^{\\star}$ is constant with respect to the summation index $e$, it can be factored out of the second sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} - \\sigma^{\\star} \\left(\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e\\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma^{\\star}$ (which is $\\sigma_{xx}^{\\star}(i)$), we obtain the expression for the area-weighted average stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}^{\\star}(i) = \\frac{\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)}}{\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNext, we use the provided data to compute the numerical values.\nThe sum of the areas is:\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 120~\\text{mm}^2 + 80~\\text{mm}^2 + 200~\\text{mm}^2 + 100~\\text{mm}^2 = 500~\\text{mm}^2\n$$\nThe numerator is the sum of the products of area and stress for each element:\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} = (120 \\cdot 95) + (80 \\cdot 110) + (200 \\cdot 85) + (100 \\cdot 130) \\quad [\\text{MPa} \\cdot \\text{mm}^2]\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{e=1}^{4} A_e \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} = 11400 + 8800 + 17000 + 13000 = 50200~\\text{MPa} \\cdot \\text{mm}^2\n$$\nThe recovered nodal stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}^{\\star}(i) = \\frac{50200~\\text{MPa} \\cdot \\text{mm}^2}{500~\\text{mm}^2} = 100.4~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nNow we compute the unweighted arithmetic average, $\\overline{\\sigma}_{xx}^{\\,\\text{arith}}$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\sigma}_{xx}^{\\,\\text{arith}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{e=1}^{4} \\sigma_{xx}^{(e)} = \\frac{95 + 110 + 85 + 130}{4}~\\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\sigma}_{xx}^{\\,\\text{arith}} = \\frac{420}{4}~\\text{MPa} = 105~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta \\sigma_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx}^{\\star}(i) - \\overline{\\sigma}_{xx}^{\\,\\text{arith}} = 100.4~\\text{MPa} - 105~\\text{MPa} = -4.6~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{xx} = -4.600~\\text{MPa}\n$$",

It requires the construction of a stress field that satisfies both the differential equation of equilibrium and the boundary conditions.\n\nThe problem asks for a unique linear stress field $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x) = Ax + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants. To determine these two constants, we need two independent conditions. The problem provides three conditions: the equilibrium equation and two traction boundary conditions. This raises the possibility of the problem being overdetermined.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Condition**: The local static balance of linear momentum in one dimension is given by the differential equation:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} + b = 0 $$\n    Applying this to the linear recovered field gives:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dx}(Ax + B) + b = 0 \\implies A + b = 0 \\implies A = -b $$\n\n2.  **Boundary Conditions**: The traction $\\bar{t}$ is related to the stress $\\sigma$ by Cauchy's formula, $\\bar{t} = \\sigma n$.\n    -   At $x=0$: $\\bar{t}(0) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) n(0)$. With $n(0)=-1$, this gives $\\bar{t}(0) = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0)$.\n      Substituting $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) = A(0) + B = B$, we get $\\bar{t}(0) = -B$, or $B = -\\bar{t}(0)$.\n    -   At $x=L$: $\\bar{t}(L) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(L) n(L)$. With $n(L)=+1$, this gives $\\bar{t}(L) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(L)$.\n      Substituting $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(L) = AL + B$, we get the third condition: $\\bar{t}(L) = AL + B$.\n\nA unique solution exists only if these three conditions are consistent. Substituting the values of $A = -b$ and $B = -\\bar{t}(0)$ into the third condition gives a consistency requirement:\n$$ \\bar{t}(L) = (-b)L + (-\\bar{t}(0)) \\implies \\bar{t}(L) + \\bar{t}(0) + bL = 0 $$\nThis equation represents the global equilibrium of the bar, stating that the sum of external forces (from tractions and body force) must be zero. Let's verify this with the given numerical values:\n$$ (1.199215 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) + (-1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) + (7.85 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^{3}})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}) $$\n$$ = (119921500 - 120000000 + 78500)\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ = (-78500 + 78500)\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 0 $$\nThe given data are consistent and satisfy global equilibrium. Therefore, the problem is not overconstrained but is well-posed, admitting a unique solution. The information regarding the individual element lengths ($L_1$, $L_2$) is contextual to the finite element method and is not required for the construction of this particular patch-level recovered field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the unique linear recovered stress field $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x)$ that is in equilibrium with the body force $b$ and satisfies the traction boundary conditions. We assume the linear form for the stress field:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x) = Ax + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, we enforce the local equilibrium condition. The one-dimensional equation for static equilibrium is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} + b = 0 $$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x)$ must satisfy this equation, we substitute its linear form:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(Ax + B) + b = 0 $$\n$$ A + b = 0 $$\nThis yields the constant $A$:\n$$ A = -b $$\nSubstituting the given value for $b$:\n$$ A = -7.85 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^{3}} $$\n\nNext, we use the boundary conditions to determine the constant $B$. The relationship between traction $\\bar{t}$ and stress $\\sigma$ is given by Cauchy's formula, $\\bar{t} = \\sigma n$. We apply this at the boundary $x=0$.\n$$ \\bar{t}(0) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) \\cdot n(0) $$\nWe are given $\\bar{t}(0) = -1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $n(0) = -1$.\n$$ -1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) \\cdot (-1) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) = 1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nFrom the assumed linear form of the stress field, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0) = A(0) + B = B $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0)$, we find the constant $B$:\n$$ B = 1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n\nHaving determined both constants $A$ and $B$, we can now construct the explicit function for the recovered stress field:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x) = Ax + B $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x) = (-7.85 \\times 10^{4})x + (1.20 \\times 10^{8}) $$\nRearranging to a more standard form:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rec}}(x) = 1.20 \\times 10^{8} - 7.85 \\times 10^{4} x $$\nThe units of the expression are pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), as required. The problem is now solved. The information about $L_1$ and $L_2$ was not necessary for this calculation, as the recovered field was defined by continuum principles over the entire patch $x \\in [0, L]$.",
