            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and analysis of a refinement matrix for a B-spline curve under sequential knot insertion. We will proceed by first principles, as requested. The problem refers to a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS), but provides a control vector in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, which corresponds to four scalar control points. This setup describes a B-spline function, which is a special case of a NURBS curve with all weights equal to unity. The standard knot insertion algorithm (Boehm's algorithm) applies directly to the control points in this case.\n\nA B-spline curve of degree $p$ is defined by a set of control points $\\mathbf{P}_i$ and a knot vector $\\Xi$. The curve is guaranteed to be invariant under knot insertion if the control points are updated according to specific local convex combination rules. Let the initial curve be $\\mathbf{C}(\\xi) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_{i,p}(\\xi) \\mathbf{P}_i$ over the knot vector $\\Xi = \\{\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_{n+p+1}\\}$. When a new knot $\\bar{\\xi}$ is inserted, such that $\\xi_k \\le \\bar{\\xi} < \\xi_{k+1}$, a new set of $n+1$ control points $\\bar{\\mathbf{P}}_i$ and a new knot vector $\\bar{\\Xi}$ are generated. The curve-invariance principle, combined with the Cox-de Boor recursion for B-spline basis functions, yields the following update rules for the control points, known as Boehm's algorithm:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathbf{P}}_i = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{P}_i & \\text{for } 1 \\le i \\le k-p \\\\\n(1 - \\alpha_i) \\mathbf{P}_{i-1} + \\alpha_i \\mathbf{P}_i & \\text{for } k-p+1 \\le i \\le k \\\\\n\\mathbf{P}_{i-1} & \\text{for } k+1 \\le i \\le n+1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere the coefficient $\\alpha_i$ is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\bar{\\xi} - \\xi_i}{\\xi_{i+p} - \\xi_i}\n$$\nThese formulas define the local convex combination relations. For $k-p+1 \\le i \\le k$, the new control point $\\bar{\\mathbf{P}}_i$ is a convex combination of two adjacent old control points, $\\mathbf{P}_{i-1}$ and $\\mathbf{P}_i$, since $0 \\le \\alpha_i < 1$ for a knot $\\bar{\\xi}$ inserted with multiplicity one in the open interval $(\\xi_k, \\xi_{k+1})$.\n\nWe now apply this procedure for the two specified knot insertions.\n\n**Step 1: First Knot Insertion at $\\xi = \\frac{1}{4}$**\nThe initial setup is a degree $p=2$ curve with $n^{(0)}=4$ control points $\\mathbf{C}^{(0)} = [\\mathbf{P}_1^{(0)}, \\mathbf{P}_2^{(0)}, \\mathbf{P}_3^{(0)}, \\mathbf{P}_4^{(0)}]^T$ and knot vector $\\Xi^{(0)} = [\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_7] = [0,0,0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1,1,1]$.

For rows corresponding to unchanged control points, the entries are $0$ or $1$. For rows corresponding to new control points, the coefficients are $1-\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_i$. Since $\\xi_k \\le \\bar{\\xi} < \\xi_{k+1}$, and for the affected control points $\\xi_i \\le \\bar{\\xi}$ and $\\xi_{i+p} > \\bar{\\xi}$, we have $0 \\le \\alpha_i < 1$. Thus, all entries in $\\mathbf{T}^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf{T}^{(2)}$ are non-negative. The product of two non-negative matrices is a non-negative matrix, since its entries are sums of products of non-negative numbers: $T_{ij} = \\sum_k T^{(2)}_{ik} T^{(1)}_{kj} \\ge 0$. Direct inspection of the computed $\\mathbf{T}$ confirms that all its entries are non-negative.\n2.  **Row Sums to Unity ($\\sum_j T_{ij} = 1$):** This property ensures that the basis functions form a partition of unity, a fundamental property inherited through refinement. For any local refinement matrix, say $\\mathbf{A}$, the rows sum to $1$. This is because each new control point is either a copy of an old one (row has a single $1$) or a convex combination $(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{P}_{j-1} + \\alpha\\mathbf{P}_j$ (row entries are $(1-\\alpha)$ and $\\alpha$, summing to $1$). A matrix whose rows each sum to $1$ is called a row-stochastic matrix. Let $\\mathbf{e}_k$ be a column vector of $k$ ones. The row-sum property is equivalent to $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{e}_{n} = \\mathbf{e}_{m}$. For our refinement matrices, $\\mathbf{T}^{(1)}\\mathbf{e}_{4} = \\mathbf{e}_{5}$ and $\\mathbf{T}^{(2)}\\mathbf{e}_{5} = \\mathbf{e}_{6}$. The product of two row-stochastic matrices is also row-stochastic:\n    $(\\mathbf{T}^{(2)}\\mathbf{T}^{(1)})\\mathbf{e}_4 = \\mathbf{T}^{(2)}(\\mathbf{T}^{(1)}\\mathbf{e}_4) = \\mathbf{T}^{(2)}\\mathbf{e}_5 = \\mathbf{e}_6$.\n    Thus, each row of $\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{T}^{(2)}\\mathbf{T}^{(1)}$ must sum to $1$. We can verify this explicitly on the computed $\\mathbf{T}$:\n    Row 1: $1+0+0+0=1$\n    Row 2: $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}+0+0=1$\n    Row 3: $0+\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}+0=1$\n    Row 4: $0+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}+0=1$\n    Row 5: $0+0+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1$\n    Row 6: $0+0+0+1=1$\n    The verification is successful.\n\n**Final Computation of $S$**\nThe scalar $S$ is the sum of all entries in the matrix $\\mathbf{T}$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} T_{ij}\n$$\nThis can be computed as the sum of the row sums:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{4} T_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nAs we have just proven and verified, the sum of each row is $1$. Therefore:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} 1 = 6\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is the number of rows in the final refinement matrix $\\mathbf{T}$.",

The surface is constructed from univariate B-spline bases of degrees $p$ in $u$ and $q$ in $v$, respectively, and control points associated through a tensor-product structure. The application context is computational solid mechanics, where the continuity of the basis functions across knot lines influences both the smoothness of geometric representation and the approximation properties of the field variables. You are told that the surface has degree $p=q=3$, that there is an interior knot line in $u$ with multiplicity $m_{u}=2$, and that there is an interior knot line in $v$ with multiplicity $m_{v}=1$.

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the orders of continuity of a tensor-product B-spline surface at specified locations. The solution must be derived from foundational principles rather than by quoting established formulas. The given parameters are the polynomial degrees $p=3$ in the $u$-direction and $q=3$ in the $v$-direction, and the multiplicities of interior knot lines, $m_u=2$ in the $u$-direction and $m_v=1$ in the $v$-direction.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the degree of a univariate B-spline basis, the multiplicity of a knot, and the order of continuity at that knot. Let us consider a univariate B-spline basis of degree $p$ defined on a knot vector $U = \\{u_0, u_1, \\dots\\}$. The basis functions, denoted $N_{i,p}(u)$, are piecewise polynomials of degree $p$. They can be defined by the Cox–de Boor recursion formula:\n$$ N_{i,p}(u) = \\frac{u - u_i}{u_{i+p} - u_i} N_{i,p-1}(u) + \\frac{u_{i+p+1} - u}{u_{i+p+1} - u_{i+1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(u) $$\nThe recursion starts with degree-0 basis functions, $N_{i,0}(u)$, which are piecewise constant: \n$$ N_{i,0}(u) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } u \\in [u_i, u_{i+1}) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nA degree-0 basis function is discontinuous at the knots $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$. We denote this as $C^{-1}$ continuity.\n\nA key property, derivable from the recursion, concerns the derivative of a B-spline basis function:\n$$ \\frac{d}{du} N_{i,p}(u) = p \\left( \\frac{N_{i,p-1}(u)}{u_{i+p} - u_i} - \\frac{N_{i+1,p-1}(u)}{u_{i+p+1} - u_{i+1}} \\right) $$\nThis shows that the derivative of a B-spline of degree $p$ is a linear combination of B-splines of degree $p-1$. By repeated application, the $k$-th derivative of a degree-$p$ spline is a spline of degree $p-k$ defined on the same knot vector.\n\nThe continuity of a spline at a knot depends on the multiplicity of that knot. Let a knot $\\bar{u}$ have multiplicity $m$.\nThis implies that $m$ consecutive knots in the knot vector are equal to $\\bar{u}$.\nThe continuity of a spline of degree $d$ is reduced at a knot of increased multiplicity. A discontinuity ($C^{-1}$) can occur in a spline of degree $d$ at a knot of multiplicity $m = d+1$. For instance, a degree-0 spline ($d=0$) is discontinuous at a simple knot ($m=1$). A degree-1 spline ($d=1$) can be made discontinuous at a knot of multiplicity $m=2$.\n\nLet's use this insight to determine the continuity of a degree-$p$ spline at a knot of multiplicity $m$.\nWe examine its derivatives.\nThe $(p-m)$-th derivative of the spline is itself a spline of degree $p-(p-m) = m$. This degree-$m$ spline is evaluated at a knot of multiplicity $m$. For a degree-$m$ spline to be discontinuous, it would require a knot of multiplicity $m+1$. Since the knot multiplicity is only $m$, this degree-$m$ spline is at least continuous ($C^0$).\nNow consider the $(p-m+1)$-th derivative. This is a spline of degree $p-(p-m+1) = m-1$. This degree-$(m-1)$ spline is evaluated at a knot of multiplicity $m$. A spline of degree $d=m-1$ can be discontinuous at a knot of multiplicity $m = (m-1)+1$. Therefore, the $(p-m+1)$-th derivative may be discontinuous.\n\nSince the $(p-m)$-th derivative is continuous and the $(p-m+1)$-th derivative can be discontinuous, by definition, the original degree-$p$ spline has a continuity order of $C^{p-m}$ at a knot of multiplicity $m$. Any spline function, being a linear combination of these basis functions, will have at least this order of continuity.\n\nWith this fundamental relationship, $c = p - m$, established, we can solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Continuity across the interior knot line in $u$, $c_u$**:\n    The surface is a tensor-product of B-spline bases. The continuity in the $u$-direction is governed solely by the univariate B-spline basis in $u$.\n    Given: degree $p=3$, knot multiplicity $m_u=2$.\n    The continuity order $c_u$ is:\n    $$ c_u = p - m_u = 3 - 2 = 1 $$\n    So, the surface is $C^1$ continuous across the entire interior knot line defined by $u=\\text{constant}$.\n\n2.  **Directional continuity orders at the intersection point, $(c_u^*, c_v^*)$**:\n    The intersection point occurs where the knot line in $u$ (say, at $u=\\bar{u}$) and the knot line in $v$ (say, at $v=\\bar{v}$) cross. We need to find the directional continuities at $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{v})$.\n\n    -   **Continuity along $u$, $c_u^*$**: To find the continuity in the $u$-direction at this specific point, we can analyze the curve $\\mathbf{S}(u, \\bar{v})$ obtained by fixing $v=\\bar{v}$. This curve is a B-spline curve of degree $p=3$ whose basis functions and knot vector in $u$ are identical to those of the parent surface. The control points of this curve are linear combinations of the surface's control points, but this does not affect the continuity, which is a property of the basis. Therefore, the continuity of this curve at $u=\\bar{u}$ is the same as the continuity of the surface everywhere along the line $u=\\bar{u}$.\n    Given: degree $p=3$, knot multiplicity $m_u=2$.\n    The continuity order $c_u^*$ is:\n    $$ c_u^* = p - m_u = 3 - 2 = 1 $$\n\n    -   **Continuity along $v$, $c_v^*$**: Similarly, to find the continuity in the $v$-direction at $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{v})$, we analyze the curve $\\mathbf{S}(\\bar{u}, v)$ obtained by fixing $u=\\bar{u}$. This is a B-spline curve of degree $q=3$ with the same basis and knot vector in $v$ as the parent surface. Its continuity at $v=\\bar{v}$ depends on $q$ and the multiplicity of the knot $\\bar{v}$, which is $m_v=1$.\n    Given: degree $q=3$, knot multiplicity $m_v=1$.\n    The continuity order $c_v^*$ is:\n    $$ c_v^* = q - m_v = 3 - 1 = 2 $$\n\nCombining these results, the required values are $c_u=1$, $c_u^*=1$, and $c_v^*=2$. The problem asks for the answer as a row matrix $\\left[c_{u},\\,c_{u}^{\\ast},\\,c_{v}^{\\ast}\\right]$.\nThe final result is $[1, 1, 2]$.",

            "problem": "Consider a quadratic Analysis-Suitable T-spline (ASTS) basis over the parametric domain $\\Omega$ with a uniform initial T-mesh defined by vertical lines at $u=0,1,2,3$ and horizontal lines at $v=0,1,2,3$. The mesh thus contains $3\\times 3$ faces bounded by these lines. For quadratic degree ($p=q=2$), anchors are associated with face centers, and the number of basis functions equals the number of faces. Index the anchors by row-major face ordering with the identifier map $I(i,j)=(j-1)\\cdot 3+i$ for column $i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and row $j\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, so that the central face $(i=2,j=2)$ has identifier $I(2,2)=5$.\n\nA local refinement inserts a single T-junction by adding a vertical mesh segment at $u=1.5$ inside the central face $(i=2,j=2)$ that starts on the top edge at $v=2$ and terminates on the midpoint of the bottom edge at $v=1$, thereby creating a T-junction at $(u=1.5,v=1)$. This splits the central face into two faces, a left subface $(2\\mathrm{L},2)$ with $u\\in[1,1.5]$ and a right subface $(2\\mathrm{R},2)$ with $u\\in[1.5,2]$. Assign new identifiers to these added anchors as $I(2\\mathrm{L},2)=10$ and $I(2\\mathrm{R},2)=11$. Assume the Analysis-Suitable T-spline extension rule for $p=q=2$ is enforced entirely within the row $j=2$ so that no additional faces are created and no T-junction extensions intersect; the new vertical segment at $u=1.5$ becomes part of the local index selection for anchors adjacent to the central face in the $u$-direction in row $j=2$.\n\nUsing only the defining properties of Analysis-Suitable T-splines for even degree ($p=2$) and the construction of local index vectors from neighboring mesh lines, determine:\n- The change $\\Delta N$ in the total number of basis functions after the refinement.\n- The identifiers of the anchors that are added by the refinement.\n- The identifiers of the anchors whose local index vectors are altered by the insertion of the vertical segment at $u=1.5$ (while they remain present as anchors), specifically within row $j=2$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single row matrix containing five entries in the following order: $\\Delta N$, $I_{\\text{add},1}$, $I_{\\text{add},2}$, $I_{\\text{alt},1}$, $I_{\\text{alt},2}$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a local refinement step on a quadratic Analysis-Suitable T-spline (ASTS) basis. We must determine the change in the number of basis functions, identify the newly added basis functions (via their anchor identifiers), and identify the existing basis functions whose definitions are altered by the refinement.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state. The problem defines a uniform $3 \\times 3$ T-mesh over the parametric domain $\\Omega$, with knot lines at $u \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ and $v \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This creates $9$ faces. For quadratic ASTS ($p=q=2$), there is a one-to-one correspondence between faces, anchors, and basis functions. Therefore, the initial number of basis functions is $N_0 = 9$. The anchors are indexed using the map $I(i,j) = (j-1) \\cdot 3 + i$ for column $i$ and row $j$. The anchors in the central row ($j=2$) are:\n- $I(1,2) = (2-1) \\cdot 3 + 1 = 4$\n- $I(2,2) = (2-1) \\cdot 3 + 2 = 5$\n- $I(3,2) = (2-1) \\cdot 3 + 3 = 6$\n\nThe local refinement operation consists of inserting a vertical mesh segment at $u=1.5$ that spans from $v=2$ to $v=1$. This segment bisects the central face, which corresponds to anchor $I(2,2) = 5$. The original face, defined by $u \\in [1,2]$ and $v \\in [1,2]$, is replaced by two new faces: a left subface for $u \\in [1,1.5]$ and a right subface for $u \\in [1.5,2]$, both over $v \\in [1,2]$.\n\n1.  **Change in the Number of Basis Functions ($\\Delta N$)**\n    The number of basis functions is equal to the number of faces (and anchors). The described refinement removes one face (the original central face) and adds two new faces in its place.\n    - Initial number of faces/basis functions: $N_0 = 9$.\n    - Final number of faces/basis functions: $N_f = N_0 - 1 + 2 = 10$.\n    The change in the total number of basis functions is:\n    $$ \\Delta N = N_f - N_0 = 10 - 9 = 1 $$\n\n2.  **Identifiers of Added Anchors ($I_{\\text{add}}$)**\n    The refinement replaces the anchor of the original central face, $I(2,2)=5$, with two new anchors corresponding to the two new subfaces. The problem statement explicitly assigns identifiers to these new anchors:\n    - Anchor for the left subface $(2\\mathrm{L},2)$: $I(2\\mathrm{L},2) = 10$.\n    - Anchor for the right subface $(2\\mathrm{R},2)$: $I(2\\mathrm{R},2) = 11$.\n    Thus, the identifiers of the added anchors are $10$ and $11$.\n\n3.  **Identifiers of Altered Anchors ($I_{\\text{alt}}$)**\n    The definition of a T-spline basis function $N_a$ associated with an anchor $a$ is determined by its local knot vectors. For a quadratic ($p=2$) T-spline, the local knot vector in a given parametric direction (e.g., $u$-direction) is constructed by collecting the knot values of the first $p/2+1 = 2/2+1 = 2$ distinct mesh lines crossed by a ray cast from the anchor in the positive and negative directions. An existing basis function is altered if its local knot vector changes. This occurs if the set of mesh lines it \"sees\" changes.\n\n    The refinement introduces a new vertical segment at $u=1.5$ only on the interval $v \\in [1,2]$. This means that only anchors whose rays are cast at a $v$-coordinate within this interval can be affected. The anchors are located at the centers of their respective faces.\n    - Anchors in row $j=1$ (e.g., $I(1,1)=1$, $I(2,1)=2$, $I(3,1)=3$): These anchors are centered at $v=0.5$. Rays cast from these anchors do not cross the $v$-interval $[1,2]$ and thus do not \"see\" the new line at $u=1.5$. Their local index vectors are unchanged.\n    - Anchors in row $j=3$ (e.g., $I(1,3)=7$, $I(2,3)=8$, $I(3,3)=9$): These anchors are centered at $v=2.5$. For the same reason, their local index vectors are also unchanged.\n    - Anchors in row $j=2$ (e.g., $I(1,2)=4$, $I(3,2)=6$): These anchors are centered at $v=1.5$, which lies within the interval $v \\in [1,2]$. Their local index vectors in the $u$-direction are potentially altered. Let's analyze them.\n\n    **Anchor $I(1,2)=4$**: This anchor is at the center of the face $[0,1] \\times [1,2]$, with coordinates $(0.5, 1.5)$.\n    - We examine the ray cast in the positive $u$-direction from $u=0.5$.\n    - **Before refinement**: The set of vertical mesh lines is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The ray first crosses $u=1$, then $u=2$. The collected lines are $\\{1, 2\\}$.\n    - **After refinement**: The set of vertical mesh lines visible from $v=1.5$ is $\\{0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3\\}$. The ray first crosses $u=1$, then $u=1.5$. The collected lines are $\\{1, 1.5\\}$.\n    - Since the set of lines used to construct the local knot vector has changed, the basis function associated with anchor $4$ is altered.\n\n    **Anchor $I(3,2)=6$**: This anchor is at the center of the face $[2,3] \\times [1,2]$, with coordinates $(2.5, 1.5)$.\n    - We examine the ray cast in the negative $u$-direction from $u=2.5$.\n    - **Before refinement**: The set of vertical mesh lines is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The ray first crosses $u=2$, then $u=1$. The collected lines are $\\{2, 1\\}$.\n    - **After refinement**: The set of vertical mesh lines visible from $v=1.5$ is $\\{0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3\\}$. The ray first crosses $u=2$, then $u=1.5$. The collected lines are $\\{2, 1.5\\}$.\n    - The local knot vector for anchor $6$ is also altered.\n\n    The problem confirms our scope by asking specifically for altered anchors \"within row $j=2$\". The anchor $I(2,2)=5$ is removed, not altered. Therefore, the identifiers of the anchors whose basis functions are altered are $4$ and $6$.\n\n    **Summary of Results:**\n    - Change in number of basis functions: $\\Delta N = 1$.\n    - Identifiers of added anchors: $10$ and $11$.\n    - Identifiers of altered anchors in row $j=2$: $4$ and $6$.\n\n    The final answer is a row matrix containing these five values in the specified order: $(\\Delta N, I_{\\text{add},1}, I_{\\text{add},2}, I_{\\text{alt},1}, I_{\\text{alt},2})$. We will list the added and altered identifiers in increasing order.\n\n    The final set of values is $(1, 10, 11, 4, 6)$.",
