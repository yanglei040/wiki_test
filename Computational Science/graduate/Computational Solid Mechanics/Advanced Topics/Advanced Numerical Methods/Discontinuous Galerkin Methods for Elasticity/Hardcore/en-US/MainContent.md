## Introduction
In the field of [computational solid mechanics](@entry_id:169583), the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has emerged as a powerful and flexible alternative to traditional continuous [finite element methods](@entry_id:749389). Its inherent ability to handle discontinuities, accommodate complex geometries, and support local variations in polynomial degree makes it uniquely suited for a new generation of engineering challenges that push the limits of classical simulation techniques. This article addresses the need for a comprehensive guide to DG methods for elasticity, bridging the gap between abstract theory and practical application. It provides a structured journey from first principles to advanced modeling concepts, empowering readers to understand, analyze, and apply this versatile framework.

The exploration is divided into three comprehensive chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork, systematically deriving the DG formulation for [linear elasticity](@entry_id:166983) and examining its core mathematical properties. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates the method's power by extending it to complex problems in [nonlinear mechanics](@entry_id:178303), fracture, [multiphysics](@entry_id:164478), and [uncertainty quantification](@entry_id:138597). Finally, **Hands-On Practices** provides targeted exercises to solidify key theoretical and implementation concepts. We begin our deep dive by constructing the DG framework from the foundational equations of elasticity.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Having established the fundamental importance of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods in the introductory chapter, we now delve into the principles and mechanisms that govern their formulation for problems in linear elasticity. Our objective is to construct a robust numerical framework from first principles. We will begin by reviewing the foundational equations of elasticity and their standard [weak form](@entry_id:137295), which will serve as a point of departure. We will then introduce the unique mathematical language of discontinuous spaces—replete with jumps, averages, and broken Sobolev norms—that is the hallmark of DG methods. With these tools, we will systematically derive the most common variant, the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method, and explore its key properties, including consistency, stability, and convergence. Finally, we will address advanced topics such as the selection of penalty parameters, the challenge of [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606), and the architecture of related methods like the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme.

### From Continuous Strong Form to Conforming Weak Form

The behavior of a static, small-strain, linear elastic body occupying a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is governed by a set of coupled partial differential equations and boundary conditions, collectively known as the **strong form** of the problem. This form constitutes a direct mathematical statement of the underlying physical principles.

First, the **[balance of linear momentum](@entry_id:193575)** requires that the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, is balanced by the applied body force density, $\boldsymbol{f}$:
$$ -\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{f} \quad \text{in } \Omega $$
In a classical Cauchy continuum, the **[balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848)**, in the absence of body couples, further imposes the crucial condition that the stress tensor must be symmetric, i.e., $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\top}$. This symmetry is a fundamental property that will have profound implications for the structure of the [weak form](@entry_id:137295). 

Second, the **kinematic relationship** connects the strain in the material to the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476), $\boldsymbol{u}$. For small deformations, the appropriate measure of strain is the symmetric part of the [displacement gradient](@entry_id:165352), known as the [infinitesimal strain tensor](@entry_id:167211), $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})$:
$$ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla \boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^{\top}\right) $$
The use of the symmetric gradient, rather than the full gradient $\nabla \boldsymbol{u}$, is essential. It ensures that rigid-body motions, which produce no deformation and hence no stress, result in zero strain. This is a manifestation of the [principle of material frame-indifference](@entry_id:188488). 

Third, the **constitutive law**, or stress-strain relation, describes the material's response. For a linear elastic material, this is Hooke's law, which states that the stress is a linear function of the strain. This relationship is mediated by the [fourth-order elasticity tensor](@entry_id:188318), $\mathbb{C}$:
$$ \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathbb{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) $$
For a homogeneous and [isotropic material](@entry_id:204616), characterized by Lamé parameters $\lambda \ge 0$ and $\mu > 0$, the [elasticity tensor](@entry_id:170728) takes a specific form. In modern, coordinate-free notation, it is expressed as:
$$ \mathbb{C} = 2\mu\, I_s + \lambda\,(\mathbf{1}\otimes\mathbf{1}) $$
Here, $\mathbf{1}$ is the second-order identity tensor, and $I_s$ is the fourth-order symmetric identity tensor. The action of $I_s$ on any second-order tensor is to return its symmetric part: $I_s : A = \frac{1}{2}(A + A^{\top})$. Its components are $(I_s)_{ijkl} = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk})$. Since the strain tensor $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})$ is already symmetric, $I_s : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})$. The term $(\mathbf{1}\otimes\mathbf{1})$ acts on a tensor to produce its trace scaled by the identity tensor: $(\mathbf{1}\otimes\mathbf{1}) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) = \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}))\,\mathbf{1}$. Combining these, the isotropic stress-strain law becomes the familiar expression:
$$ \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}) = 2\mu\,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) + \lambda\,\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}))\,\mathbf{1} $$
where $\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})) = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}$. 

These equations are supplemented by boundary conditions. On the Dirichlet boundary $\Gamma_D$, the displacement is prescribed, $\boldsymbol{u} = \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}$. On the Neumann boundary $\Gamma_N$, the traction is prescribed, $\boldsymbol{t} = \boldsymbol{\sigma n} = \bar{\boldsymbol{t}}$, where $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal. 

To derive the standard **weak form**, we multiply the momentum balance equation by a suitable vector-valued [test function](@entry_id:178872), $\boldsymbol{v}$, and integrate over the domain $\Omega$. Applying [integration by parts](@entry_id:136350) (the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271)) transfers a derivative from the stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ to the test function $\boldsymbol{v}$:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}) : \nabla \boldsymbol{v} \, dx - \int_{\partial\Omega} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{n}) \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, ds = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, dx $$
Because the stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})$ is symmetric, its double-dot product with the skew-symmetric part of $\nabla \boldsymbol{v}$ is zero. This means we can replace $\nabla \boldsymbol{v}$ with its symmetric part, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v})$, without changing the result. This reveals the work-conjugate pairing between [stress and strain](@entry_id:137374):
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) \, dx - \int_{\partial\Omega} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{n}) \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, ds = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, dx $$
This step is only possible due to the symmetry of the stress tensor, which, as we noted, is a consequence of the [balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848). 

In a standard *conforming* finite element method, we require both the trial solution $\boldsymbol{u}$ and the [test function](@entry_id:178872) $\boldsymbol{v}$ to belong to a [function space](@entry_id:136890) where functions are continuous, such as the Sobolev space $[H^1(\Omega)]^d$. The Dirichlet boundary condition, $\boldsymbol{u} = \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}$, is enforced directly on the space of [trial functions](@entry_id:756165); it is an **essential** boundary condition. The [test functions](@entry_id:166589) are chosen from the corresponding space with homogeneous conditions, $\boldsymbol{v} = \boldsymbol{0}$ on $\Gamma_D$. This causes the boundary integral over $\Gamma_D$ to vanish. The traction condition on $\Gamma_N$ is then substituted into the remaining boundary integral. The final conforming weak form is: Find $\boldsymbol{u} \in V$ such that for all $\boldsymbol{v} \in V_0$:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) : \mathbb{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}) \, dx = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, dx + \int_{\Gamma_N} \bar{\boldsymbol{t}} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, ds $$
where $V := \{ \boldsymbol{w} \in [H^1(\Omega)]^d \mid \boldsymbol{w} = \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} \text{ on } \Gamma_D \}$ and $V_0 := \{ \boldsymbol{w} \in [H^1(\Omega)]^d \mid \boldsymbol{w} = \boldsymbol{0} \text{ on } \Gamma_D \}$. The traction condition is satisfied weakly through its inclusion in the linear functional on the right-hand side; it is a **natural** boundary condition. 

### The Discontinuous Galerkin Paradigm: A New Mathematical Framework

The core innovation of Discontinuous Galerkin methods is the relaxation of the inter-[element continuity](@entry_id:165046) requirement imposed on the finite element space. Instead of seeking a solution in a subspace of $[H^1(\Omega)]^d$, we work with functions that are smooth *inside* each element of the mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ but are allowed to be discontinuous across element faces.

This approach requires a new set of mathematical objects to handle the discontinuities. We begin by defining the **broken Sobolev space**:
$$ [H^1(\mathcal{T}_h)]^d := \{ \boldsymbol{v} \in [L^2(\Omega)]^d : \boldsymbol{v}|_K \in [H^1(K)]^d \text{ for all } K \in \mathcal{T}_h \} $$
The discrete finite element space $V_h$ is then a subspace of this broken space, typically composed of vector-valued polynomials of degree $p \ge 1$ on each element $K$:
$$ V_h := \{ \boldsymbol{v}_h \in [L^2(\Omega)]^d : \boldsymbol{v}_h|_K \in [\mathbb{P}_p(K)]^d \text{ for all } K \in \mathcal{T}_h \} $$
where $\mathbb{P}_p(K)$ is the space of polynomials on $K$ of total degree at most $p$. 

Since functions in $V_h$ can be double-valued on interior faces of the mesh, we must carefully define their **traces**. For an interior face $F$ shared by two elements, $K^+$ and $K^-$, a function $\boldsymbol{v} \in V_h$ has two traces on $F$: $\boldsymbol{v}^+ = \boldsymbol{v}|_{\partial K^+ \cap F}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}^- = \boldsymbol{v}|_{\partial K^- \cap F}$. We adopt a convention where a [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) $\boldsymbol{n}$ on $F$ is fixed, for instance pointing from $K^+$ to $K^-$. The outward unit normals for the respective elements are then $n_{K^+} = \boldsymbol{n}$ and $n_{K^-} = -\boldsymbol{n}$. These are referred to as the oriented normals, $n^+$ and $n^-$.

With these traces, we define two fundamental operators: the **average** and the **jump**.
The **average** of a scalar, vector, or tensor quantity is simply the arithmetic mean of its two traces. For a vector field $\boldsymbol{v}$ and a [tensor field](@entry_id:266532) $\boldsymbol{\tau}$:
$$ \{\!\{\boldsymbol{v}\}\!\} := \frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{v}^+ + \boldsymbol{v}^-), \qquad \{\!\{\boldsymbol{\tau}\}\!\} := \frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\tau}^+ + \boldsymbol{\tau}^-) $$
The **jump** operator is defined to be consistent with the oriented normals. The output of the [jump operator](@entry_id:155707) is chosen to be of a rank suitable for elegant pairing with other quantities in the weak form.
- For a scalar field $u$, the jump is a vector: $[[u]] := u^+ \boldsymbol{n}^+ + u^- \boldsymbol{n}^- = (u^+ - u^-)\boldsymbol{n}$.
- For a vector field $\boldsymbol{v}$, the jump is a second-order tensor: $[[\boldsymbol{v}]] := \boldsymbol{v}^+ \otimes \boldsymbol{n}^+ + \boldsymbol{v}^- \otimes \boldsymbol{n}^- = (\boldsymbol{v}^+ - \boldsymbol{v}^-) \otimes \boldsymbol{n}$.
- For a second-order tensor field $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, the jump is a vector: $[[\boldsymbol{\tau}]] := \boldsymbol{\tau}^+ \boldsymbol{n}^+ + \boldsymbol{\tau}^- \boldsymbol{n}^- = (\boldsymbol{\tau}^+ - \boldsymbol{\tau}^-)\boldsymbol{n}$.  

These "oriented" or "rank-lifting" jump definitions are common in modern DG literature. A simpler jump definition is also frequently used, representing the simple difference of traces, e.g., $[\boldsymbol{v}] = \boldsymbol{v}^+ - \boldsymbol{v}^-$. These are related; for example, the contraction of the tensor jump with the normal recovers the simple vector jump: $[[\boldsymbol{v}]]\boldsymbol{n} = ((\boldsymbol{v}^+ - \boldsymbol{v}^-) \otimes \boldsymbol{n})\boldsymbol{n} = \boldsymbol{v}^+ - \boldsymbol{v}^-$. We will use both notations as convenient.

### Deriving the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) Method

With the DG machinery in place, we can construct a global [weak formulation](@entry_id:142897). We begin again with the element-wise [weak form](@entry_id:137295), summing over all elements $K \in \mathcal{T}_h$:
$$ \sum_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} \int_K \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}_h) \, dx - \sum_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} \int_{\partial K} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h)\boldsymbol{n}_K) \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_h \, ds = \sum_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} \int_K \boldsymbol{f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_h \, dx $$
The sum of boundary integrals over $\partial K$ is re-expressed as a sum over all mesh faces $\mathcal{F}_h$. For an interior face $F \in \mathcal{F}_h^{\mathrm{int}}$, the contribution comes from two adjacent elements, $K^+$ and $K^-$. The central idea of DG methods is to replace the element-wise traction terms $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h)\boldsymbol{n}_K$ with a **numerical flux**, which is a single-valued function on the face designed to approximate the physical interaction. The choice of [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) defines the specific DG method.

For the Interior Penalty (IP) family of methods, the flux is built from the averages and jumps of the solution and [test functions](@entry_id:166589). The most widely used variant is the **Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method**. Its [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) $a_h(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h)$ is constructed to be consistent, symmetric, and stable. The total [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) is:
$$ a_h(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h) = \sum_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} \int_K \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}_h) \, dx + \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_h^{\mathrm{int}}} a_F(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h) + \text{boundary face terms} $$
The interior face term $a_F(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h)$ for SIPG is composed of three parts:
$$ a_F(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h) = \underbrace{- \int_F \{\!\{\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) \boldsymbol{n}\}\!\} \cdot [\boldsymbol{v}_h] \, ds}_{\text{Consistency}} \underbrace{- \int_F \{\!\{\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{v}_h) \boldsymbol{n}\}\!\} \cdot [\boldsymbol{u}_h] \, ds}_{\text{Symmetry/Adjoint Consistency}} + \underbrace{\int_F \eta_F \,[\boldsymbol{u}_h] \cdot [\boldsymbol{v}_h] \, ds}_{\text{Penalty/Stability}} $$
where $[\boldsymbol{v}_h]$ denotes the simple jump $\boldsymbol{v}_h^+ - \boldsymbol{v}_h^-$.  

Let us analyze each part:
- The **Consistency Term**: This term arises naturally from the element-wise integration by parts. It ensures the method is **consistent**, meaning that if the exact, smooth solution $\boldsymbol{u}$ is substituted into the discrete equations, the original PDE is recovered. For a smooth solution, the jump $[\boldsymbol{v}_h]$ is non-zero, but the average traction $\{\!\{\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{n}\}\!\}$ reduces to the single-valued physical traction $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{n}$, and the term correctly represents the work done by this traction on the jump of the [test function](@entry_id:178872). The consistency property can also be seen from a flux perspective. If we define a numerical traction flux $t^{\star} = \{\!\{\boldsymbol{\sigma}(u)\}\!\} \boldsymbol{n} - \eta_F [\boldsymbol{u}]$, it reduces to the physical traction $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{n}$ for an exact solution where $[\boldsymbol{u}] = 0$. 

- The **Symmetry Term**: This term is the formal adjoint of the consistency term, with the roles of $\boldsymbol{u}_h$ and $\boldsymbol{v}_h$ swapped. Its inclusion makes the entire [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) symmetric, i.e., $a_h(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{v}_h) = a_h(\boldsymbol{v}_h, \boldsymbol{u}_h)$, which leads to a symmetric [stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659) in the final linear system. Other IP variants, like the Non-symmetric (NIPG) and Incomplete (IIPG) methods, modify or omit this term, resulting in non-symmetric [bilinear forms](@entry_id:746794). 

- The **Penalty Term**: This term is crucial for stability. The two consistency terms are not positive-definite and do not provide control over the jump $[\boldsymbol{u}_h]$. The penalty term, which penalizes the jump in the solution, ensures that the [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) is coercive (or positive-definite) on the [discrete space](@entry_id:155685). This forces the discontinuous solution to be "nearly" continuous, preventing non-physical oscillations. The **penalty parameter**, $\eta_F$, must be chosen sufficiently large to guarantee stability.

### The Crucial Role of the Penalty Parameter

The stability of the SIPG method hinges on the proper choice of the [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318) $\eta_F$. A rigorous analysis involving trace and inverse inequalities for polynomials shows that to ensure [coercivity](@entry_id:159399), $\eta_F$ must be large enough to control the negative contributions from the consistency terms. This leads to a scaling law of the form:
$$ \eta_F \ge C \frac{p^2}{h_F} (\text{stiffness}) $$
where $C$ is a constant depending on shape regularity, $p$ is the polynomial degree, and $h_F$ is the face diameter. The $p^2/h_F$ scaling arises from the constants in the inverse inequalities. 

The "stiffness" part must reflect the material properties. For [isotropic elasticity](@entry_id:203237), the traction involves both Lamé parameters, $\mu$ and $\lambda$. To guarantee stability for all material regimes, including the nearly incompressible limit where $\lambda \to \infty$, the penalty parameter must scale with the stiffest mode, which involves both parameters. A sufficient choice is:
$$ \eta_F = C_{\text{penalty}} \frac{(p+1)(p+d)}{h_F} (2\mu + \lambda) $$
The term $(p+1)(p+d)$ is a more precise representation of the polynomial degree dependence in $d$ dimensions. This choice ensures that the stability of the method does not degrade as the material becomes incompressible. 

### Advanced Properties and Formulations

#### Stability, Convergence, and Error Estimation

With a properly chosen [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318), the SIPG method is not only stable but also optimally convergent. For a sufficiently regular exact solution $\boldsymbol{u} \in [H^{p+1}(\Omega)]^d$, [a priori error estimates](@entry_id:746620) guarantee convergence rates. The error, measured in a DG-specific **[energy norm](@entry_id:274966)**, decreases with the mesh size $h$ at an optimal rate of $p$:
$$ \| \boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{u}_h \|_{\mathrm{DG}} \le C \, h^{p} \, \| \boldsymbol{u} \|_{H^{p+1}(\Omega)^d} $$
Furthermore, using a duality argument (the Aubin-Nitsche trick), one can show that the error in the standard $L^2$ norm converges one order faster:
$$ \| \boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{u}_h \|_{L^2(\Omega)^d} \le C \, h^{p+1} \, \| \boldsymbol{u} \|_{H^{p+1}(\Omega)^d} $$
These estimates confirm the [high-order accuracy](@entry_id:163460) of DG methods. 

For practical applications, especially in [adaptive mesh refinement](@entry_id:143852), **a posteriori error estimators** are invaluable. These estimators use the computed solution $\boldsymbol{u}_h$ to estimate the error without knowledge of the exact solution. A common form is a [residual-based estimator](@entry_id:174490) that sums the local residuals of the governing equations:
$$ \eta^2 := \sum_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} h_K^2 \| \boldsymbol{f} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) \|_{L^2(K)^d}^2 + \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_h} h_F \| [\![\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) \boldsymbol{n}]\!] \|_{L^2(F)^d}^2 $$
This estimator, which includes the element interior residual and the traction jump residual, is both **reliable** (provides an upper bound on the true error) and **efficient** (provides a lower bound, up to data oscillations), making it an effective tool for guiding adaptivity. 

#### Volumetric Locking

A significant challenge in computational elasticity is **volumetric locking**, which occurs in the [nearly incompressible](@entry_id:752387) limit ($\lambda \to \infty$). Standard displacement-based methods can become overly stiff and produce inaccurate results. The constraint $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} \approx 0$ is difficult for low-order continuous [polynomial spaces](@entry_id:753582) to satisfy, leading to a polluted solution. 

DG methods offer powerful strategies to mitigate or eliminate locking.
1.  **Mixed DG Formulations**: One approach is to reformulate the problem by introducing the [hydrostatic pressure](@entry_id:141627) $p = -\lambda \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}$ as an independent variable. This leads to a mixed [saddle-point problem](@entry_id:178398) for $(\boldsymbol{u}, p)$. A stable DG [discretization](@entry_id:145012) can be designed for this system, provided the discrete spaces for displacement and pressure satisfy an appropriate inf-sup (LBB) condition. This is often achieved with judicious choices of [polynomial spaces](@entry_id:753582) and [pressure stabilization](@entry_id:176997) terms. Such methods are robust and yield error estimates with constants independent of $\lambda$. 
2.  **Primal DG with Modified Penalties**: An alternative is to stay within the primal (displacement-only) formulation but modify it to specifically address the volumetric constraint. One effective strategy is to use an anisotropic penalty. Instead of a single [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318) $\eta_F$, separate parameters are used for the [normal and tangential components](@entry_id:166204) of the displacement jump. The tangential penalty scales with the [shear modulus](@entry_id:167228), $\eta_{t,F} \propto \mu$, while the normal penalty, which controls the volumetric modes, scales with the full bulk stiffness, $\eta_{n,F} \propto (2\mu + \lambda)$. This targeted approach provides stability without inducing locking.  

#### A Glimpse at Hybridizable DG (HDG) Methods

The Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method represents a distinct and computationally efficient branch of the DG family. The core idea is to introduce a new hybrid variable, $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h$, which lives only on the faces of the mesh and represents the displacement on the element boundaries.

The unknowns are the element-wise displacement and stress, $(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_h)$, and the global hybrid variable $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h$. The key is the [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) for traction, which is defined on the boundary of each element and enforces coupling to the hybrid variable:
$$ \widehat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_h \boldsymbol{n} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_h \boldsymbol{n} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_F ( \boldsymbol{u}_h - \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h ) $$
Here, $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F$ is a stabilization tensor. The positive sign is critical; it ensures that the [stabilization term](@entry_id:755314) is dissipative and leads to a stable method. The stabilization tensor $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F$ must be [symmetric positive definite](@entry_id:139466) to control all components of the displacement mismatch $(\boldsymbol{u}_h - \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h)$, and its magnitude must scale similarly to the SIPG penalty, i.e., $\boldsymbol{\tau}_F \sim \mathcal{O}(E p^2 / h_F)$, where $E$ is a representative modulus. 

The key advantage of HDG is that the element-wise unknowns $(\boldsymbol{u}_h, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_h)$ can be expressed in terms of the hybrid variable $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h$ through a local "[static condensation](@entry_id:176722)" procedure. This reduces the final global system to one involving only the degrees of freedom for $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}_h$, which are far fewer than for a standard DG method, leading to significant computational savings.
