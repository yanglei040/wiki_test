            "problem": "A thin, isotropic, homogeneous metallic plate of thickness $h$ is clamped along its entire boundary and is initially at a uniform reference temperature $T_{0}$. At time $t=0$, a short-duration pulse of absorbed energy $E_{0}$ from a focused heat source (e.g., a pulsed laser) is deposited on the mid-surface with a spatially localized Gaussian distribution. Assume that the pulse duration is sufficiently short that it can be modeled as impulsive in time, and that through-thickness temperature gradients are negligible on the time scale of interest (so the problem reduces to in-plane, two-dimensional heat diffusion in the mid-surface). The absorbed areal energy density is\n$$\ne(x,y) = \\frac{E_{0}}{\\pi w^{2}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{w^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nso that the initial temperature rise satisfies $ \\rho c h\\,\\Delta T(x,y,0^{+}) = e(x,y)$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $w$ is the $1/\\mathrm{e}$ Gaussian radius. Neglect radiation and convection, and treat the plate as laterally extensive compared to $w$ so that in-plane diffusion can be modeled on an unbounded domain. Treat the solid as linear, small-strain, isotropic thermoelastic under plane-stress kinematics, with coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha_{T}$, Young’s modulus $E$, and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

From the definition of thermal strain for an isotropic solid, write the thermal strain field $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{th}}(x,y,t)$ as a second-order tensor field in terms of $\\Delta T(x,y,t)$.\n3. Using the plane-stress linear thermoelastic constitutive equations, estimate the order of magnitude of the thermoelastic stress at the pulse center by assuming that, immediately after the pulse, in-plane thermal expansion at the hot spot is effectively constrained by the surrounding colder material and clamped boundary (i.e., approximate the local in-plane strains as negligible compared to the thermal strain, yielding a nearly equibiaxial in-plane stress state).

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in transient thermoelasticity, grounded in the fundamental principles of heat conduction and continuum mechanics. The provided data are consistent and physically representative of the specified material. The assumptions, such as treating the heat pulse as impulsive, the plate as an unbounded 2D domain for diffusion, and the material as linear elastic, are explicitly stated simplifications common in analytical modeling to obtain an estimate.\n\n**1. Temperature Field Evolution $\\Delta T(r,t)$**\n\nThe problem of temperature evolution is governed by the conservation of energy. For a thin plate of thickness $h$ with no through-thickness temperature gradients and no internal heat generation or surface losses for $t>0$, the energy balance equation integrated over the thickness is:\n$$\n\\rho c h \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{2D} \\cdot (h \\mathbf{q}_{2D}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, $T(x,y,t)$ is the temperature, and $\\mathbf{q}_{2D}$ is the in-plane heat flux vector. Using Fourier's law of heat conduction, $\\mathbf{q}_{2D} = -k \\nabla_{2D} T$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and assuming material properties are constant, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\rho c h \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} - k h \\nabla_{2D}^2 T = 0\n$$\nLet $\\Delta T = T-T_0$ be the temperature rise above the reference temperature. The governing equation is the two-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta T)}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\nabla_{2D}^2 (\\Delta T)\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa = \\frac{k}{\\rho c}$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial condition at $t=0^+$ is determined by the impulsive energy deposition. The absorbed areal energy density $e(x,y)$ causes an instantaneous temperature rise given by $\\rho c h \\, \\Delta T(x,y,0^+) = e(x,y)$.\n$$\n\\Delta T(x,y,0^+) = \\frac{e(x,y)}{\\rho c h} = \\frac{E_0}{\\pi w^2 \\rho c h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{w^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a Gaussian initial temperature distribution. The solution to the heat equation with a Gaussian initial condition on an unbounded domain is known to be a spreading Gaussian. The solution can be derived via Fourier transforms or by convolution with the heat kernel. The resulting temperature field for $t>0$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta T(r,t) = \\frac{E_0}{\\pi \\rho c h (w^2 + 4\\kappa t)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{w^2 + 4\\kappa t}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. This expression describes the diffusion and decay of the initial thermal spot over time.\n\n**2. Thermal Strain Field $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{th}}(x,y,t)$**\n\nFor an isotropic material, thermal expansion is purely volumetric (dilatational) and is linearly proportional to the temperature change. The thermal strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{th}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ij}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\alpha_T \\Delta T \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_T$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. In the two-dimensional $(x,y)$ plane of the plate, the thermal strain tensor field is represented as a second-order tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{th}}(x,y,t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{th}} & \\varepsilon_{xy}^{\\mathrm{th}} \\\\ \\varepsilon_{yx}^{\\mathrm{th}} & \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{th}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_T \\Delta T(x,y,t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha_T \\Delta T(x,y,t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha_T \\Delta T(x,y,t) \\mathbf{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity tensor and $\\Delta T(x,y,t)$ is the temperature field derived in the previous section.\n\n**3. Peak Thermoelastic Stress at $r=0, t=0^+$**\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the stress at the center of the pulse $(r=0)$ immediately after its deposition $(t=0^+)$. We use the plane-stress linear thermoelastic constitutive equations. The total strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the sum of the mechanical strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{mech}}$ and thermal strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{th}}$. The stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is related to the mechanical strain. For plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$), the in-plane stress-strain relations are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ (\\varepsilon_{xx} - \\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{th}}) + \\nu(\\varepsilon_{yy} - \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{th}}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ (\\varepsilon_{yy} - \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{th}}) + \\nu(\\varepsilon_{xx} - \\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{th}}) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\alpha_T \\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\nu\\varepsilon_{yy} - (1+\\nu)\\alpha_T \\Delta T \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\nu\\varepsilon_{xx} - (1+\\nu)\\alpha_T \\Delta T \\right]\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that at the center and at $t=0^+$, the rapid local heating occurs under conditions of total in-plane mechanical constraint from the surrounding cold, stiff material. This is modeled by setting the total in-plane strains to zero: $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$ and $\\varepsilon_{yy} = 0$. Due to the radial symmetry of the heating, we expect an equibiaxial stress state, $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy}$. Substituting the constraint into the equations:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ 0 + 0 - (1+\\nu)\\alpha_T \\Delta T \\right] = -\\frac{E(1+\\nu)\\alpha_T\\Delta T}{1-\\nu^2} = -\\frac{E\\alpha_T\\Delta T}{1-\\nu}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the stress is compressive, as the material is prevented from expanding. The magnitude of this peak compressive stress, $|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}|$, is evaluated at $r=0$ and $t=0^+$:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{E\\alpha_T}{1-\\nu} \\Delta T(0, 0^+)\n$$\nThe peak temperature rise at the center is:\n$$\n\\Delta T(0, 0^+) = \\frac{E_0}{\\pi w^2 \\rho c h}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the stress magnitude equation gives the final symbolic expression:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{E \\alpha_T E_0}{(1-\\nu) \\pi w^2 \\rho c h}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, all in SI units:\n$E = 193 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\alpha_T = 16.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$E_0 = 0.50 \\, \\mathrm{J}$\n$\\nu = 0.30$\n$w = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\rho = 8000 \\, \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$c = 500 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$h = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{(193 \\times 10^9) (16.0 \\times 10^{-6}) (0.50)}{(1 - 0.30) \\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-4})^2 (8000) (500) (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})}\n$$\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{1.544 \\times 10^6}{0.7 \\times \\pi \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{1.544 \\times 10^6}{0.7 \\times 16\\pi \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{1.544 \\times 10^{11}}{11.2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n|\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{1.544 \\times 10^{11}}{35.1858...} = 4.38814... \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe stress magnitude is $4388.14... \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$.

First, the element is axially constrained between rigid boundaries, which implies that the total axial strain $\\varepsilon$ is constant. Therefore, its rate of change is zero:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0\n$$\nSecond, the process occurs at a uniform constant temperature $T$. Thermal strain $\\varepsilon^{\\theta}$ is a function of temperature, so if temperature is constant, the thermal strain is also constant. Consequently, its rate of change is zero:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\theta} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these two conditions into the strain rate decomposition yields a relationship between the elastic and creep strain rates:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{e} + \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{c} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{e} = -\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{c}\n$$\nThis equation represents the core physical process: the increase in creep strain is compensated by a corresponding decrease in elastic strain to maintain zero total strain change.\n\nNext, we introduce the constitutive relations provided in the problem statement. The elastic behavior follows a linear constitutive relation (Hooke's Law):\n$$\n\\sigma = E \\, \\varepsilon^{e}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young’s modulus, assumed to be constant. Differentiating this with respect to time gives the elastic strain rate in terms of the stress rate, $\\dot{\\sigma}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{e} = \\frac{1}{E} \\dot{\\sigma}\n$$\nThe creep behavior is described by a Norton-type power-law:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{c} = A \\, \\sigma^{n}\n$$\nwhere $A > 0$ and $n > 0$ are temperature-dependent material parameters, and $\\sigma$ is the axial stress. Since the temperature $T$ is constant, $A$ and $n$ are also constant during the dwell period.\n\nSubstituting these two constitutive rate equations into the kinematic relation $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{e} = -\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{c}$ gives a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the evolution of stress $\\sigma$ as a function of time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E} \\dot{\\sigma} = -A \\, \\sigma^{n}\n$$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} = -E A \\, \\sigma^{n}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables $\\sigma$ and $t$ to facilitate integration:\n$$\n\\sigma^{-n} \\, d\\sigma = -E A \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the stress $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$ at the end of the dwell period, we integrate both sides of this equation. The integration for the stress is from the initial stress $\\sigma(0) = \\sigma_{0}$ to the final stress $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$. The integration for time is from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\sigma_{0}}^{\\sigma(\\Delta t)} \\sigma^{-n} \\, d\\sigma = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} -E A \\, dt\n$$\nThe right-hand side is straightforward to integrate:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} -E A \\, dt = -E A [t]_{0}^{\\Delta t} = -E A \\Delta t\n$$\nFor the left-hand side, we use the power rule for integration. The problem specifies that $n \\neq 1$, so the integral is:\n$$\n\\int \\sigma^{-n} \\, d\\sigma = \\frac{\\sigma^{-n+1}}{-n+1} = \\frac{\\sigma^{1-n}}{1-n}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral gives:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right]_{\\sigma_{0}}^{\\sigma(\\Delta t)} = \\frac{\\sigma(\\Delta t)^{1-n}}{1-n} - \\frac{\\sigma_{0}^{1-n}}{1-n}\n$$\nEquating the results of the left-hand and right-hand side integrations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(\\Delta t)^{1-n} - \\sigma_{0}^{1-n}}{1-n} = -E A \\Delta t\n$$\nNow, we solve for the final stress, $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$. First, multiply both sides by $(1-n)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\Delta t)^{1-n} - \\sigma_{0}^{1-n} = -E A (1-n) \\Delta t = E A (n-1) \\Delta t\n$$\nNext, isolate the term containing $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\Delta t)^{1-n} = \\sigma_{0}^{1-n} + E A (n-1) \\Delta t\n$$\nFinally, to solve for $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$, we raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{1-n}$. This yields the final analytical expression for the stress at the end of the dwell period:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\Delta t) = \\left[ \\sigma_{0}^{1-n} + E A (n-1) \\Delta t \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-n}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the relaxed stress $\\sigma(\\Delta t)$ as a function of the initial stress $\\sigma_{0}$, the material parameters $E$, $A$, $n$, and the dwell duration $\\Delta t$, as required.",
