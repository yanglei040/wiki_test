A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n**Part 1: Mapping between opposite boundary points**\n\nThe RVE is a parallelogram in the reference configuration $\\Omega$. Without loss of generality, we can place one of its vertices at the origin of our coordinate system, $\\boldsymbol{X} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The four vertices of the RVE are then $\\boldsymbol{0}$, $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$, $\\boldsymbol{a}_2$, and $\\boldsymbol{a}_1 + \\boldsymbol{a}_2$. The boundary of the RVE, $\\partial\\Omega$, is composed of four line segments. These segments can be grouped into two pairs of opposite boundaries.\n\nLet us define a parametric coordinate $s \\in [0, 1]$ to describe the points on these boundary segments.\n\nThe first pair of opposite boundaries, say $\\partial\\Omega_1^-$ and $\\partial\\Omega_1^+$, are parallel to the vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_2$. A point $\\boldsymbol{X}^- \\in \\partial\\Omega_1^-$ can be parametrized as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^-(s) = s \\boldsymbol{a}_2, \\quad s \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nThis segment connects the vertex at $\\boldsymbol{0}$ to the vertex at $\\boldsymbol{a}_2$. The opposite boundary segment, $\\partial\\Omega_1^+$, is translated by the vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$. A point $\\boldsymbol{X}^+ \\in \\partial\\Omega_1^+$ corresponding to the same parameter $s$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^+(s) = \\boldsymbol{a}_1 + s \\boldsymbol{a}_2, \\quad s \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nThis segment connects the vertex at $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$ to the vertex at $\\boldsymbol{a}_1+\\boldsymbol{a}_2$. The mapping between any pair of opposite points $(\\boldsymbol{X}^-, \\boldsymbol{X}^+)$ on these two boundaries is therefore:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^+ = \\boldsymbol{X}^- + \\boldsymbol{a}_1\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the second pair of opposite boundaries, $\\partial\\Omega_2^-$ and $\\partial\\Omega_2^+$, which are parallel to the vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$:\nA point $\\boldsymbol{X}^- \\in \\partial\\Omega_2^-$ is parametrized as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^-(s) = s \\boldsymbol{a}_1, \\quad s \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nThe corresponding opposite point $\\boldsymbol{X}^+ \\in \\partial\\Omega_2^+$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^+(s) = \\boldsymbol{a}_2 + s \\boldsymbol{a}_1, \\quad s \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nThe mapping between this pair of opposite points is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^+ = \\boldsymbol{X}^- + \\boldsymbol{a}_2\n$$\nIn general, a pair of opposite boundary points $(\\boldsymbol{X}^-, \\boldsymbol{X}^+)$ are related by one of the lattice translation vectors, $\\boldsymbol{X}^+ = \\boldsymbol{X}^- + \\boldsymbol{a}_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Displacement-Type Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe derivation starts from the two-scale kinematic decomposition of the displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X})$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X} + \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}(\\boldsymbol{X})\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the macro-homogeneous part of the displacement and $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}(\\boldsymbol{X})$ is the periodic microscopic fluctuation field.\n\nThe condition of periodicity on the fluctuation field requires that $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}$ has the same value at any pair of corresponding points $\\boldsymbol{X}^-$ and $\\boldsymbol{X}^+$ on opposite boundaries. As established in Part 1, these points are related by $\\boldsymbol{X}^+ = \\boldsymbol{X}^- + \\boldsymbol{a}_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Thus, the periodicity condition is formally stated as:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) = \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-)\n$$\nWe can express the fluctuation field $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}$ in terms of the total displacement $\\boldsymbol{u}$ by rearranging the kinematic decomposition:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}) - \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the periodicity condition, we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}^+ = \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-) - \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}^-\n$$\nWe are interested in the displacement jump across opposite boundaries, which is the difference $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-)$. Rearranging the above equation to isolate this term yields:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-) = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}^+ - \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{X}^-\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the matrix-vector product, we can factor out the macroscopic strain tensor $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-) = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,(\\boldsymbol{X}^+ - \\boldsymbol{X}^-)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the geometric relation between opposite boundary points, $\\boldsymbol{X}^+ - \\boldsymbol{X}^- = \\boldsymbol{a}_i$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-) = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{a}_i, \\quad i \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the displacement-type periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). It states that the jump in the total displacement field across boundaries separated by a lattice vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_i$ is a constant vector given by the product of the macroscopic strain tensor and that lattice vector.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation of the Displacement Jump**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the displacement jump vector for the pair of opposite boundaries related by the lattice vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$. Using the formula derived in Part 2 with $i=1$, this jump, denoted $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1 = \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^+) - \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{X}^-) = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\,\\boldsymbol{a}_1\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values for $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0117 & 0.0042 \\\\ 0.0042 & -0.0031 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{a}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 5.7 \\\\ 3.4 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{mm}\n$$\nThe calculation is a matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0117 & 0.0042 \\\\ 0.0042 & -0.0031 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 5.7 \\\\ 3.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the resulting vector are computed as follows:\nFirst component:\n$$\n(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1)_1 = (0.0117)(5.7) + (0.0042)(3.4) = 0.06669 + 0.01428 = 0.08097\n$$\nSecond component:\n$$\n(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1)_2 = (0.0042)(5.7) + (-0.0031)(3.4) = 0.02394 - 0.01054 = 0.01340\n$$\nThe macroscopic strain tensor $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ is dimensionless, and the vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_1$ has units of mm, so the resulting displacement jump vector $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1$ is in mm. The problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe first component, $0.08097$, already has four significant figures.\nThe second component, $0.0134$, has three significant figures. To express it with four significant figures, we write it as $0.01340$.\nThe displacement jump vector is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.08097 \\\\ 0.01340 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{mm}\n$$\nThe final answer is to be presented as a single row matrix.",

It is a valid, well-structured problem in computational solid mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe foundation of this problem lies in relating macroscopic (homogenized) quantities to their microscopic (heterogeneous) counterparts. The macroscopic stress $\\bar{\\sigma}$ and strain $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ are defined as volume averages of the microscopic fields:\n$$ \\bar{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L}\\sigma(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x $$\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L}\\epsilon(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x $$\nFrom the microscopic equilibrium condition, the stress $\\sigma(x)$ is constant, which we denote as $\\sigma$. Therefore, the macroscopic stress simplifies to $\\bar{\\sigma} = \\sigma$. The microscopic strain is related to the displacement field $u(x)$ by $\\epsilon(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x}$. The average strain can then be computed as:\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{u(L) - u(0)}{L} $$\n\n**1) Derivation of the Effective Modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nFor this part, the boundary conditions are $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=\\bar{\\epsilon}L$. Substituting these into the expression for the average strain confirms that the prescribed parameter $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ is indeed the true average strain of the RVE:\n$$ \\frac{u(L) - u(0)}{L} = \\frac{\\bar{\\epsilon}L-0}{L} = \\bar{\\epsilon} $$\nTo find the effective modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ defined by the macroscopic law $\\bar{\\sigma}=E_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\bar{\\epsilon}$, we must express $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ in terms of $\\bar{\\sigma}$. We use the microscopic constitutive law $\\sigma(x) = E(x)\\epsilon(x)$, which can be inverted to find the strain: $\\epsilon(x) = \\sigma(x)/E(x)$. Since $\\sigma(x)=\\sigma=\\bar{\\sigma}$, we have $\\epsilon(x) = \\bar{\\sigma}/E(x)$.\n\nWe now compute the average strain by integrating over the two phases:\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L}\\epsilon(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L}\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}}{E(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x $$\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}}{L}\\left[ \\int_{0}^{L_1}\\frac{1}{E_1}\\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{L_1}^{L}\\frac{1}{E_2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\right] $$\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}}{L}\\left[ \\frac{L_1}{E_1} + \\frac{L_2}{E_2} \\right] = \\bar{\\sigma} \\left[ \\frac{L_1/L}{E_1} + \\frac{L_2/L}{E_2} \\right] $$\nThe relationship between $\\bar{\\sigma}$ and $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ is thus $\\frac{\\bar{\\epsilon}}{\\bar{\\sigma}} = \\frac{L_1/L}{E_1} + \\frac{L_2/L}{E_2}$.\nBy definition, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}}{\\bar{\\epsilon}}$. Therefore, the reciprocal of the effective modulus is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{L_1/L}{E_1} + \\frac{L_2/L}{E_2} $$\nThis gives the effective modulus as the volume-weighted harmonic average of the phase moduli:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L E_1} + \\frac{L_2}{L E_2}\\right)^{-1} $$\nThis is the correct result for a series composite, corresponding to the Reuss bound.\n\n**2) Analysis of the \"Polluted\" Boundary Condition**\n\nThe Hill-Mandel condition is satisfied if the work done by boundary tractions on the fluctuation displacement field is zero. The displacement field $u(x)$ is decomposed as $u(x) = \\bar{\\epsilon}x + u'(x)$, where $\\bar{\\epsilon}x$ is the macroscopic part and $u'(x)$ is the fluctuation. The condition for energy consistency in $1$D is that the boundary work of fluctuations vanishes: $[(\\sigma A) u'(x)]_{0}^{L} = 0$.\n\nFor the \"polluted\" BC, $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=\\bar{\\epsilon}L+\\delta$. We evaluate the fluctuation field at the boundaries:\n$$ u'(0) = u(0) - \\bar{\\epsilon}(0) = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n$$ u'(L) = u(L) - \\bar{\\epsilon}L = (\\bar{\\epsilon}L + \\delta) - \\bar{\\epsilon}L = \\delta $$\nThe boundary work of fluctuations is therefore:\n$$ [(\\sigma A) u'(x)]_{0}^{L} = (\\sigma A) u'(L) - (\\sigma A) u'(0) = (\\sigma A)\\delta - 0 = \\sigma A \\delta $$\nSince it is given that $\\delta \\neq 0$ and we assume a non-trivial loading state ($\\sigma \\neq 0$), the boundary work $\\sigma A \\delta$ is non-zero. This non-zero boundary work demonstrates that the \"polluted\" boundary condition violates the Hill-Mandel energy consistency requirement.\n\nNext, we derive the apparent modulus $\\tilde{E}$ that maps the parameter $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ to the resulting average stress $\\bar{\\sigma}$. Under these BCs, the true average strain in the RVE, let's call it $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{u(L) - u(0)}{L} = \\frac{(\\bar{\\epsilon}L+\\delta) - 0}{L} = \\bar{\\epsilon} + \\frac{\\delta}{L} $$\nThe relationship between the true average strain and the average stress is still governed by the true effective modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ \\bar{\\sigma} = E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{avg}} = E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left(\\bar{\\epsilon} + \\frac{\\delta}{L}\\right) $$\nThe problem defines the apparent modulus $\\tilde{E}$ through the relation $\\bar{\\sigma} = \\tilde{E} \\bar{\\epsilon}$, where $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ is the parameter from the BC, not the true average strain. Setting the two expressions for $\\bar{\\sigma}$ equal gives:\n$$ \\tilde{E} \\bar{\\epsilon} = E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left(\\bar{\\epsilon} + \\frac{\\delta}{L}\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\tilde{E}$ yields:\n$$ \\tilde{E} = E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta}{L\\bar{\\epsilon}}\\right) $$\nThe absolute error in the apparent stiffness is:\n$$ |\\tilde{E} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}| = \\left| E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta}{L\\bar{\\epsilon}}\\right) - E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\right| = \\left| E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{\\delta}{L\\bar{\\epsilon}} \\right| $$\n\n**3) Numerical Calculation of the Absolute Error**\n\nWe are given $L_1=L_2=L/2$, $E_1=150\\,\\text{GPa}$, and $E_2=30\\,\\text{GPa}$. First, we calculate the true effective modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{L_1/L}{E_1} + \\frac{L_2/L}{E_2}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{1/2}{150} + \\frac{1/2}{30}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{60}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{1+5}{300}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{6}{300}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{300}{6} = 50\\,\\text{GPa} $$\nNow, we use the given fluctuation magnitude $\\delta = 0.1\\bar{\\epsilon}L$ to calculate the absolute error.

The RVE is the unit square domain $\\Omega = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$, discretized by a uniform bilinear quadrilateral finite element (FE) mesh, and occupied by a two-phase composite with prescribed phase properties and volume fraction. The goal is to compute the homogenized (volume-averaged) Cauchy stress for a prescribed macroscopic uniaxial strain. You must produce a single program that performs the micro-scale FE solve and outputs the homogenized stress component $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ for each provided test case.\n\nStart from first principles of small-strain linear elasticity, balance of linear momentum, and constitutive linearity, without shortcut formulas beyond core definitions:\n\n- Kinematics: the small-strain tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}})$, with engineering shear strain defined by $\\gamma_{12} = 2 \\varepsilon_{12}$.\n- Balance of linear momentum (without body forces) at the micro-scale: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ in $\\Omega$.\n- Constitutive relation for isotropic linear elasticity under plane strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, with $\\mathbb{C}$ determined by Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$ via the Lamé parameters $\\lambda = \\dfrac{\\nu E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$ and $\\mu = \\dfrac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$, and the $3 \\times 3$ matrix (in Voigt notation with ordering $[\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\gamma_{12}]^{\\mathsf{T}}$)\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda + 2\\mu & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n\\lambda & \\lambda + 2\\mu & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\mu\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nImpose Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) consistent with a prescribed macroscopic strain $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ by decomposing the micro-scale displacement $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$ as $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\, \\mathbf{x} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is periodic across opposite boundaries. The periodicity is enforced by tying opposite boundary node pairs so that their displacement differences equal the macroscopic affine part, i.e., for opposite points $\\mathbf{x}^{+}$ and $\\mathbf{x}^{-}$ on a pair of opposite boundaries,\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}^{+}) - \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}^{-}) = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\, (\\mathbf{x}^{+} - \\mathbf{x}^{-}).\n$$\nTo eliminate rigid body modes of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}$, fix the two displacement components of a single reference node.\n\nUse the finite element method with bilinear quadrilateral elements (Q4) and $2 \\times 2$ Gauss quadrature. Let the mesh have $N_x$ elements along $x$ and $N_y$ elements along $y$. For this problem, fix $N_x = 12$ and $N_y = 12$. Use isoparametric mapping, compute element stiffness matrices via standard assembly $ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{C} \\, \\mathbf{B} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$ with $ \\mathbf{B}$ the strain-displacement matrix, and assemble the global stiffness.\n\nDefine the two-phase composite as follows. Phase $1$ has Young’s modulus $E_1$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_1$, phase $2$ has Young’s modulus $E_2$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_2$. The target volume fraction of phase $1$ is $v_f \\in [0,1]$. The material distribution is a perfectly periodic vertical layering: phase $1$ occupies $\\{(x,y) \\in \\Omega: x \\in [0, v_f)\\}$ and phase $2$ occupies the complement. This realizes exactly the desired volume fraction in the continuum setting and is consistent with periodic extension of the RVE. In the finite element discretization, assign each element’s constitutive tensor $\\mathbf{C}_e$ based on the $x$-coordinate of its centroid relative to $v_f$.\n\nFor the macroscopic loading, prescribe a uniaxial macroscopic strain of the form\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwith $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11}$ given. Solve the micro problem subject to PBC and the reference-node constraints, then compute the homogenized Cauchy stress by volume averaging,\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\sum_{e} \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{C}_e \\, \\mathbf{B} \\, \\mathbf{u}_h \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega,\n$$\nand report the $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ component.\n\nPhysical units: All Young’s moduli $E_1$ and $E_2$ must be interpreted in Pascals (Pa). Poisson’s ratios $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$ are dimensionless. The macroscopic strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11}$ is dimensionless. The output homogenized stress $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ must be reported in Pascals (Pa). Angles are not used. No percentages may appear; volume fraction $v_f$ is a decimal in $[0,1]$.\n\nNumerical specification for the FE discretization and quadrature:\n- Use a uniform mesh with $N_x = 12$ and $N_y = 12$ bilinear quadrilateral elements over $\\Omega$.\n- Use $2 \\times 2$ Gaussian quadrature per element with standard points at $\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$ and unit weights.\n- Enforce PBC by periodic node pairing in both $x$- and $y$-directions with the affine macroscopic jump defined by $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$.\n- Eliminate rigid body modes by fixing both displacement components of the master node at $(0,0)$.\n\nTest Suite:\nYour program must run the following four test cases and output the homogenized $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ for each, in Pascals (Pa):\n1. $E_1 = 200 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_1 = 0.30$, $E_2 = 70 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_2 = 0.33$, $v_f = 0.30$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11} = 0.001$.\n2. $E_1 = 150 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_1 = 0.28$, $E_2 = 50 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_2 = 0.25$, $v_f = 0.0$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11} = 0.001$.\n3. $E_1 = 210 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_1 = 0.30$, $E_2 = 5 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_2 = 0.45$, $v_f = 1.0$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11} = 0.0005$.\n4. $E_1 = 100 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_1 = 0.29$, $E_2 = 1 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\nu_2 = 0.35$, $v_f = 0.50$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11} = 0.002$.\n\nAnswer format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in scientific notation with six digits after the decimal point, namely $[\\text{res}_1,\\text{res}_2,\\text{res}_3,\\text{res}_4]$, where each $\\text{res}_k$ is $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ in Pascals (Pa), formatted as, for example, $1.234567\\text{e}+08$.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem in computational solid mechanics, specifically concerning two-scale computational homogenization. The task is to implement a finite element (FE) model for a two-dimensional, plane-strain, linear-elastic Representative Volume Element (RVE) with Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs). The goal is to compute the homogenized stress tensor resulting from a prescribed macroscopic strain.\n\nThe problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information, including the governing equations, constitutive laws, boundary conditions, discretization parameters, material properties, and loading cases, allowing for a direct and unambiguous implementation.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\n\n**1. Theoretical Formulation**\n\nThe micro-scale problem is governed by the balance of linear momentum, which in the absence of body forces is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. The material behavior is described by a linear isotropic elastic constitutive relation, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbb{C}$ is the fourth-order elasticity tensor and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the small-strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}})$. For the plane strain condition, the constitutive matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ in Voigt notation ($[\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\gamma_{12}]^\\mathsf{T}$) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda + 2\\mu & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n\\lambda & \\lambda + 2\\mu & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\mu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\frac{\\nu E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$ and $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ are the Lamé parameters, defined by Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\n**2. Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs) and FE Discretization**\n\nThe key to homogenization is the enforcement of PBCs, which link the micro-scale displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$ to the macroscopic strain tensor $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$. The displacement field is decomposed as $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\mathbf{x} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is a periodic fluctuation field. This leads to the constraint for any pair of points $\\mathbf{x}^{+}$ and $\\mathbf{x}^{-}$ on opposite boundaries of the RVE:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}^{+}) - \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}^{-}) = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} (\\mathbf{x}^{+} - \\mathbf{x}^{-})\n$$\nIn the finite element framework, this translates to linear constraint equations between the degrees of freedom (DOFs) of nodes on opposite boundaries. We employ a master-slave approach. Nodes on the left and bottom boundaries are designated as \"master\" nodes, and nodes on the right and top boundaries are \"slave\" nodes. The DOFs of slave nodes are expressed in terms of the DOFs of their corresponding master nodes plus a non-homogeneous term derived from $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$. For the prescribed loading $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}} = \\text{diag}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11}, 0)$, the constraints for nodal displacements $\\mathbf{d}$ are:\n- For a node pair on the right/left boundaries (at $x=1, x=0$): $\\mathbf{d}(1, y_j) = \\mathbf{d}(0, y_j) + [\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11}, 0]^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n- For a node pair on the top/bottom boundaries (at $y=1, y=0$): $\\mathbf{d}(x_i, 1) = \\mathbf{d}(x_i, 0)$.\n\nThese constraints are used to eliminate the slave DOFs, resulting in a reduced system of linear equations $\\mathbf{K}^* \\mathbf{d}^* = \\mathbf{F}^*$, where $\\mathbf{d}^*$ contains only the independent master DOFs. To ensure a unique solution by removing the rigid body motion of the fluctuation field $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}$, the displacements of one master node (here, the node at the origin $(0,0)$) are fixed to zero.\n\nThe RVE domain $\\Omega = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ is discretized using a uniform $N_x \\times N_y = 12 \\times 12$ mesh of bilinear quadrilateral (Q4) elements. Standard isoparametric FE procedures are used. The element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{B} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$ is computed via $2 \\times 2$ Gaussian quadrature, where $\\mathbf{B}$ is the strain-displacement matrix.\n\n**3. Assembly of the Reduced System**\n\nThe assembly process condenses the global system into the reduced system for the independent DOFs $\\mathbf{d}^*$. For each element, its stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e$ is computed. The contribution of each entry $K_{e,ij}$ to the reduced system is determined by the master-slave relationships of the local DOFs $i$ and $j$. If local DOF $j$ is a slave with displacement $d_j = d_{m_j} + g_j$ (where $d_{m_j}$ is the master DOF and $g_j$ is the jump), its contribution is split: the stiffness part $K_{e,ij}d_{m_j}$ is assembled into the reduced stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}^*$, and the prescribed displacement part $K_{e,ij}g_j$ is moved to the right-hand side, contributing to the reduced force vector $\\mathbf{F}^*$.\n\n**4. Solution and Homogenization**\n\nAfter assembling $\\mathbf{K}^*$ and $\\mathbf{F}^*$, the linear system is solved for the unknown master displacements $\\mathbf{d}^*$. Subsequently, the full displacement field over the entire RVE is reconstructed by applying the master-slave relations.\n\nThe final step is to compute the homogenized stress tensor, which is the volume average of the micro-scale stress:\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nSince $|\\Omega|=1$, this is simply the integral of the stress over the domain. In the FE context, this integral is computed as a sum of integrals over each element, evaluated using the same Gauss quadrature scheme:\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\sum_e \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{C}_e \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}_e \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\sum_e \\sum_{g} \\mathbf{C}_e \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}_g) \\mathbf{d}_e \\det(\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x}_g)) w_g\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{d}_e$ are the reconstructed nodal displacements for element $e$, and the sum is over all elements and all Gauss points $\\mathbf{x}_g$ with weights $w_g$. The program calculates the $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11}$ component of this homogenized stress tensor for each test case.\nThe cases with $v_f=0$ and $v_f=1$ correspond to homogeneous materials, for which the exact analytical solution is $\\bar{\\sigma}_{11} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{11}$. The layered composite cases also have a known analytical solution under these loading conditions, providing a robust validation for the numerical implementation.",
