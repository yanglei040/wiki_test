            "problem": "Consider a right circular cylindrical piezoelectric rod of radius $a$ and length $L$, whose material symmetry is transversely isotropic about the axis $z$ (crystal class $6mm$) and whose poling direction coincides with the cylinder axis $z$. The rod is modeled in the linear piezoelectric regime under small strains and quasi-static electrostatics. The fundamental governing equations are:\n- Balance of linear momentum: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{T} + \\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, with $\\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n- Gauss's law in the absence of free charge: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{D} = 0$.\n- Electrostatic field definition: $\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$.\n\nThe linear piezoelectric constitutive relations in the stress–charge form are:\n$$\\boldsymbol{T} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{E} : \\boldsymbol{S} - \\boldsymbol{e}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{E}, \\qquad \\boldsymbol{D} = \\boldsymbol{e} : \\boldsymbol{S} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{S} \\boldsymbol{E},$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{T}$ is the Cauchy stress, $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is the small-strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is the electric displacement, $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is the electric field, $\\boldsymbol{c}^{E}$ is the elastic stiffness at constant electric field, $\\boldsymbol{e}$ is the piezoelectric coupling tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{S}$ is the permittivity at constant strain.\n\nBoundary and loading conditions are:\n- Mechanical: the end at $z=0$ is fixed ($\\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{0}$), and a static torque $M$ about the $z$-axis is applied to the end at $z=L$; the lateral surface $r=a$ is traction-free.\n- Electrical: the end faces are perfectly electroded with prescribed potentials $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(L)=V$, and the lateral surface $r=a$ is electrically insulated so that $\\boldsymbol{D}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}=0$ there.\n\nAssume an axisymmetric Saint-Venant torsion state with no warping of cross-sections and neglect end effects (i.e., fields are uniform along $z$ except for boundary layers near the ends). Under the given material symmetry about $z$ and poling along $z$, the only relevant stiffness in torsion is $c_{44}$ (the shear modulus in the rod), and the coupling between axial electric field $E_{z}$ and shear stress components $T_{z\\theta}$ vanishes for crystal class $6mm$.\n\nStarting from the above laws and conditions, derive the exact analytic expressions for:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement presented is a well-posed boundary value problem in the field of linear piezoelectricity. It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and possesses sufficient information to derive a unique solution under the specified assumptions. The core of the problem lies in applying the principles of continuum mechanics and electrostatics to a piezoelectric material with specific symmetry (crystal class $6mm$) under a particular loading (torsion). A crucial simplification, explicitly stated in the problem, is that for this material class and loading, the mechanical torsion is decoupled from the axial electric field. This allows the problem to be separated into two independent subproblems: a purely mechanical torsion problem and a purely electrostatic problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds by analyzing these two subproblems separately.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanical torsion problem to find the circumferential displacement $u_{\\theta}(r)$ at the end $z=L$.\nThe problem assumes an axisymmetric Saint-Venant torsion state with no warping. For a circular shaft, this corresponds to a displacement field of the form:\n$$\nu_r = 0, \\quad u_z = 0, \\quad u_{\\theta} = r \\psi(z)\n$$\nwhere $u_r$, $u_{\\theta}$, and $u_z$ are the displacement components in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, and $\\psi(z)$ is the angle of twist of the cross-section at position $z$.\n\nThe non-zero components of the small-strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\top})$ are derived from this displacement field. The only non-zero component is the engineering shear strain in the $\\theta-z$ plane:\n$$\nS_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(r\\psi(z)) = \\frac{1}{2}r \\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\n$$\nThe assumption that fields are uniform along the length $L$ (neglecting end effects) implies that the rate of twist is constant. Let us define this constant rate of twist as $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\n$$\nThus, the strain is $S_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{2}r\\alpha$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the electromechanical coupling between the shear stress $T_{\\theta z}$ and the axial electric field $E_z$ is zero for the $6mm$ crystal class. Also, the problem is structured such that we can assume a purely axial electric field $\\boldsymbol{E} = E_z \\boldsymbol{\\hat{e}}_z$, meaning $E_r=E_{\\theta}=0$. The constitutive relation for stress, $\\boldsymbol{T} = \\boldsymbol{c}^{E} : \\boldsymbol{S} - \\boldsymbol{e}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{E}$, simplifies. For the shear stress component $T_{\\theta z}$, the piezoelectric term involving $E_z$ is absent. The relation reduces to the purely elastic form, where $c_{44}$ is the relevant shear modulus:\n$$\nT_{\\theta z} = 2 c_{44}^{E} S_{\\theta z} = 2 c_{44} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} r\\alpha\\right) = c_{44} r \\alpha\n$$\nWe omit the superscript $E$ on $c_{44}$ as it's the only one considered. This stress field automatically satisfies the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{T} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ in the absence of body forces.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions. The applied torque $M$ at the end $z=L$ is the resultant moment of the shear stress $T_{\\theta z}$ over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nM = \\int_A r T_{\\theta z} \\, dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^a r (c_{44} r \\alpha) \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\n$$\nM = 2\\pi c_{44} \\alpha \\int_0^a r^3 \\, dr = 2\\pi c_{44} \\alpha \\left[\\frac{r^4}{4}\\right]_0^a = \\frac{\\pi c_{44} a^4 \\alpha}{2}\n$$\nFrom this relation, we solve for the constant twist rate $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2M}{\\pi c_{44} a^4}\n$$\nTo find the displacement, we integrate the twist rate $\\alpha = d\\psi/dz$ with respect to $z$. The boundary condition at the fixed end, $\\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ at $z=0$, implies $u_{\\theta}(r,0)=0$, which means $\\psi(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\psi(z) = \\int_0^z \\alpha \\, dz' = \\alpha z\n$$\nThe circumferential displacement at the loaded end, $z=L$, is then given by:\n$$\nu_{\\theta}(r, L) = r \\psi(L) = r \\alpha L\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\nu_{\\theta}(r, L) = r L \\left(\\frac{2M}{\\pi c_{44} a^4}\\right) = \\frac{2MLr}{\\pi a^4 c_{44}}\n$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nSecond, we address the electrostatic problem to find the axial electric field $E_z$.\nThe problem is decoupled, so we can solve for the electric field independently. The rod is electroded at its ends with $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(L)=V$. Neglecting end effects implies a uniform electric field along the $z$-axis. The geometry suggests that the electric potential $\\phi$ varies only with $z$, i.e., $\\phi = \\phi(z)$.\nThe electric field is related to the potential by $\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$. For a potential depending only on $z$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} \\boldsymbol{\\hat{e}}_z\n$$\nThus, the electric field is purely axial, with $E_z = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}$. Since we assume a uniform field, $E_z$ must be a constant.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = -E_z = \\text{constant}\n$$\nIntegrating this equation gives the potential:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = -E_z z + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant. We apply the electrical boundary conditions to determine $E_z$ and $C$:\n1. At $z=0$, $\\phi(0) = 0$:\n   $$0 = -E_z(0) + C \\implies C=0$$\n2. At $z=L$, $\\phi(L) = V$:\n   $$V = -E_z L$$\nSolving for the axial electric field component $E_z$:\n$$\nE_z = -\\frac{V}{L}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with all other conditions. Gauss's law $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{D} = 0$ is satisfied because the decoupling implies $D_z = \\epsilon_{33}^{S} E_z$, which is constant, and other components of $\\boldsymbol{D}$ do not contribute to a non-zero divergence. The insulation condition on the lateral surface, $\\boldsymbol{D} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = D_r = 0$, is also satisfied since $E_r=0$ and the strain field does not generate $D_r$.\n\nCombining the two derived expressions, we obtain the required solution set.\nThe circumferential displacement at $z=L$ is $u_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{2MLr}{\\pi a^4 c_{44}}$.\nThe axial electric field is $E_z = -\\frac{V}{L}$.",

It presents a standard problem in continuum mechanics concerning the transformation of material property tensors under a coordinate system rotation. All provided data are physically plausible and consistent with the specified material symmetry. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two components, $C'_{1111}$ and $e'_{311}$, of the elasticity and piezoelectric stress tensors, respectively, in a rotated laboratory frame. The transformation is from the crystal frame $\\{X, Y, Z\\}$ to the laboratory frame $\\{x, y, z\\}$ via a rotation of $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ about the $Y$-axis.\n\nThe transformation for the coordinates is given by $x_p = Q_{pi} X_i$, where $Q$ is the orthogonal rotation matrix.\nA fourth-order tensor, such as the elasticity tensor $C_{ijkl}$, transforms according to the rule:\n$$C'_{pqrs} = Q_{pi} Q_{qj} Q_{rk} Q_{sl} C_{ijkl}$$\nA third-order tensor, such as the piezoelectric stress tensor $e_{ijk}$, transforms according to:\n$$e'_{pqr} = Q_{pi} Q_{qj} Q_{rk} e_{ijk}$$\nIn these expressions, the Einstein summation convention over repeated indices ($i,j,k,l \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$) is implied. The components of the rotation matrix $Q$ for a rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $Y$-axis (the '$2$'-axis) are:\n$$\nQ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c & 0 & s \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -s & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $c = \\cos\\theta$ and $s = \\sin\\theta$.

Setting $p=q=r=s=1$ in the transformation law:\n$$C'_{1111} = Q_{1i} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} Q_{1l} C_{ijkl}$$\nFrom the matrix $Q$, the only non-zero components in the first row are $Q_{11} = c$ and $Q_{13} = s$. Therefore, the indices $i, j, k, l$ in the sum can only take values of $1$ or $3$ to yield non-zero terms.\n\nThe material is transversely isotropic with the $Z$-axis (the '$3$'-axis) as the axis of symmetry. The non-zero components of $C_{ijkl}$ are those with an even number of each index from the transverse plane (i.e., indices $1$ and $2$). In our restricted sum where indices are only $1$ or $3$, the non-zero components are $C_{1111}$, $C_{3333}$, $C_{1133}$, and $C_{1313}$ (and those related by symmetry).\n\nLet us expand the summation by considering all contributing terms:\n$$C'_{1111} = \\sum_{i,j,k,l \\in \\{1,3\\}} Q_{1i} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} Q_{1l} C_{ijkl}$$\nThe terms in the sum can be grouped by the non-zero $C_{ijkl}$ components:\n1.  Term with $C_{1111}$: The only combination of indices is $i=j=k=l=1$. This gives the term $Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{11}C_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111}$.\n2.  Term with $C_{3333}$: The only combination is $i=j=k=l=3$. This gives the term $Q_{13}Q_{13}Q_{13}Q_{13}C_{3333} = s^4 C_{3333}$.\n3.  Terms with $C_{1133}$ (and its symmetric equivalents like $C_{3311}$): These terms have two indices equal to $1$ and two equal to $3$. The combinations are $(1,1,3,3)$ and $(3,3,1,1)$. This yields $Q_{11}^2 Q_{13}^2 C_{1133} + Q_{13}^2 Q_{11}^2 C_{3311}$. Due to major symmetry, $C_{1133} = C_{3311}$. So this contribution is $2 c^2 s^2 C_{1133}$.\n4.  Terms with $C_{1313}$ (and its symmetric equivalents): These terms also have two indices equal to $1$ and two equal to $3$. The combinations are $(1,3,1,3)$, $(1,3,3,1)$, $(3,1,1,3)$, and $(3,1,3,1)$. This yields $Q_{11}Q_{13}Q_{11}Q_{13}C_{1313} + Q_{11}Q_{13}Q_{13}Q_{11}C_{1331} + Q_{13}Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{13}C_{3113} + Q_{13}Q_{11}Q_{13}Q_{11}C_{3131}$. Due to minor symmetries, $C_{1313} = C_{1331} = C_{3113} = C_{3131}$. So this contribution is $4 c^2 s^2 C_{1313}$.\n\nAll other components like $C_{1113}$, $C_{1333}$ are zero for this symmetry class.\nCombining all terms, we obtain the full expression:\n$$C'_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111} + s^4 C_{3333} + 2c^2s^2 C_{1133} + 4c^2s^2 C_{1313}$$\nUsing the contracted (Voigt-like) notation from the problem statement: $C_{11} \\equiv C_{1111}$, $C_{33} \\equiv C_{3333}$, $C_{13} \\equiv C_{1133}$, and $C_{44} \\equiv C_{1313}$ (noting for transverse isotropy $C_{55}=C_{1313}=C_{44}$).\n$$C'_{11} = c^4 C_{11} + s^4 C_{33} + 2c^2s^2 C_{13} + 4c^2s^2 C_{44}$$\n$$C'_{11} = c^4 C_{11} + s^4 C_{33} + 2c^2s^2 (C_{13} + 2C_{44})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$\\theta = 30^\\circ$, $c = \\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $s = \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$c^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$, $s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. $c^4 = \\frac{9}{16}$, $s^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n$C_{11} = 160$ GPa, $C_{33} = 140$ GPa, $C_{13} = 75$ GPa, $C_{44} = 35$ GPa.\n$$C'_{11} = \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)(160) + \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(140) + 2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(75 + 2(35)\\right)$$\n$$C'_{11} = \\frac{1440}{16} + \\frac{140}{16} + \\frac{6}{16}(75 + 70)$$\n$$C'_{11} = \\frac{1}{16} (1440 + 140 + 6(145)) = \\frac{1}{16} (1580 + 870) = \\frac{2450}{16}$$\n$$C'_{11} = 153.125~\\text{GPa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $C'_{1111} = 153.1$ GPa.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Rotated Piezoelectric Component $e'_{311}$**\n\nWe now compute the component $e'_{311}$ of the rotated piezoelectric stress tensor. Setting $p=3, q=1, r=1$ in the transformation law:\n$$e'_{311} = Q_{3i} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} e_{ijk}$$\nFrom the $Q$ matrix, the non-zero components of the first row are $Q_{11}=c, Q_{13}=s$, and of the third row are $Q_{31}=-s, Q_{33}=c$. Thus, the summation indices must be $i \\in \\{1,3\\}$ and $j,k \\in \\{1,3\\}$.\n$$e'_{311} = \\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\{1,3\\}} Q_{3i} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} e_{ijk} = Q_{31} \\sum_{j,k \\in \\{1,3\\}} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} e_{1jk} + Q_{33} \\sum_{j,k \\in \\{1,3\\}} Q_{1j} Q_{1k} e_{3jk}$$\nFor a crystal of class $6mm$, the non-zero $e_{ijk}$ components given are $e_{311}=e_{322}=e_{31}$, $e_{333}=e_{33}$, and $e_{113}=e_{131}=e_{223}=e_{232}=e_{15}$. The problem also states symmetry in the last two indices, $e_{ijk} = e_{ikj}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the two sums:\n1.  First sum (with $i=1$):\n    $$Q_{31} [Q_{11}^2 e_{111} + Q_{11}Q_{13}e_{113} + Q_{13}Q_{11}e_{131} + Q_{13}^2 e_{133}]$$\n    For class $6mm$, $e_{111}=0$ and $e_{133}=0$. With $e_{113}=e_{131}=e_{15}$, this sum becomes:\n    $$(-s)[c \\cdot s \\cdot e_{15} + s \\cdot c \\cdot e_{15}] = -s(2cs e_{15}) = -2cs^2 e_{15}$$\n2.  Second sum (with $i=3$):\n    $$Q_{33} [Q_{11}^2 e_{311} + Q_{11}Q_{13}e_{313} + Q_{13}Q_{11}e_{331} + Q_{13}^2 e_{333}]$$\n    For class $6mm$, $e_{313}=e_{331}=0$. The sum becomes:\n    $$(c)[c^2 e_{311} + s^2 e_{333}] = c^3 e_{311} + cs^2 e_{333}$$\n    Using the notation from the problem: $e_{311}=e_{31}$ and $e_{333}=e_{33}$.\n\nCombining the two parts gives the full expression:\n$$e'_{311} = c^3 e_{31} + cs^2 e_{33} - 2cs^2 e_{15}$$\n$$e'_{311} = c^3 e_{31} + cs^2(e_{33} - 2e_{15})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$e_{31} = -0.58$ C/m$^2$, $e_{33} = 1.34$ C/m$^2$, $e_{15} = 0.48$ C/m$^2$.\n$c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $s = \\frac{1}{2}$. $c^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}$, $cs^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}$.\n$$e'_{311} = \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)(-0.58) + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}(1.34 - 2(0.48))$$\n$$e'_{311} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} [3(-0.58) + (1.34 - 0.96)]$$\n$$e'_{311} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} [-1.74 + 0.38]$$\n$$e'_{311} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} [-1.36] = -0.17\\sqrt{3} \\approx -0.17 \\times 1.73205...$$\n$$e'_{311} \\approx -0.2944485~\\text{C/m}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $e'_{311} = -0.294$ C/m$^2$.\n\nThe requested numerical values are $C'_{1111} = 153.1$ GPa and $e'_{311} = -0.294$ C/m$^2$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the formulation of boundary value problems in linear piezoelectricity for the Finite Element Method (FEM). It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and electrostatics, well-posed, objective, and self-contained for the analysis requested. We may proceed to derive the variational formulation and evaluate each statement.\n\n### Derivation of the Weak (Variational) Form\nThe weak form is derived by applying the method of weighted residuals to the governing strong-form equations.\n\n1.  **Mechanical Equation:** The balance of linear momentum is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. We multiply by a vector test function $\\delta\\mathbf{u}$ (a virtual displacement), which belongs to a suitable space of functions that vanish on the Dirichlet boundary $\\Gamma_u$ (i.e., $\\delta\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$ on $\\Gamma_u$), and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 0 $$\n    Applying the divergence theorem to the first term (using the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T \\mathbf{v}) = (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\nabla\\mathbf{v}$ and the symmetry of the Cauchy stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$) yields:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Gamma} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla(\\delta\\mathbf{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\n    Since $\\delta\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$ on $\\Gamma_u$, the boundary integral is non-zero only on $\\Gamma_t = \\Gamma \\setminus \\Gamma_u$. The term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla(\\delta\\mathbf{u})$ can be replaced by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\delta\\mathbf{u})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\delta\\mathbf{u})$ is the symmetric part of $\\nabla(\\delta\\mathbf{u})$ (the virtual strain), because $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is symmetric. Substituting back, we get:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\delta\\mathbf{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega + \\int_{\\Gamma_t} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma $$\n    The term on the left is the internal virtual work. The terms on the right are the external virtual work done by body forces $\\mathbf{b}$ and prescribed tractions $\\overline{\\mathbf{t}} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$ on $\\Gamma_t$.\n\n2.  **Electrical Equation:** Gauss's law is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} - \\rho_v = 0$. We multiply by a scalar test function $\\delta\\phi$ (a virtual potential), where $\\delta\\phi = 0$ on the Dirichlet boundary $\\Gamma_\\phi$, and integrate over $\\Omega$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} - \\rho_v) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 0 $$\n    Applying the divergence theorem to the first term (using the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\phi\\mathbf{F}) = (\\nabla\\phi)\\cdot\\mathbf{F} + \\phi(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F})$):\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Gamma} (\\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\nabla(\\delta\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\n    Since $\\delta\\phi = 0$ on $\\Gamma_\\phi$, the boundary integral is non-zero only on $\\Gamma_q = \\Gamma \\setminus \\Gamma_\\phi$. Substituting back, we get:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\nabla(\\delta\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Gamma_q} (\\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_v \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\n    The electrical Neumann boundary condition prescribes the surface free charge density $\\overline{\\rho_s}$ on $\\Gamma_q$, which by definition is $\\overline{\\rho_s} = \\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$.\n\nThe fields $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\phi$ whose specification on a boundary is required for the problem to be well-posed are called primary fields or essential variables. The boundary conditions fixing them are **Dirichlet** (or essential) boundary conditions. The quantities appearing in the boundary integrals that arise from integration by parts, $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\rho_s = \\mathbf{D}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}$, are the conjugate fluxes or natural variables. Boundary conditions that prescribe them are **Neumann** (or natural) boundary conditions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Dirichlet boundary conditions fix the primary fields: $\\mathbf{u} = \\overline{\\mathbf{u}}$ on $\\Gamma_u$ and $\\phi = \\overline{\\phi}$ on $\\Gamma_\\phi$. The corresponding natural Neumann data are $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$ on $\\Gamma_t$ and $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D} = \\rho_s$ on $\\Gamma_q$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation above. The primary fields are indeed the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$ and potential $\\phi$. Prescribing them constitutes a Dirichlet boundary condition. The integration by parts (divergence theorem) naturally introduces the traction vector $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$ and the normal component of electric displacement $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}$ (which is the surface charge density $\\rho_s$) in the boundary terms of the weak formulation. Prescribing these fluxes constitutes a Neumann boundary condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. To impose $\\phi = V_0$ on a perfectly conducting electrode $\\Gamma_e$ via a Lagrange multiplier, it suffices to add the term $\\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\lambda\\,\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ to the weak form; the multiplier $\\lambda$ equals the normal electric displacement $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}$.**\nThis statement contains two errors.\nFirst, to enforce the constraint $\\phi = V_0$, one augments the potential energy functional with the term $\\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\lambda (\\phi - V_0) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$. Taking the variation with respect to $\\phi$ contributes the term $\\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\lambda \\delta\\phi \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ to the weak form. The statement's term $\\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\lambda \\phi \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ would enforce the constraint $\\phi = 0$, not $\\phi = V_0$, and it misrepresents how contributions to the weak form arise from the variational principle.\nSecond, by integrating the electrical weak form by parts back to the strong form on the boundary $\\Gamma_e$, we find that $\\lambda + \\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D} = 0$, which implies $\\lambda = - \\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}$. The multiplier $\\lambda$ represents the negative of the surface charge density required to maintain the potential $V_0$. The statement omits the negative sign.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A penalty enforcement of $\\phi = V_0$ on $\\Gamma_e$ can be introduced by adding the surface energy $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\eta \\int_{\\Gamma_e} (\\phi - V_0)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$, which contributes the weak boundary term $\\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\eta\\,(\\phi - V_0)\\,\\delta\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$. The penalty parameter $\\eta$ should be chosen on the order of an electrical stiffness per unit area, e.g., $\\eta \\approx \\varepsilon/\\ell$ with $\\varepsilon$ a representative permittivity and $\\ell$ a characteristic length scale.**\nThe penalty method enforces a constraint approximately by adding a term to the energy functional that penalizes deviations from the constraint. The term $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\eta \\int_{\\Gamma_e} (\\phi - V_0)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ is the standard quadratic penalty functional, which is minimized (equals zero) when $\\phi = V_0$. Its variation with respect to $\\phi$ is $\\delta \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\eta \\int_{\\Gamma_e} (\\phi - V_0)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma \\right) = \\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\eta\\,(\\phi - V_0)\\,\\delta\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$, which is precisely the stated contribution to the weak form.\nFor the units of the penalty parameter $\\eta$: the energy term has units of Joules ($J$). Since $\\int (\\phi-V_0)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ has units of $V^2 \\cdot m^2$, the units of $\\eta$ must be $J / (V^2 \\cdot m^2)$. Recalling that capacitance is Farads ($F$) and $1\\,F = 1\\,J/V^2$, the unit of $\\eta$ is $F/m^2$ (capacitance per area). The suggested form $\\eta \\approx \\varepsilon/\\ell$ has units of $(F/m)/m = F/m^2$, which is dimensionally consistent. This corresponds to the capacitance per unit area of a thin fictitious layer of permittivity $\\varepsilon$ and thickness $\\ell$. A large $\\eta$ (high stiffness) better enforces the constraint. This physical and dimensional reasoning is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Electrical Neumann boundary conditions prescribe the normal component of the electric field, $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = e_n$, since the natural electrical boundary term after integration by parts involves $\\mathbf{E}$.**\nThis is incorrect. As shown in the derivation of the weak form, the governing equation for electrostatics is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_v$. The integration by parts acts on the term with $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$, and the resulting natural boundary term involves the flux conjugate to the potential $\\phi$, which is the normal component of the electric displacement, $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}$. The natural boundary term does not involve the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$. Prescribing $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}$ is a possible but non-natural boundary condition in this standard formulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Mixed (Robin-type) electrical boundary conditions may take the form $\\alpha\\,\\phi + \\beta\\,(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}) = g$ on $\\Gamma_m$, which recover Dirichlet and Neumann as limiting cases; a mechanical analogue is $\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{u} + \\beta\\,(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}) = \\mathbf{h}$ on a mechanical mixed boundary.**\nA mixed or Robin-type boundary condition is a linear combination of a field (Dirichlet data) and its conjugate flux (Neumann data).\nFor the electrical problem, the field is $\\phi$ and the flux is $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}$. The form $\\alpha\\,\\phi + \\beta\\,(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}) = g$ is the correct definition of a Robin condition. If $\\beta=0$ (with $\\alpha=1$), it becomes the Dirichlet condition $\\phi=g$. If $\\alpha=0$ (with $\\beta=1$), it becomes the Neumann condition $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}=g$.\nFor the mechanical problem, the field is the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$ and the flux is the traction $\\mathbf{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$. The form $\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{u} + \\beta\\,(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}) = \\mathbf{h}$ is the correct mechanical analogue, physically representing an elastic foundation or distributed spring boundary. The statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. When enforcing $\\phi = V_0$ using Lagrange multipliers, the multiplier $\\lambda$ has units of voltage and achieves the constraint by penalizing deviations quadratically on $\\Gamma_e$.**\nThis statement confuses the Lagrange multiplier and penalty methods. First, as analyzed for option B, the units of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ are charge per unit area ($C/m^2$), not voltage ($V$). This is required for the term $\\int \\lambda(\\phi-V_0)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ to have units of energy. Second, the mechanism of penalizing deviations quadratically (i.e., via a term proportional to $(\\phi-V_0)^2$) is characteristic of the penalty method, not the Lagrange multiplier method. The Lagrange multiplier method enforces the constraint exactly by introducing an additional field ($\\lambda$) and a constraint equation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
