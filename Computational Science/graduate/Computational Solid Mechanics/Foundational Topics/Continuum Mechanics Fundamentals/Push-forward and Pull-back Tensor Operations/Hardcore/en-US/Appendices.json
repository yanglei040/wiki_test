A fundamental result in continuum mechanics is that the Lie derivative of the Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, is the push-forward of the material time derivative of the 2nd P-K stress tensor, $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} \\dot{\\mathbf{S}} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nwhere $(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = \\dot{\\tau}_{ij} - l_{ik}\\tau_{kj} - \\tau_{ik}l_{kj}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Spatial Elasticity Tensor**\n\nWe can now combine these relations to derive the spatial constitutive law.\nStarting with the stress rate transformation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} \\dot{\\mathbf{S}} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nSubstitute the material constitutive law, $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}} = \\mathbb{C} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbb{C} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}) \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nNow, substitute the kinematic relation $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbb{C} : (\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F})) \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nTo make the structure clear, we write this in index notation. Let capital indices ($I, J, K, L$) denote the material configuration and lower-case indices ($i, j, k, l$) denote the spatial configuration.\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = F_{iI} (\\dot{S}_{IJ}) F_{jJ}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{IJ} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\dot{E}_{KL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} (F_{kK} d_{kl} F_{lL})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{S}_{IJ}$ into the expression for $(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij}$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = F_{iI} (\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} F_{kK} d_{kl} F_{lL}) F_{jJ}\n$$\nRearranging the terms (as they are all scalars summed over repeated indices):\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = (F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}) d_{kl}\n$$\nThe spatial constitutive law relates an objective stress rate to the rate of deformation, typically as $\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{c}_{\\tau} : \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{c}_{\\tau}$ is the spatial elasticity tensor corresponding to the Kirchhoff stress. By comparison, we identify its components as:\n$$\n(c_{\\tau})_{ijkl} = F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the spatial counterpart of $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}$ consistent with the Cauchy stress transformation. This corresponds to the tensor that relates the Truesdell rate of Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla$ to $\\mathbf{d}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla = \\frac{1}{J}\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. The relationship is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla = \\mathbf{c} : \\mathbf{d}$.\nFrom this, we have $\\mathbf{c} = \\frac{1}{J}\\mathbf{c}_{\\tau}$. Thus, the components of the spatial elasticity tensor $\\mathbf{c}$ are:\n$$\nc_{ijkl} = \\frac{1}{J} F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}\n$$\nThis is the required push-forward mapping.\n\n**4. Preservation of Symmetries**\n\nThe material tensor $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}$ for a hyperelastic material possesses minor symmetries ($\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL}$ and $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJLK}$) and major symmetry ($\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{KLIJ}$). The derived push-forward mapping preserves these symmetries. For example, to prove the first minor symmetry $c_{ijkl} = c_{jikl}$:\n\\begin{align*}\nc_{jikl} &= \\frac{1}{J} F_{jI} F_{iJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{J} F_{jJ} F_{iI} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL} \\quad (\\text{swapping dummy indices } I \\leftrightarrow J) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{J} F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\quad (\\text{using } \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\text{ and rearranging terms}) \\\\\n&= c_{ijkl}\n\\end{align*}\nSimilar proofs hold for the other minor symmetry and the major symmetry, confirming that if $\\mathbb{C}$ has these symmetries, so will the pushed-forward tensor $c$.\n\n**5. Material and Spatial Isotropic Tensors**\n\nFor an isotropic material, the elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ in the reference configuration is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\lambda \\delta_{IJ} \\delta_{KL} + \\mu (\\delta_{IK} \\delta_{JL} + \\delta_{IL} \\delta_{JK})\n$$\nIf the deformation is a pure rotation, $\\mathbf{F} \\in SO(3)$, then $\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{I}$ and $J=1$. The push-forward operation simplifies, yielding the same isotropic form in the spatial configuration:\n$$\nc_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jk})\n$$\nThis property, known as material frame-indifference, will be verified numerically.\n\nThe following Python code implements this derived mapping and performs the required checks.",
