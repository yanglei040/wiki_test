            "solution": "### 1. Formulation of Strong and Weak Boundary Value Problems\n\nThe problem is governed by the static balance of linear momentum and a linear elastic constitutive relation.\n\n**Strong Form:**\nThe balance of linear momentum is given by:\n$$-\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = b$$\nThe constitutive relation for anti-plane shear is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mu \\nabla u$$\nwhere $u$ is the out-of-plane displacement, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the stress vector (in this 2D context, a vector with components $(\\sigma_{zx}, \\sigma_{zy})$ if the plane is $xy$ and displacement is in $z$), $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, and $b$ is the body force density.\n\nSubstituting the constitutive relation into the balance equation yields:\n$$-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mu \\nabla u) = b$$\nGiven that $\\mu$ is a positive constant, this simplifies to:\n$$-\\mu \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla u) = b$$\n$$-\\mu \\Delta u = b$$\nwhere $\\Delta u = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla u$ is the Laplacian of $u$.\n\nThe problem specifies the domain $\\Omega = (-1,1)^{2} \\setminus ([0,1] \\times [-1,0])$, shear modulus $\\mu=1$, and a constant body force density $b=1$. The displacement is prescribed as zero on the entire boundary $\\Gamma_D = \\partial \\Omega$.\nThus, the strong form of the boundary value problem is to find a function $u$ that is sufficiently smooth (e.g., $u \\in C^{2}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0}(\\bar{\\Omega})$) satisfying:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta u = 1 & \\text{in } \\Omega \\\\\nu = 0 & \\text{on } \\partial \\Omega\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Weak (Variational) Form:**\nTo derive the weak form, we start with the strong form, multiply by an arbitrary test function $v$, and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$. The test function $v$ must be chosen from a suitable function space. Since the boundary condition $u=0$ is essential (Dirichlet), we require the trial function $u$ and the test function $v$ to belong to a space where this condition is satisfied. The appropriate space is the Sobolev space $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe space $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ is the space of functions in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ whose first weak derivatives are also in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. The space $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ is the subset of $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ functions whose trace (generalized boundary value) is zero on $\\partial\\Omega$. Formally, $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ is the closure of $C^{\\infty}_{0}(\\Omega)$ (infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in $\\Omega$) in the $H^{1}$ norm.\n\nLet $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ be the trial solution and $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ be the test function.\nMultiplying the PDE by $v$ and integrating:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (-\\Delta u) v \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} 1 \\cdot v \\, d\\Omega $$\nWe apply Green's first identity (integration by parts in multiple dimensions) to the left-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\nabla u \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) v \\, dS = \\int_{\\Omega} v \\, d\\Omega $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Since the test function $v$ is in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, its trace on the boundary is zero, i.e., $v = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Therefore, the boundary integral vanishes:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\nabla u \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) v \\, dS = 0 $$\nThe resulting equation is the weak form of the problem: Find $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ such that\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} v \\, d\\Omega \\quad \\forall v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega) $$\nTo formalize this for the Lax-Milgram theorem, we define a bilinear form $a(u,v)$ and a linear functional $L(v)$:\n-   Bilinear form: $a(u,v) := \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega$\n-   Linear functional: $L(v) := \\int_{\\Omega} v \\, d\\Omega$\n\nThe weak problem is then: Find $u \\in V$ such that $a(u,v) = L(v)$ for all $v \\in V$, where the function space for both trial and test functions is $V = H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\n### 2. Existence and Uniqueness via Lax-Milgram Theorem\n\nThe Lax–Milgram theorem states that if $V$ is a Hilbert space, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot): V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded and coercive bilinear form, and $L(\\cdot): V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded linear functional, then there exists a unique solution $u \\in V$ to the problem $a(u,v) = L(v)$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nWe verify these conditions for our problem with $V = H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$. The inner product on $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ is $\\langle u,v \\rangle_{H^1} = \\int_\\Omega (uv + \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v) d\\Omega$, and the norm is $\\|v\\|_{H^1} = \\sqrt{\\langle v,v \\rangle_{H^1}}$.\n\n**a) Boundedness of the linear functional $L(v)$:**\n$$ |L(v)| = \\left| \\int_{\\Omega} v \\, d\\Omega \\right| = \\left| \\int_{\\Omega} 1 \\cdot v \\, d\\Omega \\right| $$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$:\n$$ |L(v)| \\le \\left(\\int_{\\Omega} 1^{2} \\, d\\Omega \\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\int_{\\Omega} v^{2} \\, d\\Omega \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\text{Area}(\\Omega)} \\|v\\|_{L^2} $$\nThe area of the L-shaped domain is $3$. So, $|L(v)| \\le \\sqrt{3} \\|v\\|_{L^2}$. Since $\\|v\\|_{L^2} \\le \\|v\\|_{H^1}$, we have\n$$ |L(v)| \\le \\sqrt{3} \\|v\\|_{H^1} $$\nThus, $L$ is a bounded linear functional on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**b) Boundedness of the bilinear form $a(u,v)$:**\n$$ |a(u,v)| = \\left| \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega \\right| $$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and then for functions in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$:\n$$ |a(u,v)| \\le \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u| |\\nabla v| \\, d\\Omega \\le \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2} \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2} $$\nThe $L^2$ norm of the gradient is part of the $H^1$ norm: $\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2} \\le \\|v\\|_{H^1}$. Therefore,\n$$ |a(u,v)| \\le \\|u\\|_{H^1} \\|v\\|_{H^1} $$\nThis shows that $a(u,v)$ is bounded with a boundedness constant $M=1$.\n\n**c) Coercivity (or $V$-ellipticity) of the bilinear form $a(u,v)$:**\nWe need to show there exists a constant $\\alpha > 0$ such that $a(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|v\\|_{H^1}^{2}$ for all $v \\in V$. For $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, we have:\n$$ a(v,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla v \\cdot \\nabla v \\, d\\Omega = \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2} $$\nThe Poincaré inequality holds for bounded domains like $\\Omega$: for any $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, there exists a constant $C_P > 0$ (depending only on $\\Omega$) such that $\\|v\\|_{L^2} \\le C_P \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}$.\nThe $H^1$ norm is $\\|v\\|_{H^1}^{2} = \\|v\\|_{L^2}^{2} + \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2}$. Using the Poincaré inequality:\n$$ \\|v\\|_{H^1}^{2} \\le C_P^{2} \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2} + \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2} = (C_P^{2} + 1) \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2} $$\nRearranging this, we get:\n$$ \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{C_P^{2} + 1} \\|v\\|_{H^1}^{2} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ a(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|v\\|_{H^1}^{2} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{1}{C_P^{2} + 1} > 0 $$\nThe bilinear form $a(u,v)$ is coercive on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\nSince all conditions of the Lax-Milgram theorem are satisfied, there exists a unique weak solution $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ to the problem.\n\n### 3. & 4. Corner Singularity Analysis and Non-existence of a Strong Solution in $H^{2}(\\Omega)$\n\nThe existence of a strong solution $u \\in H^2(\\Omega)$ depends on the regularity of the domain and the data. While the data $b=1$ is smooth, the L-shaped domain $\\Omega$ is not convex and has a reentrant corner, which prevents the solution from being in $H^2(\\Omega)$.\n\nTo analyze the local behavior, we focus on the homogeneous Laplace equation $\\Delta u = 0$ near the reentrant corner at the origin. The local singularity is governed by the homogeneous part of the PDE. We use polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$, where the corner is at $r=0$. The domain locally corresponds to the wedge $0 < r < \\epsilon$ and $0 < \\theta < \\omega = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The boundary conditions on the adjacent edges are $u=0$ for $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\omega$.\n\nWe use separation of variables, seeking a non-trivial solution of the form $u(r,\\theta) = r^{\\lambda} \\phi(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation in polar coordinates, $\\Delta u = u_{rr} + \\frac{1}{r} u_r + \\frac{1}{r^2} u_{\\theta\\theta} = 0$, gives:\n$$ \\lambda(\\lambda-1) r^{\\lambda-2} \\phi(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r} \\lambda r^{\\lambda-1} \\phi(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r^2} r^{\\lambda} \\phi''(\\theta) = 0 $$\n$$ r^{\\lambda-2} [\\lambda^2 \\phi(\\theta) + \\phi''(\\theta)] = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\phi''(\\theta) + \\lambda^2 \\phi(\\theta) = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $\\phi(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + B \\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$.\nThe boundary conditions $u(r,0)=0$ and $u(r,\\omega)=0$ translate to $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(\\omega)=0$.\n-   $\\phi(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0$.\n-   So, $\\phi(\\theta) = B \\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$.\n-   $\\phi(\\omega) = B \\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0$, which implies $\\lambda\\omega = k\\pi$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n$$ \\lambda_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{\\omega} $$\nFor the given domain, $\\omega = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The exponents are:\n$$ \\lambda_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{3\\pi/2} = \\frac{2k}{3}, \\quad k=1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThe solution near the corner is a linear combination of these basis functions: $u(r,\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k r^{2k/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2k\\theta}{3}\\right)$.\n\nThe most singular part of the solution corresponds to the smallest positive exponent $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda = \\frac{2}{3}$. This is the **leading-order singular term**:\n$$ u_s(r,\\theta) = c_1 r^{2/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\theta}{3}\\right) $$\nwhere $c_1$ is a constant known as the stress intensity factor, determined by the global geometry and loading. The problem asks for the form of this term.\n\nNow we can construct the counterexample required in part 3 by analyzing the regularity of this term. Let's check if a function that behaves like $u_s$ near the origin belongs to $H^1(\\Omega)$ and $H^2(\\Omega)$.\n\n**Regularity check:**\nThe derivatives of $u_s$ behave as:\n-   First derivatives: $|\\nabla u_s| \\sim \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} r^{2/3} \\sim r^{2/3 - 1} = r^{-1/3}$.\n-   Second derivatives: $|\\nabla^2 u_s| \\sim \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} r^{2/3} \\sim r^{2/3 - 2} = r^{-4/3}$.\n\nTo check if $u_s \\in H^1$ locally, we must check if its first derivatives are square-integrable. The integral of $|\\nabla u_s|^2$ near the origin behaves as:\n$$ \\int_0^\\epsilon \\int_0^{3\\pi/2} |\\nabla u_s|^2 r \\, d\\theta \\, dr \\sim \\int_0^\\epsilon (r^{-1/3})^2 r \\, dr = \\int_0^\\epsilon r^{-2/3} r \\, dr = \\int_0^\\epsilon r^{1/3} \\, dr $$\nThis integral is $\\left[\\frac{3}{4} r^{4/3}\\right]_0^\\epsilon$, which is finite. Thus, the weak solution $u \\in H^1(\\Omega)$.\n\nTo check if $u_s \\in H^2$ locally, we must check if its second derivatives are square-integrable. The integral of $|\\nabla^2 u_s|^2$ behaves as:\n$$ \\int_0^\\epsilon \\int_0^{3\\pi/2} |\\nabla^2 u_s|^2 r \\, d\\theta \\, dr \\sim \\int_0^\\epsilon (r^{-4/3})^2 r \\, dr = \\int_0^\\epsilon r^{-8/3} r \\, dr = \\int_0^\\epsilon r^{-5/3} \\, dr $$\nThis integral is $\\left[-\\frac{3}{2} r^{-2/3}\\right]_0^\\epsilon$, which diverges as $r \\to 0$.\nSince the second derivatives are not square-integrable, $u_s \\notin H^2$ in any neighborhood of the origin. This implies that the full solution $u$ is not in $H^2(\\Omega)$.\n\nThis analysis constitutes the counterexample showing that a strong solution in the sense of $u \\in H^2(\\Omega)$ does not exist, even though a unique weak solution in $H^1(\\Omega)$ is guaranteed. The failure of $H^2$ regularity is a direct consequence of the reentrant corner in the domain.\n\n### 5. Implications for Boundary Conditions\n\nThe enforcement of essential boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\\Gamma_D$ is handled differently in the weak formulation versus how one might conceive of it for a classical solution.\n-   **In the Weak Formulation:** The condition $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$ is satisfied in a generalized sense via the trace theorem. The function space for the solution, $H^1_0(\\Omega)$, is specifically defined as the set of $H^1(\\Omega)$ functions whose trace on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is zero. By seeking a solution $u$ within this space, the boundary condition is imposed *a priori* as a constraint on the space of admissible functions. It is an \"essential\" part of the problem's setup, not an equation to be satisfied by the solution in a pointwise sense (which may not be meaningful for an $H^1$ function).\n-   **In Numerical Approximations (e.g., Finite Element Method):** The same principle applies. One constructs a finite-dimensional subspace $V_h \\subset H^1_0(\\Omega)$. This is typically done by defining a mesh over $\\Omega$ and using a basis of piecewise polynomial functions (shape functions) $\\phi_i(x)$. To ensure that any function $u_h = \\sum c_i \\phi_i$ in $V_h$ satisfies $u_h=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, one simply ensures that all basis functions $\\phi_i$ associated with nodes *not* on the boundary are zero on $\\partial\\Omega$. In practice, degrees of freedom corresponding to nodes on the Dirichlet boundary are eliminated from the global system of algebraic equations.\n\nThe presence of the singularity $u_s \\sim r^{2/3}$ has profound consequences for numerical approximations. Standard FEM with uniform meshes and polynomial basis functions struggle to capture the singular behavior. The error in the energy norm, $\\|u-u_h\\|_{H^1}$, which for a smooth solution would converge at a rate of $O(h^p)$ (where $h$ is the mesh size and $p$ is the polynomial degree), is limited by the regularity of the solution. For this problem, the convergence rate degrades to $O(h^{\\lambda_1}) = O(h^{2/3})$, which is substantially slower than the optimal rate of $O(h)$ for linear elements. This necessitates advanced techniques like graded mesh refinement towards the corner or enriching the basis functions with the known singular form (e.g., using XFEM or singular elements) to restore optimal convergence rates.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of a one-dimensional linear elastic bar using the Finite Element Method (FEM), specifically focusing on the effects of \"variational crimes\" on the consistency of the formulation. We will first derive the weak form, then the discrete equation with the specified approximations, solve for the unknown displacement, and finally compute the consistency indicator $J$.\n\nThe governing strong form of the boundary value problem is given by:\n$$-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(E A(x) u'(x)\\right) = b(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0, L)$$\nwith boundary conditions:\n$$u(0) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Essential BC})$$\n$$E A(L) u'(L) = t_{0} \\quad (\\text{Natural BC})$$\nwhere $u(x)$ is the axial displacement, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $A(x) = A_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$ is the variable cross-sectional area, $b(x) = b_{1} x$ is the distributed body force (force per unit length), and $t_0$ is the applied traction (a concentrated force) at the end $x=L$.\n\nTo derive the weak form, we employ the principle of virtual work.

For the specified orientation, $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{P}$.\n- Inconsistent: $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{load}}^{\\text{inc}} = \\frac{p}{2} (\\mathbf{N}\\otimes\\mathbf{t}) = \\frac{p}{2}\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}}$.\n\nWe evaluate $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}}$ for the orientation $\\mathbf{t} \\approx (1,0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ and $\\mathbf{N} \\approx (0,1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}} = \\mathbf{N}\\otimes\\mathbf{t} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the difference matrix $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}} - \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}} - \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 - 0 & 0 - (-1) \\\\ 1 - 1 & 0 - 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe $(1,2)$ component of this matrix is $[\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}} - \\mathbf{B}]_{1,2} = 1$.\nSubstituting this into the given formula for $k_{\\text{spur}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{spur}} = \\frac{p}{2} \\big( [\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{inc}} - \\mathbf{B}]_{1,2} \\big) = \\frac{p}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe quantity $p$ is a force per unit length (units $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), so $k_{\\text{spur}}$ has units of stiffness, which is consistent.",
