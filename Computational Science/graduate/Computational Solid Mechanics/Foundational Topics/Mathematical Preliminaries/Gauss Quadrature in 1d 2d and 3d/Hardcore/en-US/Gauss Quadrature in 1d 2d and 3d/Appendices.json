It asks for the exact calculation of a specific integral using a specified method. A potential issue could be the requirement of an \"exact\" result from a numerical quadrature rule. However, a $2$-point Gauss quadrature rule integrates polynomials of degree up to $2n-1 = 2(2)-1 = 3$ exactly. The integrand, once transformed to the reference domain, is $(N_{1}(\\xi))^{2}J$, where $N_1(\\xi)$ is linear in $\\xi$ and the Jacobian $J$ is constant for a linear element. Thus, the integrand is a quadratic polynomial in $\\xi$ (degree $2$), which is less than $3$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the consistent mass matrix entry $M_{11} = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} N_{1}(x)^{2} \\, dx$ using the isoparametric mapping and a $2$-point Gauss quadrature rule.\n\nFirst, we define the linear Lagrange shape functions on the reference element, which spans the domain $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$. The shape functions corresponding to nodes at $\\xi = -1$ and $\\xi = 1$ are:\n$$\nN_{1}(\\xi) = \\frac{1 - \\xi}{2}\n$$\n$$\nN_{2}(\\xi) = \\frac{1 + \\xi}{2}\n$$\nThese functions satisfy the required properties: $N_{1}(-1) = 1$, $N_{1}(1) = 0$, $N_{2}(-1) = 0$, and $N_{2}(1) = 1$.\n\nThe isoparametric mapping provides the physical coordinate $x$ as a function of the reference coordinate $\\xi$ using these same shape functions:\n$$\nx(\\xi) = N_{1}(\\xi)x_{1} + N_{2}(\\xi)x_{2} = \\frac{1 - \\xi}{2}x_{1} + \\frac{1 + \\xi}{2}x_{2}\n$$\nThis is an affine map. To transform the integral from the physical domain to the reference domain, we need the Jacobian of the transformation, $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} + \\xi \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{2}\n$$\nThe differential element transforms as $dx = J \\, d\\xi$.\n\nThe integral for $M_{11}$ can now be rewritten in the reference coordinate system. By the definition of an isoparametric element, the shape function $N_{1}(x)$ evaluated at a point $x(\\xi)$ is equivalent to the reference shape function $N_{1}(\\xi)$.\n$$\nM_{11} = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} N_{1}(x)^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} (N_{1}(x(\\xi)))^{2} J \\, d\\xi = \\int_{-1}^{1} (N_{1}(\\xi))^{2} J \\, d\\xi\n$$\nLet's define the integrand in the reference domain as $f(\\xi)$:\n$$\nf(\\xi) = (N_{1}(\\xi))^{2} J = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\xi}{2} \\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} (1 - \\xi)^{2}\n$$\nThis integrand is a polynomial of degree $2$ in $\\xi$.\n\nThe problem specifies using the $2$-point Gauss quadrature rule to evaluate the integral. The general form of Gauss quadrature is:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(\\xi) \\, d\\xi \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i} f(\\xi_{i})\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_i$ are the quadrature points (abscissas) and $w_i$ are the corresponding weights. For $n=2$, the points and weights are:\n- Points: $\\xi_{1} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, $\\xi_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n- Weights: $w_{1} = 1$, $w_{2} = 1$\n\nA $2$-point Gauss rule provides an exact result for polynomial integrands of degree up to $2n-1 = 2(2)-1 = 3$. Since our integrand $f(\\xi)$ is a polynomial of degree $2$, the quadrature will be an exact calculation, not an approximation.\n$$\nM_{11} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_{i} f(\\xi_{i}) = w_{1} f(\\xi_{1}) + w_{2} f(\\xi_{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the values for the points and weights:\n$$\nM_{11} = (1) \\cdot f\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) + (1) \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\nNow we evaluate the function $f(\\xi)$ at the two Gauss points:\nAt $\\xi_1 = -1/\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$\nf\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} \\left(1 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right)^{2} = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nAt $\\xi_2 = 1/\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nSumming these two terms gives $M_{11}$:\n$$\nM_{11} = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nLet's simplify the expression in the square brackets. Using the identity $(a+b)^{2} + (a-b)^{2} = 2(a^{2} + b^{2})$ with $a=1$ and $b=1/\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2} = 2 \\left(1^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $M_{11}$:\n$$\nM_{11} = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{8} \\left( \\frac{8}{3} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nM_{11} = \\frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{3}\n$$\nThis is the exact value for the mass matrix entry $M_{11}$, expressed as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the nodal coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$.",

For a tensor-product rule on the domain $\\Omega = [-1,1]\\times [-1,1]$ with $n_x$ points in the $x$-direction and $n_y$ points in the $y$-direction, the integral of a separable function $f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$ is given by\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x)h(y) \\, dx \\, dy = \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} h(y) \\, dy \\right)\n$$\nThe numerical approximation is\n$$\nI \\approx \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n_x} w_i^x g(x_i) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n_y} w_j^y h(y_j) \\right)\n$$\nThis approximation is exact if the $n_x$-point rule is exact for $g(x)$ and the $n_y$-point rule is exact for $h(y)$.\n\nIn this problem, the integrand is $f(x,y) = x^3 y^4$.

To guarantee exact integration, the degree of exactness of the quadrature rule must be at least $3$.

The minimal rule that *guarantees* exactness for any polynomial of degree $3$ is the $2$-point rule.\n\n2.  **Determination of the minimal rule in the $y$-direction ($n_y$):**\n    The function to be integrated is $h(y) = y^4$, which is a polynomial of degree $d_y = 4$.

Let's verify the approximation:\n$$\\widehat{I}[y] = w \\sum_{i=1}^{3} y_i = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{6}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\nThe rule is exact for $f(x,y)=y$.\n\nFor $f(x,y) = x^2$:\n$$I[x^2] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} x^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} x^2(1-x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x^3) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12}.$$\n$$\\widehat{I}[x^2] = w \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{16}{36} + \\frac{1}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{18}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}.$$\nThe rule is exact for $f(x,y)=x^2$.\n\nFor $f(x,y) = y^2$:\nBy symmetry, $I[y^2] = I[x^2] = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n$$\\widehat{I}[y^2] = w \\sum_{i=1}^{3} y_i^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{16}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{18}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12}.$$\nThe rule is exact for $f(x,y)=y^2$.\n\nFor $f(x,y) = xy$:\n$$I[xy] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} xy \\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} x \\left[\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{1-x} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x(1-x)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (x - 2x^2 + x^3) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{2x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^4}{4}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{6 - 8 + 3}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{24}.$$\n$$\\widehat{I}[xy] = w \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i y_i = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{2}{18} + \\frac{2}{18}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{4}{36} + \\frac{4}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{9}{36}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{24}.$$\nThe rule is exact for $f(x,y)=xy$.\nSince the rule is exact for all basis polynomials of total degree at most $2$, it is exact for any polynomial of total degree at most $2$. The verification is complete.\n\nFinally, we must compute the quadrature error $E[f]=\\widehat{I}[f] - I[f]$ for the monomial $f(x,y) = x^3$.\nFirst, we calculate the exact integral:\n$$I[x^3] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} x^3 \\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} x^3(1-x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} (x^3 - x^4) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\frac{x^4}{4} - \\frac{x^5}{5}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20}.$$\nNext, we calculate the quadrature approximation:\n$$\\widehat{I}[x^3] = w \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i^3 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{1}{216} + \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{1}{216} \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{2}{216} + \\frac{8}{27} \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{1}{108} + \\frac{8 \\cdot 4}{27 \\cdot 4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{1}{108} + \\frac{32}{108} \\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{33}{108}\\right).$$\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{33}{108}$ by dividing numerator and denominator by $3$ gives $\\frac{11}{36}$.\n$$\\widehat{I}[x^3] = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{11}{36} = \\frac{11}{216}.$$\nThe integrals $I[x^3] = \\frac{1}{20}$ and $\\widehat{I}[x^3] = \\frac{11}{216}$ are not equal, confirming that this cubic monomial is not integrated exactly.\n\nThe quadrature error is:\n$$E[x^3] = \\widehat{I}[x^3] - I[x^3] = \\frac{11}{216} - \\frac{1}{20}.$$\nTo find a common denominator, we compute the least common multiple of $216$ and $20$. $216 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3$ and $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$. The LCM is $2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 = 8 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 = 1080$.\n$$E[x^3] = \\frac{11 \\cdot 5}{216 \\cdot 5} - \\frac{1 \\cdot 54}{20 \\cdot 54} = \\frac{55}{1080} - \\frac{54}{1080} = \\frac{1}{1080}.$$\nThe exact value of the quadrature error for $f(x,y)=x^3$ is $\\frac{1}{1080}$.",
