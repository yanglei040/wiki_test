This formulation results in strains (and stresses) that are constant throughout the element. In contrast, a Linear Strain Triangle (LST) is a 6-node triangular element (with midside nodes) characterized by a quadratic displacement field, which results in strains (and stresses) that vary linearly over the element.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e$ is derived from the principle of virtual work. For a single element, the internal virtual work $\\delta W_{int}$ is given by:\n$$ \\delta W_{int} = \\int_{V_e} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\, dV $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the stress vector, $\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is the virtual strain vector, and the integration is over the element volume $V_e$.\n\nThe kinematic relationship for a CST element links the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$ to the nodal displacements $\\mathbf{d}_e$ via linear shape functions $N_i(x,y)$.\n$$ \\mathbf{u}(x,y) = \\begin{Bmatrix} u(x,y) \\\\ v(x,y) \\end{Bmatrix} = \\mathbf{N}(x,y) \\mathbf{d}_e $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{d}_e = \\{u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, u_3, v_3\\}^T$ is the vector of nodal displacements, and the shape function matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{N}(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} N_1 & 0 & N_2 & 0 & N_3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & N_1 & 0 & N_2 & 0 & N_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe shape functions are $N_i(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2A}(a_i + b_i x + c_i y)$, where $A$ is the element area and the coefficients are $a_i = x_j y_k - x_k y_j$, $b_i = y_j - y_k$, and $c_i = x_k - x_j$ for cyclic indices $(i,j,k)$.\n\nThe strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\{\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\gamma_{xy}\\}^T$ is related to the displacement field by $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{u}$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ is the differential operator. Substituting the interpolated displacement, we get:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}_e $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{N}$ is the strain-displacement matrix. For a CST, $\\mathbf{B}$ is constant:\n$$ \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{2A} \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 & 0 & b_2 & 0 & b_3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_1 & 0 & c_2 & 0 & c_3 \\\\ c_1 & b_1 & c_2 & b_2 & c_3 & b_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nThe constitutive law relates stress and strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{D} \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}_e$. Substituting these into the virtual work expression:\n$$ \\delta W_{int} = \\int_{V_e} (\\delta(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}_e))^T (\\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}_e) \\, dV = \\delta \\mathbf{d}_e^T \\left( \\int_{V_e} \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\, dV \\right) \\mathbf{d}_e $$\nFrom the definition $\\delta W_{int} = \\delta \\mathbf{d}_e^T \\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e$, the element stiffness matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_{V_e} \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\, dV $$\nFor a CST with uniform thickness $t$, $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$ are constant, so the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = (\\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot (A \\cdot t) $$\n\nNow, we compute $\\mathbf{K}_e$ for the given element with nodes $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(0,1)$.\nThe area of the triangle is $A = \\frac{1}{2} |\\det \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}| = \\frac{1}{2} |\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}| = \\frac{1}{2} |1(2 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0)| = 1$.\nThe coefficients $b_i$ and $c_i$ are:\n$b_1 = y_2 - y_3 = 0 - 1 = -1$\n$b_2 = y_3 - y_1 = 1 - 0 = 1$\n$b_3 = y_1 - y_2 = 0 - 0 = 0$\n$c_1 = x_3 - x_2 = 0 - 2 = -2$\n$c_2 = x_1 - x_3 = 0 - 0 = 0$\n$c_3 = x_2 - x_1 = 2 - 0 = 2$\n\nWith $2A = 2$, the $\\mathbf{B}$ matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe constitutive matrix is $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\nu & 0 \\\\ \\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nWe now compute $\\mathbf{K}_e = t A \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} = t \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = t \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & -2 \\\\ 0 & -2 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\nu & 0 \\\\ \\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\frac{Et}{4(1-\\nu^2)} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & -2 \\\\ 0 & -2 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\nu & 0 \\\\ \\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix multiplications yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\frac{Et}{4(1-\\nu^2)} \\begin{bmatrix} 3-2\\nu & 1+\\nu & -1 & \\nu-1 & 2\\nu-2 & -2\\nu \\\\ 1+\\nu & \\frac{9-\\nu}{2} & -2\\nu & -\\frac{1-\\nu}{2} & \\nu-1 & -4 \\\\ -1 & -2\\nu & 1 & 0 & 0 & 2\\nu \\\\ \\nu-1 & -\\frac{1-\\nu}{2} & 0 & \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} & 1-\\nu & 0 \\\\ 2\\nu-2 & \\nu-1 & 0 & 1-\\nu & 2(1-\\nu) & 0 \\\\ -2\\nu & -4 & 2\\nu & 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n**Verification of Symmetry and Positive Semidefiniteness:**\n1.  **Symmetry:** The stiffness matrix is given by $\\mathbf{K}_e = tA\\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{B}$. Its transpose is $\\mathbf{K}_e^T = tA(\\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{B})^T = tA\\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{D}^T(\\mathbf{B}^T)^T = tA\\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{K}_e$, because the constitutive matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ for a linear elastic material is symmetric ($\\mathbf{D}^T = \\mathbf{D}$). The explicitly computed matrix can also be seen to be symmetric by inspection.\n2.  **Positive Semidefiniteness:** The strain energy stored in the element is $U_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{d}_e^T \\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e$. Since strain energy must be non-negative for any physically admissible displacement $\\mathbf{d}_e$, the quadratic form $\\mathbf{d}_e^T \\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e$ must be greater than or equal to zero. This is the definition of a positive semidefinite matrix. The energy is zero only if the strains are zero, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{d}_e = 0$. This occurs for rigid body motions (translation and rotation), for which the element does not deform. An unconstrained element stiffness matrix must admit these zero-energy modes, which correspond to a non-trivial null space. Therefore, $\\mathbf{K}_e$ must be singular and positive semidefinite, not positive definite.\n\n**Determinant of $\\mathbf{K}_e$:**\nA singular matrix has a determinant of zero. We can verify that $\\mathbf{K}_e$ is singular by identifying its null space vectors, which correspond to rigid body motions.\nFor a rigid body translation in the $x$-direction, $\\mathbf{d}_e = \\{1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0\\}^T$. The product $\\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e$ is the sum of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th columns of $\\mathbf{K}_e$. Summing the elements of the first row gives:\n$\\frac{Et}{4(1-\\nu^2)}[(3-2\\nu) + (-1) + (2\\nu-2)] = \\frac{Et}{4(1-\\nu^2)}[0] = 0$.\nThis holds for all rows. Thus, $\\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e = \\mathbf{0}$ for this $\\mathbf{d}_e$, confirming a non-trivial null space.\nSimilarly, for a rigid translation in the $y$-direction, $\\mathbf{d}_e = \\{0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1\\}^T$, the sum of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns is the zero vector.\nSince $\\mathbf{K}_e$ has a non-trivial null space, it is singular. The determinant of any singular matrix is zero.\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{K}_e) = 0 $$\nThe value $0$ is a dimensionless scalar, satisfying the problem's requirement.",

The CST uses the linear shape functions $N_1=L_1$, $N_2=L_2$, $N_3=L_3$. The LST uses the quadratic shape functions $N_1=L_1(2L_1-1)$, $N_2=L_2(2L_2-1)$, $N_3=L_3(2L_3-1)$, $N_4=4L_1L_2$, $N_5=4L_2L_3$, $N_6=4L_3L_1$.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed numerical analysis problem grounded in the principles of computational solid mechanics and the finite element method. All required data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientific inaccuracies.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing a computational analysis to quantify the strain approximation error for both Constant Strain Triangle (CST) and Linear Strain Triangle (LST) elements when subjected to an exact quadratic displacement field. The error is measured by the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) norm of the strain tensor components, evaluated over a prescribed set of sampling points within the element.\n\nFirst, we define the exact displacement and strain fields. The problem provides a general quadratic displacement field in two dimensions $(x, y)$:\n$$u(x,y) = a\\,x^2 + b\\,x\\,y + c\\,y^2 + d\\,x + e\\,y + f$$\n$$v(x,y) = p\\,x^2 + q\\,x\\,y + r\\,y^2 + s\\,x + t\\,y + w$$\nwhere $u$ and $v$ are the displacement components along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. The coefficients $a,b,c,d,e,f,p,q,r,s,t,w$ are given for each test case.\n\nThe exact infinitesimal strain tensor components, $(\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\text{exact}}, \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\text{exact}}, \\varepsilon_{xy}^{\\text{exact}})$, are derived by differentiating the displacement field according to the small-strain definitions:\n$$\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2ax + by + d$$\n$$\\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = qx + 2ry + t$$\n$$\\varepsilon_{xy}^{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (bx + 2cy + e) + (2px + qy + s) \\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{2} + p\\right)x + \\left(c + \\frac{q}{2}\\right)y + \\frac{e+s}{2}$$\nNote that for a quadratic displacement field, the resulting strain field is linear in position $(x, y)$.\n\nNext, we formulate the finite element approximations. A key component of this formulation is the use of barycentric coordinates $(L_1, L_2, L_3)$ for a triangle with vertices at $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$. Any point $(x,y)$ inside the triangle can be expressed as a convex combination of the vertices: $x = L_1x_1 + L_2x_2 + L_3x_3$ and $y = L_1y_1 + L_2y_2 + L_3y_3$, where $L_1+L_2+L_3=1$. The approximated displacement field, $u^h(x,y)$, is constructed by interpolating the nodal displacements $u_i$ using shape functions $N_i$: $u^h = \\sum_i N_i u_i$. To compute strains, we require the spatial gradients of the shape functions. Since the shape functions are defined in terms of barycentric coordinates, we use the chain rule: $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial L_j} \\frac{\\partial L_j}{\\partial x}$. The gradients of the barycentric coordinates are constant throughout the element and are given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_3}{2A}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial L_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{x_3 - x_2}{2A} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{y_3 - y_1}{2A}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial L_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{x_1 - x_3}{2A} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_3}{\\partial x} = \\frac{y_1 - y_2}{2A}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial L_3}{\\partial y} = \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{2A} $$\nwhere $A$ is the area of the triangle, calculated as $2A = x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)$.\n\nFor the Constant Strain Triangle (CST), we have $3$ nodes at the vertices. The shape functions are linear: $N_1=L_1, N_2=L_2, N_3=L_3$. Consequently, the displacement approximation $u^h$ is linear, and its derivatives, the strains $\\varepsilon^h$, are constant. The nodal displacements $(u_i,v_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$ are obtained by evaluating the exact quadratic displacement field at the vertex coordinates. The constant approximate strain components are then:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx}^h = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} u_i = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial x} u_i $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy}^h = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} v_i = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial y} v_i $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xy}^h = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} u_i + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} v_i \\right) $$\nSince the exact strain field is linear and the CST approximation is constant, an error is expected.\n\nFor the Linear Strain Triangle (LST), we have $6$ nodes: $3$ at the vertices and $3$ at the midpoints of the sides. The shape functions $N_i$ are quadratic polynomials of the barycentric coordinates. The crucial insight for the LST element is its ability to exactly represent any quadratic polynomial. The space of quadratic polynomials in two variables, $P_2(x,y)$, has $6$ degrees of freedom (corresponding to coefficients of $1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2$). An LST element has $6$ nodes. A quadratic polynomial is uniquely determined by its values at $6$ non-degenerate points. Since the exact displacement field $(u, v)$ is quadratic, and the LST nodal displacements $(u_i, v_i)$ are evaluated from this exact field, the LST interpolation $u^h = \\sum_{i=1}^6 N_i u_i$ will be identical to the exact field $u(x,y)$ everywhere within the element. This is a fundamental property of finite element completeness. Consequently, the strains derived from the LST approximation, $\\varepsilon^h$, will be identical to the exact strains, $\\varepsilon^{\\text{exact}}$. Therefore, the strain error for the LST element is identically zero, and the resulting RMS error is $0.0$.\n\nThe residual error is quantified by the RMS norm. For each of the $N_{sp}=7$ sampling points, we compute the strain error vector $\\mathbf{e} = (\\varepsilon_{xx}^{h}-\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\text{exact}},\\varepsilon_{yy}^{h}-\\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\text{exact}},\\varepsilon_{xy}^{h}-\\varepsilon_{xy}^{\\text{exact}})$.

The condition number can be calculated from these quantities.\n\n**For Point A:** $J_A \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.16333 & -0.00833 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\|J_A\\|_F^2 = 5^2 + 0.1^2 + (\\frac{0.49}{3})^2 + (-\\frac{0.025}{3})^2 \\approx 25.036816$\n$\\det(J_A) = 5(-\\frac{0.025}{3}) - 0.1(\\frac{0.49}{3}) = \\frac{-0.125-0.049}{3} = -\\frac{0.174}{3} = -0.058$\nUsing these values, the singular values are $\\sigma_{\\max}(J_A) \\approx 5.00733$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}(J_A) \\approx 0.01160$.\n$\\kappa_2(J_A) = \\frac{5.00733}{0.01160} \\approx 431.6669$\n\n**For Point B:** $J_B \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.02333 & 0.05167 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\|J_B\\|_F^2 = 5^2 + 0.1^2 + (\\frac{0.07}{3})^2 + (\\frac{0.155}{3})^2 \\approx 25.013214$\n$\\det(J_B) = 5(\\frac{0.155}{3}) - 0.1(\\frac{0.07}{3}) = \\frac{0.775-0.007}{3} = \\frac{0.768}{3} = 0.256$\nThe singular values are $\\sigma_{\\max}(J_B) \\approx 5.002118$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}(J_B) \\approx 0.05120$.\n$\\kappa_2(J_B) = \\frac{5.002118}{0.05120} \\approx 97.6976$\n\n**For Point C:** $J_C \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.22333 & 0.04167 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\|J_C\\|_F^2 = 5^2 + 0.1^2 + (\\frac{0.67}{3})^2 + (\\frac{0.125}{3})^2 \\approx 25.061613$\n$\\det(J_C) = 5(\\frac{0.125}{3}) - 0.1(\\frac{0.67}{3}) = \\frac{0.625-0.067}{3} = \\frac{0.558}{3} = 0.186$\nThe singular values are $\\sigma_{\\max}(J_C) \\approx 5.012044$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}(J_C) \\approx 0.03720$.\n$\\kappa_2(J_C) = \\frac{5.012044}{0.03720} \\approx 134.7324$\n\nComparing the three condition numbers:\n$\\kappa_2(J_A) \\approx 431.6669$\n$\\kappa_2(J_B) \\approx 97.6976$\n$\\kappa_2(J_C) \\approx 134.7324$\n\nThe maximum condition number among the three points is $\\kappa_2(J_A)$.\nMaximum value $\\approx 431.6669$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $431.7$.",
