            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics, and objective. It presents a standard derivation in linear elasticity.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental constitutive law for a linear, isotropic elastic material, which relates the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ via the Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace operator and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nThe problem provides the kinematic decompositions of the stress and strain tensors into their respective deviatoric (denoted with a prime) and spherical (volumetric) parts:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\mathbf{I}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nBy definition, the deviatoric tensors are traceless, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}') = 0$ and $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = 0$.\n\nOur objective is to derive an expression for the deviatoric strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ in terms of the deviatoric stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$. To do this, we substitute the decomposition of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ into the constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} \\right)\n$$\nWe can distribute the term $2\\mu$ and group the terms proportional to the identity tensor $\\mathbf{I}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\left( \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu \\right) \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'\n$$\nThe problem defines the bulk modulus $K$ as $K = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$. Substituting this definition into the equation yields a decoupled form of the constitutive law:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'\n$$\nThis equation shows that the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the sum of a spherical part, $K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}$, and a deviatoric part, $2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$. Note that $2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ is indeed deviatoric since $\\operatorname{tr}(2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = 2\\mu \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = 0$.\n\nNow, we compare this with the given decomposition of the stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, we can identify the corresponding spherical and deviatoric parts.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the traces. Taking the trace of our derived constitutive equation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\operatorname{tr}(K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}')\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the trace operator and the facts that $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) = 3$ (in three dimensions) and $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = 0$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) + 2\\mu \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\cdot 3 + 2\\mu \\cdot 0\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 3K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\n$$\nThis gives the relation for the spherical (volumetric) response: $\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$. The mean stress is proportional to the volumetric strain, with the bulk modulus $K$ as the constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ into the left side of the equation:\n$$\nK \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'\n$$\nSubtracting the term $K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}$ from both sides yields the relationship between the deviatoric parts:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'\n$$\nThis equation directly relates the deviatoric stress to the deviatoric strain. The constant of proportionality is $2\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the shear modulus.\n\nTo find the desired expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$, we simply rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression.\n\nRegarding the dependence on the bulk modulus $K$: The derivation shows that the relationship between the deviatoric stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ and deviatoric strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ depends only on the shear modulus $\\mu$. The bulk modulus $K$ (and the Lamé parameter $\\lambda$) does not appear in the final expression $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$.\n\nThe argument from first principles arises from the physical meaning of the decomposition. For an isotropic material, the response can be split into two independent parts:\n$1$. A volumetric response, which relates the mean stress (pressure) to the change in volume (volumetric strain). This response is governed by the bulk modulus $K$ through the relation $\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n$2$. A deviatoric or shear response, which relates the part of the stress causing shape distortion (deviatoric stress) to the resulting shape distortion at constant volume (deviatoric strain). This response is governed by the shear modulus $\\mu$ through the relation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$.\nThe mathematical derivation confirms this physical principle of decoupling. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ exclusively describe the distortional (shear) aspect of deformation and stress, it is logical from first principles that their relationship is governed solely by the material's resistance to shear, $\\mu$, and is independent of its resistance to volume change, $K$.",

The normal components can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_x \\\\ \\varepsilon_y \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\frac{1}{E} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\nu \\\\ -\\nu  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_x \\\\ \\sigma_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nInverting the $2 \\times 2$ matrix gives:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_x \\\\ \\sigma_y \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\nu \\\\ \\nu  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_x \\\\ \\varepsilon_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe shear relation is a direct inversion: $\\tau_{xy} = \\mu \\gamma_{xy}$.\nCombining these results, the plane stress constitutive matrix, $[C]_{\\text{plane stress}}$, is:\n$$\n[C]_{\\text{plane stress}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}  \\frac{E\\nu}{1-\\nu^2}  0 \\\\\n\\frac{E\\nu}{1-\\nu^2}  \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\mu\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  \\nu  0 \\\\\n\\nu  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{2(1+\\nu)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSimplifying the shear entry: $\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{(1-\\nu)(1+\\nu)}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{1-\\nu}{2}$. Thus, the matrix is:\n$$\n[C]_{\\text{plane stress}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  \\nu  0 \\\\\n\\nu  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\frac{1-\\nu}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe shear entry is $C_{33} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\cdot \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{2(1-\\nu)(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\mu$.\n\n**3. Explanation for the Equivalence of the Shear Entry $C_{33}$**\nThe derivations for both plane strain and plane stress conditions yield the same result for the shear entry: $C_{33} = \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$. This is not a coincidence but a direct consequence of material isotropy.\n\nBased on first principles, the 3D isotropic constitutive law $\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2 \\mu \\varepsilon_{ij}$ demonstrates a fundamental decoupling. For shear components where $i \\neq j$, the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ is zero, meaning the first term involving the volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_{kk}$ vanishes. The law for shear components reduces to $\\sigma_{ij} = 2 \\mu \\varepsilon_{ij}$.\n\nThis shows that for an isotropic material, a shear stress in a given plane (e.g., $\\sigma_{xy}$) depends only on the corresponding shear strain in that same plane (e.g., $\\varepsilon_{xy}$) and is not affected by any of the normal strain components ($\\varepsilon_x, \\varepsilon_y, \\varepsilon_z$).\n\nThe plane strain condition imposes a constraint on a normal strain component ($\\varepsilon_z=0$), while the plane stress condition imposes a constraint on a normal stress component ($\\sigma_z=0$). Since the relationship between the in-plane shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$ and the in-plane shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ is independent of both normal stresses and normal strains, the specific constraints defining plane strain versus plane stress have no influence on the in-plane shear stiffness. Therefore, the shear entry $C_{33}$ in the 2D constitutive matrix remains unchanged and is equal to the shear modulus $\\mu$ in both cases.\n\nThe single closed-form expression for this entry is $\\mu$ expressed in terms of $E$ and $\\nu$.",
