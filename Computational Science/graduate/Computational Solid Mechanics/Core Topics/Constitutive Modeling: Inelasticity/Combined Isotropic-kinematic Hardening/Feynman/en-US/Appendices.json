The given data is:\nThe trial Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{trial}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n160 & 30 & 0\\\\\n30 & 120 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 80\n\\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe backstress tensor at the beginning of the increment:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 5 & 0\\\\\n5 & -5 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -5\n\\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe material parameters and state variables:\nInitial yield stress, $\\sigma_{y0}=65$ MPa.\nIsotropic hardening modulus, $H_{\\mathrm{iso}}=120$ MPa.\nAccumulated equivalent plastic strain, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p}=0.05$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the trial deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$.

Note that the backstress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is inherently deviatoric; its trace is $10 - 5 - 5 = 0$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n40 & 30 & 0\\\\\n30 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -40\n\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 5 & 0\\\\\n5 & -5 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -5\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n30 & 25 & 0\\\\\n25 & 5 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -35\n\\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThird, we calculate the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. This involves the double dot product $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} : \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is symmetric, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} : \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\sum_{i,j} \\xi_{ij}^2$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi} : \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = (30)^2 + (25)^2 + (0)^2 + (25)^2 + (5)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (-35)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi} : \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = 900 + 625 + 625 + 25 + 1225 = 3400 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}^2\n$$\nNow, the equivalent stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} : \\boldsymbol{\\xi})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}(3400)} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 1700} = \\sqrt{5100} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx 71.41428$ MPa.\n\nFourth, we determine the current yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, which defines the size of the yield surface. With linear isotropic hardening, the increase in yield stress, $R$, is:\n$$\nR = H_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p} = 120 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} \\times 0.05 = 6 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe current yield stress is the sum of the initial yield stress and this hardening contribution:\n$$\n\\sigma_y = \\sigma_{y0} + R = 65 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} + 6 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} = 71 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the value of the yield function, $f$, at the trial state.\n$$\nf = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\sigma_y = \\sqrt{5100} - 71 \\approx 71.41428 - 71 = 0.41428 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf \\approx 0.4143 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nSince $f > 0$, the trial stress state lies outside the yield surface. This signifies that the correct response for the increment involves plastic deformation. The purely elastic assumption is invalid, and a return-mapping algorithm must be applied to bring the stress state back to the updated yield surface. The problem, however, only asks for the evaluation of $f$ and a decision on the state. The decision is that the state is plastic.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the angle between the plastic strain increment direction and the hydrostatic axis for a material governed by associative von Mises plasticity. The solution requires a rigorous application of continuum mechanics principles.\n\nFirst, we must validate the provided deviatoric stress tensor, $s$. A tensor is deviatoric if and only if its trace is zero. Let us compute the trace of the given tensor $s$:\n$$\ntr(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} s_{ii} = 60 + (-20) + (-40) = 60 - 60 = 0\n$$\nThe trace is indeed $0$, so the provided tensor $s$ is a valid deviatoric stress tensor.\n\nThe problem states that the material obeys an associative flow rule. This means the plastic strain rate tensor, which we can denote as $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_p$, is normal to the yield surface in stress space. The direction of the plastic strain increment, and thus of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_p$, is given by the gradient of the yield function, $f(\\sigma)$, with respect to the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}\n$$\nHere, $\\dot{\\lambda}$ is the plastic multiplier, a non-negative scalar. The problem specifies von Mises (or $J_2$) plasticity. The von Mises yield criterion is a function only of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} s:s$. A standard form of the yield function is $f(\\sigma) = \\sqrt{3J_2} - \\sigma_Y$, where $\\sigma_Y$ is the material's yield strength. The backstress is given as zero, which means the yield surface is centered at the origin of the deviatoric stress space.\n\nThe direction of plastic flow is proportional to $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}$. Using the chain rule, we find this gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial J_2} \\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\sigma}\n$$\nThe derivative of $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2}s_{ij}s_{ij}$ with respect to $\\sigma$ is known to be the deviatoric stress tensor $s$ itself. To demonstrate this:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial (s_{ij}s_{ij})}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = s_{ij} \\frac{\\partial s_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}}\n$$\nUsing $s_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\sigma_{mm}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial s_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = (\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}) - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = s_{ij} \\left( \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} \\right) = s_{kl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{kl} s_{jj} = s_{kl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{kl} tr(s)\n$$\nSince $tr(s)=0$, we confirm the fundamental relation $\\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\sigma} = s$. Consequently, the gradient of the yield function is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{s:s}} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\|s\\|} s\n$$\nThis shows that the direction of plastic flow is parallel to the deviatoric stress tensor $s$. The first task is to compute the unit plastic strain increment direction tensor, $\\hat{n}_p$. This is found by normalizing the direction vector, which is $s$:\n$$\n\\hat{n}_p = \\frac{s}{\\|s\\|}\n$$\nTo compute this explicitly, we need the Frobenius norm of $s$:\n$$\n\\|s\\|^2 = s:s = \\sum_{i,j} s_{ij}^2 = (60)^2 + (12)^2 + (-9)^2 + (12)^2 + (-20)^2 + (8)^2 + (-9)^2 + (8)^2 + (-40)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\|s\\|^2 = 3600 + 144 + 81 + 144 + 400 + 64 + 81 + 64 + 1600 = 6178\n$$\nThus, $\\|s\\| = \\sqrt{6178}$. The unit direction tensor $\\hat{n}_p$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{n}_p = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6178}} \\begin{pmatrix} 60 & 12 & -9 \\\\ 12 & -20 & 8 \\\\ -9 & 8 & -40 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second task is to compute the angle $\\theta$ between $\\hat{n}_p$ and the hydrostatic axis, represented by the identity tensor $I$. The angle is defined by:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hat{n}_{p}:I}{\\|\\hat{n}_{p}\\| \\|I\\|}\n$$\nWe evaluate the terms in this expression.\nThe norm of the unit tensor $\\hat{n}_p$ is, by definition, $\\|\\hat{n}_p\\| = 1$.\nThe norm of the identity tensor $I$ in three dimensions is:\n$$\n\\|I\\| = \\sqrt{I:I} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe inner product in the numerator is the trace of $\\hat{n}_p$:\n$$\n\\hat{n}_p : I = \\sum_{i,j} (\\hat{n}_p)_{ij} I_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\hat{n}_p)_{ii} = tr(\\hat{n}_p)\n$$\nSince $\\hat{n}_p$ is proportional to $s$, its trace is $tr(\\hat{n}_p) = \\frac{1}{\\|s\\|}tr(s)$. As we established at the beginning, $tr(s) = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{n}_p : I = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the formula for the cosine of the angle:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{0}{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}} = 0\n$$\nThis result signifies that the plastic strain increment direction tensor $\\hat{n}_p$ is orthogonal to the hydrostatic axis direction tensor $I$. This is a general feature of $J_2$ plasticity, which implies that plastic deformation is isochoric, i.e., it preserves volume, since $tr(\\dot{\\varepsilon}_p) = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_p : I = 0$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ that satisfies $\\cos\\theta = 0$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\arccos(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n$$\nThe specific numerical components of the tensor $s$ were only necessary to confirm that it is a non-zero deviatoric tensor, but the final result for the angle is a direct and general consequence of the theory.",

To find the amplitude $ A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha_{\\max} - \\alpha_{\\min}) $, we subtract equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\max} - \\alpha_{\\min} = \\left[ \\frac{c}{\\gamma} - \\left(-\\frac{c}{\\gamma}\\right) \\right] + \\left[ \\left( \\alpha_{\\min} - \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\right) - \\left( \\alpha_{\\max} + \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\right) \\right] \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) $$\n$$ (\\alpha_{\\max} - \\alpha_{\\min}) = \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} + \\left( (\\alpha_{\\min} - \\alpha_{\\max}) - \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} \\right) \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) $$\nSubstituting $ 2A_{\\alpha} = \\alpha_{\\max} - \\alpha_{\\min} $:\n$$ 2A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} + \\left( -2A_{\\alpha} - \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} \\right) \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) $$\n$$ 2A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} - 2A_{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) - \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) $$\nGroup terms containing $ A_{\\alpha} $:\n$$ 2A_{\\alpha} \\left( 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) \\right) = \\frac{2c}{\\gamma} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p) \\right) $$\nSolving for $ A_{\\alpha} $:\n$$ A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p)}{1 + \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p)} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by recognizing the definition of the hyperbolic tangent function, $ \\tanh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2x)}{1 + \\exp(-2x)} $.\n$$ A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta p}{2}\\right) $$\n\n### Derivation of Isotropic Hardening Amplitude $ A_{R} $\nThe evolution of the isotropic hardening variable $ R $ is governed by:\n$$ dR = b(Q - R)dp $$\nSince $ b > 0 $ and we assume the process starts from an initial state with $ R_0 \\le Q $, the term $ (Q - R) $ is non-negative. The accumulated plastic strain increment $ dp $ is always non-negative by definition. Therefore, $ dR \\ge 0 $ always. This means $ R $ is a monotonically non-decreasing function of time (or total accumulated plastic strain $ p $).\nIn a time-periodic (stabilized) regime with period $ T $, any state variable $ X(t) $ must satisfy $ X(t+T) = X(t) $. For the isotropic hardening variable, this means $ R(t_0+T) = R(t_0) $ for any starting time $ t_0 $.\nThe total change in $ R $ over one cycle is zero:\n$$ \\Delta R_{\\text{cycle}} = R(t_0+T) - R(t_0) = \\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} dR = 0 $$\nHowever, we established that $ dR \\ge 0 $. The integral of a non-negative function is zero if and only if the function is zero everywhere its domain of integration is non-zero. In our case, plastic flow occurs, so $ dp > 0 $ for parts of the cycle.\n$$ \\int_{\\text{cycle}} b(Q-R)dp = 0 $$\nFor this integral to be zero while $ \\int_{\\text{cycle}} dp = 2 \\Delta p > 0 $, the integrand must be zero whenever $ dp > 0 $. Since $ b>0 $, this requires $ Q - R = 0 $, or $ R = Q $, during all phases of plastic deformation.\nWhen there is no plastic flow ($ dp=0 $), $ dR=0 $, so $ R $ remains constant.\nThus, in the stabilized periodic state, the isotropic hardening variable must be constant and equal to its saturation value $ Q $.\n$$ R(t) = Q \\quad \\text{for all } t \\text{ in the stabilized regime} $$\nThis implies that $ R_{\\max} = R_{\\min} = Q $. The stabilized half-range amplitude is therefore:\n$$ A_{R} = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{\\max} - R_{\\min}) = \\frac{1}{2}(Q - Q) = 0 $$\n\n### Justification of Independence from Mean Strain $ \\varepsilon_{m} $\nThe derived expressions for the amplitudes are $ A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta p}{2}\\right) $ and $ A_{R} = 0 $.\nNeither expression contains the mean strain $ \\varepsilon_m $. This independence is a direct consequence of the structure of the hardening laws. The evolution equations for both $ \\alpha $ and $ R $ are rate-form equations that depend only on the plastic strain increments ($ d\\varepsilon_p $, $ dp $) and the current values of the state variables ($ \\alpha $, $ R $), not on the total strain $ \\varepsilon $ or stress $ \\sigma $.\nThe amplitudes $ A_{\\alpha} $ and $ A_{R} $ characterize the size of the hysteresis loop in the $ \\sigma-\\varepsilon $ plane, while the mean strain $ \\varepsilon_m $ (and the corresponding mean stress $ \\sigma_m $) determines its position. The calculation of the amplitudes relies on integrating the rate equations over the two half-cycles of plastic straining and imposing periodicity. As the problem specifies a symmetric cyclic plastic strain increment $ \\Delta p $ for both half-cycles, the resulting amplitudes depend only on this increment and the material parameters governing the hardening evolution ($ c $, $ \\gamma $ for $ A_{\\alpha} $; $ b $, $ Q $ for $ A_{R} $). The mean strain $ \\varepsilon_m $ only influences the mean value around which the state variables oscillate, not the amplitude of their oscillation.\n\n### Numerical Validation Calculation\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of $ A_{\\alpha} $ using the provided parameters:\n$ c = 3.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{MPa} $, $ \\gamma = 50 $, $ \\Delta p = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3} $.\nThe formula is:\n$$ A_{\\alpha} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta p}{2}\\right) $$\nFirst, we compute the ratio $ \\frac{c}{\\gamma} $:\n$$ \\frac{c}{\\gamma} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{MPa}}{50} = 600 \\ \\text{MPa} $$\nNext, we compute the argument of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta p}{2} = \\frac{50 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{2} = \\frac{0.20}{2} = 0.1 $$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $ A_{\\alpha} $:\n$$ A_{\\alpha} = 600 \\ \\text{MPa} \\times \\tanh(0.1) $$\nUsing a calculator for $ \\tanh(0.1) $:\n$$ \\tanh(0.1) \\approx 0.0996679946 $$\nFinally, we compute $ A_{\\alpha} $:\n$$ A_{\\alpha} \\approx 600 \\times 0.0996679946 \\ \\text{MPa} \\approx 59.80079676 \\ \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ A_{\\alpha} \\approx 59.80 \\ \\text{MPa} $$",
