            "problem": "Consider a small-strain, rate-independent, isotropic elasto-plastic material governed by the second invariant of the deviatoric stress (commonly called $J_2$ plasticity) with linear isotropic hardening. The elastic response is defined by the isotropic linear elasticity tensor with Lamé parameters $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $ related to the Young’s modulus $ E $ and Poisson’s ratio $ \\nu $ by $ \\mu = \\dfrac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $ and $ \\lambda = \\dfrac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2 \\nu)} $. The material behavior is expressed using the additive strain decomposition $ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p $, where $ \\varepsilon $ is the total small-strain tensor, $ \\varepsilon^e $ is the elastic strain tensor, and $ \\varepsilon^p $ is the plastic strain tensor. The Cauchy stress tensor is $ \\sigma = 2 \\mu \\, \\varepsilon^e + \\lambda \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^e) I $, where $ I $ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nPlastic yielding is determined by the von Mises yield function $ f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma) - \\sigma_y(\\alpha) $, where $ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{2}} \\, \\| s \\| $, $ s = \\sigma - \\dfrac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma) I $ is the deviatoric stress, $ \\| s \\| $ is the Frobenius norm of $ s $, and $ \\sigma_y(\\alpha) = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha $ is the current yield stress expressed through the accumulated equivalent plastic strain $ \\alpha $ with initial yield stress $ \\sigma_{y0} $ and hardening modulus $ H $. The plastic flow is associative, with the plastic strain rate $ \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p $ aligned with the gradient of the yield function with respect to stress, and the accumulated equivalent plastic strain rate $ \\dot{\\alpha} $ defined by $ \\dot{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\, \\| \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p \\| $. The evolution must satisfy the classical Kuhn–Tucker conditions for rate-independent plasticity: $ f \\le 0 $, $ \\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0 $, $ \\dot{\\lambda} f = 0 $, and the consistency condition when yielding occurs. Here $ \\dot{\\lambda} $ is the plastic multiplier.\n\nYour task is to derive, from these fundamental principles, a backward-Euler return-mapping update for a single constant strain increment in three dimensions, and implement it to advance the state through prescribed loading paths. The update must ensure plastic incompressibility $ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = 0 $ whenever plastic flow occurs, and must satisfy the mechanical dissipation inequality $ \\Delta D = \\sigma : \\Delta \\varepsilon^p \\ge 0 $ for each increment. You must also implement checks to verify the yield consistency in the final state of each path.\n\nMaterial parameters are given as $ E = 210000 $ (in megapascals, MPa), $ \\nu = 0.3 $ (dimensionless), $ \\sigma_{y0} = 250 $ (in MPa), and $ H = 1000 $ (in MPa). Strains are dimensionless. The stress must be computed in megapascals (MPa). Angles, if any are needed for internal checks, must be handled in radians.\n\nImplement the algorithm and simulate the following three benchmark loading paths, each specified as a sequence of constant strain increments applied to the strain tensor $ \\varepsilon $:\n\n- Uniaxial tension path: apply $ 20 $ increments, each $ \\Delta \\varepsilon = \\mathrm{diag}(10^{-4}, 0, 0) $.\n- Pure shear path: apply $ 20 $ increments, each $ \\Delta \\varepsilon $ having components $ \\Delta \\varepsilon_{12} = \\Delta \\varepsilon_{21} = 10^{-4} $ and all other components zero.\n- Nonproportional biaxial path: first apply $ 15 $ increments of $ \\Delta \\varepsilon = \\mathrm{diag}(10^{-4}, 0, 0) $, then apply $ 5 $ increments of $ \\Delta \\varepsilon = \\mathrm{diag}(0, 10^{-4}, 0) $.\n\nFor each path, after completing all increments, compute and report three boolean checks:\n\n1. Plastic incompressibility check: $ |\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^p_{\\mathrm{final}})| \\le 10^{-10} $.\n2. Nonnegative dissipation check: the total accumulated plastic dissipation $ \\sum \\sigma_{n+1} : \\Delta \\varepsilon^p \\ge -10^{-12} $.\n3. Yield consistency check at the final state: if the final accumulated equivalent plastic strain $ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}  10^{-12} $, then $ | f(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{final}}, \\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}) | \\le 10^{-10} $; otherwise (purely elastic final state), $ f(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{final}}, \\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}) \\le 10^{-10} $.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the nine boolean results for the three paths in the order described above, aggregated as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $ [\\mathrm{result}_1, \\mathrm{result}_2, \\mathrm{result}_3, \\ldots, \\mathrm{result}_9] $. No other output should be produced. All computations of stress must be performed in megapascals (MPa). The booleans are dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a numerical algorithm to model the behavior of a small-strain, rate-independent, isotropic elasto-plastic material. The model is based on the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2$, and incorporates linear isotropic hardening. The algorithm will be used to simulate material response under specified loading paths. The core of the solution lies in the implementation of a backward-Euler return-mapping scheme to integrate the constitutive equations over a discrete strain increment.\n\nThe state of the material at a discrete time step $n$ is defined by the total strain tensor $\\varepsilon_n$, the plastic strain tensor $\\varepsilon^p_n$, and the scalar accumulated equivalent plastic strain $\\alpha_n$. Given this state and a prescribed total strain increment $\\Delta\\varepsilon$, the task is to compute the state at step $n+1$. The total strain at the end of the increment is given by $\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon$. The algorithm consists of an elastic predictor step followed by a plastic corrector step if yielding is detected.\n\nThe first step is the elastic predictor. We assume the entire strain increment is purely elastic, which implies that the plastic state variables do not change: $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p = 0$ and $\\Delta\\alpha=0$. The elastic strain at the end of the step, termed the trial elastic strain $\\varepsilon^{e, \\text{trial}}_{n+1}$, is computed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{e, \\text{trial}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n = (\\varepsilon_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon) - \\varepsilon^p_n = \\varepsilon^e_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon $$\nThe trial stress, $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}$, is then calculated using the isotropic linear elastic constitutive law:\n$$ \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} = 2\\mu \\varepsilon^{e, \\text{trial}}_{n+1} + \\lambda \\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^{e, \\text{trial}}_{n+1}) I $$\nwhere $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ and $\\lambda = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2 \\nu)}$ are the Lamé parameters, and $I$ is the second-order identity tensor. The trial value for the accumulated plastic strain remains unchanged from the previous step, $\\alpha^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} = \\alpha_n$.\n\nThe second step is the yield condition check. We evaluate the von Mises yield function $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma) - \\sigma_y(\\alpha)$ at the trial state:\n$$ f^{\\text{trial}} = f(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}, \\alpha_n) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) - \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) $$\nHere, the equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\| s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} \\|$, where $s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) I$ is the deviatoric part of the trial stress. The yield stress is given by the linear hardening law $\\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n$. If $f^{\\text{trial}} \\le 0$, the elastic assumption is valid. The trial state becomes the final state for the increment: $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}$, $\\varepsilon^p_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^p_n$, and $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n$.\n\nIf $f^{\\text{trial}}  0$, the material has yielded, and a plastic correction is necessary. This is the return-mapping stage. The plastic flow is governed by the associative flow rule, which, when discretized using the backward-Euler scheme, gives the plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon^p_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n$ as:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^p = \\Delta\\gamma \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\sigma}\\bigg|_{\\sigma_{n+1}} = \\Delta\\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{s_{n+1}}{\\|s_{n+1}\\|} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\gamma \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier increment. The evolution of the accumulated plastic strain is given by $\\Delta\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\| \\Delta\\varepsilon^p \\|$. A crucial consequence of the flow rule for $J_2$ plasticity is that $\\Delta\\alpha = \\Delta\\gamma$. This comes from the fact that the norm of the gradient $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\sigma}$ is unity. A further consequence is plastic incompressibility, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p)=0$, as the gradient is purely deviatoric.\n\nThe stress at step $n+1$ is related to the trial stress by $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - 2\\mu\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$. Since $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p)=0$, the hydrostatic stress is unaffected by the plastic correction, i.e., $\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma_{n+1}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1})$. The correction applies only to the deviatoric part: $s_{n+1} = s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - 2\\mu\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$. Substituting the flow rule for $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$:\n$$ s_{n+1} = s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - 2\\mu \\Delta\\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{s_{n+1}}{\\|s_{n+1}\\|} $$\nThis equation reveals that $s_{n+1}$ is collinear with $s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}$. By rearranging and taking the norm of both sides, we find the relation:\n$$ \\|s_{n+1}\\| + 2\\mu \\Delta\\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\|s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}\\| $$\nMultiplying by $\\sqrt{3/2}$ and substituting the definition of equivalent stress yields:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma_{n+1}) + 3\\mu\\Delta\\gamma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) $$\nThe final state must satisfy the consistency condition, $f(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})=0$, which requires $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma_{n+1}) = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_{n+1}) = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) + H\\Delta\\alpha$. Using $\\Delta\\alpha = \\Delta\\gamma$, we get $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma_{n+1}) = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) + H\\Delta\\gamma$. Substituting this into the previous equation allows us to solve for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ (\\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) + H\\Delta\\gamma) + 3\\mu\\Delta\\gamma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}) - \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) = (3\\mu + H)\\Delta\\gamma $$\nThe left side is $f^{\\text{trial}}$. Thus, the plastic multiplier is found in closed form:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma = \\frac{f^{\\text{trial}}}{3\\mu + H} $$\nWith $\\Delta\\gamma$ determined, the state variables are updated.\n1. Update internal hardening variable: $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\gamma$.\n2. Compute plastic strain increment. Since $s_{n+1}$ and $s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}$ are collinear, we can use the direction of $s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}$:\n   $$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^p = \\Delta\\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}}{\\|s^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}\\|} $$\n3. Update total plastic strain: $\\varepsilon^p_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon^p$.\n4. Update the stress tensor: $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - 2\\mu\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for the given loading paths. After all increments for a path are completed, the final state is subjected to three checks: plastic incompressibility $|\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^p_{\\mathrm{final}})| \\le 10^{-10}$, nonnegative total dissipation $\\sum \\sigma_{n+1} : \\Delta \\varepsilon^p \\ge -10^{-12}$, and yield consistency $| f(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{final}}, \\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}) | \\le 10^{-10}$ if plastic flow occurred ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}  10^{-12}$), or $f(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{final}}, \\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}) \\le 10^{-10}$ otherwise.",

This exercise delves into a one-dimensional model with linear kinematic hardening, challenging you to contrast a fully consistent return-mapping algorithm with a simplified 'lagged' scheme . By quantifying the error introduced by the lagged update, you will gain critical insight into the importance of consistent algorithmic treatments for ensuring accuracy in plasticity computations.",

            "problem": "Consider small-strain, uniaxial, rate-independent plasticity with linear kinematic hardening. You will derive, implement, and test a two-substep strain-controlled update algorithm that uses an elastic predictor/plastic corrector return-mapping scheme. The focus is to reveal how a nonzero backstress shifts admissibility in the second substep and to quantify the correction error if the backstress is treated in a lagged fashion.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- Kinematics: The total strain is additively decomposed into elastic and plastic parts, $\\,\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,.$\n- Free energy: Postulate a quadratic Helmholtz free energy density $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}, \\alpha) = \\tfrac{1}{2} E \\left(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)^{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2H}\\,\\alpha^{2}\\,,$ where $\\,E\\,$ is Young’s modulus and $\\,H\\,$ is the linear kinematic hardening modulus. Assume small strains.\n- Constitutive force conjugacy: Stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ is work-conjugate to total strain $\\,\\varepsilon\\,$, plastic strain $\\,\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,$ is dissipative with an associated plastic multiplier $\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\ge 0\\,$, and the backstress $\\,\\alpha\\,$ is work-conjugate to its own kinematic internal variable. Use the Clausius–Duhem inequality to ensure nonnegative dissipation and adopt standard associative normality for rate-independent plasticity.\n- Yield function: Use the one-dimensional shifted von Mises-type criterion $\\,f(\\sigma,\\alpha) = \\lvert \\sigma - \\alpha \\rvert - \\sigma_{y}\\le 0\\,$, where $\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,$ is the initial yield stress. Impose the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker complementarity conditions $\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\ge 0\\,$, $\\,f\\le 0\\,$, and $\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\,f = 0\\,$, and the consistency condition $\\,\\dot{\\gamma}0 \\Rightarrow \\dot{f}=0\\,$. Adopt associative flow in one dimension so that the plastic flow direction is $\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma-\\alpha)\\,$. For linear kinematic hardening in one dimension, take $\\,\\dot{\\alpha} = H\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,.$\n\nYour tasks:\n1) From the above base, derive the one-dimensional return-mapping equations for a strain-controlled substep update from time $\\,t_{n}\\,$ to $\\,t_{n+1}\\,.$ Express the elastic predictor (trial state) and the plastic corrector with a scalar plastic multiplier increment $\\,\\Delta\\gamma\\,$. Ensure that for plastic loading $\\,\\Delta\\gamma0\\,$ the updated state satisfies $\\,f(\\sigma_{n+1},\\alpha_{n+1})=0\\,$ exactly. Do not assume any shortcut formulas; derive them from the stated principles.\n2) Define a “lagged backstress” scheme in which the backstress is held fixed at its substep-start value in the yield and consistency equations during the plastic correction, while still updating the stress via the elastic modulus. After solving for the plastic multiplier in this lagged manner, update the backstress at the end of the substep using the obtained plastic strain increment. Quantify the inconsistency of this lagged scheme by evaluating the yield residual $\\,r = \\lvert \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\alpha_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} \\rvert - \\sigma_{y}\\,$ using the updated (not frozen) backstress and compare the final stress with the consistent solution.\n3) Implement a two-substep loading within a single step. The first substep must be elastic. In the second substep, the trial state must violate admissibility due to the presence of a nonzero backstress, triggering plastic correction.\n\nPhysical and numerical details:\n- Use units of stress in megapascals (MPa) and strain as dimensionless. Express any stress-like output in MPa and any strain-like output as a pure number. When reporting a relative error, report it as a decimal (not a percentage).\n- Angle units are not applicable here.\n\nPrecisely define the two-substep update per test case as follows:\n- Known at the start: $\\,E\\,$ (MPa), $\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,$ (MPa), $\\,H\\,$ (MPa), $\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,$, $\\,\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{0}\\,$, and $\\,\\alpha_{0}\\,$.\n- Substep $\\,1\\,$: apply $\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon_{1}\\,$, compute the elastic predictor $\\,\\sigma^{\\mathrm{tr}}_{1} = \\sigma_{0} + E\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon_{1}\\,$ with $\\,\\sigma_{0} = E(\\varepsilon_{0} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{0})\\,$, check admissibility, and update the state.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a return-mapping algorithm for one-dimensional, rate-independent plasticity with linear kinematic hardening. The analysis will compare a fully consistent implicit update with a simplified \"lagged backstress\" explicit update.\n\n### 1. Constitutive Framework\n\nThe foundation of the model is a thermodynamically consistent framework. The state of the material is described by the total strain $\\,\\varepsilon\\,$ and two internal variables: the plastic strain $\\,\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,$ and a scalar kinematic hardening variable, which for linear hardening is linearly related to the backstress $\\,\\alpha\\,$.\n\n**Free Energy and State Variables:**\nThe specified Helmholtz free energy density is:\n$$ \\psi(\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}, \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\left(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2H}\\,\\alpha^{2} $$\nwhere $\\,E\\,$ is Young's modulus and $\\,H\\,$ is the kinematic hardening modulus. The term $\\,\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}} = \\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,$ is the elastic strain.\n\n**Thermodynamic Forces:**\nThe constitutive relations for the stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ and the thermodynamic forces are derived by differentiating the free energy with respect to their conjugate state variables.\nThe stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ is conjugate to the total strain $\\,\\varepsilon\\,$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = E (\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}) = E \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}} $$\nThis is Hooke's Law. The dissipation inequality, derived from the Clausius-Duhem inequality, dictates the evolution of internal variables. The dissipation rate $\\,\\mathcal{D}\\,$ must be non-negative:\n$$ \\mathcal{D} = \\sigma \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} - \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\alpha}\\dot{\\alpha} \\ge 0 $$\nThe problem defines the hardening law as $\\,\\dot{\\alpha} = H \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,$. Substituting this and $\\,\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha}{H}\\,$ into the dissipation inequality gives:\n$$ \\mathcal{D} = \\sigma \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{H}\\right) (H \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}) = (\\sigma - \\alpha) \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} \\ge 0 $$\nThe term $\\,\\xi = \\sigma - \\alpha\\,$ is the effective stress, which is the thermodynamic driving force for plastic flow.\n\n**Plastic Flow and Yield Condition:**\nFor rate-independent plasticity, flow occurs only when a yield criterion is met. The yield function is given as:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = \\lvert \\sigma - \\alpha \\rvert - \\sigma_{y} = \\lvert \\xi \\rvert - \\sigma_{y} \\le 0 $$\nwhere $\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,$ is the initial yield stress. Plastic flow is governed by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma} \\ge 0, \\quad f(\\sigma, \\alpha) \\le 0, \\quad \\dot{\\gamma} f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\,$ is the plastic multiplier rate. An associative flow rule is adopted, linking the plastic strain rate to the yield function:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\gamma} \\, \\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma - \\alpha) $$\nThe consistency condition requires that during plastic flow ($\\,\\dot{\\gamma}  0\\,$), the state must remain on the yield surface ($\\,f=0\\,$), which implies $\\,\\dot{f}=0\\,$.\n\n### 2. Discretized Update Algorithm: Return Mapping\n\nWe employ a backward Euler integration scheme for a strain-controlled time step from $\\,t_{n}\\,$ to $\\,t_{n+1}\\,$. The state at time $\\,t_n\\,$ ($\\,\\varepsilon_n, \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n, \\alpha_n\\,$) is known, and the total strain at time $\\,t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t\\,$ is prescribed.\n\n**Step 1: Elastic Predictor (Trial State)**\nFirst, we assume the entire strain increment $\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon_n\\,$ is accommodated elastically.\n- The plastic strain and backstress are frozen: $\\,\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1, \\mathrm{tr}} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n\\,$ and $\\,\\alpha_{n+1, \\mathrm{tr}} = \\alpha_n\\,$.\n- The trial stress is computed:\n  $$ \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1, \\mathrm{tr}}) = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n) = E(\\varepsilon_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n) = E(\\varepsilon_n - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n) + E\\Delta\\varepsilon = \\sigma_n + E\\Delta\\varepsilon $$\n- The trial effective stress is $\\,\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\alpha_n\\,$.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Yielding**\nWe evaluate the yield function at the trial state:\n$$ f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = f(\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}, \\alpha_{n+1, \\mathrm{tr}}) = \\lvert \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\alpha_n \\rvert - \\sigma_y = \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\rvert - \\sigma_y $$\n- If $\\,f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\le 0\\,$, the trial state is admissible. The step is elastic. The updated state is the trial state:\n  $$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}, \\quad \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n, \\quad \\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n $$\n- If $\\,f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}  0\\,$, the trial state is inadmissible. Plastic flow occurs, and a plastic corrector step is required.\n\n**Step 3: Plastic Corrector**\nThe goal is to find the plastic strain increment $\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}\\,$ such that the final state $(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})$ satisfies the yield condition $\\,f(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0$. The discrete increments of the internal variables are:\n- Plastic strain increment: $\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n = \\Delta\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{sign}(\\xi_{n+1})\\,$, where $\\,\\Delta\\gamma = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\dot{\\gamma} dt \\ge 0\\,$.\n- Backstress increment: $\\,\\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{n+1} - \\alpha_n = H \\Delta\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} = H \\Delta\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{sign}(\\xi_{n+1})\\,$.\n\nFor a radial return, the direction of flow is constant and determined by the trial effective stress: $\\,N = \\mathrm{sign}(\\xi_{n+1}) = \\mathrm{sign}(\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}})\\,$.\nThe updated state variables are expressed in terms of the trial state and the unknown plastic multiplier increment $\\,\\Delta\\gamma\\,$:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma N $$\n$$ \\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_n + H \\Delta\\gamma N $$\nThe final effective stress is:\n$$ \\xi_{n+1} = \\sigma_{n+1} - \\alpha_{n+1} = (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma N) - (\\alpha_n + H \\Delta\\gamma N) = (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\alpha_n) - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma N = \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma N $$\n\n### 3. Derivation of Consistent and Lagged Schemes\n\n**3.1. Consistent Return Mapping**\nThe final state must lie on the yield surface: $\\,\\lvert \\xi_{n+1} \\rvert = \\sigma_y\\,$. Since $\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\xi_{n+1}) = N\\,$, this means $\\,\\xi_{n+1} = \\sigma_y N\\,$. Substituting this into the effective stress update equation:\n$$ \\sigma_y N = \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}} N $$\nMultiplying by $\\,N\\,$ (since $\\,N^2 = 1\\,$) and noting that $\\,\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} N = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert\\,$:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}} $$\nSolving for the consistent plastic multiplier increment $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,$:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}} = \\frac{\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y}{E+H} = \\frac{f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{E+H} $$\nSince we are in the plastic case ($\\,f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}  0\\,$), it follows that $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}}  0\\,$. With $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,$ known, all state variables at $\\,t_{n+1}\\,$ can be uniquely determined.\n\n**3.2. Lagged Backstress Scheme**\nIn this scheme, the backstress is \"frozen\" at its step-initial value, $\\,\\alpha_n\\,$, when enforcing the yield condition. The condition becomes $\\,f(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_n) = 0\\,$, or $\\,\\lvert \\sigma_{n+1} - \\alpha_n \\rvert = \\sigma_y\\,$.\nThe stress update $\\,\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma N\\,$ is still used. We substitute this into the lagged yield condition:\n$$ \\lvert (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} N) - \\alpha_n \\rvert = \\sigma_y $$\n$$ \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} N \\rvert = \\sigma_y $$\nAgain, assuming a radial return, we obtain:\n$$ \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - E \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\sigma_y $$\nSolving for the lagged plastic multiplier increment $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}}\\,$:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\frac{\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y}{E} = \\frac{f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{E} $$\nAfter computing $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}}\\,$, all state variables are updated. Note that since $\\,H  0\\,$, it is clear that $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}}  \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,$.\n\n**3.3. Quantifying Inconsistency of the Lagged Scheme**\nThe lagged scheme is inconsistent because the final state $(\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}}, \\alpha_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}})$ does not satisfy the true yield condition. We quantify this with the yield residual, $\\,r\\,$.\nThe final effective stress is $\\,\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\alpha_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}}\\,$. Its magnitude is:\n$$ \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} \\rvert = \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} N \\rvert = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\,\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}}\\,$:\n$$ \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} \\rvert = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - (E+H)\\frac{\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y}{E} = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\left(1 + \\frac{H}{E}\\right)(\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y) $$\n$$ \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} \\rvert = \\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - (\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y) - \\frac{H}{E}(\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y) = \\sigma_y - \\frac{H}{E}(\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y) $$\nThe yield residual is therefore:\n$$ r = \\lvert \\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} \\rvert - \\sigma_y = -\\frac{H}{E}(\\lvert\\xi_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\rvert - \\sigma_y) = -\\frac{H}{E} f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} $$\nSince $\\,H, E, f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}  0\\,$, the residual $\\,r\\,$ is negative, indicating the lagged scheme overcorrects and brings the state inside the true yield surface.\n\nThe relative stress error $\\,e_{\\sigma}\\,$ is defined as $\\,e_{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{cons}})/\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,$.\nThe stress difference is:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{cons}} = (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} N) - (\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - E \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}} N) = -E(\\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}})N $$\nThe difference in multipliers is:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\Delta\\gamma^{\\mathrm{cons}} = \\frac{f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{E} - \\frac{f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{E+H} = f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\left(\\frac{E+H-E}{E(E+H)}\\right) = f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\frac{H}{E(E+H)} $$\nSo, $\\,\\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{lag}} - \\sigma_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{cons}} = -E \\left( f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\frac{H}{E(E+H)} \\right) N = -f_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{tr}} \\frac{H}{E+H} N\\,$. This difference will be evaluated numerically for each case.\n\n### 4.

This practice explores the rich behavior of non-smooth, polyhedral yield surfaces, which are common in fields like crystal plasticity and soil mechanics . By comparing the plastic dissipation calculated for a smooth ($\\ell_2$) versus a non-smooth ($\\ell_\\infty$) yield criterion, you will directly investigate how corner regions affect plastic flow and learn to assess the reliability of using simplified models as estimators.",

            "problem": "Consider a small-strain, rate-independent, associative elastoplastic material in two-dimensional deviatoric stress space. Let the elastic modulus be a positive constant $E$ (in $\\mathrm{Pa}$), and let the yield strength be a positive constant $\\sigma_y$ (in $\\mathrm{Pa}$). Denote the trial stress by $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} = E\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the applied strain vector (dimensionless). The rate-independent associative flow rule is $d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = d\\lambda\\,\\boldsymbol{n}$ with $d\\lambda \\ge 0$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ a normal to the yield surface. The updated stress satisfies $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\,\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$, where $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$ is the plastic strain increment selected such that $\\boldsymbol{s}$ lies on the yield surface.\n\nTwo yield surfaces are considered:\n\n- A smooth yield surface defined by the $\\ell_2$ norm: $f_2(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2 - \\sigma_y$, which is differentiable wherever $\\boldsymbol{s}\\neq \\boldsymbol{0}$ and has a unique normal direction at yield.\n\n- A nonsmooth yield surface defined by the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm: $f_\\infty(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_\\infty - \\sigma_y$, which has corners (non-differentiable points) where multiple components achieve the maximum magnitude simultaneously, and hence possesses a non-unique subgradient set at those points.\n\nThe plastic dissipation per increment is the goal functional $J = \\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$ (in $\\mathrm{Pa}$). For rate-independent perfect plasticity with associated flow, $J$ equals the stress power expended by plastic flow during the increment and is a function of the return mapping to the yield surface. Your task is to construct and compare a goal-oriented estimate of plastic dissipation for the nonsmooth $\\ell_\\infty$ yield surface using information derived from the smooth $\\ell_2$ yield surface, and to quantify how corner activation in the nonsmooth surface reduces estimator reliability when no smoothing is applied.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions given above and from the linear elastic relation $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} = E\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, do the following:\n\n1. Derive the plastic dissipation $J$ for a single increment for the smooth $\\ell_2$ yield surface by enforcing yield consistency and the associative flow rule. Express $J$ explicitly in terms of $E$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$.\n\n2. Derive the plastic dissipation $J$ for a single increment for the nonsmooth $\\ell_\\infty$ yield surface by enforcing yield consistency and the associative flow rule, carefully handling the activation of one face or multiple faces. Express $J$ explicitly in terms of $E$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$.\n\n3. Construct a goal-oriented estimate of the nonsmooth dissipation $J$ that uses the smooth $\\ell_2$ dissipation as its surrogate without any corner smoothing. Justify this choice from first principles (for example, via linearization of the goal functional or via the use of a smooth adjoint weight based on the $\\ell_2$ geometry). Define a reliability metric $\\rho$ that measures the accuracy of the estimate relative to the exact nonsmooth dissipation. Use a dimensionless definition such as $\\rho = 1 - |J_{\\mathrm{est}} - J_{\\infty}| / J_{\\infty}$ whenever $J_{\\infty}  0$, with a principled definition when $J_{\\infty} = 0$.\n\n4.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of plastic dissipation for two different yield criteria in a 2D deviatoric stress space, followed by an implementation to quantify the reliability of using the smooth criterion to estimate results for the nonsmooth one. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational plasticity, well-posed, and provides all necessary data.\n\nThe general framework for rate-independent elastoplasticity involves a trial stress, $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, computed assuming a purely elastic increment, and a return mapping algorithm to find the final stress, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, if the trial state is outside the elastic domain defined by the yield surface. The key constitutive relations are:\n- Linear elasticity: $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} = E\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$\n- Stress update (backward Euler): $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\,\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$\n- Associative flow rule: $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda\\,\\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward normal to the yield surface at $\\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\\Delta\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the plastic consistency parameter.\n- Yield condition: $f(\\boldsymbol{s}) \\le 0$\n- Loading/unloading conditions: $\\Delta\\lambda \\ge 0$, $f(\\boldsymbol{s}) \\le 0$, $\\Delta\\lambda f(\\boldsymbol{s}) = 0$.\n\nIf $f(\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}) \\le 0$, the step is elastic, $\\Delta\\lambda = 0$, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\boldsymbol{0}$, $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, and the plastic dissipation $J = \\boldsymbol{s} \\cdot \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = 0$. If $f(\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}})  0$, the step is plastic, and a return mapping is necessary.\n\n**1. Derivation for the Smooth $\\ell_2$ Yield Surface**\n\nThe smooth yield surface is defined by $f_2(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2 - \\sigma_y = 0$, representing a circle of radius $\\sigma_y$ in the 2D stress space. For a plastic step, where $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2  \\sigma_y$, the final stress $\\boldsymbol{s}$ must satisfy $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2 = \\sigma_y$.\n\nThe normal to the yield surface at $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is $\\nabla f_2(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\boldsymbol{s}/\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2$. The unit normal is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{s}/\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2$. Substituting the flow rule into the stress update gives:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\,\\Delta\\lambda\\,\\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2} $$\nSince $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2 = \\sigma_y$ for a plastic state, this becomes:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\frac{E\\,\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_y}\\boldsymbol{s} \\implies \\boldsymbol{s}\\left(1 + \\frac{E\\,\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_y}\\right) = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} $$\nThis equation shows that the final stress $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is collinear with the trial stress $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$. This is the characteristic \"radial return\" for this yield criterion. The unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is therefore also collinear with $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2} $$\nTo find the consistency parameter $\\Delta\\lambda$, we enforce the yield condition on $\\boldsymbol{s}$:\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_2 = \\left\\| \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}}{1 + E\\,\\Delta\\lambda/\\sigma_y} \\right\\|_2 = \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2}{1 + E\\,\\Delta\\lambda/\\sigma_y} = \\sigma_y $$\nSolving for $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{E\\,\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2}{\\sigma_y} \\implies \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E}\\left(\\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2}{\\sigma_y} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2 - \\sigma_y) $$\nThe plastic dissipation per increment, $J_2$, is defined as $J = \\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$.\n$$ J_2 = \\boldsymbol{s} \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda\\,\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\Delta\\lambda (\\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}) $$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is on the yield surface and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the unit normal at $\\boldsymbol{s}$, the dot product $\\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n} = (\\sigma_y\\boldsymbol{n}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\sigma_y\\|\\boldsymbol{n}\\|_2^2 = \\sigma_y$.\nThus, the dissipation is:\n$$ J_2 = \\sigma_y\\,\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E}(\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2 - \\sigma_y) $$\nThe complete expression for the $\\ell_2$ dissipation is:\n$$ J_2 = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} (\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2 - \\sigma_y)  \\text{if } \\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2  \\sigma_y \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_2 \\le \\sigma_y \\end{cases} $$\n\n**2. Derivation for the Nonsmooth $\\ell_\\infty$ Yield Surface**\n\nThe nonsmooth yield surface is defined by $f_\\infty(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_\\infty - \\sigma_y = \\max(|s_1|, |s_2|) - \\sigma_y = 0$. This represents a square in the 2D stress space with vertices at $(\\pm\\sigma_y, \\pm\\sigma_y)$. The return mapping algorithm for this criterion corresponds to a projection onto the convex set defined by $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_\\infty \\le \\sigma_y$, which is the square $[-\\sigma_y, \\sigma_y] \\times [-\\sigma_y, \\sigma_y]$. In the energy norm induced by the elastic tensor, this projection is computed component-wise:\n$$ s_i = \\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}) \\min(|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}|, \\sigma_y) \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2 $$\nIf $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_\\infty \\le \\sigma_y$, then $|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| \\le \\sigma_y$ for both components, so $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\boldsymbol{0}$, and the dissipation $J_\\infty = 0$.\nIf $\\|\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|_\\infty  \\sigma_y$, we have a plastic step. The plastic strain increment is found from the stress update rule:\n$$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\frac{1}{E}(\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\boldsymbol{s}) $$\nThe components of the plastic strain are:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{p,i} = \\frac{1}{E}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}) \\min(|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}|, \\sigma_y)) = \\frac{1}{E}\\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}})\\max(0, |s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - \\sigma_y) $$\nThe plastic dissipation $J_\\infty = \\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\sum_{i=1}^2 s_i \\Delta\\varepsilon_{p,i}$. For each component $i$:\n- If $|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| \\le \\sigma_y$, then $s_i = s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}$ and $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{p,i} = 0$, so the contribution is $0$.\n- If $|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}|  \\sigma_y$, then $s_i = \\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}})\\sigma_y$. The contribution to dissipation is:\n$$ s_i \\Delta\\varepsilon_{p,i} = \\left(\\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}})\\sigma_y\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\mathrm{sgn}(s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}})\\max(0, |s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - \\sigma_y)\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E}(|s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - \\sigma_y) $$\nThe total dissipation is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ J_\\infty = \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} \\max(0, |s_i^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - \\sigma_y) $$\nThis expression correctly captures activation on a single face (if only one component of $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$ exceeds $\\sigma_y$ in magnitude) or at a corner (if both components do).\n\n**3. Goal-Oriented Estimate and Reliability Metric**\n\nThe task is to construct an estimate of the nonsmooth dissipation $J_\\infty$ using the smooth dissipation $J_2$ as a surrogate. We define the estimator as:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{est}} = J_2 $$\nThis choice represents a pragmatic engineering approach where a simpler, analytically smoother model (the $\\ell_2$ or von Mises criterion) is used to approximate the behavior of a more complex, nonsmooth one (the $\\ell_\\infty$ or Tresca-like criterion). The justification stems from the geometric similarity of the yield surfaces; however, the accuracy of this approximation is expected to be poor when the loading direction points towards regions where the geometries diverge most significantly, such as the corners of the $\\ell_\\infty$ square.\n\nTo quantify the performance of this estimator, we define a reliability metric $\\rho$. As specified, for non-zero dissipation $J_\\infty  0$:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{|J_{\\mathrm{est}} - J_{\\infty}|}{J_{\\infty}} $$\nFor the case where $J_\\infty = 0$, a principled definition is required.\n- If $J_{\\infty} = 0$ and $J_{\\mathrm{est}} = 0$, the estimator correctly predicts an elastic step. The error is zero, so the reliability is perfect. We define $\\rho=1$.\n- If $J_{\\infty} = 0$ but $J_{\\mathrm{est}}  0$, the estimator incorrectly predicts plastic flow. This is a qualitative failure of the model. The relative error is infinite, indicating zero reliability. We define $\\rho=0$.\nCombining these gives the complete definition for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = \\begin{cases} 1 - \\frac{|J_2 - J_{\\infty}|}{J_{\\infty}}  \\text{if } J_{\\infty}  0 \\\\ 1  \\text{if } J_{\\infty} = 0 \\text{ and } J_2 = 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } J_{\\infty} = 0 \\text{ and } J_2  0 \\end{cases} $$\n\nThe algorithmic design is to implement the derived formulae for $J_2$, $J_\\infty$, and $\\rho$ for each given test case.",
