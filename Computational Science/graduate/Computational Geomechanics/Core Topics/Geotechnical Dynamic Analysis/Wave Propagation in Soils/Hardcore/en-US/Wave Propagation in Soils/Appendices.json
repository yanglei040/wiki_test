            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard physical scenario of shear wave reflection and transmission at an elastic interface, for which a unique and meaningful solution exists. All necessary parameters and governing principles are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of an energy-balance expression for a horizontally polarized shear (SH) wave incident on a planar interface between two elastic media.\n\nLet the interface be the plane $z=0$. Medium $1$ occupies $z0$ and medium $2$ occupies $z0$. The displacement field $u_y(x,z,t)$ is purely in the $y$-direction. The total wave field in medium $1$ is the superposition of the incident and reflected waves, while the field in medium $2$ consists of the transmitted wave.\n\nThe incident wave in medium $1$ is given by\n$$u_i(x,z,t) = A_i \\exp[i(k_x x + k_{z1} z - \\omega t)]$$\nThe reflected wave in medium $1$ is\n$$u_r(x,z,t) = A_r \\exp[i(k_x x - k_{z1} z - \\omega t)]$$\nThe transmitted wave in medium $2$ is\n$$u_t(x,z,t) = A_t \\exp[i(k_x x + k_{z2} z - \\omega t)]$$\nwhere $A_i$, $A_r$, and $A_t$ are the complex amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves, respectively. The angular frequency is $\\omega$. The horizontal wavenumber $k_x$ is conserved across the interface. The vertical wavenumbers are $k_{z1}$ in medium $1$ and $k_{z2}$ in medium $2$.\n\nThe wavenumbers are related to the incidence angle $\\theta_1$ and transmission angle $\\theta_2$ (both measured from the normal, i.e., the $z$-axis) as:\n$$k_x = k_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = k_2 \\sin\\theta_2$$\n$$k_{z1} = k_1 \\cos\\theta_1$$\n$$k_{z2} = k_2 \\cos\\theta_2$$\nwhere $k_j = \\omega/\\beta_j$ is the total wavenumber in medium $j$ ($j=1,2$) and $\\beta_j$ is the shear-wave speed. The conservation of $k_x$ leads to Snell's law:\n$$\\frac{\\sin\\theta_1}{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\sin\\theta_2}{\\beta_2}$$\n\nAt the welded interface ($z=0$), two boundary conditions must be satisfied:\n$1$. Continuity of displacement: The total displacement in medium $1$ must equal the displacement in medium $2$.\n$$u_i(x,0,t) + u_r(x,0,t) = u_t(x,0,t)$$\nSubstituting the wave forms and canceling the common exponential term $\\exp[i(k_x x - \\omega t)]$ gives:\n$$A_i + A_r = A_t$$\nDividing by $A_i$ and using the definitions $R = A_r/A_i$ and $T = A_t/A_i$, we obtain the first equation:\n$$1 + R = T$$\n\n$2$. Continuity of shear traction: The shear traction $\\tau_{yz}$ must be continuous across the interface. The constitutive relation is $\\tau_{yz} = \\mu (\\partial u_y / \\partial z)$, where $\\mu = \\rho \\beta^2$ is the shear modulus.\nIn medium $1$, the total traction is $\\tau_{yz,1} = \\mu_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(u_i + u_r) = \\mu_1(i k_{z1} u_i - i k_{z1} u_r)$.\nIn medium $2$, the traction is $\\tau_{yz,2} = \\mu_2 \\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial z} = \\mu_2(i k_{z2} u_t)$.\nEquating the tractions at $z=0$:\n$$\\mu_1 k_{z1} (A_i - A_r) = \\mu_2 k_{z2} A_t$$\nSubstitute $k_{zj} = (\\omega/\\beta_j)\\cos\\theta_j$ and $\\mu_j = \\rho_j \\beta_j^2$:\n$$\\rho_1 \\beta_1^2 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta_1}\\cos\\theta_1\\right) (A_i - A_r) = \\rho_2 \\beta_2^2 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta_2}\\cos\\theta_2\\right) A_t$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$(\\rho_1 \\beta_1 \\cos\\theta_1) (A_i - A_r) = (\\rho_2 \\beta_2 \\cos\\theta_2) A_t$$\nDefining the shear wave impedance $Z_j = \\rho_j \\beta_j$, the equation becomes:\n$$Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 (A_i - A_r) = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2 A_t$$\nDividing by $A_i$ gives the second equation:\n$$Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 (1 - R) = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2 T$$\n\nWe now solve the system of two equations for $R$ and $T$:\n$$1 + R = T$$\n$$Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 (1 - R) = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2 T$$\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 (1 - R) = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2 (1 + R)$$\n$$Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 - R Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2 + R Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2$$\n$$R (Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2) = Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 - Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2$$\nThus, the reflection coefficient is:\n$$R = \\frac{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 - Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2}{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2}$$\nAnd the transmission coefficient is:\n$$T = 1 + R = 1 + \\frac{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 - Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2}{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2} = \\frac{2 Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1}{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the energy-balance expression:\n$$\\mathcal{E} \\equiv |R|^2 + \\left(\\frac{Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2}{Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1}\\right)|T|^2$$\nThis expression represents the conservation of energy flux normal to the interface. The first term is the reflection coefficient of energy flux, and the second is the transmission coefficient of energy flux. For a lossless system, their sum must be unity. We will demonstrate this analytically.\nFor convenience, let $Z'_1 = Z_1 \\cos\\theta_1$ and $Z'_2 = Z_2 \\cos\\theta_2$. The coefficients are $R = (Z'_1 - Z'_2) / (Z'_1 + Z'_2)$ and $T = 2Z'_1 / (Z'_1 + Z'_2)$. All physical parameters ($\\rho_j, \\beta_j$) are real, and as long as no total internal reflection occurs, $\\cos\\theta_2$ is real. The given parameters are $\\beta_1=250\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\beta_2=400\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\theta_1=30^{\\circ}$. Snell's law gives $\\sin\\theta_2 = (\\beta_2/\\beta_1)\\sin\\theta_1 = (400/250)\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 1.6 \\times 0.5 = 0.8$. Since $|\\sin\\theta_2|  1$, the angle $\\theta_2$ is real, so $R$ and $T$ are real-valued. Thus, $|R|^2 = R^2$ and $|T|^2 = T^2$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R$ and $T$ into $\\mathcal{E}$:\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\left(\\frac{Z'_1 - Z'_2}{Z'_1 + Z'_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{Z'_2}{Z'_1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2Z'_1}{Z'_1 + Z'_2}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(Z'_1 - Z'_2)^2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2} + \\frac{Z'_2}{Z'_1} \\frac{4(Z'_1)^2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2}$$\nSimplifying the second term:\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(Z'_1)^2 - 2Z'_1Z'_2 + (Z'_2)^2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2} + \\frac{4Z'_1Z'_2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2}$$\nCombining the fractions over the common denominator:\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(Z'_1)^2 - 2Z'_1Z'_2 + (Z'_2)^2 + 4Z'_1Z'_2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2}$$\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(Z'_1)^2 + 2Z'_1Z'_2 + (Z'_2)^2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2}$$\nThe numerator is the expansion of $(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2$:\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2}{(Z'_1 + Z'_2)^2} = 1$$\nThis confirms that the energy-balance expression is identically equal to $1$, reflecting the principle of conservation of energy for this lossless system. The numerical values provided in the problem are consistent with this physical principle.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $\\mathcal{E}$ rounded to four significant figures. Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is analytically $1$, its value is exactly $1$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $1.000$.",

It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All terms are clearly defined, and no contradictions are present. The idealization of an infinite mesh is a standard procedure for numerical dispersion analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by establishing the Galerkin weak form of the PDE. For an arbitrary test function $w(x)$, the weak form over a single finite element of length $h$ (from $x_j$ to $x_{j+1}$) is:\n$$ \\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} w \\left( \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - G \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\right) dx = 0 $$\nIntegrating the second term by parts yields:\n$$ \\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} \\left( w \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} G \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right) dx - \\left[ w G \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right]_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} = 0 $$\nIn the Galerkin method, the displacement field $u(x,t)$ and the test function $w(x)$ are approximated using the same shape functions. For a two-node linear element, let the local coordinate be $\\zeta = (x-x_{j})/h \\in [0, 1]$. The displacement is approximated as $u(\\zeta, t) = N_j(\\zeta) u_j(t) + N_{j+1}(\\zeta) u_{j+1}(t)$, where the shape functions are $N_j(\\zeta) = 1-\\zeta$ and $N_{j+1}(\\zeta) = \\zeta$.\nIn matrix form, $u(\\zeta, t) = \\mathbf{N}(\\zeta) \\mathbf{u}_e(t)$, with $\\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\zeta  \\zeta \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_e = \\begin{pmatrix} u_j(t)  u_{j+1}(t) \\end{pmatrix}^T$. The test functions are similarly chosen as $w(x) = \\mathbf{N}(\\zeta) \\mathbf{w}_e$, where $\\mathbf{w}_e$ is a vector of arbitrary nodal values.\nSubstituting these approximations into the weak form for one element gives the element equation $\\mathbf{M}_e \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}}_e + \\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{f}_e$, where $\\mathbf{f}_e$ represents the boundary terms from integration by parts.

            "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated. All provided information is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and the Finite Element Method, and objectively stated. The problem is well-posed and complete. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe one-dimensional shear wave equation is given by:\n$$ \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} = G A \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [0, L] $$\nThe boundary conditions are a fixed base, $u(0,t)=0$, and a traction-free surface, $G \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L,t)=0$.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of Semi-Discrete FE Equations\n\nWe begin by establishing the weak form of the governing equation. Multiplying by a test function $v(x)$ that satisfies the essential boundary conditions (here, $v(0)=0$) and integrating over the domain $[0, L]$ gives:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} v(x) \\left( \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} - G A \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} \\right) dx = 0 $$\nIntegrating the second term by parts yields:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A v \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} dx + \\int_{0}^{L} G A \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx - \\left[ G A v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right]_{0}^{L} = 0 $$\nThe boundary term is $G A v(L) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L,t) - G A v(0) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0,t)$. The traction-free condition at $x=L$ makes the first term zero. The condition $v(0)=0$ makes the second term zero. The weak form for free vibration is thus:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A v \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} dx + \\int_{0}^{L} G A \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx = 0 $$\nThe domain is discretized into two linear finite elements of equal length $h = L/2$. The nodes are at $x_0=0$, $x_1=h$, and $x_2=2h=L$. The displacement field is approximated as $u(x,t) \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{2} N_i(x) u_i(t)$, where $N_i$ are the global shape functions and $u_i$ are the nodal displacements. Using the Galerkin method, we set $v(x) = N_j(x)$ for $j=0,1,2$. This yields the semi-discrete system $\\mathbf{M} \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} + \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is the mass matrix, $\\mathbf{K}$ is the stiffness matrix, and $\\mathbf{u} = \\{u_0, u_1, u_2\\}^T$.\n\nFor a single linear element of length $h$, the element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{k}^e$ and consistent mass matrix $\\mathbf{m}_c^e$ are:\n$$ \\mathbf{k}^e = \\frac{GA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{m}_c^e = \\frac{\\rho A h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAssembling the matrices for the two elements (nodes $0-1$ and $1-2$) gives the global $3 \\times 3$ matrices:\n$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\frac{GA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0 \\\\ -1  2  -1 \\\\ 0  -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{M}_c = \\frac{\\rho A h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 \\\\ 1  4  1 \\\\ 0  1  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe lumped mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}_l$ is formed by summing the rows of $\\mathbf{M}_c$ and placing the results on the diagonal:\nRow 0 sum: $\\frac{\\rho A h}{6}(2+1) = \\frac{\\rho A h}{2}$. Row 1 sum: $\\frac{\\rho A h}{6}(1+4+1) = \\rho A h$. Row 2 sum: $\\frac{\\rho A h}{6}(1+2) = \\frac{\\rho A h}{2}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_l = \\rho A h \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe essential boundary condition $u(0,t)=0$ implies $u_0=0$. We reduce the system by removing the first row and column of the global matrices. The remaining degrees of freedom are $\\mathbf{d} = \\{u_1, u_2\\}^T$.\nThe reduced $2 \\times 2$ stiffness matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_{red} = \\frac{GA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reduced $2 \\times 2$ consistent mass matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_{c,red} = \\frac{\\rho A h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reduced $2 \\times 2$ lumped mass matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_{l,red} = \\rho A h \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor harmonic motion $\\mathbf{d}(t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} e^{i\\omega t}$, the semi-discrete equation becomes a generalized eigenvalue problem: $(\\mathbf{K}_{red} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M}_{red}) \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Eigenvalues $\\gamma$\n\nWe introduce the shear wave speed $c = \\sqrt{G/\\rho}$ and the nondimensional parameter $\\gamma = \\omega^2 h^2 / c^2 = \\omega^2 h^2 \\rho / G$. The eigenvalue problem can be written as $\\det(\\mathbf{K}_{red} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M}_{red}) = 0$.\n\n**Consistent Mass Formulation:**\n$$ \\det\\left( \\frac{GA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\omega^2 \\frac{\\rho A h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{\\omega^2 \\rho h^2}{6G} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 $$\nSubstituting $\\gamma = \\omega^2 \\rho h^2 / G$:\n$$ \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{\\gamma}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \\frac{2\\gamma}{3}  -1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{6} \\\\ -1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{6}  1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(2 - \\frac{2\\gamma}{3}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{6}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ 2 - \\frac{4\\gamma}{3} + \\frac{2\\gamma^2}{9} - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{3} + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{36}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ 1 - \\frac{5\\gamma}{3} + \\frac{7\\gamma^2}{36} = 0 \\implies 7\\gamma^2 - 60\\gamma + 36 = 0 $$\nThe roots are $\\gamma_c = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{60^2 - 4(7)(36)}}{14} = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{3600-1008}}{14} = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{2592}}{14} = \\frac{60 \\pm 36\\sqrt{2}}{14} = \\frac{30 \\pm 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}$.\nThe highest eigenvalue is $\\gamma_{c,high} = \\frac{30 + 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}$.\n\n**Lumped Mass Formulation:**\n$$ \\det\\left( \\frac{GA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\omega^2 \\rho A h \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{\\omega^2 \\rho h^2}{G} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 $$\nSubstituting $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \\gamma  -1 \\\\ -1  1 - \\gamma/2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (2 - \\gamma)(1 - \\gamma/2) - 1 = 0 \\implies 2 - 2\\gamma + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2} - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\gamma^2 - 4\\gamma + 2 = 0 $$\nThe roots are $\\gamma_l = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-8}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe highest eigenvalue is $\\gamma_{l,high} = 2 + \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n### Step 3: Nondimensional Frequencies\n\nThe exact eigenfrequencies for the continuous system are $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi c}{2L}$. For the second mode ($n=2$) and with $L=2h$, we have:\n$$ \\omega_2 = \\frac{(2(2)-1)\\pi c}{2(2h)} = \\frac{3\\pi c}{4h} $$\nThe exact nondimensional frequency of the second mode is $\\eta_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{\\omega_2 h}{c}$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} $$\nThe FE nondimensional frequencies for the highest mode ($n=2$) are found using $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\gamma}$.\nFor the consistent mass formulation:\n$$ \\eta_c = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{c,high}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30 + 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}} $$\nFor the lumped mass formulation:\n$$ \\eta_l = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{l,high}} = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n### Step 4: Computation of Error Difference $\\Delta$\n\nThe magnitude of the relative error is defined as $e = \\left|\\frac{\\eta - \\eta_{\\text{true}}}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}}\\right|$.\nNumerically, $\\eta_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\approx 2.3562$, $\\eta_c \\approx \\sqrt{7.9223} \\approx 2.8147$, and $\\eta_l \\approx \\sqrt{3.4142} \\approx 1.8478$.\nSince $\\eta_c > \\eta_{\\text{true}}$ and $\\eta_l  \\eta_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$ e_c = \\frac{\\eta_c - \\eta_{\\text{true}}}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{\\eta_c}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} - 1 $$\n$$ e_l = \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{true}} - \\eta_l}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} = 1 - \\frac{\\eta_l}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} $$\nThe scalar difference $\\Delta = e_c - e_l$ is:\n$$ \\Delta = \\left(\\frac{\\eta_c}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} - 1\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\eta_l}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\eta_c + \\eta_l}{\\eta_{\\text{true}}} - 2 $$\nSubstituting the expressions:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{30 + 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}} - 2 = \\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{30 + 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\\right) - 2 $$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$e_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{30 + 18\\sqrt{2}}{7}}}{3\\pi/4} - 1 \\approx \\frac{2.81465155}{2.35619449} - 1 \\approx 1.19457490 - 1 = 0.19457490$\n$e_l = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{3\\pi/4} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1.84775907}{2.35619449} \\approx 1 - 0.78421289 = 0.21578711$\n$$ \\Delta = e_c - e_l \\approx 0.19457490 - 0.21578711 \\approx -0.02121221 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-0.02121$.",
