This first exercise  strips the problem down to its mathematical essence using a simple nonlinear spring. By deriving the incremental-iterative equations from first principles, you will discover precisely why a load-controlled procedure mathematically fails at a peak load, and how augmenting the system with a displacement constraint elegantly circumvents this limitation, allowing the full post-peak response to be traced.",

            "problem": "A single degree of freedom (SDOF) nonlinear elastic spring is subjected to a quasi-static scalar load. The internal restoring force is defined by the constitutive relation $f_{\\text{int}}(u) = k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3}$ with $k0$ and $\\beta0$, where $u$ is the displacement. The external load is represented by a scalar load factor $\\lambda$ multiplying a unit reference load, so the equilibrium equation is $f_{\\text{int}}(u) - \\lambda = 0$. Consider two incremental-iterative procedures: load control, in which increments of $\\lambda$ are prescribed, and displacement control, in which increments of $u$ are prescribed. Starting only from the definitions of equilibrium, linearization, and the Newton–Raphson iteration, do the following.\n\n(1) Write the residual $R(u,\\lambda)$ and its first-order linearization about a generic state $(u,\\lambda)$. Using this, identify the tangent stiffness $K_{\\text{T}}(u)$ and write the Newton update equation for load control when a nonzero increment $\\Delta \\lambda$ is imposed. State the algebraic condition that must hold for this update to be well-posed and explain, using only this condition and the constitutive law, why the load-controlled procedure cannot pass the limit (peak) point of the equilibrium path.\n\n(2) Introduce a displacement constraint $g(u) = u - u_{\\text{c}} = 0$ to enforce displacement control with unknowns $(u,\\lambda)$. Form the coupled linearized system for the Newton step $(\\Delta u,\\Delta \\lambda)$ and compute its Jacobian determinant in terms of $K_{\\text{T}}(u)$. Use this to explain why the displacement-controlled procedure remains well-posed at the limit point and can trace the descending branch.\n\n(3) Determine the coordinates $(u_{\\text{p}},\\lambda_{\\text{p}})$ of the peak (limit) point on the equilibrium curve, defined as the state at which the load attains a local maximum with respect to the displacement. Express your answer in closed form in terms of $k$ and $\\beta$. No numerical values are to be substituted. Express the displacement in meters and the load in Newtons.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of load-controlled and displacement-controlled incremental-iterative procedures for a single degree of freedom (SDOF) nonlinear spring, and for the determination of the coordinates of the limit point on its equilibrium path.\n\nThe equilibrium equation for the system is given by the condition that the internal restoring force, $f_{\\text{int}}(u)$, balances the external load, $\\lambda$:\n$$f_{\\text{int}}(u) - \\lambda = 0$$\nThe constitutive relation for the internal force is provided as a softening nonlinear spring model:\n$$f_{\\text{int}}(u) = k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3}$$\nwhere $k0$ and $\\beta0$ are material parameters. Substituting the constitutive law into the equilibrium equation gives the scalar load-displacement relationship:\n$$\\lambda(u) = k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3}$$\n\n(1) **Analysis of the Load-Control Procedure**\n\nThe residual function, $R(u, \\lambda)$, measures the out-of-balance force for a given state $(u, \\lambda)$:\n$$R(u, \\lambda) = f_{\\text{int}}(u) - \\lambda = k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3} - \\lambda$$\nThe goal of an incremental-iterative procedure is to find a sequence of states $(u, \\lambda)$ that satisfy $R(u, \\lambda) = 0$.\n\nA Newton-Raphson scheme finds the solution by successive linearization. Let's consider a generic state $(u_i, \\lambda_i)$ and find an incremental update $(\\Delta u, \\Delta \\lambda)$ that drives the residual to zero. A first-order Taylor series expansion of the residual function about $(u_i, \\lambda_i)$ is:\n$$R(u_i + \\Delta u, \\lambda_i + \\Delta \\lambda) \\approx R(u_i, \\lambda_i) + \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial u}\\bigg|_{u_i} \\Delta u + \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda}\\bigg|_{\\lambda_i} \\Delta \\lambda$$\nSetting the future residual $R(u_i + \\Delta u, \\lambda_i + \\Delta \\lambda)$ to zero, we get the linearized incremental equation:\n$$ -R(u_i, \\lambda_i) = \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial u}\\bigg|_{u_i} \\Delta u + \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda}\\bigg|_{\\lambda_i} \\Delta \\lambda $$\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial u} = \\frac{d}{du}(k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3}) = k - 3\\,\\beta\\,u^{2}$$\nThis term is defined as the tangent stiffness, $K_{\\text{T}}(u)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(-\\lambda) = -1$$\nSubstituting these into the linearized equation yields:\n$$-R(u_i, \\lambda_i) = K_{\\text{T}}(u_i) \\Delta u - \\Delta \\lambda$$\nThis is the general linearized equation relating increments in displacement and load to the current residual.\n\nIn a pure load-control procedure, the load increment $\\Delta \\lambda$ is prescribed, and the displacement increment $\\Delta u$ is the unknown to be solved for. The procedure typically involves a predictor step from a known equilibrium point followed by corrector iterations. Starting from an equilibrium state $(u_i, \\lambda_i)$ where $R(u_i, \\lambda_i) = 0$, a load increment $\\Delta \\lambda$ is applied. The equation for the initial (predictor) displacement increment $\\Delta u$ becomes:\n$$0 = K_{\\text{T}}(u_i) \\Delta u - \\Delta \\lambda$$\nRearranging gives the update equation for load control:\n$$K_{\\text{T}}(u_i) \\Delta u = \\Delta \\lambda$$\nFor this equation to yield a unique solution for the unknown displacement increment $\\Delta u$ for any given load increment $\\Delta \\lambda$, the coefficient $K_{\\text{T}}(u_i)$ must be invertible. Since this is a scalar problem, the algebraic condition is that the tangent stiffness must be non-zero:\n$$K_{\\text{T}}(u_i) \\neq 0$$\nThe limit (peak) point of the equilibrium path is defined as the point where the load $\\lambda$ reaches a local maximum with respect to the displacement $u$. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d\\lambda}{du}=0$. From the equilibrium equation $\\lambda = f_{\\text{int}}(u)$, this derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d\\lambda}{du} = \\frac{d f_{\\text{int}}}{du} = K_{\\text{T}}(u)$$\nTherefore, at the limit point, the tangent stiffness is zero: $K_{\\text{T}}(u_{\\text{p}}) = 0$.\n\nAt this point, the well-posedness condition $K_{\\text{T}}(u) \\neq 0$ is violated. The update equation becomes $0 \\cdot \\Delta u = \\Delta \\lambda$. If a non-zero load increment $\\Delta \\lambda \\neq 0$ is prescribed, this equation has no solution. If a zero load increment $\\Delta \\lambda = 0$ is prescribed precisely at the peak, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot \\Delta u = 0$, which has infinitely many solutions for $\\Delta u$. In either case, the procedure cannot determine a unique displacement increment to advance the solution. Thus, the load-controlled procedure fails at and cannot trace the path beyond the limit point.\n\n(2) **Analysis of the Displacement-Control Procedure**\n\nIn displacement control, we treat both $u$ and $\\lambda$ as unknowns and add a constraint equation that prescribes the displacement. The system of equations is:\n$$ \\begin{cases} R(u, \\lambda) = f_{\\text{int}}(u) - \\lambda = 0  \\text{(Equilibrium)} \\\\ g(u) = u - u_{\\text{c}} = 0  \\text{(Constraint)} \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $u_{\\text{c}}$ is the controlled (target) displacement. We can write this as a vector equation $\\mathbf{F}(u, \\lambda) = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} R(u, \\lambda) \\\\ g(u) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method for this system linearizes $\\mathbf{F}$ at a state $(u_i, \\lambda_i)$ to find corrections $(\\Delta u, \\Delta \\lambda)$:\n$$\\mathbf{J}(u_i, \\lambda_i) \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta u \\\\ \\Delta \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = -\\mathbf{F}(u_i, \\lambda_i)$$\nThe Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by:\n$$\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial u}  \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\lambda} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe have already calculated $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial u} = K_{\\text{T}}(u)$ and $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda} = -1$. The derivatives of the constraint are $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\lambda} = 0$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore:\n$$\\mathbf{J}(u) = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{\\text{T}}(u)  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe coupled linearized system for the Newton step $(\\Delta u, \\Delta \\lambda)$ is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} K_{\\text{T}}(u)  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta u \\\\ \\Delta \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = -\\begin{pmatrix} f_{\\text{int}}(u) - \\lambda \\\\ u - u_{\\text{c}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe well-posedness of this system depends on whether the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is invertible, which is true if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of the Jacobian is:\n$$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = (K_{\\text{T}}(u))(0) - (-1)(1) = 1$$\nSince $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = 1$ is a non-zero constant, the Jacobian matrix is invertible for all values of $u$, including at the limit point where $K_{\\text{T}}(u_{\\text{p}}) = 0$. At the limit point, the Jacobian becomes $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is still non-singular.\nBecause the linearized system always has a unique solution for the increments $(\\Delta u, \\Delta \\lambda)$, the displacement-controlled Newton-Raphson procedure remains well-posed throughout the entire equilibrium path. This allows it to successfully pass the limit point and trace the descending (post-peak) branch of the curve where the tangent stiffness $K_{\\text{T}}(u)$ is negative.\n\n(3) **Coordinates of the Peak (Limit) Point**\n\nThe peak or limit point $(u_{\\text{p}}, \\lambda_{\\text{p}})$ is the state where the load $\\lambda$ is at a local maximum, characterized by $\\frac{d\\lambda}{du} = 0$. As previously shown, this is equivalent to the tangent stiffness being zero:\n$$K_{\\text{T}}(u_{\\text{p}}) = 0$$\nUsing the expression for the tangent stiffness:\n$$k - 3\\,\\beta\\,u_{\\text{p}}^{2} = 0$$\nSolving for $u_{\\text{p}}$ (assuming positive displacement for the first peak, which is standard):\n$$u_{\\text{p}}^{2} = \\frac{k}{3\\beta} \\implies u_{\\text{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{3\\beta}}$$\nTo find the corresponding load $\\lambda_{\\text{p}}$, we substitute $u_{\\text{p}}$ back into the equilibrium equation $\\lambda = k\\,u - \\beta\\,u^{3}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{p}} = k\\,u_{\\text{p}} - \\beta\\,u_{\\text{p}}^{3} = u_{\\text{p}}(k - \\beta\\,u_{\\text{p}}^{2})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $u_{\\text{p}}$ and $u_{\\text{p}}^{2}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{3\\beta}} \\left( k - \\beta \\left(\\frac{k}{3\\beta}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{3\\beta}} \\left( k - \\frac{k}{3} \\right)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{3\\beta}} \\left( \\frac{2k}{3} \\right)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{2k}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{3\\beta}}$$\nThe coordinates of the peak point are therefore $(u_{\\text{p}}, \\lambda_{\\text{p}})$.",

The residual norm $\\|\\mathbf{R}\\|$ assesses iterative convergence within a step, not the quality of the path-following constraint. Moreover, random reassignment is an unscientific and inefficient strategy.\n\n**D. Controlling a far-field boundary DOF enhances stability across snap-back because such displacements are monotone in $\\lambda$, thus improving conditioning and ensuring traversal of the post-peak branch.**\nThis is false. The displacement of a far-field DOF is not generally monotonic and its low sensitivity to load changes degrades, not improves, conditioning.\n\n**E. A robust remedy is to replace the single-DOF control by a local energy-weighted arc-length constraint $g(\\mathbf{u},\\lambda) = \\sum_{i} w_{i}\\,u_{i}^{2} + \\beta\\,\\lambda^{2} - s^{2} = 0$, where $w_{i}$ are DOF weights mapped from element-wise plastic dissipation rates and $\\beta0$ balances load and displacement scales; this adaptively reweights the control direction toward the localization zone and improves post-peak path-following.**\nThis describes an advanced and robust path-following technique. By weighting the constraint based on plastic dissipation, it automatically focuses on the active deformation region (the localization band), ensuring the constraint remains sensitive to the failure mechanism. This is a scientifically sound and effective remedy. This statement is correct.\n\nTherefore, statements A and E are correct.",
