            "problem": "Consider a saturated, homogeneous, isotropic clay layer of thickness $H$ subjected at time $t=0$ to a spatially uniform, instantaneous step increase in total vertical stress $q_0$ at the top surface $z=0$. The top surface is mechanically loaded but remains hydraulically drained, and the base $z=H$ is either hydraulically drained (two-face drainage) or hydraulically undrained with no-flow (one-face drainage). Assume small strains, one-dimensional vertical deformation, linear elastic compressibility of the skeleton with one-dimensional constrained compressibility $m_v$, and Darcy flow of pore fluid. In the framework of poromechanics, begin from the governing coupled field equations of the saturated porous medium (Biot consolidation), specifically: linear momentum balance for the mixture, linear elastic effective stress for the skeleton, mass conservation of fluid, and Darcy’s law. Under the stated assumptions, reduce the governing system to the scalar diffusion-type Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the excess pore pressure $p(z,t)$, and then apply separation of variables to derive the closed-form analytical solution $p(z,t)$ for:\n\n- One-face drainage: $p(0,t)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}(H,t)=0$.\n- Two-face drainage: $p(0,t)=0$ and $p(H,t)=0$.\n\nThe initial condition is $p(z,0)=q_0$ for $0 \\leq z \\leq H$. From the effective stress–strain relation in one-dimensional compression, deduce the time-dependent settlement at the loaded surface $u_z(0,t)$ as the depth integral of the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t)$, expressing $u_z(0,t)$ in terms of $p(z,t)$ for each drainage condition. Your derivation must start from the coupled field laws and proceed to the diffusion PDE, its eigenfunction expansion, determination of coefficients by orthogonality, and the resulting series for $p(z,t)$ and $u_z(0,t)$.\n\nFinally, for verification of a coupled finite element model, evaluate the two-face drainage settlement at a specified time using realistic parameters:\n- $H = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $q_0 = 150\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$,\n- $m_v = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$,\n- $c_v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ (coefficient of consolidation),\n- $t = 180\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nCompute the numerical value of $u_z(0,t)$ for the two-face drainage case.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and solution of the one-dimensional consolidation equation, starting from the fundamental coupled field equations of poromechanics, and its application to a numerical example.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the excess pore pressure $p(z,t)$. The analysis is based on the following principles for a saturated porous medium undergoing one-dimensional vertical deformation.\n\n1.  Linear Momentum Balance (Equilibrium): For a quasi-static process where inertial forces are negligible, the total stress field must be in equilibrium. In one dimension (the $z$-direction), and neglecting body forces such as self-weight (as we are concerned with increments due to applied load), this is expressed as $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$. This implies that the total vertical stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is constant with depth. An instantaneous step increase in total vertical stress $q_0$ at the surface $z=0$ is transmitted throughout the depth of the layer. Thus, the change in total vertical stress is uniform: $\\Delta\\sigma_{zz}(z,t) = q_0$.\n\n2.  Effective Stress Principle: The total stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is supported by both the solid skeleton (effective stress $\\sigma'_{zz}$) and the pore fluid (pore pressure $p$). In terms of incremental stresses, Terzaghi's effective stress principle is $\\Delta\\sigma_{zz} = \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz} + p$, where $p$ is the excess pore pressure. At time $t=0$, the load $q_0$ is instantaneously applied to the saturated clay. Since the pore fluid is incompressible and drainage takes time, the entire load is initially carried by the pore fluid, so $p(z,0) = q_0$ and $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,0)=0$. For any time $t > 0$, we have $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t) = q_0 - p(z,t)$.\n\n3.  Constitutive Law for the Soil Skeleton: For one-dimensional compression, the incremental vertical strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is linearly proportional to the incremental effective vertical stress $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}$ through the constrained compressibility $m_v$. This is expressed as $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{zz} = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}$. Since we start from a state of zero incremental stress and strain, $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t)$. Differentiating with respect to time gives the strain rate: $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = m_v \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz})}{\\partial t}$. Substituting the effective stress relation, we get $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = m_v \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(q_0 - p(z,t)) = -m_v \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$.\n\n4.  Mass Conservation (Continuity) and Darcy's Law: The rate of volume change of the deforming porous medium (volumetric strain rate) must equal the divergence of the fluid flow velocity. In one dimension, the volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_V$ equals the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$. The continuity equation for the fluid is $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}$, where $v_z$ is the Darcy velocity of the pore fluid in the vertical direction. Darcy's law states that this velocity is proportional to the gradient of the excess pore pressure: $v_z = -\\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$, where $k_{perm}$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and $\\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water.\n\nCombining these equations, we substitute Darcy's law into the continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(-\\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$, assuming the soil is homogeneous ($k_{perm}$ is constant).\nEquating the two expressions for the strain rate $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t}$ gives $-m_v \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$.\nRearranging yields the one-dimensional consolidation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nwhere $c_v = \\frac{k_{perm}}{m_v \\gamma_w}$ is the coefficient of consolidation, which is assumed to be constant.\n\nNext, we solve this PDE using separation of variables. Let $p(z,t) = Z(z)T(t)$. Substituting into the PDE gives $Z(z)T'(t) = c_v Z''(z)T(t)$. Separating variables yields $\\frac{T'(t)}{c_v T(t)} = \\frac{Z''(z)}{Z(z)}$. Since the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side only on $z$, both must equal a constant, which we denote as $-\\lambda^2$. A negative constant is chosen to ensure a decaying solution in time, which is physically expected. This leads to two ordinary differential equations:\n$T'(t) + \\lambda^2 c_v T(t) = 0$, with solution $T(t) = A \\exp(-\\lambda^2 c_v t)$.\n$Z''(z) + \\lambda^2 Z(z) = 0$, with solution $Z(z) = B \\cos(\\lambda z) + C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n\nWe now apply the boundary conditions for the two specified drainage cases to determine the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ and the constants $B$ and $C$.\n\nCase 1: One-face drainage\nThe boundary conditions are $p(0,t)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}(H,t)=0$.\nApplying to $Z(z)$:\n$Z(0) = B\\cos(0) + C\\sin(0) = B = 0$. So, $Z(z) = C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z'(z) = C\\lambda \\cos(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z'(H) = C\\lambda \\cos(\\lambda H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0$), we require $\\cos(\\lambda H)=0$.\nThis condition is satisfied for eigenvalues $\\lambda_n H = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, $\\lambda_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}$.\nThe general solution is a superposition of all possible solutions:\n$p(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition $p(z,0) = q_0$:\n$q_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right)$.\nUsing the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, we find $C_n = \\frac{2}{H} \\int_0^H q_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) dz = \\frac{2q_0}{H} \\left[-\\frac{2H}{(2n-1)\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right)\\right]_0^H = \\frac{4q_0}{(2n-1)\\pi}$.\nThe solution for one-face drainage is:\n$$\np(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4q_0}{(2n-1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\n\nCase 2: Two-face drainage\nThe boundary conditions are $p(0,t)=0$ and $p(H,t)=0$.\nApplying to $Z(z)$:\n$Z(0) = B = 0$. So, $Z(z) = C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z(H) = C \\sin(\\lambda H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(\\lambda H) = 0$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n H = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{H}$.\nThe general solution is:\n$p(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition $p(z,0) = q_0$:\n$q_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right)$.\n$C_n = \\frac{2}{H} \\int_0^H q_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right) dz = \\frac{2q_0}{H} \\left[-\\frac{H}{n\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right]_0^H = \\frac{2q_0}{n\\pi}(1 - (-1)^n)$.\n$C_n$ is $0$ for even $n$ and $\\frac{4q_0}{n\\pi}$ for odd $n$. We can write the sum over odd integers by setting $n = 2m-1$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The solution for two-face drainage is:\n$$\np(z,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4q_0}{(2m-1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the settlement $u_z(0,t)$. Settlement is the total compression of the layer. Assuming the base at $z=H$ is fixed ($u_z(H,t)=0$) and displacement $u_z$ is positive upwards, the settlement at the surface is $S(t) = -u_z(0,t)$. It is calculated by integrating the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t)$ over the depth of the layer:\n$S(t) = \\int_0^H \\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) dz$.\nUsing the constitutive relation $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t) = m_v (q_0 - p(z,t))$, we have:\n$S(t) = \\int_0^H m_v (q_0 - p(z,t)) dz = m_v q_0 H - m_v \\int_0^H p(z,t) dz$.\nThe ultimate settlement, $S_{ult}$, occurs as $t \\to \\infty$, when $p(z,t) \\to 0$. Thus, $S_{ult} = m_v q_0 H$.\nThe settlement at time $t$ is $S(t) = S_{ult} - m_v \\int_0^H p(z,t) dz$.\n\nFor two-face drainage, we integrate the derived pore pressure solution:\n$\\int_0^H p(z,t) dz = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{4q_0}{(2m-1)\\pi} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\int_0^H \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{H}\\right) dz \\right]$.\nThe integral evaluates to $\\frac{2H}{(2m-1)\\pi}$.\nSo, $\\int_0^H p(z,t) dz = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{8q_0 H}{(2m-1)^2 \\pi^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe settlement for two-face drainage is:\n$S(t) = m_v q_0 H - m_v \\left( \\frac{8q_0 H}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\right)$.\n$S(t) = S_{ult} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\right]$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for the two-face drainage case with the given parameters:\n$H = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$q_0 = 150\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$m_v = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$c_v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$\n$t = 180\\,\\mathrm{days} = 180 \\times 24 \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s} = 15,552,000\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the ultimate settlement $S_{ult}$:\n$S_{ult} = m_v q_0 H = (2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the exponential term's argument. Let the dimensionless time factor be $T_H = \\frac{c_v t}{H^2}$.\n$T_H = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}) \\times (15,552,000\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{1.24416}{4} = 0.31104$.\nThe settlement expression is $S(t) = S_{ult} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-(2m-1)^2 \\pi^2 T_H \\right) \\right]$.\nThe series converges rapidly. We evaluate the first few terms of the sum:\nFor $m=1$: $\\frac{1}{1^2} \\exp(-\\pi^2 \\times 0.31104) = \\exp(-3.0699) \\approx 0.046426$.\nFor $m=2$: $\\frac{1}{3^2} \\exp(-9 \\pi^2 \\times 0.31104) = \\frac{1}{9} \\exp(-27.6291) \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{-13}$.\nSubsequent terms are negligible. We can approximate the sum with only the first term.\nThe degree of consolidation, $U$, is the term in the brackets:\n$U(t) \\approx 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (0.046426) \\approx 1 - 0.81057 \\times 0.046426 \\approx 1 - 0.037632 = 0.962368$.\nThe settlement at $t=180\\,\\mathrm{days}$ is:\n$S(180\\,\\mathrm{days}) = S_{ult} \\times U(t) \\approx 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 0.962368 = 7.21776\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the settlement is $7.218\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This represents the magnitude of the displacement of the top surface, $|u_z(0,t)|$. The displacement itself, $u_z(0,t)$, is $-7.218\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The problem requires the settlement value.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of soil mechanics (specifically, consolidation theory), is well-posed, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It presents a standard derivation and analysis task in computational geomechanics.\n\nThe task is to derive the one-dimensional ($1$D) consolidation equation, nondimensionalize it, and identify the resulting dimensionless time variable.\n\nThe starting point is the set of governing equations for transient flow in a porous medium. The conservation of mass for the pore fluid is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the fluid content per unit reference volume, $q$ is the Darcy flux in the vertical direction $z$, and $t$ is time.\n\nThe problem states that for $1$D consolidation, the complex poro-mechanical coupling can be simplified. Specifically, the change in fluid content $\\zeta$ can be directly related to the change in hydraulic head $h$ through a single storage coefficient, $S$. The problem specifies that this $S$ is the storage coefficient with respect to head. This simplification combines the effects of fluid compressibility, solid grain compressibility, and the change in void ratio due to changes in effective stress into one coefficient. The relationship is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial t} = S \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}\n$$\nIntegrating this, we can state the fluid content as $\\zeta = S h + \\zeta_0$, where $\\zeta_0$ is a constant of integration. For the purpose of the transient equation, only the rate of change matters.

We introduce dimensionless variables for space, time, and head. Let the characteristic length be the thickness of the soil layer, $H$. Let the characteristic head scale be $\\Delta h$. The dimensionless variables, which we denote with a subscript $D$, are:\n- Dimensionless coordinate: $z_D = \\frac{z}{H}$\n- Dimensionless head: $h_D = \\frac{h}{\\Delta h}$ (assuming we can set a reference base head to zero)\n- Dimensionless time: $t_D = \\frac{t}{\\tau_c}$, where $\\tau_c$ is a characteristic time scale to be determined.\n\nWe express the original variables and their derivatives in terms of the dimensionless ones:\n$z = H z_D \\implies \\partial z = H \\partial z_D$\n$h = \\Delta h h_D$\n$t = \\tau_c t_D \\implies \\partial t = \\tau_c \\partial t_D$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives in the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta h h_D)}{\\partial (\\tau_c t_D)} = \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\tau_c} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial t_D}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta h h_D)}{\\partial (H z_D)} = \\frac{\\Delta h}{H} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial z_D}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta h}{H} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial z_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (H z_D)} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta h}{H} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial z_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta h}{H^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h_D}{\\partial z_D^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the derived PDE, $\\partial h/\\partial t = D \\, \\partial^2 h/\\partial z^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta h}{\\tau_c} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial t_D} = D \\left(\\frac{\\Delta h}{H^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h_D}{\\partial z_D^2}\\right)\n$$\nWe can cancel the characteristic head scale $\\Delta h$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_c} \\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial t_D} = \\frac{D}{H^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h_D}{\\partial z_D^2}\n$$\nTo obtain a canonical dimensionless PDE, we group the physical constants.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h_D}{\\partial t_D} = \\left(\\frac{D \\tau_c}{H^2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 h_D}{\\partial z_D^2}\n$$\nFor the equation to be fully nondimensional, the coefficient multiplying the spatial derivative must be unity. This choice collapses the solutions for all geometrically similar problems onto a single curve. Thus, we set:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\tau_c}{H^2} = 1 \\implies \\tau_c = \\frac{H^2}{D}\n$$\nThis defines the characteristic time scale for diffusion over a length $H$. The dimensionless time variable, which we can call the Time Factor, $T_v$, is therefore:\n$$\nT_v = t_D = \\frac{t}{\\tau_c} = \\frac{t}{H^2 / D} = \\frac{D t}{H^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this expression in terms of the fundamental parameters $K$, $S$, $H$, and $t$. Substituting $D = K/S$:\n$$\nT_v = \\frac{(K/S) t}{H^2} = \\frac{K t}{S H^2}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the dimensionless time variable.\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the significance of this dimensionless time, $T_v$, for experimental design. The fact that the degree of consolidation (e.g., the percentage of total settlement that has occurred) depends only on $T_v$ forms the basis of physical modeling in geotechnics. For two problems (e.g., a small-scale laboratory test and a large-scale field site) involving the same soil, the soil properties $K$ and $S$ are identical. If we want to study the field behavior by observing the lab model, we can equate the Time Factors. Let the subscripts 'lab' and 'field' denote the laboratory and field scales, respectively. For the two systems to be at an equivalent stage of consolidation, we must have:\n$$\n(T_v)_{\\text{lab}} = (T_v)_{\\text{field}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{K t_{\\text{lab}}}{S H_{\\text{lab}}^2} = \\frac{K t_{\\text{field}}}{S H_{\\text{field}}^2}\n$$\nSince $K$ and $S$ are the same, this simplifies to the time-scaling law:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\text{lab}}}{H_{\\text{lab}}^2} = \\frac{t_{\\text{field}}}{H_{\\text{field}}^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad t_{\\text{field}} = t_{\\text{lab}} \\left(\\frac{H_{\\text{field}}}{H_{\\text{lab}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis relationship shows that consolidation time scales with the square of the drainage path length ($H$). This is critical for experimental design: it allows engineers to predict the very long time (often years or decades) required for consolidation of a thick clay layer in the field by performing an experiment on a thin specimen in the laboratory that takes only hours or days. For example, if the field layer is $100$ times thicker than the lab specimen, the field consolidation will take $100^2 = 10000$ times longer to reach the same degree of completion.",

It is well-posed, providing a clear objective and sufficient information for a unique, derivable solution. The language is objective and formal. The formulation is self-contained and consistent with standard practices in the field, even though the chosen equal-order element ($P_1-P_1$) is known to have limitations regarding numerical stability (not part of the question). The derivation requested is a fundamental and non-trivial exercise. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the element coupling matrix for a $2D$ linear triangular element in the context of Biot's poroelasticity theory, and an explanation of the reciprocity of the coupling terms.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Element Coupling Matrix**\n\nThe coupling between the solid deformation and the fluid mass balance arises from the divergence of the solid velocity contributing to the rate of change of fluid content. In the weak form of the fluid mass balance equation, this coupling appears as the term $\\int_{\\Omega^e} \\delta p \\, \\alpha \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_v \\, d\\Omega$, where $\\delta p$ is the pressure test function, $\\alpha$ is the Biot coefficient, $\\varepsilon_v$ is the volumetric strain, and the dot represents a time derivative. The Galerkin procedure discretizes this term spatially. Ignoring the time derivative for the derivation of the spatial matrix operator, we are interested in the term $\\int_{\\Omega^e} \\delta p \\, \\alpha \\, \\varepsilon_v \\, d\\Omega$.\n\nThe displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and pressure field $p$ are interpolated within the element using linear shape functions $N_i(x,y)$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{u}(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i(x,y) \\begin{pmatrix} u_i \\\\ v_i \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i(x,y) p_i $$\nThe volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_v$ is given by:\n$$ \\varepsilon_v = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} u_i + \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} v_i \\right) $$\nThis can be written in matrix form as $\\varepsilon_v = \\boldsymbol{B}_v \\boldsymbol{d}^e$, where $\\boldsymbol{d}^e = [u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, u_3, v_3]^T$ is the element nodal displacement vector and $\\boldsymbol{B}_v$ is the volumetric strain-displacement matrix:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{B}_v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor a linear triangular element, the shape functions $N_i$ are affine functions of coordinates, meaning their spatial derivatives are constant over the element.\n\nThe Galerkin method uses the shape functions themselves as test functions. For the pressure equation, the test function is $\\delta p = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} N_j(x,y) \\delta p_j$, where $\\delta p_j$ are arbitrary nodal variations. The contribution of the coupling term to the $j$-th discrete fluid mass balance equation (associated with node $j$) is:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega^e} N_j(x,y) \\, \\alpha \\, \\varepsilon_v \\, d\\Omega $$\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon_v = \\boldsymbol{B}_v \\boldsymbol{d}^e$ and noting that $\\alpha$ and the components of $\\boldsymbol{B}_v$ are constant within the element, we can write this contribution as:\n$$ \\left( \\alpha \\int_{\\Omega^e} N_j(x,y) \\, d\\Omega \\right) \\boldsymbol{B}_v \\boldsymbol{d}^e $$\nA standard property of linear triangular basis functions is that the integral of any basis function $N_j$ over the element area $A$ is $\\int_{\\Omega^e} N_j \\, d\\Omega = \\frac{A}{3}$. Therefore, the contribution to the $j$-th equation is $\\frac{\\alpha A}{3} \\boldsymbol{B}_v \\boldsymbol{d}^e$.\n\nThe total contribution to the system from this term is $(\\delta \\boldsymbol{p}^e)^T \\boldsymbol{Q}^e \\boldsymbol{d}^e$, where $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e$ is the $3 \\times 6$ element coupling matrix we seek. The $j$-th row of $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e$ is the vector of coefficients multiplying $\\boldsymbol{d}^e$ for the $j$-th equation. Thus, the $j$-th row is $\\frac{\\alpha A}{3} \\boldsymbol{B}_v$. Since this is true for all $j=1,2,3$, all rows of $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e$ are identical:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e = \\frac{\\alpha A}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{B}_v $$\nNow, we must express $\\boldsymbol{B}_v$ in terms of the nodal coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. The derivatives of the linear shape functions are given by $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} = \\frac{b_i}{2A}$ and $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} = \\frac{c_i}{2A}$, where $A$ is the element area and the coefficients $b_i$ and $c_i$ depend on the nodal coordinates as follows (for counterclockwise numbering):\n\\begin{align*} b_1 &= y_2 - y_3, \\quad &c_1 &= x_3 - x_2 \\\\ b_2 &= y_3 - y_1, \\quad &c_2 &= x_1 - x_3 \\\\ b_3 &= y_1 - y_2, \\quad &c_3 &= x_2 - x_1 \\end{align*}\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\boldsymbol{B}_v$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{B}_v = \\frac{1}{2A} \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e = \\frac{\\alpha A}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2A} \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\alpha}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nExpanding this outer product gives the explicit matrix:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e = \\frac{\\alpha}{6} \\begin{pmatrix}\nb_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3 \\\\\nb_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3 \\\\\nb_1 & c_1 & b_2 & c_2 & b_3 & c_3\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nSubstituting the coordinate expressions for $b_i$ and $c_i$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e = \\frac{\\alpha}{6} \\begin{pmatrix}\ny_2 - y_3 & x_3 - x_2 & y_3 - y_1 & x_1 - x_3 & y_1 - y_2 & x_2 - x_1 \\\\\ny_2 - y_3 & x_3 - x_2 & y_3 - y_1 & x_1 - x_3 & y_1 - y_2 & x_2 - x_1 \\\\\ny_2 - y_3 & x_3 - x_2 & y_3 - y_1 & x_1 - x_3 & y_1 - y_2 & x_2 - x_1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2) Reciprocity of Coupling Matrices**\n\nThe symmetry in the coupled formulation originates from the underlying physics, which can be expressed through a single energy functional or the principle of virtual work. The standard Galerkin procedure preserves this symmetry in the resulting discrete system.\n\nThe weak form of the mechanical equilibrium equation is derived from the principle of virtual work, $\\delta W_{int} = \\delta W_{ext}$. The internal virtual work includes the work done by the effective stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha p \\boldsymbol{m}$, where $\\boldsymbol{m}^T = [1 \\; 1 \\; 0]$ for $2D$ plane strain. The term coupling pressure to the mechanical equilibrium is:\n$$ \\delta W_p = - \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^T (\\alpha p \\boldsymbol{m}) d\\Omega = - \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha p \\, \\delta \\varepsilon_v \\, d\\Omega $$\nwhere $\\delta \\varepsilon_v$ is the virtual volumetric strain. Discretizing this term with $\\delta\\varepsilon_v = \\boldsymbol{B}_v \\delta\\boldsymbol{d}^e$ and $p = \\boldsymbol{N}_p \\boldsymbol{p}^e$ gives:\n$$ - \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha (\\boldsymbol{N}_p \\boldsymbol{p}^e) (\\boldsymbol{B}_v \\delta\\boldsymbol{d}^e) d\\Omega = -(\\delta\\boldsymbol{d}^e)^T \\left( \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{B}_v^T \\boldsymbol{N}_p d\\Omega \\right) \\boldsymbol{p}^e $$\nThe \"companion coupling matrix\" that appears in the mechanical equilibrium equation (as the coefficient of the nodal pressure vector $\\boldsymbol{p}^e$) is thus $\\boldsymbol{L}^e = - \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{B}_v^T \\boldsymbol{N}_p d\\Omega$. This is a $6 \\times 3$ matrix.\n\nThe coupling matrix $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e$ derived in Part 1 arose from the fluid mass balance equation and is given by $\\boldsymbol{Q}^e = \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{N}_p^T \\boldsymbol{B}_v d\\Omega$. Let us take its transpose:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{Q}^e)^T = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{N}_p^T \\boldsymbol{B}_v d\\Omega \\right)^T = \\int_{\\Omega^e} (\\alpha \\boldsymbol{N}_p^T \\boldsymbol{B}_v)^T d\\Omega $$\nUsing the matrix transpose property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ and noting that $\\alpha$ is a scalar:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{Q}^e)^T = \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{B}_v^T (\\boldsymbol{N}_p^T)^T d\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega^e} \\alpha \\boldsymbol{B}_v^T \\boldsymbol{N}_p d\\Omega $$\nComparing this with the expression for $\\boldsymbol{L}^e$, we see that $\\boldsymbol{L}^e = -(\\boldsymbol{Q}^e)^T$.\n\nThe semi-discrete system of equations has the general form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{K} & \\boldsymbol{L}^e \\\\ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e & \\boldsymbol{S} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{d}^e \\\\ \\boldsymbol{p}^e \\end{pmatrix} + \\dots = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{f} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{g} \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{K} & -(\\boldsymbol{Q}^e)^T \\\\ \\boldsymbol{Q}^e & \\boldsymbol{S} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{d}^e \\\\ \\boldsymbol{p}^e \\end{pmatrix} + \\dots = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{f} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{g} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe off-diagonal block of the system matrix is skew-symmetric. The fact that the problem statement claims the companion matrix *equals* the transpose implies a sign convention where the coupling term in the mechanical equilibrium is defined to absorb the negative sign. Regardless of convention, the fundamental reciprocity relationship, $\\boldsymbol{L}^e = -(\\boldsymbol{Q}^e)^T$, is a direct consequence of the fact that the Galerkin discretization of the operator pair ($\\nabla\\cdot$, $-\\alpha \\nabla$) preserves the adjoint relationship of the continuous operators. The use of the same interpolation space for trial and test functions (Bubnov-Galerkin) is essential for this property.",
