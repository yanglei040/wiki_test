            "problem": "Consider a saturated, homogeneous, isotropic clay layer of thickness $H$ subjected at time $t=0$ to a spatially uniform, instantaneous step increase in total vertical stress $q_0$ at the top surface $z=0$. The top surface is mechanically loaded but remains hydraulically drained, and the base $z=H$ is either hydraulically drained (two-face drainage) or hydraulically undrained with no-flow (one-face drainage). Assume small strains, one-dimensional vertical deformation, linear elastic compressibility of the skeleton with one-dimensional constrained compressibility $m_v$, and Darcy flow of pore fluid. In the framework of poromechanics, begin from the governing coupled field equations of the saturated porous medium (Biot consolidation), specifically: linear momentum balance for the mixture, linear elastic effective stress for the skeleton, mass conservation of fluid, and Darcy’s law. Under the stated assumptions, reduce the governing system to the scalar diffusion-type Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the excess pore pressure $p(z,t)$, and then apply separation of variables to derive the closed-form analytical solution $p(z,t)$ for:\n\n- One-face drainage: $p(0,t)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}(H,t)=0$.\n- Two-face drainage: $p(0,t)=0$ and $p(H,t)=0$.\n\nThe initial condition is $p(z,0)=q_0$ for $0 \\leq z \\leq H$. From the effective stress–strain relation in one-dimensional compression, deduce the time-dependent settlement at the loaded surface $u_z(0,t)$ as the depth integral of the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t)$, expressing $u_z(0,t)$ in terms of $p(z,t)$ for each drainage condition. Your derivation must start from the coupled field laws and proceed to the diffusion PDE, its eigenfunction expansion, determination of coefficients by orthogonality, and the resulting series for $p(z,t)$ and $u_z(0,t)$.\n\nFinally, for verification of a coupled finite element model, evaluate the two-face drainage settlement at a specified time using realistic parameters:\n- $H = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $q_0 = 150\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$,\n- $m_v = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$,\n- $c_v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ (coefficient of consolidation),\n- $t = 180\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nCompute the numerical value of $u_z(0,t)$ for the two-face drainage case. Express your final numerical answer in $\\mathrm{mm}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and solution of the one-dimensional consolidation equation, starting from the fundamental coupled field equations of poromechanics, and its application to a numerical example.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the excess pore pressure $p(z,t)$. The analysis is based on the following principles for a saturated porous medium undergoing one-dimensional vertical deformation.\n\n1.  Linear Momentum Balance (Equilibrium): For a quasi-static process where inertial forces are negligible, the total stress field must be in equilibrium. In one dimension (the $z$-direction), and neglecting body forces such as self-weight (as we are concerned with increments due to applied load), this is expressed as $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$. This implies that the total vertical stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is constant with depth. An instantaneous step increase in total vertical stress $q_0$ at the surface $z=0$ is transmitted throughout the depth of the layer. Thus, the change in total vertical stress is uniform: $\\Delta\\sigma_{zz}(z,t) = q_0$.\n\n2.  Effective Stress Principle: The total stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is supported by both the solid skeleton (effective stress $\\sigma'_{zz}$) and the pore fluid (pore pressure $p$). In terms of incremental stresses, Terzaghi's effective stress principle is $\\Delta\\sigma_{zz} = \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz} + p$, where $p$ is the excess pore pressure. At time $t=0$, the load $q_0$ is instantaneously applied to the saturated clay. Since the pore fluid is incompressible and drainage takes time, the entire load is initially carried by the pore fluid, so $p(z,0) = q_0$ and $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,0)=0$. For any time $t > 0$, we have $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t) = q_0 - p(z,t)$.\n\n3.  Constitutive Law for the Soil Skeleton: For one-dimensional compression, the incremental vertical strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is linearly proportional to the incremental effective vertical stress $\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}$ through the constrained compressibility $m_v$. This is expressed as $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{zz} = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}$. Since we start from a state of zero incremental stress and strain, $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t)$. Differentiating with respect to time gives the strain rate: $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = m_v \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma'_{zz})}{\\partial t}$. Substituting the effective stress relation, we get $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = m_v \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(q_0 - p(z,t)) = -m_v \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$.\n\n4.  Mass Conservation (Continuity) and Darcy's Law: The rate of volume change of the deforming porous medium (volumetric strain rate) must equal the divergence of the fluid flow velocity. In one dimension, the volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_V$ equals the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$. The continuity equation for the fluid is $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}$, where $v_z$ is the Darcy velocity of the pore fluid in the vertical direction. Darcy's law states that this velocity is proportional to the gradient of the excess pore pressure: $v_z = -\\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$, where $k_{perm}$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and $\\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water.\n\nCombining these equations, we substitute Darcy's law into the continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(-\\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$, assuming the soil is homogeneous ($k_{perm}$ is constant).\nEquating the two expressions for the strain rate $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t}$ gives $-m_v \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k_{perm}}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$.\nRearranging yields the one-dimensional consolidation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nwhere $c_v = \\frac{k_{perm}}{m_v \\gamma_w}$ is the coefficient of consolidation, which is assumed to be constant.\n\nNext, we solve this PDE using separation of variables. Let $p(z,t) = Z(z)T(t)$. Substituting into the PDE gives $Z(z)T'(t) = c_v Z''(z)T(t)$. Separating variables yields $\\frac{T'(t)}{c_v T(t)} = \\frac{Z''(z)}{Z(z)}$. Since the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side only on $z$, both must equal a constant, which we denote as $-\\lambda^2$. A negative constant is chosen to ensure a decaying solution in time, which is physically expected. This leads to two ordinary differential equations:\n$T'(t) + \\lambda^2 c_v T(t) = 0$, with solution $T(t) = A \\exp(-\\lambda^2 c_v t)$.\n$Z''(z) + \\lambda^2 Z(z) = 0$, with solution $Z(z) = B \\cos(\\lambda z) + C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n\nWe now apply the boundary conditions for the two specified drainage cases to determine the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ and the constants $B$ and $C$.\n\nCase 1: One-face drainage\nThe boundary conditions are $p(0,t)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}(H,t)=0$.\nApplying to $Z(z)$:\n$Z(0) = B\\cos(0) + C\\sin(0) = B = 0$. So, $Z(z) = C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z'(z) = C\\lambda \\cos(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z'(H) = C\\lambda \\cos(\\lambda H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0$), we require $\\cos(\\lambda H)=0$.\nThis condition is satisfied for eigenvalues $\\lambda_n H = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, $\\lambda_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}$.\nThe general solution is a superposition of all possible solutions:\n$p(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition $p(z,0) = q_0$:\n$q_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right)$.\nUsing the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, we find $C_n = \\frac{2}{H} \\int_0^H q_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) dz = \\frac{2q_0}{H} \\left[-\\frac{2H}{(2n-1)\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right)\\right]_0^H = \\frac{4q_0}{(2n-1)\\pi}$.\nThe solution for one-face drainage is:\n$$\np(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4q_0}{(2n-1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi z}{2H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2H}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\n\nCase 2: Two-face drainage\nThe boundary conditions are $p(0,t)=0$ and $p(H,t)=0$.\nApplying to $Z(z)$:\n$Z(0) = B = 0$. So, $Z(z) = C \\sin(\\lambda z)$.\n$Z(H) = C \\sin(\\lambda H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(\\lambda H) = 0$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n H = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{H}$.\nThe general solution is:\n$p(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition $p(z,0) = q_0$:\n$q_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right)$.\n$C_n = \\frac{2}{H} \\int_0^H q_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right) dz = \\frac{2q_0}{H} \\left[-\\frac{H}{n\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right]_0^H = \\frac{2q_0}{n\\pi}(1 - (-1)^n)$.\n$C_n$ is $0$ for even $n$ and $\\frac{4q_0}{n\\pi}$ for odd $n$. We can write the sum over odd integers by setting $n = 2m-1$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The solution for two-face drainage is:\n$$\np(z,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4q_0}{(2m-1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{H}\\right) \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the settlement $u_z(0,t)$. Settlement is the total compression of the layer. Assuming the base at $z=H$ is fixed ($u_z(H,t)=0$) and displacement $u_z$ is positive upwards, the settlement at the surface is $S(t) = -u_z(0,t)$. It is calculated by integrating the vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t)$ over the depth of the layer:\n$S(t) = \\int_0^H \\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) dz$.\nUsing the constitutive relation $\\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) = m_v \\Delta\\sigma'_{zz}(z,t) = m_v (q_0 - p(z,t))$, we have:\n$S(t) = \\int_0^H m_v (q_0 - p(z,t)) dz = m_v q_0 H - m_v \\int_0^H p(z,t) dz$.\nThe ultimate settlement, $S_{ult}$, occurs as $t \\to \\infty$, when $p(z,t) \\to 0$. Thus, $S_{ult} = m_v q_0 H$.\nThe settlement at time $t$ is $S(t) = S_{ult} - m_v \\int_0^H p(z,t) dz$.\n\nFor two-face drainage, we integrate the derived pore pressure solution:\n$\\int_0^H p(z,t) dz = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{4q_0}{(2m-1)\\pi} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\int_0^H \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{H}\\right) dz \\right]$.\nThe integral evaluates to $\\frac{2H}{(2m-1)\\pi}$.\nSo, $\\int_0^H p(z,t) dz = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{8q_0 H}{(2m-1)^2 \\pi^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe settlement for two-face drainage is:\n$S(t) = m_v q_0 H - m_v \\left( \\frac{8q_0 H}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\right)$.\n$S(t) = S_{ult} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-c_v \\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{H}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\right]$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for the two-face drainage case with the given parameters:\n$H = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$q_0 = 150\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$m_v = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$c_v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$\n$t = 180\\,\\mathrm{days} = 180 \\times 24 \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s} = 15,552,000\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the ultimate settlement $S_{ult}$:\n$S_{ult} = m_v q_0 H = (2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the exponential term's argument. Let the dimensionless time factor be $T_H = \\frac{c_v t}{H^2}$.\n$T_H = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}) \\times (15,552,000\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{1.24416}{4} = 0.31104$.\nThe settlement expression is $S(t) = S_{ult} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-(2m-1)^2 \\pi^2 T_H \\right) \\right]$.\nThe series converges rapidly. We evaluate the first few terms of the sum:\nFor $m=1$: $\\frac{1}{1^2} \\exp(-\\pi^2 \\times 0.31104) = \\exp(-3.0699) \\approx 0.046426$.\nFor $m=2$: $\\frac{1}{3^2} \\exp(-9 \\pi^2 \\times 0.31104) = \\frac{1}{9} \\exp(-27.6291) \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{-13}$.\nSubsequent terms are negligible. We can approximate the sum with only the first term.\nThe degree of consolidation, $U$, is the term in the brackets:\n$U(t) \\approx 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (0.046426) \\approx 1 - 0.81057 \\times 0.046426 \\approx 1 - 0.037632 = 0.962368$.\nThe settlement at $t=180\\,\\mathrm{days}$ is:\n$S(180\\,\\mathrm{days}) = S_{ult} \\times U(t) \\approx 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 0.962368 = 7.21776\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the settlement is $7.218\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

For $Q_1$–$P_0$ on an affine-mapped quadrilateral, the coupling integral $\\int_{\\Omega_e} \\alpha\\,p\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v}\\,{\\mathrm d}\\Omega$ over an element $\\Omega_e$ is exactly integrated by $1\\times 1$ Gauss quadrature, while the mechanical stiffness terms involving products of displacement gradients generally require at least $2\\times 2$ Gauss quadrature for exactness.**\n\n*   **Coupling Integral:** The integrand is $\\alpha \\, p \\, (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v})$.\n    *   $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n    *   $p$ is a $P_0$ function, so it is a constant (polynomial of degree $0$) on the element.\n    *   $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is a $Q_1$ function, so its divergence, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$, is a polynomial of degree at most $1$ in the parent coordinates.\n    *   The total integrand (including the constant Jacobian determinant) is a polynomial of degree at most $1$.\n    *   A $1 \\times 1$ Gauss quadrature rule is exact for polynomials up to degree $2(1) - 1 = 1$. Therefore, the coupling integral is exactly integrated.\n*   **Mechanical Stiffness Terms:** These terms, such as in $a(\\boldsymbol{u},\\boldsymbol{v})$, involve products like $(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u})(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v})$ or $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}):\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{v})$.\n    *   Both $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$ are polynomials of degree at most $1$. Their product is a polynomial of degree at most $2$.\n    *   To exactly integrate a polynomial of degree $2$, the quadrature rule must be exact up to degree $2$. A $1 \\times 1$ rule (exact up to degree $1$) is insufficient. A $2 \\times 2$ rule is exact up to degree $2(2) - 1 = 3$, which is sufficient. Thus, at least a $2 \\times 2$ rule is required for exactness.\n*   **Verdict:** Both claims in the statement are correct.\n\n**B. Selective reduced integration—using $1\\times 1$ Gauss points for the volumetric term $\\int_{\\Omega_e} \\lambda\\,(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u})(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v})\\,{\\mathrm d}\\Omega$ and $2\\times 2$ Gauss points for the deviatoric term $\\int_{\\Omega_e} 2\\mu\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}):\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{v})\\,{\\mathrm d}\\Omega$—can alleviate volumetric locking as $\\lambda/\\mu \\to \\infty$ without inducing hourglass modes in $Q_1$ elements.**\n\n*   **Volumetric Locking:** Volumetric locking in nearly incompressible materials arises from over-constraining the divergence field. Using full $2 \\times 2$ quadrature for the volumetric term imposes the incompressibility constraint at $4$ points within the element, which is too restrictive for the kinematics of a $Q_1$ element. Reducing the integration for this term to a single point ($1 \\times 1$) effectively weakens the constraint, a well-established technique to alleviate locking. This is the basis of the \"B-bar\" method.\n*   **Hourglass Modes:** Hourglass modes are spurious zero-energy deformation modes that can appear when integration is reduced too much. For the $Q_1$ element, these modes are primarily deviatoric (shear-like) and have zero strain at the element center. Fully reduced integration (i.e., $1 \\times 1$ for all terms) fails to detect the strain energy of these modes, leading to a singular stiffness matrix. However, the proposed selective reduced integration (SRI) scheme uses a $2 \\times 2$ rule for the deviatoric term. This rule accurately captures the strain energy of the hourglass modes, thereby controlling them and ensuring the stability of the element stiffness matrix (apart from rigid body modes).\n*   **Verdict:** The statement accurately describes the purpose and effect of selective reduced integration for $Q_1$ elements. It alleviates locking while maintaining stability. The statement is correct.\n\n**C. Using fully reduced integration ($1\\times 1$ on all mechanical terms) in $Q_1$ bilinear quadrilateral elements eliminates both volumetric locking and hourglass instabilities in plane strain.**\n\n*   **Volumetric locking:** As discussed for option B, reduced integration of the volumetric term alleviates locking. So, the first part of the claim is correct.\n*   **Hourglass instabilities:** As also discussed for option B, using $1 \\times 1$ integration for the deviatoric term *causes* hourglass instabilities because the strain energy associated with these modes is zero at the single integration point. The statement claims that this method *eliminates* hourglass instabilities, which is the opposite of the truth. Techniques like hourglass control/stabilization are required to use fully reduced integration, but the method itself does not eliminate the problem.\n*   **Verdict:** The statement is incorrect because fully reduced integration induces, rather than eliminates, hourglass instabilities.\n\n**D. The Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition for the $(\\boldsymbol{u},p)$ mixed formulation becomes satisfied by reduced integration; thus $Q_1$–$P_0$ is stable in the incompressible limit if one uses $1\\times 1$ quadrature for the coupling term $b(\\boldsymbol{v},p)$.**\n\n*   **LBB Stability of $Q_1$-$P_0$:** The $Q_1$-$P_0$ element pair is a classic example of an LBB-stable mixed finite element pair for Stokes/incompressible problems. It satisfies the condition with exact integration. It does not require any numerical tricks like reduced integration to achieve stability. The premise that the pair is unstable and \"becomes satisfied by reduced integration\" is false.\n*   **Integration of the Coupling Term:** As established in the analysis of option A, for an affine-mapped element, $1 \\times 1$ quadrature integrates the coupling term $b(\\boldsymbol{v},p)$ *exactly*. Therefore, using a $1 \\times 1$ rule is identical to using exact integration. It cannot change the stability properties of the element pair.\n*   **Verdict:** The statement is founded on a false premise. The $Q_1$-$P_0$ pair is inherently LBB-stable. Reduced integration is neither necessary nor the reason for its stability. The statement is incorrect.\n\n**E. In transient consolidation, under-integrating the storage term $m(p,q)$ to $1\\times 1$ cannot influence spurious pressure oscillations, because this term does not couple to displacement; observed oscillations must be attributed solely to the diffusion term $d(p,q)$.**\n\n*   **Effect of Under-integration:** For $P_0$ elements, the pressure basis functions have disjoint support. The storage matrix (often called the pressure mass matrix) derived from $m(p,q)$ is therefore naturally diagonal, regardless of the integration rule. Using a $1 \\times 1$ rule gives the same (exact) result as a higher-order rule for an affine element. So, for this specific element, \"under-integration\" has no effect on the matrix structure.\n*   **Cause of Oscillations:** The statement claims oscillations must be \"solely\" due to the diffusion term $d(p,q)$. This is an incorrect oversimplification. The transient behavior of a parabolic system like the pressure equation is governed by the interplay of the mass/storage matrix (from $m(p,q)$) and the stiffness/diffusion matrix (from $d(p,q)$). The properties of the mass matrix (e.g., consistent vs. lumped) are well-known to be critical in preventing or causing spurious oscillations in transient analyses.\n*   **Reasoning:** The provided reason, \"because this term does not couple to displacement,\" is a non-sequitur. The potential for oscillations in the pressure field is an issue within the time-dependent pressure equation itself, independent of its coupling to the mechanical field.\n*   **Verdict:** The statement presents flawed reasoning and an incorrect conclusion. The storage matrix is fundamentally important to the transient response, and attributing oscillations solely to the diffusion term is wrong. The statement is incorrect.",

The properties of the matrices, namely that the capacity matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}$ and the conductivity matrix $\\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}$ are symmetric and positive definite, are consistent with their physical meaning and with standard Finite Element Method (FEM) formulations for diffusion-type problems. The tasks involve a standard time discretization procedure (Backward Euler) and a modal stability analysis, which are fundamental techniques in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations. The problem is self-contained, factually sound, and unambiguously posed. The givens are sufficient for the required derivations. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nWe proceed with the two tasks outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we perform the time discretization of the semi-discrete mass balance equation using the Backward Euler (BE) method. The BE method is an implicit, first-order accurate time integration scheme. In this method, the system of ordinary differential equations is evaluated at the end of the time step, $t^{n+1} = t^{n} + \\Delta t$. The time derivatives of the nodal pressure vector, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{p}}$, and the nodal displacement vector, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}$, are approximated by a finite difference:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{p}}(t^{n+1}) \\approx \\frac{\\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{p}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}(t^{n+1}) \\approx \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{u}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe state variables and external forcing vectors are also evaluated at time $t^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{p}(t^{n+1}) = \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{r}_{p}(t^{n+1}) = \\boldsymbol{r}_{p}^{n+1}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the governing semi-discrete equation yields the fully discretized equation for the time step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\Delta t} \\right) + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\, \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} + \\boldsymbol{C}_{pu} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\Delta t} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{r}_{p}^{n+1}\n$$\nThis equation represents the algebraic system to be solved at each time step. The problem asks for the single-step algebraic residual equation. The residual is the amount by which the equation is not satisfied, and for a solution, it must be zero. Thus, the residual equation is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{p}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\Delta t} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} + \\boldsymbol{C}_{pu} \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\Delta t} - \\boldsymbol{r}_{p}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThis is the requested algebraic residual equation in terms of the increments $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{p}$, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}$, and the state $\\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1}$.\n\nSecond, we perform a modal stability analysis for the uncoupled diffusion subsystem. For this analysis, we set the coupling matrix $\\boldsymbol{C}_{pu} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ and the source/flux vector $\\boldsymbol{r}_{p} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The governing equation simplifies to the homogeneous diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}\\,\\dot{\\boldsymbol{p}} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}\\,\\boldsymbol{p} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nApplying the Backward Euler time discretization to this simplified system gives:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{p}^{n}}{\\Delta t} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to express $\\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1}$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{p}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n}\n$$\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\right) \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{p}^{n}\n$$\nThe stability of the scheme is determined by the spectral properties of the amplification matrix that maps $\\boldsymbol{p}^n$ to $\\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1}$. To find this, we perform a modal analysis. The pressure vector $\\boldsymbol{p}(t)$ is expressed as a linear combination of the generalized eigenvectors $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}$, which are the solutions to the generalized eigenproblem $\\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}=\\lambda_{i}\\,\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{p}^{n} = \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boldsymbol{p}^{n+1} = \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n+1} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\n$$\nwhere $a_{i}^{n}$ and $a_{i}^{n+1}$ are the scalar modal amplitudes at times $t^n$ and $t^{n+1}$, respectively. Substituting these expansions into the discretized equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\right) \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n+1} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\n$$\nThe eigenvectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i\\}$ form a basis. For symmetric positive definite matrices $\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}$ and $\\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}$, these eigenvectors are $\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}$-orthogonal, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. To isolate a single mode, we pre-multiply the equation by $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T}$ for some mode $j$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\right) \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n+1} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i} = \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\sum_{i} a_{i}^{n} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\n$$\nDue to orthogonality, all terms in the sums for which $i \\neq j$ vanish, leaving:\n$$\na_{j}^{n+1} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} + \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\right) \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} = a_{j}^{n} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\right) \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}\n$$\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n$$\na_{j}^{n+1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} + \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} a_{j}^{n} \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} \\right)\n$$\nFrom the definition of the generalized eigenproblem, we have $\\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} = \\lambda_{j}\\,\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}$. Pre-multiplying by $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T}$ gives $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T}\\boldsymbol{K}_{pp}^{flow}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} = \\lambda_{j}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T}\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}$. Substituting this into the previous equation:\n$$\na_{j}^{n+1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} + \\lambda_{j} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} a_{j}^{n} \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{M}_{pp}$ is positive definite and $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}$ is a non-zero eigenvector, the scalar term $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}^{T} \\boldsymbol{M}_{pp} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{j}$ is strictly positive and can be cancelled from both sides:\n$$\na_{j}^{n+1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} + \\lambda_{j} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} a_{j}^{n}\n$$\nThe scalar modal amplification factor, $G_j$, is the ratio of the modal amplitudes, $G_j = a_{j}^{n+1} / a_{j}^{n}$:\n$$\nG_j = \\frac{1/\\Delta t}{1/\\Delta t + \\lambda_{j}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda_{j} \\Delta t}\n$$\nFor a generic diffusion eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the amplification factor is:\n$$\nG(\\lambda, \\Delta t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\lambda \\Delta t}\n$$\nThis expression is the required closed-form analytic result. For unconditional stability, we require $|G| \\leq 1$ for all $\\Delta t > 0$. Given that $\\lambda_i \\geq 0$ and $\\Delta t > 0$, we have $1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\ge 1$, which ensures that $|G| \\le 1$. This confirms the well-known unconditional stability of the Backward Euler method for this class of problems.",
