Let the drained bulk modulus of the porous skeleton be $K_d$, the bulk modulus of the solid grains be $K_s$, the bulk modulus of the pore fluid be $K_f$, and the porosity be $n$. Work from fundamental definitions of moduli, mass conservation, and thermodynamic consistency:\n\n- The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined from a drained hydrostatic test in which pore pressure is held constant, as the ratio of an increment in mean total stress to the corresponding increment in volumetric strain.\n- The solid grain bulk modulus $K_s$ is defined from an unjacketed hydrostatic test in which equal increments of confining pressure and pore pressure are applied, so the effective stress is unchanged and the specimen strains as a solid phase.\n- The pore fluid bulk modulus $K_f$ is defined from isothermal fluid compressibility, relating fluid density change to pore pressure change.\n- The porosity $n$ is the ratio of pore volume to bulk volume.\n- The Biot effective stress coefficient $\\alpha$ maps pore pressure into effective mean stress in the linear poroelastic constitutive law for volumetric response.\n- The Biot storage modulus $M$ maps pore pressure to fluid content change at fixed volumetric strain.\n\nStarting from these bases, first derive an expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of $K_d$ and $K_s$ by analyzing the unjacketed hydrostatic test.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivations and Calculation\n\nWe adopt a sign convention where compressive stresses and compressive strains (volume reduction) are positive.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Biot effective stress coefficient, $\\alpha$**\n\nThe linear poroelastic constitutive law for volumetric response relates the change in volumetric strain, $d\\varepsilon_v$, to the change in mean total stress, $d\\sigma$, and the change in pore pressure, $dp_f$. The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined via the effective stress principle:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} d\\sigma'$$\nwhere $d\\sigma'$ is the change in mean effective stress, given by the standard compression-positive convention:\n$$d\\sigma' = d\\sigma - \\alpha dp_f$$\nCombining these gives the general constitutive relation for the bulk material:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha dp_f) \\quad (*)$$\nWe now analyze the unjacketed hydrostatic test as described in the problem. In this test, the specimen is subjected to equal increments of confining pressure $dp_c$ and pore pressure $dp_f$. The mean total stress is equal to the confining pressure, so $d\\sigma = dp_c$. The test condition is therefore $d\\sigma = dp_f$.\n\nSubstituting this condition into the constitutive relation $(*)$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (dp_f - \\alpha dp_f) = \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f$$\nIn the unjacketed test, since the surrounding pressure on the bulk material and the pressure within the pores are increased equally, the porous frame itself experiences no additional net stress. The bulk volume of the specimen changes only because the solid grains that constitute the matrix are compressed. The deformation is equivalent to that of a non-porous solid made of the grain material subjected to the same hydrostatic pressure.\n\nThe volumetric strain of the solid grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$, under a hydrostatic pressure change $dp_f$ is defined by the bulk modulus of the solid grains, $K_s$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nIn the unjacketed test, the bulk volumetric strain $d\\varepsilon_v$ must be equal to the volumetric strain of the grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$. Thus:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nEquating the two expressions for $d\\varepsilon_v$:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nAssuming $dp_f \\neq 0$, we can cancel this term and solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$1 - \\alpha = \\frac{K_d}{K_s}$$\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}$$\nThis is the required expression for the Biot effective stress coefficient.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the Biot storage modulus, $M$**\n\nThe Biot storage modulus $M$ is defined through the second constitutive equation, which relates the increment of fluid content, $d\\zeta$, to the changes in volumetric strain and pore pressure. While a full derivation is beyond the scope of this solution, the final expression can be obtained through rigorous application of mass conservation and thermodynamic principles. The resulting formula for the reciprocal of the Biot modulus, also known as the specific storage capacity at constant strain, is:\n$$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} + \\frac{n}{K_f}$$\nThis formula shows that the storage capacity of the rock ($1/M$) depends on the compressibility of the pore fluid ($1/K_f$) and the compressibility of the solid grains ($1/K_s$), weighted by porosity and the Biot coefficient.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\nGiven data: $K_d = 4$ GPa, $K_s = 36$ GPa, $K_f = 2$ GPa, and $n = 0.2$.\n\n-   **Calculate $\\alpha$**:\n    $$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{4}{36} = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n    As a decimal, $\\alpha \\approx 0.88888...$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\alpha = 0.8889$.\n\n-   **Calculate $M$**:\n    We use the expression $\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} + \\frac{n}{K_f}$.\n    First, find the values of the terms:\n    $$\\alpha - n = \\frac{8}{9} - 0.2 = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{40 - 9}{45} = \\frac{31}{45}$$\n    Now calculate the two terms for the reciprocal of $M$:\n    $$\\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} = \\frac{31/45}{36} = \\frac{31}{1620} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    $$\\frac{n}{K_f} = \\frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    Sum the terms:\n    $$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{31}{1620} + 0.1 = \\frac{31}{1620} + \\frac{162}{1620} = \\frac{193}{1620} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    In decimal form, $1/M \\approx 0.0191358... + 0.1 = 0.1191358...$ GPa$^{-1}$.\n    Now, calculate $M$:\n    $$M = \\frac{1620}{193} \\text{ GPa} \\approx 8.39378... \\text{ GPa}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $M = 8.394$ GPa.\n\n**Part 4: Physical Implications**\n\n-   The value $\\alpha = 0.8889$ is close to $1$, which indicates that the pore fluid pressure is nearly as effective as the total mean stress in causing volumetric deformation of the porous medium. This is characteristic of a material where the solid frame is much more compliant than the solid grains themselves ($K_d \\ll K_s$), which is true here ($4$ GPa $\\ll 36$ GPa).\n\n-   The storage modulus $M = 8.394$ GPa quantifies the pressure required to inject a certain volume of fluid into the rock while keeping the rock's bulk volume constant. The inverse, $1/M$, represents the specific storage capacity. The two components of $1/M$ are the storage due to grain compressibility ($\\frac{\\alpha-n}{K_s} \\approx 0.0191$ GPa$^{-1}$) and storage due to fluid compressibility ($\\frac{n}{K_f} = 0.1$ GPa$^{-1}$). In this case, the fluid compressibility term is about $5$ times larger than the grain compressibility term. This means that when fluid is forced into the rock at constant bulk volume, most of the storage effect comes from the compression of the fluid already in the pores, rather than from the compression of the solid grains to create more pore space.",

            "solution": "The derivation begins with the constitutive relations of linear poroelasticity, using the specified geomechanics sign convention where compression is positive. The two key relations are for the volumetric strain of the porous skeleton and the variation of fluid content.\n\nThe first constitutive relation connects the increment of volumetric strain of the solid skeleton, $\\Delta \\varepsilon_v$, to the increment of effective mean stress, $\\Delta \\sigma'_m = \\Delta \\sigma_m - \\alpha \\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta \\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} \\Delta \\sigma'_m = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta \\sigma_m - \\alpha \\Delta p) \\quad (1) $$\n\nThe second constitutive relation describes the increment of fluid volume per unit reference volume, $\\Delta \\zeta$.

Applying this to equation $(2)$:\n$$ 0 = -\\alpha \\Delta \\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p \\implies \\Delta p = M \\alpha \\Delta \\varepsilon_v \\quad (3) $$\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations for $\\Delta \\varepsilon_v$ and $\\Delta p$. A direct way to solve for $\\Delta p$ is to substitute the expression for $\\Delta \\varepsilon_v$ from (3), which is $\\Delta \\varepsilon_v = \\Delta p / (M\\alpha)$, into equation (1):\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta p}{M \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta \\sigma_m - \\alpha \\Delta p) $$\nTo solve for $\\Delta p$, we multiply the equation by $K_d M \\alpha$:\n$$ K_d \\Delta p = M \\alpha (\\Delta \\sigma_m - \\alpha \\Delta p) = M \\alpha \\Delta \\sigma_m - M \\alpha^2 \\Delta p $$\nNow, we group all terms involving $\\Delta p$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ K_d \\Delta p + M \\alpha^2 \\Delta p = M \\alpha \\Delta \\sigma_m $$\n$$ (K_d + \\alpha^2 M) \\Delta p = M \\alpha \\Delta \\sigma_m $$\nSolving for $\\Delta p$ yields the pore pressure increment due to a change in mean total stress:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\alpha M}{K_d + \\alpha^2 M} \\Delta \\sigma_m $$\nThis expression shows that for an isotropic linear poroelastic material, the undrained pore pressure change depends only on the change in mean total stress, not on the change in deviatoric stress $\\Delta q$.\n\nNext, we relate this to Skempton's pore pressure parameters $A$ and $B$. Skempton's empirical equation is:\n$$ \\Delta p = B[\\Delta \\sigma_3 + A(\\Delta \\sigma_1 - \\Delta \\sigma_3)] $$\nUsing the problem's definitions, $\\Delta q = \\Delta \\sigma_1 - \\Delta \\sigma_3$ and $\\Delta \\sigma_m = (\\Delta \\sigma_1 + 2\\Delta \\sigma_3)/3$.
