This quantity is proportional to the second-order plastic work rate and is central to evaluating material stability according to Drucker's postulate.\n\nFirst, we express the quantity of interest by applying the chain rule to the plastic potential $g(p,q)$, which is a function of the stress invariants $p$ and $q$. The gradient of the plastic potential with respect to the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q} \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nFrom the definition of the plastic potential $g(p,q) = q + p \\sin\\psi$, we compute its partial derivatives with respect to the invariants $p$ and $q$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} = \\sin\\psi \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these into the chain rule expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = (\\sin\\psi) \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + (1) \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nNow, we can write the target expression as:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\left( (\\sin\\psi) \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\right) = (\\sin\\psi) \\left( d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\right) + \\left( d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms in parentheses can be identified as the total differentials of the invariants $p$ and $q$. By definition, the increment of a scalar function of the stress tensor, say $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$, is $d\\phi = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\ndp = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\n$$\ndq = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nThis derivation simplifies the target expression significantly, showing that it is precisely the total differential of the plastic potential function, $dg$:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = (\\sin\\psi) dp + dq = dg\n$$\nThis intermediary result holds for any stress increment $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The problem, however, constrains the derivation to a plastic loading path, which means the stress state must satisfy the yield condition $f(p,q) = 0$ and remain on the yield surface. For rate-independent perfect plasticity, this is enforced by the plastic consistency condition, $df=0$.\n\nThe yield function is given as $f(p,q) = q + p \\sin\\phi - c \\cos\\phi$. We compute its total differential:\n$$\ndf = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} dp + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} dq = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of the yield function are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} = \\sin\\phi \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these into the consistency condition gives a relationship between the increments $dp$ and $dq$ during plastic flow:\n$$\n(\\sin\\phi) dp + (1) dq = 0 \\implies dq = -dp \\sin\\phi\n$$\nThis constraint is valid for any plastic yielding process. We now substitute this expression for $dq$ into our equation for $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\partial g/\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = (\\sin\\psi) dp + dq = (\\sin\\psi) dp + (-dp \\sin\\phi)\n$$\nFactoring out the mean stress increment $dp$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = dp (\\sin\\psi - \\sin\\phi)\n$$\nThis is the required expression. To establish that violation of Drucker's stability postulate can occur, we analyze the sign of this expression. Drucker's second postulate for stability requires $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p \\geq 0$. Given the flow rule $d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = d\\lambda \\, \\partial g/\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ with the plastic multiplier $d\\lambda  0$ for plastic loading, the stability condition reduces to $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\partial g/\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\geq 0$.\n\nThe problem specifies a non-associated material where $0 \\leq \\psi  \\phi$. For typical geomaterials, the friction angle $\\phi$ is in the range $(0, \\pi/2)$. In this range, the sine function is monotonically increasing. Therefore, $\\psi  \\phi$ implies $\\sin\\psi  \\sin\\phi$. Consequently, the term $(\\sin\\psi - \\sin\\phi)$ is strictly negative.\n\nThe sign of the entire expression $dp (\\sin\\psi - \\sin\\phi)$ is now opposite to the sign of the mean stress increment $dp$. An admissible plastic loading path can be constructed where the mean stress increases, i.e., $dp  0$. For such a path, the deviatoric stress increment must be $dq = -dp \\sin\\phi  0$ to satisfy consistency. This corresponds to a stress path moving along the yield surface towards higher confinement and lower deviatoric stress, which is physically plausible.\n\nFor any such loading path with $dp  0$, we have:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\underbrace{dp}_{0} \\underbrace{(\\sin\\psi - \\sin\\phi)}_{0}  0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for a non-associated material with $\\psi  \\phi$, plastic loading paths exist for which Drucker's stability postulate is violated. This potential for instability is a key feature of non-associated plasticity models used in geomechanics.\n\nThe final answer sought is the analytic expression derived for $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\partial g/\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ under the constraint $df=0$.",

The plastic dissipation becomes\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{cor}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\left( \\mathbb{C} : \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbb{C} : (\\Delta \\lambda \\boldsymbol{n}_G) \\right) : \\left( \\Delta \\lambda \\boldsymbol{n}_G \\right) = \\Delta \\lambda (\\mathbb{C}:\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) : \\boldsymbol{n}_G - \\Delta \\lambda^2 \\boldsymbol{n}_G : \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{n}_G.\n$$\nBecause $\\boldsymbol{n}_G : \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{n}_G  0$ for a positive-definite $\\mathbb{C}$ and the choice of $\\Delta \\lambda$ consistent with returning to the yield surface in the energy norm induced by $\\mathbb{C}^{-1}$, the corrected algorithm aligns the stress correction direction with the flow direction, suppressing the cross-terms that caused negative dissipation and producing $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{cor}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p \\ge 0$ for the provided cases.\n\nAlgorithmically, both updates reduce to solving a scalar nonlinear equation in $\\Delta \\lambda$ of the form $f(\\Delta \\lambda) = F(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\Delta \\lambda \\,\\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{n}) = 0$, with $\\boldsymbol{n}$ fixed as either $\\boldsymbol{n}_F$ or $\\boldsymbol{n}_G$. A bracketing method is used: starting from $\\Delta \\lambda = 0$ with $f(0) = F(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{trial}})  0$, we seek a right bracket $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\mathrm{right}}$ such that $f(\\Delta \\lambda_{\\mathrm{right}}) \\le 0$ and then bisect until convergence. An initial estimate $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\mathrm{est}} = \\frac{F(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{trial}})}{\\boldsymbol{n} : \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{n}}$ provides scale, and doubling ensues until a valid bracket is found or a safety cap is reached. Once $\\Delta \\lambda$ is determined, all required tensors and the double contraction $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$ are computed for both algorithms.\n\nFor the test suite, the friction-dominated states with strong non-association in test case $1$ and moderate non-association in test case $2$ emphasize the mismatch between $\\boldsymbol{n}_F$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_G$, often producing $d\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{inc}} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p  0$ under the inconsistent scheme. In test case $3$, with $\\psi = \\phi$, the normals coincide $\\boldsymbol{n}_G = \\boldsymbol{n}_F$ and the inconsistency disappears, leading to matching and non-negative dissipation values. The single-line output requested compiles these dissipation values for all cases in Pascals.",
