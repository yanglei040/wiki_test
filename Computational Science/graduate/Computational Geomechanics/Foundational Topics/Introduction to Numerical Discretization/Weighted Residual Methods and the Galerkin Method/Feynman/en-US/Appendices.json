The number of hourglass modes is $5 - 3 = 2$.\n\n**A. Correct.** Based on the analysis above, the reduced-integration stiffness matrix has rank 3. This leads to a 5-dimensional null space. After accounting for the 3 rigid-body modes, there are exactly $5 - 3 = 2$ linearly independent spurious zero-energy modes (hourglass modes).\n\n**B. Incorrect.** Hourglassing is a characteristic artifact of using one-point integration on $Q_1$ elements, regardless of whether the element is a parallelogram (affine mapping) or has a more general shape. An affine map does not eliminate the modes. Furthermore, the strain field in a $Q_1$ element is generally linear, not constant, so one-point integration is not exact for the stiffness matrix even on an affine element.\n\n**C. Correct.** The hourglass modes correspond to nodal displacement patterns that produce zero strain at the integration point. The patterns described, where nodal displacements alternate signs around the element (e.g., $u_x$ proportional to $[+1, -1, +1, -1]$), are the classic hourglass shapes. A mathematical check confirms that for these displacement patterns, all components of the strain tensor are zero at the element center $(\\xi, \\eta)=(0,0)$, because they depend on sums of shape function derivatives that cancel out for this pattern. These two modes (one in $u_x$, one in $u_y$) are linearly independent and are not rigid-body motions.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** One-point integration is exact for integrands that are constant. The method can perfectly represent and compute the energy of any constant strain field. The issue is with non-constant strain fields. Hourglass modes are specific non-constant deformation fields whose corresponding strains happen to be zero at the element center, causing the one-point integration scheme to incorrectly calculate their strain energy as zero.\n\n**E. Correct.** This statement accurately identifies the mathematical origin of the rank deficiency. The stiffness matrix is formed by mapping the 8-dimensional space of nodal displacements to the 3-dimensional space of plane strains at a single point. This mapping, represented by the $3 \\times 8$ matrix $\\boldsymbol{B}(0,0)$, can have a rank of at most 3. A stable element requires a rank of $8 - 3 = 5$. The inherent rank deficiency from $5$ to $3$ is precisely what allows for the existence of the $2$ non-rigid zero-energy (hourglass) modes.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, C, and E.",
