## Introduction
The conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy are the pillars upon which our understanding of the physical world is built. In the field of [computational geomechanics](@entry_id:747617), these principles are not just theoretical constructs but the essential tools for predicting the complex behavior of [geomaterials](@entry_id:749838) like soils and rocks. A significant challenge lies in translating these universal laws from the idealized single-phase continuum to the reality of multiphase, porous media subjected to coupled mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes. This article bridges that gap by providing a rigorous and comprehensive journey from fundamental theory to advanced application.

The following chapters will guide you through this complex landscape. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will derive the conservation laws from first principles, starting with a single-phase continuum and extending the framework to multiphase porous media, while also introducing thermodynamic constraints and advanced micropolar models. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how these laws are applied to solve real-world problems in [poromechanics](@entry_id:175398), [reactive transport](@entry_id:754113), and [wave propagation](@entry_id:144063), highlighting their role in building sophisticated [multiphysics](@entry_id:164478) simulations. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will solidify your understanding through targeted exercises that address the derivation, implementation, and numerical challenges associated with these fundamental laws.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter establishes the fundamental principles governing the mechanical and thermal behavior of continua, with a specific focus on their application to [geomaterials](@entry_id:749838). We will begin by reviewing the essential kinematic concepts and transport theorems that form the mathematical bedrock for all conservation laws. Subsequently, we will formulate the local balance laws for mass, momentum, and energy for a single-phase continuum. Building upon this foundation, we will then extend these principles to multiphase [porous media](@entry_id:154591), a model central to [geomechanics](@entry_id:175967). Finally, we will explore the thermodynamic constraints on material behavior and introduce an enhanced continuum theory for modeling phenomena beyond the scope of classical models.

### Fundamental Kinematics and the Transport Theorem

To describe the motion and deformation of a body, we employ two principal frameworks: the material (or Lagrangian) description and the spatial (or Eulerian) description. The **material description** tracks properties associated with individual material particles, which are labeled by their position $\mathbf{X}$ in a fixed reference configuration. A generic field in this description is denoted $\Phi(\mathbf{X}, t)$. In contrast, the **spatial description** observes properties at fixed points in space, $\mathbf{x}$, at a given time $t$. A field in this description is denoted $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$. The link between these two frameworks is the **motion map**, $\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\chi}(\mathbf{X}, t)$, which gives the current position $\mathbf{x}$ of the particle that was at $\mathbf{X}$ at time $t=0$. The relationship between the field descriptions is therefore $\Phi(\mathbf{X}, t) = \phi(\boldsymbol{\chi}(\mathbf{X}, t), t)$ .

The velocity of a material particle is the [material time derivative](@entry_id:190892) of its position, $\mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \partial \boldsymbol{\chi} / \partial t$. The rate of change of a property $\phi$ as experienced by a moving particle is given by the **[material time derivative](@entry_id:190892)**, denoted $D\phi/Dt$ or $\dot{\phi}$. Using the [chain rule](@entry_id:147422), this can be expressed in terms of spatial derivatives:
$ \frac{D\phi}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \phi $
Here, $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ is the local rate of change at a fixed point, and $\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \phi$ is the convective rate of change due to the particle's motion through a spatially varying field .

The derivation of [local conservation](@entry_id:751393) laws from global statements applied to a finite region of space relies on the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)**. This theorem relates the rate of change of a total quantity within a time-dependent control volume $\mathcal{V}(t)$ to fluxes across its boundary $\partial\mathcal{V}(t)$ and sources within it. Let $\psi(\mathbf{x}, t)$ be an arbitrary intensive property (per unit volume), and let the boundary of the control volume move with a velocity $\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{x}, t)$. The RTT states:
$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\mathcal{V}(t)} \psi \, dV = \int_{\mathcal{V}(t)} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} \, dV + \int_{\partial\mathcal{V}(t)} \psi \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS $
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary. The first term on the right is the rate of change due to local variations within the volume, and the second is the rate of change due to the motion of the boundary itself.

### Conservation Laws for a Single-Phase Continuum

We first formulate the balance laws for a classical single-phase Cauchy continuum, which serves as a building block for more complex models.

#### Conservation of Mass

The principle of [mass conservation](@entry_id:204015) states that the mass of a material volume remains constant in the absence of sources or sinks. Applying the RTT to the mass density $\rho$ in a material [control volume](@entry_id:143882) (where $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{v}$) and recognizing that the total mass does not change for that volume, one can derive the local (Eulerian) form of the [mass balance equation](@entry_id:178786):
$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0 $
This equation is also known as the [continuity equation](@entry_id:145242). The first term represents the local accumulation of mass, and the second term, the divergence of the mass flux $\rho \mathbf{v}$, represents the net outflow of mass from a differential volume element.

#### Balance of Linear Momentum

Newton's second law, applied to a material volume, states that the rate of change of the body's [total linear momentum](@entry_id:173071) equals the sum of all external forces. These forces consist of body forces $\mathbf{b}$ (acting on the volume, such as gravity) and [surface forces](@entry_id:188034) or tractions $\mathbf{t}$ (acting on the boundary). The **Cauchy stress tensor** $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is introduced to relate the [traction vector](@entry_id:189429) to the surface orientation via the [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) $\mathbf{n}$, as $\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{n}) = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n}$ (or $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{n}$, which are equivalent if $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is symmetric). A common sign convention in mechanics, which we adopt here unless stated otherwise, is that positive normal components of $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ represent tension. Applying the integral momentum balance to an arbitrary volume and using the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271) to convert the [surface integral](@entry_id:275394) of tractions into a volume integral of the [divergence of stress](@entry_id:185633) leads to the local form, known as **Cauchy's first law of motion** :
$ \rho \dot{\mathbf{v}} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \rho \mathbf{b} $
Here, $\rho\dot{\mathbf{v}}$ is the inertial force per unit volume (with $\dot{\mathbf{v}}$ being the [material acceleration](@entry_id:270992)), $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the internal force arising from stress gradients, and $\rho\mathbf{b}$ is the [body force](@entry_id:184443) per unit volume.

#### Balance of Angular Momentum

The [balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848), in the absence of body couples or couple-stresses, requires that the rate of change of angular momentum be balanced by the moment of the external forces. For a classical continuum, this principle leads to a crucial property of the Cauchy stress tensor: it must be symmetric.
$ \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathsf{T}} $
This symmetry condition reduces the number of independent components of the stress tensor from nine to six. We will revisit this balance later when we consider materials where this assumption is relaxed.

#### Balance of Energy

The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation. The total energy of a body is the sum of its kinetic energy and its internal energy. The rate of change of the total energy of a material volume equals the rate at which work is done on the body by external forces plus the rate at which heat is supplied to it. The local form of the [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) is:
$ \rho \dot{e} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D} - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + \rho r $
where $e$ is the specific internal energy (per unit mass), $\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D}$ is the **[stress power](@entry_id:182907)** per unit volume (work done by stresses on the deformation rate $\mathbf{D} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\mathbf{v} + \nabla\mathbf{v}^{\mathsf{T}})$), $\mathbf{q}$ is the heat [flux vector](@entry_id:273577), and $r$ is a volumetric heat source per unit mass.

To illustrate the global application of this law, consider a one-dimensional bar subject to tensile tractions $t_N$ at its ends, a steady [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) $v(x)$, and an internal heat source $r(x)$. Let us calculate the rate of change of its total internal energy, $dE_{\mathrm{int}}/dt$. The global [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) states that the rate of change of total energy (internal $E_{\mathrm{int}}$ plus kinetic $E_{\mathrm{kin}}$) equals the power of external forces $\mathcal{P}_{\text{ext}}$ plus the net heat supply $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{net}}$.
$ \frac{dE_{\mathrm{int}}}{dt} + \frac{dE_{\mathrm{kin}}}{dt} = \mathcal{P}_{\text{ext}} + \mathcal{Q}_{\text{net}} $
If inertia is negligible, $dE_{\mathrm{kin}}/dt \approx 0$. The external power $\mathcal{P}_{\text{ext}}$ is the work done by the boundary tractions, $\int_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathbf{v} \, dS$. The net heat supply $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{net}}$ is the sum of heat conducted across the boundary, $-\int_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS$, and heat generated internally, $\int_{\Omega} \rho r \, dV$. For the specific bar described in , with adiabatic boundaries ($\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$) and no body forces, the rate of change of internal energy simplifies to the sum of the power supplied by the end traction and the total power from the internal heat source: $dE_{\mathrm{int}}/dt = t_N v(L) A + \int_{0}^{L} r(x) A \, dx$. This example demonstrates how each physical process contributes to the overall energy balance of the system.

#### The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics places a fundamental constraint on the direction of natural processes by positing that the total entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease. For a continuum, this is expressed locally as the **Clausius-Duhem inequality**, which states that the rate of entropy production must be non-negative. By combining the local [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) with the local entropy balance, we can derive a powerful form of this inequality in terms of the **Helmholtz free energy** $\psi = e - T\eta$, where $T$ is the [absolute temperature](@entry_id:144687) and $\eta$ is the specific entropy . The derivation yields:
$ \rho \dot{\psi} + \rho \eta \dot{T} \le \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D} - \frac{1}{T}\mathbf{q}\cdot \nabla T $
This inequality is central to [constitutive modeling](@entry_id:183370). It states that the power supplied by stresses and heat flow must be sufficient to account for the energy stored in the material (as represented by the rate of change of free energy) and any changes related to temperature variations. Any excess power is dissipated, primarily as heat. The term $-\frac{1}{T}\mathbf{q}\cdot\nabla T$ represents the dissipation due to [heat conduction](@entry_id:143509) (which must be non-negative, implying heat flows from hot to cold regions), and the remaining part of the inequality constrains the dissipation from mechanical processes.

### Application to Multiphase Porous Media

Geomaterials are typically multiphase systems, most commonly a solid skeleton saturated with one or more fluids. Modeling such systems requires extending the single-phase balance laws to each constituent.

#### Kinematics and Control Volume Choices

In a multiphase medium, each phase $\alpha$ (e.g., solid $s$, fluid $f$) has its own [volume fraction](@entry_id:756566) $n_{\alpha}$ (with porosity $\phi = n_f$), partial density $\rho_{\alpha} = n_{\alpha}\hat{\rho}_{\alpha}$ (where $\hat{\rho}_{\alpha}$ is the intrinsic or true density), and [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) $\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}$.

The choice of [control volume](@entry_id:143882) is critical for formulating balance laws .
- A **fixed spatial (Eulerian) [control volume](@entry_id:143882)** ($\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{0}$) is the simplest choice, but requires accounting for the flux of all moving phases across its fixed boundaries .
- A **material [control volume](@entry_id:143882) attached to a phase $\alpha$** ($\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}$) moves and deforms with that phase. For this choice, the advective flux of phase $\alpha$ across the boundary is, by definition, zero. This is the most natural framework for tracking the mass of a specific material body .
- A control volume attached to one phase (e.g., the solid, $\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{v}^s$) can be used to study the other phase (e.g., the fluid). The advective flux of the fluid across this moving boundary is then governed by the **relative velocity**, $\mathbf{v}^f - \mathbf{v}^s$ . This [relative motion](@entry_id:169798) is the seepage flow, a cornerstone of [poromechanics](@entry_id:175398).

#### Conservation of Mass in Porous Media

Applying the principle of [mass conservation](@entry_id:204015) to each phase in a fixed [control volume](@entry_id:143882), we arrive at a set of coupled continuity equations. For a solid (s) and fluid (f) phase, these are :
$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}((1-\phi)\rho_s) + \nabla \cdot ((1-\phi)\rho_s \mathbf{v}^s) = m_s $
$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho_f) + \nabla \cdot (\phi\rho_f \mathbf{v}^f) = m_f $
Here, $m_s$ and $m_f$ are volumetric mass source terms. These terms can represent [interphase](@entry_id:157879) mass exchange, such as mineral dissolution (mass transfer from solid to fluid) or precipitation, as well as external injection or withdrawal of a phase. If dissolution occurs at a rate $\gamma$ (mass per unit volume per time) and fluid is injected at a rate $r_{\text{ext}}$, the source terms become $m_s = -\gamma$ and $m_f = \gamma + r_{\text{ext}}$. The total mass source is $m_s + m_f = r_{\text{ext}}$, which is zero for a closed system .

#### Conservation of Momentum in Porous Media: From Stokes Flow to Darcy's Law

Formulating a momentum balance for each phase is complicated by the need to model the interaction forces (drag, [buoyancy](@entry_id:138985)) at the fluid-solid interfaces. A more practical approach is to develop a macroscopic law by averaging the microscopic behavior over a Representative Elementary Volume (REV).

Consider slow, steady, incompressible fluid flow at the pore scale, which is governed by the **Stokes equations**. By performing a formal volume averaging of these equations, one can derive a macroscopic relationship between the average fluid flux and the average driving forces. This procedure is contingent on the **assumption of [scale separation](@entry_id:152215)**, meaning the pore-scale dimension $\ell$ is much smaller than the macroscopic length scale $L$ over which averaged properties vary ($\ell/L \ll 1$) . The averaging process reveals that the average [viscous drag](@entry_id:271349) exerted by the solid on the fluid manifests as a macroscopic resistance to flow. The resulting macroscopic law is **Darcy's Law**:
$ \mathbf{q} = -\frac{\mathbf{K}}{\mu} (\nabla p - \rho_f \mathbf{g}) $
Here, $\mathbf{q} = \phi(\mathbf{v}^f - \mathbf{v}^s)$ is the Darcy velocity or specific discharge, $\mathbf{K}$ is the **permeability tensor** (which depends on the pore geometry), $\mu$ is the [fluid viscosity](@entry_id:261198), $p$ is the macroscopic pore pressure, and $(\nabla p - \rho_f \mathbf{g})$ is the driving force including the hydraulic gradient and gravity. The permeability tensor $\mathbf{K}$ is determined by solving a "cell problem" on the periodic unit cell of the microstructure .

### Thermodynamic Frameworks for Poroelasticity

The behavior of the solid skeleton is coupled to that of the pore fluid. **Biot's theory of [poroelasticity](@entry_id:174851)** provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for describing this coupling in elastic media. A central concept is the **[principle of effective stress](@entry_id:197987)**, which partitions the total stress acting on the mixture into a part carried by the solid skeleton and a part supported by the pore fluid. Adopting a sign convention where compression is positive, the total Cauchy stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is related to the **[effective stress](@entry_id:198048)** $\boldsymbol{\sigma}'$ and the pore pressure $p$ by:
$ \boldsymbol{\sigma}' = \boldsymbol{\sigma} - b p \mathbf{I} $
where $b$ is the Biot coefficient and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. The effective stress is the stress that governs the deformation of the solid skeleton.

The [thermodynamic consistency](@entry_id:138886) of this framework can be established by examining the stored energy of the system. For an isothermal, reversible process, the rate of change of the Helmholtz free energy per unit volume, $\dot{\psi}$, represents the rate of stored energy. For a poroelastic material, the state is determined by the strain of the skeleton, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$, and the variation of fluid content, $\zeta$. The rate of energy storage is thus $\dot{\psi} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}':\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} + p \dot{\zeta}$. This reveals the fundamental **power-conjugate pairs**: $(\boldsymbol{\sigma}', \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}})$ and $(p, \dot{\zeta})$ . These pairs dictate that the [effective stress](@entry_id:198048) does work on the skeleton's rate of deformation, and the pore pressure does work on the rate of change of fluid content. This provides a rigorous basis for formulating the [constitutive laws](@entry_id:178936) that relate these "forces" ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}', p$) to their conjugate "displacements" ($\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, \zeta$).

### Beyond the Classical Continuum: Micropolar Models

The classical Cauchy continuum model assumes that material interactions are fully described by force-tractions and that the stress tensor is symmetric. This model is inadequate for materials where the underlying [microstructure](@entry_id:148601) has a characteristic length that influences the macroscopic response, or where local rotations of micro-constituents are kinematically significant. Granular materials, like dense sand, are a prime example. In laboratory tests, these materials often develop **[shear bands](@entry_id:183352)** with a finite thickness related to the grain size. Classical plasticity models fail to predict this finite thickness, exhibiting a [pathological mesh dependence](@entry_id:183356) in numerical simulations where the shear band narrows to the size of a single element .

To overcome this limitation, enriched continuum theories can be employed. The **Cosserat (or micropolar) continuum** is one such theory. It enriches the [kinematics](@entry_id:173318) by introducing an independent [microrotation](@entry_id:184355) field, $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, in addition to the standard translation field. The [statics](@entry_id:165270) are enriched by introducing a **[couple-stress](@entry_id:747952) tensor**, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, which is energetically conjugate to the gradient of [microrotation](@entry_id:184355). The existence of couples at the micro-scale (e.g., from [rolling resistance](@entry_id:754415) between grains) provides a physical basis for this enrichment .

The most significant consequence of the Cosserat theory lies in the **[balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848)**. With the inclusion of couple-stresses and body couples, this balance no longer reduces to the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor. Instead, it relates the skew-symmetric part of the stress tensor to the divergence of the [couple-stress](@entry_id:747952). For quasi-static conditions and neglecting micro-inertial effects, the local balance becomes :
$ \varepsilon_{ijk} \sigma_{jk} + \mu_{ij,j} + c_i = 0 $
where $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol, $\mu_{ij,j}$ is the divergence of the [couple-stress](@entry_id:747952) tensor, and $c_i$ is the body couple. This equation demonstrates that stress asymmetry is balanced by couple-stresses. In dynamic situations, a micro-inertial term is added to the balance:
$ \varepsilon_{ijk} \sigma_{jk} + \mu_{ij,j} + c_i = \rho j_{ij} \dot{\omega}_j $
where $j_{ij}$ is the micro-[inertia tensor](@entry_id:178098) . Importantly, the [balance of linear momentum](@entry_id:193575) retains its classical form, $\rho \dot{v}_i = \sigma_{ji,j} + b_i$. The introduction of couple-stresses does not add a force term to this equation. By incorporating gradients of the internal [microrotation](@entry_id:184355) into the [constitutive laws](@entry_id:178936), the Cosserat model introduces an internal length scale, allowing it to regularize solutions and realistically capture phenomena like finite shear band thickness.
