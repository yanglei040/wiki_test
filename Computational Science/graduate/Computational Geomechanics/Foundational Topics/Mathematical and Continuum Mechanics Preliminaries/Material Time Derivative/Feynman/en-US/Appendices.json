While often expressed in the compact form $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla$, its true power and generality are revealed when applying it from first principles in different coordinate systems. This exercise  challenges you to derive the material derivative in spherical coordinates for a radial flow problem, a common scenario in geomechanics, reinforcing the connection between the derivative's definition, the chain rule, and the kinematics of the flow.",

Let $\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)$ be a scalar material property of the pore fluid (e.g., a dissolved tracer concentration) that is transported with the fluid.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in continuum mechanics, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard derivation exercise concerning the material time derivative in a specific curvilinear coordinate system under symmetry constraints. I will proceed with the solution by addressing the three tasks in sequence.\n\nThe first task is to derive a general expression for the material (or substantial) time derivative, $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$, in spherical coordinates. The definition is given as the total time derivative of a scalar field $\\phi$ following a material particle trajectory $\\mathbf{x}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} \\equiv \\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\phi(\\mathbf{x}(t),t)\n$$\nIn spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\varphi)$, the position of a particle is described by functions of time, $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\leftrightarrow \\big(r(t), \\theta(t), \\varphi(t)\\big)$. The scalar field $\\phi$ is generally a function of these coordinates and time, $\\phi = \\phi(r, \\theta, \\varphi, t)$. To find the total derivative of $\\phi\\big(r(t), \\theta(t), \\varphi(t), t\\big)$ with respect to time $t$, we apply the multivariate chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}\\frac{dt}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\frac{dr}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\varphi}\\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}\n$$\nGiven that $\\frac{dt}{dt}=1$, and using the dot notation for the time derivatives of the coordinates, $\\dot{r} \\equiv \\frac{dr}{dt}$, $\\dot{\\theta} \\equiv \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, and $\\dot{\\varphi} \\equiv \\frac{d\\varphi}{dt}$, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\dot{r}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} + \\dot{\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\varphi}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the material derivative in spherical coordinates, which completes the first task.\n\nThe second task requires specializing this expression for the given spherically symmetric setting with purely radial flow. The fluid velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is, by definition, the time derivative of the particle's position vector, $\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}$. In spherical coordinates, the velocity vector is related to the coordinate time rates by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = \\dot{r}\\,\\mathbf{e}_{r} + (r\\dot{\\theta})\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + (r\\sin\\theta\\,\\dot{\\varphi})\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{e}_{r}$, $\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$, and $\\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}$ are the orthonormal basis vectors. The problem states that the flow is purely radial, given by $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = v_{r}(r,t)\\mathbf{e}_{r}$. To kinematically satisfy this condition, we must equate the components of the general velocity expression with the given one:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Radial component: $\\dot{r} = v_{r}(r,t)$.\n    \\item Polar component: $r\\dot{\\theta} = 0$.\n    \\item Azimuthal component: $r\\sin\\theta\\,\\dot{\\varphi} = 0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor a particle not located at the origin ($r  0$), the condition $r\\dot{\\theta} = 0$ implies that $\\dot{\\theta} = 0$. For a particle not on the polar axis ($z$-axis, where $\\sin\\theta = 0$), the condition $r\\sin\\theta\\,\\dot{\\varphi} = 0$ implies that $\\dot{\\varphi} = 0$. Thus, a purely radial flow kinematically requires that the angular coordinates of a moving fluid particle remain constant, so their time rates of change, $\\dot{\\theta}$ and $\\dot{\\varphi}$, are zero.\n\nFurthermore, the scalar field $\\phi$ is also spherically symmetric, $\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\phi(r,t)$, which means it is independent of $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$. Consequently, its partial derivatives with respect to the angular coordinates vanish: $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\theta} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\varphi} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the kinematic results $\\dot{r} = v_{r}$, $\\dot{\\theta} = 0$, and $\\dot{\\varphi} = 0$ into the general expression for $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v_{r}(r,t)\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r} + (0)\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\theta} + (0)\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\varphi}\n$$\nThe expression simplifies to the required closed form:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v_{r}(r,t)\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\n$$\n\nThe third task is to show that this result is equivalent in form to the one-dimensional Cartesian material derivative using the provided mappings: $s=r$, $u(s,t)=v_{r}(r,t)$, and $\\psi(s,t)=\\phi(r,t)$. The material derivative of a scalar field $\\psi(s,t)$ in a one-dimensional Cartesian system with coordinate $s$ and velocity $u(s,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\psi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} + u(s,t) \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial s}\n$$\nThis form arises from the general definition $\\frac{D\\psi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\psi$, where in one dimension $\\mathbf{v} = u(s,t)\\mathbf{e}_{s}$ and $\\nabla = \\mathbf{e}_{s}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}$. Now, we apply the given mappings to this equation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Since $\\psi(s,t) = \\phi(r(s),t)$ and $r=s$, holding $s$ constant is the same as holding $r$ constant, so $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$.\n    \\item By definition, $u(s,t) = v_{r}(r,t)$.\n    \\item By the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\frac{dr}{ds}$. Since $s=r$, $\\frac{dr}{ds}=1$, so $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSubstituting these equivalences back into the one-dimensional Cartesian expression for $\\frac{D\\psi}{Dt}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v_{r}(r,t) \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\n$$\nThis result is identical to the expression for $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$ derived in the second task. This demonstrates that the advection of a spherically symmetric field by a purely radial flow is mathematically analogous to a one-dimensional advection problem along a line. The final requested expression is the result from the second task.",

To formulate physically valid constitutive laws for large deformations, we must use objective stress rates that isolate changes due to deformation from those due to pure rotation. This advanced practice  has you verify the fundamental property of these objective rates: that for a rigid-body rotation with no deformation, they correctly evaluate to zero, a critical benchmark for any large-deformation simulation code.",

Consider three objective stress rates applied to the deviatoric stress: the Zaremba–Jaumann (ZJ) rate, the Green–Naghdi (GN) rate, and the Truesdell (TR) rate, each understood in its standard definition as an objective rate for second-order tensors.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, a set of derivations concerning stress tensors under rigid-body rotation; second, a proof that three standard objective stress rates of the deviatoric stress vanish under these conditions; and third, a numerical program to verify this result.\n\nWe begin with the theoretical derivations and proofs as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivations for Stress under Rigid-Body Motion\n\nThis section provides the derivations for the spatial Cauchy stress and its material time derivative under rigid-body rotation.\n\n**1. Spatial Cauchy Stress from a Constant Material Stress Tensor**\n\nA second-order tensor field in the material description, $ \\boldsymbol{S}(\\boldsymbol{X}, t) $, is transformed to its spatial counterpart, the Cauchy stress $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) $, via the push-forward operation $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\det \\boldsymbol{F})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} $. The problem describes a rigid-body motion given by $ \\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\boldsymbol{R}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{X} + \\boldsymbol{c}(t) $. The deformation gradient is $ \\boldsymbol{F} = \\partial \\boldsymbol{x}/\\partial \\boldsymbol{X} = \\boldsymbol{R}(t) $. Since $ \\boldsymbol{R}(t) $ is a proper orthogonal tensor, its determinant is $ \\det \\boldsymbol{R}(t) = 1 $.\n\nThe problem states that $ \\boldsymbol{S}_0 $ is a constant tensor fixed in the corotating material frame. This means it is constant with respect to both material coordinates $ \\boldsymbol{X} $ and time $ t $ in the material description. Substituting $ \\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{R}(t) $, $ \\det \\boldsymbol{F} = 1 $, and $ \\boldsymbol{S} = \\boldsymbol{S}_0 $ into the push-forward formula yields the spatial Cauchy stress:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t) = \\boldsymbol{R}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{S}_0\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the spatial stress is obtained by rotating the constant material stress tensor $ \\boldsymbol{S}_0 $ with the rotation tensor $ \\boldsymbol{R}(t) $.\n\n**2. Material Time Derivative of the Cauchy Stress**\n\nThe material time derivative of $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t) $ is found by differentiating the expression above with respect to time $ t $. Using the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\boldsymbol{R}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{S}_0\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}} \\right) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{S}_0\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{R}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{S}_0\\,\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nWe can express $ \\boldsymbol{S}_0 $ in terms of $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t) $ by rearranging the first equation: $ \\boldsymbol{S}_0 = \\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t) $. Substituting this into the expression for $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(t) $:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(t) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}(t)\\,(\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t))\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{R}(t)\\,(\\boldsymbol{R}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{R}(t))\\,\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nUsing the orthogonality property $ \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{I} $, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(t) = (\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,(\\boldsymbol{R}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}^{\\mathsf{T}})\n$$\nFor rigid-body motion, the velocity gradient is $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} $. The problem gives that $ \\boldsymbol{D}=\\boldsymbol{0} $, so $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $, where $ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $ is the spin tensor. Thus, $ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} $.\nDifferentiating the identity $ \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{I} $ with respect to time gives $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{R}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{0} $. This implies $ \\boldsymbol{R}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}^{\\mathsf{T}} = - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = -\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(t) $:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nThis result, $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = [\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}] $, shows that the material derivative of the Cauchy stress is the Lie bracket of the spin tensor and the stress tensor itself.\n\n**3. Material Time Derivative of the Deviatoric Stress**\n\nThe deviatoric stress tensor $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $ is defined as $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\tfrac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,\\boldsymbol{I} $. Its material time derivative is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} - \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}))\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nThe trace of the spatial stress is $ \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{S}_0\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}) $. Using the cyclic property of the trace, $ \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{B}\\boldsymbol{C}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{C}\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{B}) $, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{S}_0) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{S}_0) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{S}_0)\n$$\nSince $ \\boldsymbol{S}_0 $ is a constant tensor, its trace is a constant scalar. Therefore, $ \\frac{d}{dt}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})) = 0 $. This simplifies the expression for $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} $ to:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the deviatoric part of $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} $, denoted $ \\operatorname{dev}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) $:\n$$\n\\operatorname{dev}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}})\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nWe compute the trace of $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $. Again using the cyclic property of the trace:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 0\n$$\nSince $ \\operatorname{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) = 0 $, its deviatoric part is itself: $ \\operatorname{dev}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} $.\nCombining these results, we have $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} $ and $ \\operatorname{dev}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} $, which proves that $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\operatorname{dev}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}) $.\n\n### Part 2: Objective Stress Rates under Rigid-Body Rotation\n\nWe now prove that the Zaremba-Jaumann, Green-Naghdi, and Truesdell objective rates of the deviatoric stress $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $ are zero for the case of rigid-body rotation. In this case, the kinematic conditions are $ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\boldsymbol{0} $ and $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $.\n\n**1. Zaremba-Jaumann (ZJ) Rate**\n\nThe ZJ rate (also known as the corotational rate) of a tensor $ \\boldsymbol{A} $ is defined as $ \\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{A}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{A}} - \\boldsymbol{W}\\boldsymbol{A} + \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{W} $. Applying this to the deviatoric stress $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{W}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{W}\n$$\nSubstituting $ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $ and using the result from Part 1 that $ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = (\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nSubstitute $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,\\boldsymbol{I} $:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) - \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\boldsymbol{I}\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nCollecting like terms:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = (\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) + (-\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThus, the ZJ rate of $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $ vanishes.\n\n**2. Green-Naghdi (GN) Rate**\n\nThe GN rate is defined using the spin $ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}_{\\text{polar}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} $ derived from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient $ \\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U} $. For rigid-body motion, $ \\boldsymbol{F}=\\boldsymbol{R} $, so $ \\boldsymbol{U}=\\boldsymbol{I} $. The rotation from the polar decomposition is simply the rigid body rotation $ \\boldsymbol{R} $. The associated spin is $ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}_{\\text{polar}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} $.\nAs established earlier, for rigid-body motion, $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} $, so $ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}_{\\text{polar}} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $.\nThe GN rate definition becomes $ \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $, which is identical to the ZJ rate. Therefore, by the same argument:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\n\n**3. Truesdell (TR) Rate**\n\nThe TR rate is defined as $ \\stackrel{\\circ}{\\boldsymbol{A}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{A}} - \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{A} - \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{L})\\boldsymbol{A} $. Applying this to $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\circ}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} - \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{L})\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\n$$\nUnder rigid-body rotation, $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $. Since $ \\boldsymbol{W} $ is a skew-symmetric tensor, we have $ \\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{W}^{\\mathsf{T}} = -\\boldsymbol{W} = -\\boldsymbol{L} $. Also, the trace of any skew-symmetric tensor is zero, so $ \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{L}) = 0 $.\nSubstituting these into the TR rate definition:\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\circ}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} - \\boldsymbol{\\tau}(-\\boldsymbol{L}) + (0)\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{L}\n$$\nSince $ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{W} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} $, this expression is identical to the ZJ and GN rates for this specific case.\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\circ}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThe Truesdell rate of $ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $ also vanishes, completing the proof. All three objective rates are designed to measure the rate of change of stress due to deformation, so it is a fundamental consistency requirement that they vanish for rigid-body rotation, a motion with no deformation.",
