It presents a standard exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically in the theory of infinitesimal strain. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe relationship between the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ and the displacement vector field $u_i$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is given by the strain-displacement relations:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe given displacement field is:\n$u_x = u_1 = \\alpha x + \\beta y$\n$u_y = u_2 = \\gamma x + \\delta y$\n$u_z = u_3 = 0$\n\nHere, we associate the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ with $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ respectively.

It measures the fractional change in volume. For this deformation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_v = \\alpha + \\delta + 0 = \\alpha + \\delta\n$$\nThis indicates that the volume of a material element changes unless $\\alpha = -\\delta$, which corresponds to an isochoric (volume-preserving) deformation in the $x-y$ plane.\n\n**Rigid-Body Motion:**\nThe displacement gradient tensor $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ can be decomposed into a symmetric strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ and an anti-symmetric (or skew-symmetric) spin (or rotation) tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$: $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$. The spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ describes the local infinitesimal rigid-body rotation of the material, which does not contribute to strain. It is calculated as $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} - (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T)$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha  \\beta  0 \\\\\n\\gamma  \\delta  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n-\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha  \\gamma  0 \\\\\n\\beta  \\delta  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\right]\n=\n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  \\beta - \\gamma  0 \\\\\n\\gamma - \\beta  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta - \\gamma)  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2}(\\beta - \\gamma)  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe nonzero component $\\Omega_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta - \\gamma)$ represents the rate of infinitesimal rigid-body rotation about the $z$-axis. If $\\beta = \\gamma$, the flow is irrotational, and the shear is said to be \"pure.\" If $\\beta \\neq \\gamma$, the deformation includes a rotational component. This rigid-body rotation is part of the overall motion but, by definition, does not cause any straining of the material.",

Thus, this condition forces $\\boldsymbol{d} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nTo eliminate rotation ($\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$), we must constrain the rotational degrees of freedom. This can be achieved by fixing the displacement of other points. For example, by fixing two components of displacement at a point on the $x$-axis, say $(L,0,0)$, we can determine two rotation components:\nWith $\\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, we have $u_y(L,0,0) = \\omega_z L$ and $u_z(L,0,0) = -\\omega_y L$. Setting $u_y(L,0,0)=0$ and $u_z(L,0,0)=0$ forces $\\omega_z=0$ and $\\omega_y=0$ (since $L \\neq 0$).\nTo find the last component, we can fix one component at a point on the $y$-axis, say $(0,L,0)$:\nWith $\\omega_y=\\omega_z=0$, we have $u_z(0,L,0) = \\omega_x L$. Setting $u_z(0,L,0)=0$ forces $\\omega_x=0$.\n\nWith $\\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, the unique displacement field that produces the desired strain state without rigid-body motion is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nThe components are:\n$$\nu_x(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vx\n$$\n$$\nu_y(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vy\n$$\n$$\nu_z(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vz\n$$\nThe boundary conditions that produce this field are Dirichlet boundary conditions where the displacement is prescribed over the entire boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ according to this formula:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x})|_{\\partial\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v \\boldsymbol{x}|_{\\partial\\Omega}\n$$\nThese boundary conditions uniquely determine the displacement field inside the domain and inherently satisfy the constraints required to eliminate rigid-body motion. The side length $L$ of the cube defines the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ but does not appear in the expression for the displacement field at a generic point $(x,y,z)$.\n\n### Verification\n\nFinally, we must verify from first principles that this displacement field yields the required strain state.\nThe displacement field is $\\boldsymbol{u}(x,y,z) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vx, \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vy, \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_vz\\right)$.\nFirst, we compute the displacement gradient tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is the symmetric part of $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\mathsf{T}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I} + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\\right)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)\n$$\nSince the identity tensor is symmetric, $(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I})^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I} + \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nNow, we verify the two conditions on the strain state:\n1.  **Volumetric Strain:**\n    The volumetric strain is the trace of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v(1+1+1) = \\epsilon_v\n    $$\n    This holds everywhere in $\\Omega$, as required.\n\n2.  **Deviatoric Strain:**\n    The deviatoric strain tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}' = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\boldsymbol{I}$. Substituting our results:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}' = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) - \\frac{1}{3}(\\epsilon_v)\\boldsymbol{I} = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I} - \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon_v\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n    $$\n    This also holds everywhere in $\\Omega$, as required.\n\nThe derived displacement field is correct and satisfies all conditions of the problem.",
