            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated in objective, formal language. The problem consists of a theoretical derivation followed by a numerical application, which is a standard format for assessing understanding in this field.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of Cauchy's stress theorem, which relates the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ on an arbitrary plane to the unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ of that plane via a second-order tensor, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. This derivation is founded on the principle of linear momentum balance for an infinitesimal body. The second part requires showing that the balance of angular momentum leads to the symmetry of the stress tensor. The final part is a direct application of these principles to compute specific quantities.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Traction Vector Representation**\n\nLet us consider an infinitesimal tetrahedron with three faces orthogonal to the Cartesian basis vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2, \\boldsymbol{e}_3\\}$, and a fourth, oblique face with an outward unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The point $P$ at which the stress state is being examined is located at the vertex where the three orthogonal faces meet. Let the area of the oblique face be $dA$. The areas of the faces with normals $-\\boldsymbol{e}_1, -\\boldsymbol{e}_2, -\\boldsymbol{e}_3$ are then $dA_1 = (\\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_1) dA = n_1 dA$, $dA_2 = n_2 dA$, and $dA_3 = n_3 dA$, respectively.\n\nThe traction vector on the oblique face is denoted by $\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n})$ and the traction vectors on the other faces are $\\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_i)$. By Cauchy's postulate (an analogue of Newton's third law for contact forces), the traction on a surface with normal $-\\boldsymbol{m}$ is the negative of the traction on a surface with normal $\\boldsymbol{m}$: $\\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{m}) = -\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{m})$.\n\nThe balance of linear momentum for the tetrahedron is given by $\\sum \\boldsymbol{F} = m\\boldsymbol{a}$. The total force $\\sum \\boldsymbol{F}$ is the sum of surface forces and body forces.\nThe net surface force is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{F}_s = \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) dA + \\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_1) dA_1 + \\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_2) dA_2 + \\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_3) dA_3 $$\nUsing Cauchy's postulate and the area relations:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{F}_s = \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) dA - \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1) n_1 dA - \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_2) n_2 dA - \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_3) n_3 dA = \\left( \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_i) \\right) dA $$\nThe body force is $\\boldsymbol{F}_b = \\boldsymbol{b} dV$, where $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is the body force per unit volume and $dV$ is the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume is $dV = \\frac{1}{3} h dA$, where $h$ is the altitude from the origin to the oblique face. The mass is $m = \\rho dV$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density.\n\nThe equation of motion is:\n$$ \\left( \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_i) \\right) dA + \\boldsymbol{b} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} h dA\\right) = \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3} h dA\\right) \\boldsymbol{a} $$\nDividing by $dA$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_i) + \\frac{1}{3} h (\\boldsymbol{b} - \\rho\\boldsymbol{a}) = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nTo find the state at the point $P$, we shrink the tetrahedron to zero size, i.e., $h \\to 0$. Assuming the body forces $\\boldsymbol{b}$ and the acceleration $\\boldsymbol{a}$ are bounded, the term proportional to $h$ vanishes. This leaves Cauchy's stress theorem:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_j) $$\nThis equation shows that the traction vector on any plane is a linear combination of the traction vectors on the coordinate planes. We now define the components of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The vector $\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_j)$ is the traction on the plane with normal $\\boldsymbol{e}_j$. Its components in the basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_i\\}$ are defined as $\\sigma_{ij}$. That is, $\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} \\boldsymbol{e}_i$.\n\nSubstituting this definition into Cauchy's theorem:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} \\boldsymbol{e}_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} n_j \\right) \\boldsymbol{e}_i $$\nThe $i$-th component of the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ is therefore $t_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} n_j$. In matrix notation, this is the linear mapping $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n}$.\n\n**Part 2: Symmetry of the Stress Tensor**\n\nThe symmetry of the stress tensor, $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, is a consequence of the balance of angular momentum, assuming no body couples are present. Consider an infinitesimal cubic element. The balance of angular momentum states that the net torque is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume, and assuming bounded angular acceleration, the net torque must vanish.\nThe torque component about the $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$-axis, for example, is produced by the shear stresses on the faces of the cube. The forces due to the stress component $\\sigma_{12}$ on the faces with normals $\\pm\\boldsymbol{e}_2$ create a couple. Similarly, forces from $\\sigma_{21}$ on faces with normals $\\pm\\boldsymbol{e}_1$ create another couple. For the net torque to be zero, these couples must balance, which requires $\\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{21}$.\nA more formal derivation shows that the balance of angular momentum for an arbitrary volume $V$ implies $\\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T) dV = \\boldsymbol{0}$, where $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is the axial vector of the skew-symmetric part of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$. Since this must hold for any $V$, the integrand must be zero, which means $\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T) = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This condition is equivalent to $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$. Thus, the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric. The provided stress tensor in the problem is symmetric, which is consistent with this fundamental principle.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation for the Specific Case**\n\nThe explicit representation of the traction vector is $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}$.\nGiven:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 3 & -2\\\\\n3 & 18 & 4\\\\\n-2 & 4 & 10\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\;\\mathrm{MPa},\n\\quad\n\\boldsymbol{n} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n1.  **Compute the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$:**\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    12 & 3 & -2\\\\\n    3 & 18 & 4\\\\\n    -2 & 4 & 10\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    (12)(2) + (3)(-1) + (-2)(2) \\\\\n    (3)(2) + (18)(-1) + (4)(2) \\\\\n    (-2)(2) + (4)(-1) + (10)(2)\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{t} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    24 - 3 - 4 \\\\\n    6 - 18 + 8 \\\\\n    -4 - 4 + 20\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    17 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 12\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\frac{17}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{4}{3} \\\\ 4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\; \\mathrm{MPa}\n    $$\n    The components are $t_1 = \\frac{17}{3}$, $t_2 = -\\frac{4}{3}$, and $t_3 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Compute the normal traction $t_n$:**\n    The normal traction is the scalar projection of $\\boldsymbol{t}$ onto $\\boldsymbol{n}$: $t_n = \\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$.\n    $$\n    t_n =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\frac{17}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{4}{3} \\\\ 4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\cdot\n    \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{1}{9} \\left( (17)(2) + (-4)(-1) + (12)(2) \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    t_n = \\frac{1}{9} (34 + 4 + 24) = \\frac{62}{9} \\; \\mathrm{MPa}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Compute the magnitude of the shear traction $\\tau$:**\n    The shear traction vector is $\\boldsymbol{t}_s = \\boldsymbol{t} - t_n \\boldsymbol{n}$.

The algorithm for each test case, which consists of a stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(k)}$, a scalar pressure $p^{(k)}$, and a set of normal vector candidates $\\mathcal{N}^{(k)}$, is as follows:\n\nFor each normal vector candidate $\\mathbf{n}$ in the set $\\mathcal{N}^{(k)}$:\n1.  **Normalization:** Compute the Euclidean norm $\\|\\mathbf{n}\\|$ and normalize the vector to obtain the unit normal $\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathbf{n} / \\|\\mathbf{n}\\|$. If $\\|\\mathbf{n}\\| = 0$, this vector is invalid, but this case does not occur in the test suite.\n2.  **Traction Calculation:**\n    -   Compute the original traction vector $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(k)}\\,\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n    -   Compute the shifted stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(k)} + p^{(k)}\\,\\mathbf{I}$.\n    -   Compute the shifted traction vector $\\mathbf{t}^{\\prime} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime}\\,\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n3.  **Traction Decomposition:**\n    -   Calculate the original normal component $t_n = \\widehat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{t}$ and shear vector $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{t} - t_n\\,\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n    -   Calculate the shifted normal component $t_n^{\\prime} = \\widehat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{t}^{\\prime}$ and shear vector $\\mathbf{s}^{\\prime} = \\mathbf{t}^{\\prime} - t_n^{\\prime}\\,\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n4.  **Verification Condition 1 (Traction Shift):**\n    -   Calculate the residual vector: $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\text{tr}} = \\mathbf{t}^{\\prime} - (\\mathbf{t} + p^{(k)}\\,\\widehat{\\mathbf{n}})$.\n    -   Calculate the error as the norm of the residual: $E_{\\text{tr}} = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\text{tr}}\\|$.\n    -   Calculate the scale factor: $S_{\\text{tr}} = \\max(\\|\\mathbf{t}\\| + |p^{(k)}|,\\,1)$.\n    -   Calculate the tolerance: $T_{\\text{tr}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{rel}}\\,S_{\\text{tr}}$, with $\\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}} = 10^{-10}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{rel}} = 10^{-10}$.\n    -   Check if $E_{\\text{tr}} \\leq T_{\\text{tr}}$.\n5.  **Verification Condition 2 (Shear Invariance):**\n    -   Calculate the residual vector: $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\text{sh}} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\prime} - \\mathbf{s}$.\n    -   Calculate the error as the norm of the residual: $E_{\\text{sh}} = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\text{sh}}\\|$.\n    -   Calculate the scale factor: $S_{\\text{sh}} = \\max(\\|\\mathbf{s}\\|,\\,1)$.\n    -   Calculate the tolerance: $T_{\\text{sh}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{abs}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{rel}}\\,S_{\\text{sh}}$.\n    -   Check if $E_{\\text{sh}} \\leq T_{\\text{sh}}$.\n6.  **Case Decision:** A test case passes and returns $\\text{True}$ if and only if both conditions are met for all normal vectors in its set $\\mathcal{N}^{(k)}$. If any check fails for any normal, the entire case fails and returns $\\text{False}$.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented for the five specified test cases. Given the analytical derivations, all cases are expected to pass, serving as a successful verification of the numerical implementation against known analytical solutions.",

This exercise demonstrates how the Cauchy stress framework is applied to a classic problem in geomechanics: identifying the plane most susceptible to failure under the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. By performing an eigen-decomposition of the stress tensor and finding the orientation that maximizes the failure function, you will connect the theoretical concepts of principal stress and traction to critical, predictive engineering assessments .",

            "problem": "A homogeneous geologic material is subjected to a static three-dimensional Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ in a Cartesian laboratory frame with tensile stress taken as positive. The Mohr–Coulomb strength criterion is used in the form $|\\tau| = c - \\sigma_{n} \\tan \\phi$, where $\\sigma_{n}$ is the normal traction on the prospective failure plane, $\\tau$ is the magnitude of the shear traction on that plane, $c$ is the cohesion, and $\\phi$ is the friction angle. You are provided the following data:\n- The Cauchy stress tensor is\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-60 & -20 & 0 \\\\\n-20 & -60 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -40\n\\end{pmatrix} \\text{ MPa}.\n$$\n- The friction angle is $\\phi = 0.523599$ radians.\n- The normal traction sign convention is tensile-positive, so compression corresponds to negative $\\sigma_{n}$.\n\nStarting from first principles of Cauchy’s stress principle (traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\boldsymbol{n}$ on a plane with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$), the definition of normal traction $\\sigma_{n}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\boldsymbol{n}$, and the definition of shear traction magnitude $|\\tau(\\boldsymbol{n})| = \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{t}\\!\\cdot\\!\\boldsymbol{t} - \\sigma_{n}^{2}}$, determine analytically the unit normal orientation $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ of the plane that would be the first to satisfy the Mohr–Coulomb equality $|\\tau| = c - \\sigma_{n}\\tan\\phi$ under monotonic loading, in the sense that it maximizes the scalar function $h(\\boldsymbol{n}) = |\\tau(\\boldsymbol{n})| + \\sigma_{n}(\\boldsymbol{n}) \\tan \\phi$. Use the eigen-decomposition of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to reduce the search to a one-parameter family of plane normals, and explicitly construct $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ in the original laboratory coordinates.\n\nThen, verify numerically by a direct search over the one-parameter family that your analytically derived $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ indeed maximizes $h(\\boldsymbol{n})$.\n\nInstructions:\n- Express any angle you introduce in radians.\n- Round each component of the final unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ to four significant figures.\n- The final answer should be provided as the three components of $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ in the original laboratory coordinate basis.",

Find the principal stresses (eigenvalues) and principal directions (eigenvectors) of the given Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n2.  Express the normal traction $\\sigma_n$ and shear traction magnitude $|\\tau|$ in the principal coordinate system.\n3.  Utilize the symmetry of the stress state to reduce the problem to a one-parameter optimization.\n4.  Analytically find the angle that maximizes the function $h$.\n5.  Construct the unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ in the original laboratory coordinates.\n6.  Numerically verify the result.\n\n**1. Eigen-decomposition of the Stress Tensor**\n\nThe given Cauchy stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-60 & -20 & 0 \\\\\n-20 & -60 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -40\n\\end{pmatrix} \\text{ MPa}\n$$\nThe principal stresses $\\lambda$ are the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-60-\\lambda & -20 & 0 \\\\\n-20 & -60-\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -40-\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} = (-40-\\lambda) [(-60-\\lambda)^2 - (-20)^2] = 0\n$$\nOne eigenvalue is immediately $\\lambda = -40$. The others are given by $(-60-\\lambda)^2 = 400$, which yields $-60-\\lambda = \\pm 20$. This gives $\\lambda = -80$ and $\\lambda = -40$.\nThe principal stresses, ordered according to $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3$, are:\n$\\sigma_1 = -40 \\text{ MPa}$\n$\\sigma_2 = -40 \\text{ MPa}$\n$\\sigma_3 = -80 \\text{ MPa}$\n\nNext, we find the corresponding principal directions (eigenvectors).\nFor $\\sigma_3 = -80 \\text{ MPa}$:\n$(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (-80)\\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 20 & -20 & 0 \\\\ -20 & 20 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 40 \\end{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This gives $v_1=v_2$ and $v_3=0$. The normalized eigenvector is $\\boldsymbol{e}_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 1, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. This is the unique axis of symmetry for the stress state.\n\nFor the repeated eigenvalue $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = -40 \\text{ MPa}$:\n$(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (-40)\\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -20 & -20 & 0 \\\\ -20 & -20 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This gives $v_1 = -v_2$, while $v_3$ is arbitrary. The eigenspace is a plane. We can choose any two orthonormal vectors in this plane. A convenient choice is:\n$\\boldsymbol{e}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, -1, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$\n$\\boldsymbol{e}_2 = (0, 0, 1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$\nThese form an orthonormal basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2, \\boldsymbol{e}_3\\}$ for the principal directions.\n\n**2. Stress Components in the Principal Basis**\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{n}$ be a unit normal vector. In the principal basis, $\\boldsymbol{n} = n'_1 \\boldsymbol{e}_1 + n'_2 \\boldsymbol{e}_2 + n'_3 \\boldsymbol{e}_3$, where $(n'_1)^2+(n'_2)^2+(n'_3)^2=1$.\nThe normal traction $\\sigma_n$ and shear traction magnitude $|\\tau|$ on the plane defined by $\\boldsymbol{n}$ are given by:\n$\\sigma_n = \\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\sigma_1(n'_1)^2 + \\sigma_2(n'_2)^2 + \\sigma_3(n'_3)^2$\n$|\\tau|^2 = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n})\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}) - \\sigma_n^2 = (\\sigma_1^2(n'_1)^2 + \\sigma_2^2(n'_2)^2 + \\sigma_3^2(n'_3)^2) - (\\sigma_1(n'_1)^2 + \\sigma_2(n'_2)^2 + \\sigma_3(n'_3)^2)^2$\n\n**3. Reduction to a One-Parameter Problem**\n\nSince $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = -40$ MPa, the stress state is axially symmetric about the $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$ axis. The values of $\\sigma_n$ and $|\\tau|$ depend only on the angle $\\theta$ between $\\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$. Let this angle be $\\theta$, so $n'_3 = \\cos\\theta$ and $(n'_1)^2+(n'_2)^2=\\sin^2\\theta$.\nThe expressions simplify to:\n$\\sigma_n(\\theta) = \\sigma_1((n'_1)^2 + (n'_2)^2) + \\sigma_3(n'_3)^2 = \\sigma_1\\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_3\\cos^2\\theta$\n$|\\tau|^2(\\theta) = \\sigma_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_3^2 \\cos^2\\theta - (\\sigma_1\\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_3\\cos^2\\theta)^2 = (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)^2 \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\theta$\n$|\\tau|(\\theta) = (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)\\sin(2\\theta)$ (since $\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_3$ and we consider $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$).\n\nUsing trigonometric identities, we write $\\sigma_n$ in terms of $2\\theta$:\n$\\sigma_n(\\theta) = \\sigma_1\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\right) + \\sigma_3\\left(\\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_1+\\sigma_3}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)$\n\n**4. Analytical Maximization**\n\nWe need to maximize $h(\\theta) = |\\tau(\\theta)| + \\sigma_n(\\theta) \\tan\\phi$:\n$$\nh(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)\\sin(2\\theta) + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_1+\\sigma_3}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)\\right)\\tan\\phi\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we differentiate $h(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)\\sin(2\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)\\cos(2\\theta)\\tan\\phi \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{d\\theta} = (\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)\\cos(2\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)(-2\\sin(2\\theta))\\tan\\phi = (\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)[\\cos(2\\theta) + \\sin(2\\theta)\\tan\\phi]\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dh}{d\\theta}=0$ and noting that $\\sigma_1 \\neq \\sigma_3$, we get:\n$\\cos(2\\theta) + \\sin(2\\theta)\\tan\\phi = 0 \\implies \\cot(2\\theta) = -\\tan\\phi$\nUsing the identity $-\\tan\\phi = \\cot(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi)$, we have:\n$2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi \\implies \\theta^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2h}{d\\theta^2} = 2(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3)[-\\sin(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\theta)\\tan\\phi]$, is negative at $\\theta^\\ast$, confirming a maximum.\n\nGiven $\\phi = 0.523599$ radians (which is $\\pi/6$ to high precision), the optimal angle is:\n$\\theta^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{12} = \\frac{4\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\n**5. Construction of the Optimal Normal Vector $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe vector $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ makes an angle $\\theta^{\\ast} = \\pi/3$ with the principal axis $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$. Due to the axial symmetry, any such vector forms a valid solution. A cone of possible $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ vectors exists. We can construct one specific solution by choosing it to lie in the plane spanned by $\\boldsymbol{e}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_3$. In the principal basis, this vector is $\\boldsymbol{n}'^{\\ast} = (\\sin\\theta^\\ast, 0, \\cos\\theta^\\ast)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n$\\boldsymbol{n}'^{\\ast} = (\\sin(\\pi/3), 0, \\cos(\\pi/3))^{\\mathsf{T}} = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0, \\frac{1}{2})^{\\mathsf{T}}$\n\nWe transform this vector back to the original laboratory coordinate system $\\{ \\boldsymbol{i}, \\boldsymbol{j}, \\boldsymbol{k} \\}$:\n$\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast} = \\sin(\\theta^{\\ast}) \\boldsymbol{e}_1 + \\cos(\\theta^{\\ast}) \\boldsymbol{e}_3$\n$\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nA more elegant simplification using sum-of-angle identities on the components gives:\n$n_x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\sin\\theta^{\\ast} + \\cos\\theta^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{2}\\cos(\\theta^{\\ast}-\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/3 - \\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/12) = \\cos(15^\\circ)$.\nThis is also equal to $\\cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$.\n$n_y^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\sin\\theta^{\\ast} + \\cos\\theta^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{2}\\cos(\\theta^{\\ast}+\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/3 + \\pi/4) = \\cos(7\\pi/12) = -\\sin(\\pi/12) = -\\sin(15^\\circ)$.\nThis is also equal to $-\\sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$.\n\nSo, $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast} = (\\cos(\\phi/2), -\\sin(\\phi/2), 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nUsing the given value $\\phi = 0.523599$ radians, so $\\phi/2 = 0.2617995$ radians.\n$n_x^{\\ast} = \\cos(0.2617995) = 0.9659258...$\n$n_y^{\\ast} = -\\sin(0.2617995) = -0.2588190...$\n$n_z^{\\ast} = 0$\nRounding each component to four significant figures gives:\n$n_x^{\\ast} \\approx 0.9659$\n$n_y^{\\ast} \\approx -0.2588$\n$n_z^{\\ast} = 0.0000$\n\n**6.

We evaluate $h(\\theta)$ at and near this angle.\n$h(\\theta) = 20 \\sin(2\\theta) + \\left( -60 - 20\\cos(2\\theta) \\right) \\tan(0.523599)$\n$\\tan(0.523599) \\approx 0.57735$.\n$h(\\theta) \\approx 20 \\sin(2\\theta) - 11.547 \\cos(2\\theta) - 34.641$.\n\nWe test three values of $\\theta$: $\\theta^{\\ast}$ and two neighboring points. Let's use angles in degrees for clarity: $60^\\circ$ ($\\pi/3$), $55^\\circ$, and $65^\\circ$.\n- For $\\theta = 60^\\circ \\approx 1.0472$ rad ($2\\theta = 120^\\circ$):\n$h(60^\\circ) \\approx 20\\sin(120^\\circ) - 11.547\\cos(120^\\circ) - 34.641 = 20(0.8660) - 11.547(-0.5) - 34.641 = 17.32 + 5.7735 - 34.641 = -11.5475$ MPa.\n- For $\\theta = 55^\\circ \\approx 0.9599$ rad ($2\\theta = 110^\\circ$):\n$h(55^\\circ) \\approx 20\\sin(110^\\circ) - 11.547\\cos(110^\\circ) - 34.641 = 20(0.9397) - 11.547(-0.3420) - 34.641 = 18.794 + 3.949 - 34.641 = -11.898$ MPa.\n- For $\\theta = 65^\\circ \\approx 1.1345$ rad ($2\\theta = 130^\\circ$):\n$h(65^\\circ) \\approx 20\\sin(130^\\circ) - 11.547\\cos(130^\\circ) - 34.641 = 20(0.7660) - 11.547(-0.6428) - 34.641 = 15.32 + 7.422 - 34.641 = -11.899$ MPa.\n\nThe numerical values confirm that $h(\\theta)$ has a maximum at $\\theta = \\theta^{\\ast} = \\pi/3$. The computed vector $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast}$ is therefore correct.\nThe final vector is $\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\ast} \\approx (0.9659, -0.2588, 0.0000)$.",
