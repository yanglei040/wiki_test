The concepts of Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions, the deformation gradient, and the Jacobian determinant are standard in this field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information—the specific motion map and the initial geometry—to uniquely determine the required quantities. The language is objective and precise. The physical scenario of homogeneous affine deformation is a common and valid simplification used in mechanics. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe motion of the continuum body is given by the affine transformation $\\mathbf{x} = \\chi(\\mathbf{X},t) = \\mathbf{F}(t)\\mathbf{X}$, since the translational part $\\mathbf{c}(t)$ is the zero vector. In matrix form, the deformation gradient is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\alpha t & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe relationship between the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$ and the material coordinates $\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, X_3)^T$ is thus:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\alpha t & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\\\ X_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the component-wise mapping:\n$x_1 = (1+\\alpha t)X_1$\n$x_2 = X_2$\n$x_3 = X_3$\n\n**Eulerian Description of the Mapped Cube $\\mathcal{C}_t$**\n\nThe reference body is the unit cube $\\mathcal{C}_0$ defined by the inequalities $0 \\leq X_1 \\leq 1$, $0 \\leq X_2 \\leq 1$, and $0 \\leq X_3 \\leq 1$. To find the Eulerian description of its image, $\\mathcal{C}_t = \\chi(\\mathcal{C}_0,t)$, we express the material coordinates in terms of the spatial coordinates and substitute them into these inequalities.\nAssuming $1+\\alpha t \\neq 0$, we have $X_1 = \\frac{x_1}{1+\\alpha t}$. The other relations are $X_2 = x_2$ and $X_3 = x_3$.\nThe inequalities become:\n$0 \\leq x_2 \\leq 1$\n$0 \\leq x_3 \\leq 1$\n$0 \\leq \\frac{x_1}{1+\\alpha t} \\leq 1$\n\nThe inequality for $x_1$ depends on the sign of the term $1+\\alpha t$.\n- If $1+\\alpha t > 0$, multiplying by this positive term preserves the inequalities: $0 \\leq x_1 \\leq 1+\\alpha t$.\n- If $1+\\alpha t < 0$, multiplying by this negative term reverses the inequalities: $0 \\geq x_1 \\geq 1+\\alpha t$, which is equivalent to $1+\\alpha t \\leq x_1 \\leq 0$.\n- If $1+\\alpha t = 0$, the mapping is singular, and all points are mapped to the plane $x_1 = 0$.\n\nThus, the mapped region $\\mathcal{C}_t$ is a rectangular prism described by the set $\\{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^3 : \\min(0, 1+\\alpha t) \\leq x_1 \\leq \\max(0, 1+\\alpha t), 0 \\leq x_2 \\leq 1, 0 \\leq x_3 \\leq 1\\}$.\n\n**Mapped Edges Emanating from the Origin**\n\nThe edges of the unit cube $\\mathcal{C}_0$ emanating from the origin $\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{0}$ are aligned with the Cartesian basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3$. We can parametrize them as $\\lambda\\mathbf{e}_1$, $\\lambda\\mathbf{e}_2$, and $\\lambda\\mathbf{e}_3$ for $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\nTheir images in the current configuration are found by applying the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}(t)$. The mapped edge vectors are the columns of $\\mathbf{F}(t)$:\n- The image of the first basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$ is $\\mathbf{f}_1(t) = \\mathbf{F}(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 = ((1+\\alpha t), 0, 0)^T$. The corresponding edge is parametrized by $\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}(\\lambda, t) = \\lambda \\mathbf{f}_1(t) = (\\lambda(1+\\alpha t), 0, 0)^T$ for $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$. This is a line segment from the origin to $((1+\\alpha t), 0, 0)^T$.\n- The image of the second basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)^T$ is $\\mathbf{f}_2(t) = \\mathbf{F}(t)\\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)^T$. The edge remains unchanged: $\\mathbf{x}^{(2)}(\\lambda, t) = (\\lambda \\mathbf{f}_2(t)) = (0, \\lambda, 0)^T$ for $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\n- The image of the third basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$ is $\\mathbf{f}_3(t) = \\mathbf{F}(t)\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$. This edge also remains unchanged: $\\mathbf{x}^{(3)}(\\lambda, t) = (\\lambda \\mathbf{f}_3(t)) = (0, 0, \\lambda)^T$ for $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**Orientation Change**\n\nThe orientation of the triad formed by the mapped edge vectors is determined by the sign of their scalar triple product, $[\\mathbf{f}_1(t), \\mathbf{f}_2(t), \\mathbf{f}_3(t)]$. This product is given by the determinant of the matrix whose columns are these vectors, which is precisely the determinant of the deformation gradient, $J(t) = \\det(\\mathbf{F}(t))$.\n$$\nJ(t) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\alpha t & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1+\\alpha t)(1)(1) = 1+\\alpha t\n$$\nThe initial triad $(\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3)$ is right-handed, with a scalar triple product of $+1$.\n- The orientation is preserved if $J(t) > 0$, which means $1+\\alpha t > 0$. This occurs when $t > -1/\\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 0$, or $t < -1/\\alpha$ for $\\alpha < 0$. Physically, this means the material has not been compressed so much along the $X_1$-axis as to invert itself.\n- The orientation is reversed if $J(t) < 0$, which means $1+\\alpha t < 0$. This occurs when $t < -1/\\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 0$, or $t > -1/\\alpha$ for $\\alpha < 0$. This corresponds to a material inversion along the $X_1$-axis.\n- The mapping becomes degenerate (the volume collapses to zero) if $J(t) = 0$, which occurs at $t = -1/\\alpha$. In this case, the three edge vectors become coplanar.\n\n**Signed Volume of the Mapped Cube**\n\nThe signed volume $V_s(t)$ of the mapped body $\\mathcal{C}_t$ is related to the initial volume $V_0$ of the reference body $\\mathcal{C}_0$ by the Jacobian determinant $J(t)$. For a homogeneous deformation (where $\\mathbf{F}$ is constant throughout the body), the relation is direct:\n$$\nV_s(t) = J(t) \\cdot V_0\n$$\nThe reference body is a unit cube with edge lengths of $1 \\mathrm{m}$. Its volume is $V_0 = (1\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$.\nUsing the previously calculated Jacobian, we find the signed volume:\n$$\nV_s(t) = (1+\\alpha t) \\cdot 1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3 = (1+\\alpha t)\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\n$$\nThe quantity $1+\\alpha t$ is dimensionless, as $\\alpha$ has units of time$^{-1}$ and $t$ has units of time. The final result for the signed volume, expressed as an analytical formula, is $1+\\alpha t$, with the understanding that the numerical value would be in units of $\\mathrm{m}^3$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded in continuum kinematics, and well-posed. All necessary definitions and conditions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Eulerian kinematic quantities—the spatial velocity field $v(x,t)$, the spatial velocity gradient $L(x,t)$, the rate-of-deformation tensor $D(x,t)$, and the spin tensor $W(x,t)$—for a rigid-body rotation.\n\nThe motion of a material point is given in the Lagrangian description by its spatial position $x$ as a function of its reference position $X$ and time $t$:\n$$x(X,t) = Q(t)X$$\nwhere $Q(t)$ is the rotation tensor for a rotation about the $e_3$ axis by an angle $\\theta(t) = \\omega t$.\n\nFirst, we derive the spatial velocity field $v(x,t)$. The definition relates the spatial velocity to the material time derivative of the position:\n$$v(\\chi(X,t), t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}x(X,t) \\bigg|_{X \\text{ fixed}}$$\nHere, $\\chi(X,t)$ is the motion map, i.e., $x = \\chi(X,t)$.\nTaking the time derivative of the motion gives the material velocity:\n$$V(X,t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(Q(t)X) = \\dot{Q}(t)X$$\nTo express this velocity in the Eulerian (spatial) description, we need to replace the reference position $X$ with the current spatial position $x$. The tensor $Q(t)$ is in the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$, which means it is an orthogonal tensor with determinant $+1$. The orthogonality property implies $Q(t)Q(t)^{\\mathsf{T}} = I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor. Therefore, the inverse of $Q(t)$ is its transpose, $Q(t)^{-1} = Q(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nFrom the motion equation $x = Q(t)X$, we can solve for $X$:\n$$X = Q(t)^{-1}x = Q(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}x$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for velocity:\n$$v(x,t) = \\dot{Q}(t) (Q(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}x) = \\left(\\dot{Q}(t)Q(t)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)x$$\nThis equation shows that the spatial velocity field $v(x,t)$ is a linear transformation of the position vector $x$.\n\nNext, we calculate the spatial velocity gradient $L(x,t)$, defined as $L = \\nabla_x v$.

This is a general property of any rigid-body motion.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate that $W$ corresponds to the given angular velocity. Any skew-symmetric second-order tensor, like $W$, can be associated with an axial vector, $\\boldsymbol{w}$, such that for any vector $a$, the action of the tensor is equivalent to a cross product: $Wa = \\boldsymbol{w} \\times a$. The matrix representation of $W$ in terms of the components of $\\boldsymbol{w} = w_1 e_1 + w_2 e_2 + w_3 e_3$ is:\n$$W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -w_3 & w_2 \\\\ w_3 & 0 & -w_1 \\\\ -w_2 & w_1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nComparing this to the derived spin tensor:\n$$W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\omega & 0 \\\\ \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwe can identify the components of the axial vector: $w_1 = 0$, $w_2 = 0$, and $w_3 = \\omega$.\nThe axial vector is therefore $\\boldsymbol{w} = \\omega e_3$. This vector represents an angular velocity of magnitude $\\omega$ about the $e_3$ axis, which is exactly the physical situation described in the problem.\nThe three requested matrices are $L$, $D$, and $W$.",

For a $2 \\times 2$ tensor, the first invariant is the trace and the second invariant is the determinant.\nThe first invariant of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is:\n$$\nI_{1}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe second invariant of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is:\n$$\nI_{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\det(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = (0)(0) - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the Green–Lagrange strain tensor $\\mathbf{E}$. This tensor is defined in terms of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F}$.\nFirst, we find the transpose of $\\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\gamma \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (1)(1)+(0)(0) & (1)(\\gamma)+(0)(1) \\\\ (\\gamma)(1)+(1)(0) & (\\gamma)(\\gamma)+(1)(1) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\gamma \\\\ \\gamma & \\gamma^{2}+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Green–Lagrange strain tensor $\\mathbf{E}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{I})$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\gamma \\\\ \\gamma & \\gamma^{2}+1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\gamma \\\\ \\gamma & \\gamma^{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\gamma}{2} & \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we determine the principal invariants of $\\mathbf{E}$.\nThe first invariant of $\\mathbf{E}$ is:\n$$\nI_{1}(\\mathbf{E}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{E}) = 0 + \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe second invariant of $\\mathbf{E}$ is:\n$$\nI_{2}(\\mathbf{E}) = \\det(\\mathbf{E}) = (0)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, we derive the invariant-error measure $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{inv}}(\\gamma)$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{inv}}(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\left(I_{1}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) - I_{1}(\\mathbf{E})\\right)^{2} + \\left(I_{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) - I_{2}(\\mathbf{E})\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the calculated invariant values:\n$$\nI_{1}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) - I_{1}(\\mathbf{E}) = 0 - \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2} = -\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nI_{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) - I_{2}(\\mathbf{E}) = -\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4} - \\left(-\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these differences into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{inv}}(\\gamma)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{inv}}(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} + (0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma^{4}}{4}}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma^{2}$ is always non-negative, the square root simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{inv}}(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the error incurred by using the invariants of the infinitesimal strain tensor instead of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor for finite simple shear, as a function of the shear parameter $\\gamma$.",
