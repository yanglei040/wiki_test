            "problem": "An axially symmetric triaxial compression test is conducted on an unsaturated coarse-grained soil specimen under isothermal, quasi-static conditions. The specimen is modeled as a three-phase porous continuum (solid skeleton, air, and water) with two interpenetrating fluid phases (air and water) occupying the pore space. Let the Cauchy stress be isotropic at the macroscopic level so that the mean total stress is $p$, and let the pore air and pore water pressures be $u_a$ and $u_w$, respectively, with matric suction $s$ defined by $s = u_a - u_w$. The volumetric strain of the skeleton is denoted $\\varepsilon_v$, the volumetric water content is thermodynamically coupled to $s$, and the degree of saturation is $S_r \\in [0,1]$.\n\nStarting from first principles of stress partitioning and work-conjugacy in unsaturated porous media, assume that:\n- The virtual work input to the solid skeleton at the mean stress level can be additively decomposed into a contribution from the net mean stress and a contribution from the suction, each being power-conjugate to the skeleton volumetric strain increment, and\n- The suction contribution is modulated by a scalar, saturation-dependent weighting function $\\chi(S_r)$ with $0 \\le \\chi(S_r) \\le 1$, consistent with the thermodynamic requirement that only the water-filled portion of the pore network contributes to capillary force transfer to the skeleton.\n\nUsing these assumptions, derive an expression for the mean effective stress $p'$ of the skeleton as a function of $p$, $u_a$, $u_w$, and $\\chi(S_r)$, and then evaluate $p'$ for the following laboratory state:\n- Mean total stress $p = 300\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$,\n- Pore air pressure $u_a = 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$,\n- Pore water pressure $u_w = 120\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$,\n- Degree of saturation $S_r = 0.40$.\n\nFor a coarse-grained soil, adopt the following functional form for the effective stress parameter:\n$$\n\\chi(S_r) = \\left(\\frac{S_r - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}\\right)^{m}, \\quad S_r > S_r^{\\mathrm{res}},\n$$\nwith residual degree of saturation $S_r^{\\mathrm{res}} = 0.05$ and exponent $m = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Assume $S_r$ satisfies $S_r > S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}$ for the test state.\n\nAdditionally, compute the slope $\\dfrac{\\partial p'}{\\partial S_r}$ at the given state and comment on the physical interpretation of the sensitivity of $p'$ to $S_r$ for coarse-grained soils under the stated suction.\n\nReport only the numerical value of the mean effective stress $p'$ for the given state, rounded to four significant figures. Express the value in $\\mathrm{kPa}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the mean effective stress, $p'$, in an unsaturated soil based on thermodynamic work-conjugacy principles, followed by its evaluation for a specific state. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of poromechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe foundation for deriving the effective stress is the principle of virtual work applied to the solid skeleton of the porous medium. The incremental work done per unit volume on the solid skeleton, $\\delta W_{\\text{skel}}$, during a virtual volumetric strain increment, $\\delta\\varepsilon_v$, defines the mean effective stress $p'$ through the conjugate pairing:\n$$\n\\delta W_{\\text{skel}} = p' \\delta\\varepsilon_v\n$$\n\nThe problem statement provides two key assumptions for constructing $\\delta W_{\\text{skel}}$:\n1.  The virtual work is an additive decomposition of a contribution from the net mean stress and a contribution from suction.\n2.  The suction contribution is weighted by a saturation-dependent function $\\chi(S_r)$.\n\nLet us formalize these assumptions. The net mean stress is the difference between the mean total stress, $p$, and the pore air pressure, $u_a$, which is $(p - u_a)$. The pore air is considered to act over the entire area of the solid phase within a representative cross-section. The work done by this net stress over a strain increment $\\delta\\varepsilon_v$ is $(p-u_a)\\delta\\varepsilon_v$.\n\nMatric suction, $s$, is defined as the difference between the pore air and pore water pressures: $s = u_a - u_w$. This suction acts at the air-water interfaces (menisci) and pulls the soil particles together. The thermodynamic assumption is that the work associated with suction is proportional to $\\chi(S_r)s$. The parameter $\\chi(S_r)$ represents the fraction of the cross-sectional area over which the suction-induced stresses are effectively transmitted to the solid skeleton. Therefore, the work contribution from suction is $\\chi(S_r)s\\,\\delta\\varepsilon_v$.\n\nAccording to the provided additive decomposition, the total virtual work on the skeleton is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\delta W_{\\text{skel}} = (p - u_a)\\delta\\varepsilon_v + \\chi(S_r)s\\,\\delta\\varepsilon_v\n$$\nFactoring out the virtual strain increment $\\delta\\varepsilon_v$, we get:\n$$\n\\delta W_{\\text{skel}} = \\left[ (p - u_a) + \\chi(S_r)s \\right] \\delta\\varepsilon_v\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $\\delta W_{\\text{skel}} = p' \\delta\\varepsilon_v$, we can identify the expression for the mean effective stress $p'$:\n$$\np' = (p - u_a) + \\chi(S_r)s\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of suction, $s = u_a - u_w$, we obtain the mean effective stress as a function of the given variables:\n$$\np' = (p - u_a) + \\chi(S_r)(u_a - u_w)\n$$\nThis is the well-known Bishop's effective stress equation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $p'$ for the given laboratory state:\n- Mean total stress $p = 300\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\n- Pore air pressure $u_a = 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\n- Pore water pressure $u_w = 120\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\n- Degree of saturation $S_r = 0.40$\n\nFirst, we calculate the matric suction $s$:\n$$\ns = u_a - u_w = 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa} - 120\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 80\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the effective stress parameter $\\chi(S_r)$ using the provided functional form for a coarse-grained soil:\n$$\n\\chi(S_r) = \\left(\\frac{S_r - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}\\right)^{m}\n$$\nwith the parameters $S_r^{\\mathrm{res}} = 0.05$ and $m = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting the given value of $S_r = 0.40$:\n$$\n\\chi(0.40) = \\left(\\frac{0.40 - 0.05}{1 - 0.05}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{0.35}{0.95}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{19}}\n$$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\n\\chi(0.40) \\approx 0.606977\n$$\nNow, we can compute the mean effective stress $p'$:\n$$\np' = (p - u_a) + \\chi(S_r)s = (300\\,\\mathrm{kPa} - 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}) + \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{19}}\\right) (80\\,\\mathrm{kPa})\n$$\n$$\np' = 100\\,\\mathrm{kPa} + (0.606977) \\times (80\\,\\mathrm{kPa}) = 100\\,\\mathrm{kPa} + 48.55816\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\n$$\np' = 148.55816\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the mean effective stress is $148.6\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nAs an additional task, we compute the slope $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial S_r}$ at the given state. The sensitivity of $p'$ with respect to $S_r$ is found by differentiating the effective stress equation, holding $p$, $u_a$, and $u_w$ constant:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial S_r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_r} \\left[ (p - u_a) + \\chi(S_r)(u_a - u_w) \\right] = (u_a - u_w) \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r} = s \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r}\n$$\nWe need the derivative of $\\chi(S_r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_r} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{S_r - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}\\right)^{m} \\right] = m \\left(\\frac{S_r - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}\\right)^{m-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r} = \\frac{m}{S_r - S_r^{\\mathrm{res}}} \\chi(S_r)\n$$\nAt the given state ($S_r = 0.40$, $S_r^{\\mathrm{res}} = 0.05$, $m = 0.5$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r}\\bigg|_{S_r=0.40} = \\frac{0.5}{0.40 - 0.05} \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{19}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.35} \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{19}} \\approx \\frac{10}{7} \\times 0.606977 \\approx 0.86711\n$$\nNow, we calculate the slope of the effective stress:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial S_r} = s \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial S_r} = (80\\,\\mathrm{kPa})(0.86711) \\approx 69.37\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nThe physical interpretation of this positive slope is that, for a constant suction, an increase in the degree of saturation makes the suction more effective at pulling soil particles together, thereby increasing the mean effective stress. As the soil wets, the water phase becomes more continuous, enhancing the transmission of capillary forces to the solid skeleton. This phenomenon contributes to the hydro-mechanical coupling in unsaturated soils, where changes in hydraulic state (saturation) directly influence the mechanical stress state. For coarse-grained soils, $\\chi$ and thus $p'$ can be quite sensitive to $S_r$, especially at lower saturation levels.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the mean effective stress $p'$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$p' = 148.6\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: deriving the governing equations, computing the hydraulic conductivities, and evaluating the parameter sensitivities.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Relative Permeability Functions**\n\nThe flow of each phase (water, denoted by subscript $w$, and air, denoted by subscript $a$) is governed by Darcy's law:\n$$ \\mathbf{q}_p = -k_p \\frac{\\nabla P_p}{\\gamma_p} = -k_{p,\\mathrm{sat}} k_{rp} \\frac{\\nabla P_p}{\\gamma_p} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_p$ is the volumetric flux, $k_p$ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, $k_{p,\\mathrm{sat}}$ is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, $k_{rp}$ is the relative permeability, $P_p$ is the phase pressure, and $\\gamma_p$ is the specific weight of the fluid for phase $p \\in \\{w,a\\}$.\n\nThe first step is to define the effective saturation, $S_e$, which normalizes the degree of saturation $S_r$ with respect to its residual value $S_{r,\\mathrm{res}}$ and maximum value (assumed to be $1$ for full saturation):\n$$ S_e = \\frac{S_r - S_{r,\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_{r,\\mathrm{res}}} $$\nThe relative permeabilities are functions of this effective saturation. According to the Mualem model, the relative permeability for the wetting phase (water) is given by the integral expression:\n$$ k_{rw}(S_e) = S_e^{\\ell} \\left[ \\frac{\\int_0^{S_e} \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} ds}{\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} ds} \\right]^2 $$\nwhere $\\psi(s)$ is the matric suction head as a function of the dummy integration variable $s$ (representing effective saturation), and $\\ell$ is the pore-connectivity parameter.\n\nThe van Genuchten model provides the water retention curve, relating $S_e$ to $\\psi$:\n$$ S_e(\\psi) = \\left[ 1 + (\\alpha |\\psi|)^n \\right]^{-m} $$\nWe must invert this to find $\\psi(S_e)$. Taking suction $|\\psi|$ as a positive quantity:\n$$ S_e^{-1/m} = 1 + (\\alpha \\psi)^n \\implies \\psi(S_e) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( S_e^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)^{1/n} $$\nThus, the term in the integral is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} = \\alpha \\left( s^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)^{-1/n} $$\nThe constant $\\alpha$ will cancel out in the ratio of integrals. We focus on evaluating the integral $I(S_e) = \\int_0^{S_e} (s^{-1/m} - 1)^{-1/n} ds$. This integral has an analytical solution under the constraint $m = 1 - 1/n$. Let's perform the substitution $u = s^{1/m}$, which implies $s = u^m$ and $ds = m u^{m-1} du$. The limits of integration become $0$ and $S_e^{1/m}$.\n$$ I(S_e) = \\int_0^{S_e^{1/m}} (u^{-1} - 1)^{-1/n} (m u^{m-1} du) = m \\int_0^{S_e^{1/m}} \\left(\\frac{1-u}{u}\\right)^{-1/n} u^{m-1} du $$\n$$ I(S_e) = m \\int_0^{S_e^{1/m}} \\left(\\frac{u}{1-u}\\right)^{1/n} u^{m-1} du = m \\int_0^{S_e^{1/m}} u^{1/n + m - 1} (1-u)^{-1/n} du $$\nUsing the constraint $m = 1 - 1/n$, the exponent of $u$ becomes $1/n + (1 - 1/n) - 1 = 0$. The integral simplifies to:\n$$ I(S_e) = m \\int_0^{S_e^{1/m}} (1-u)^{-1/n} du $$\nThis can be integrated directly:\n$$ I(S_e) = m \\left[ \\frac{-(1-u)^{1-1/n}}{1-1/n} \\right]_0^{S_e^{1/m}} = -m \\left[ \\frac{(1-u)^m}{m} \\right]_0^{S_e^{1/m}} = - \\left[ (1-u)^m \\right]_0^{S_e^{1/m}} $$\n$$ I(S_e) = - \\left( (1-S_e^{1/m})^m - (1-0)^m \\right) = 1 - (1-S_e^{1/m})^m $$\nThe denominator in the Mualem expression is this integral evaluated at $S_e=1$:\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} ds \\propto 1 - (1-1^{1/m})^m = 1 $$\nTherefore, the integral ratio is simply $1 - (1-S_e^{1/m})^m$. Substituting this into the Mualem formula for $k_{rw}$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$ k_{rw}(S_e) = S_e^{\\ell} \\left[ 1 - \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^m \\right]^2 $$\nFor the non-wetting phase (air), the Mualem model is:\n$$ k_{ra}(S_e) = (1-S_e)^{\\ell} \\left[ \\frac{\\int_{S_e}^1 \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} ds}{\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\psi(s)} ds} \\right]^2 $$\nThe numerator integral is $\\int_{S_e}^1 \\frac{ds}{\\psi(s)} \\propto \\left[ -(1-s^{1/m})^m \\right]_{S_e}^1 = -(1-1)^m - (-(1-S_e^{1/m})^m) = (1-S_e^{1/m})^m$.\nSo the expression for $k_{ra}$ becomes:\n$$ k_{ra}(S_e) = (1-S_e)^{\\ell} \\left[ (1-S_e^{1/m})^m \\right]^2 = (1-S_e)^{\\ell} \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^{2m} $$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of Hydraulic Conductivities**\n\nWe are given the following values: $S_r = 0.60$, $S_{r,\\mathrm{res}} = 0.10$, $\\ell = 0.50$, $n = 2.00$, $k_{w,\\mathrm{sat}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ m/s, and $k_{a,\\mathrm{sat}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ m/s.\nFirst, we find the parameters $m$ and $S_e$:\n$$ m = 1 - \\frac{1}{n} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2.00} = 0.50 $$\n$$ S_e = \\frac{S_r - S_{r,\\mathrm{res}}}{1 - S_{r,\\mathrm{res}}} = \\frac{0.60 - 0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.50}{0.90} = \\frac{5}{9} $$\nNow we calculate the relative permeabilities $k_{rw}$ and $k_{ra}$.\nFor water:\n$$ S_e^{1/m} = \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^{1/0.5} = \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{81} $$\n$$ k_{rw} = \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^{0.5} \\left[ 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{25}{81}\\right)^{0.5} \\right]^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3} \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{56}{81}\\right)^{0.5} \\right]^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{56}}{9} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ k_{rw} \\approx 0.74536 \\left( 1 - \\frac{7.4833}{9} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.74536 (1 - 0.83148)^2 \\approx 0.74536 (0.16852)^2 \\approx 0.021171 $$\nThe unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for water is:\n$$ k_w = k_{w,\\mathrm{sat}} k_{rw} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times 0.021171 \\approx 4.2342 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\nFor air:\n$$ 1-S_e = 1 - \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} $$\n$$ 2m = 2 \\times 0.50 = 1.0 $$\n$$ k_{ra} = \\left(1 - S_e\\right)^{\\ell} \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^{2m} = \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^{0.5} \\left(1 - \\frac{25}{81}\\right)^{1} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{56}{81} = \\frac{112}{243} $$\n$$ k_{ra} \\approx 0.460905 $$\nThe unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for air is:\n$$ k_a = k_{a,\\mathrm{sat}} k_{ra} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times \\frac{112}{243} \\approx 6.9136 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Logarithmic Sensitivities**\n\nThe sensitivity of a conductivity $k_p$ to the parameter $\\ell$ is defined as $S_{k_p}^{(\\ell)} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln k_p}{\\partial \\ell}$.\nFor the water phase:\n$$ k_w = k_{w,\\mathrm{sat}} k_{rw} = k_{w,\\mathrm{sat}} S_e^{\\ell} \\left[ 1 - \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^m \\right]^2 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln k_w = \\ln(k_{w,\\mathrm{sat}}) + \\ell \\ln(S_e) + 2 \\ln\\left(1 - \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^m\\right) $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $\\ell$, noting that all other parameters are independent of $\\ell$:\n$$ S_{k_w}^{(\\ell)} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln k_w}{\\partial \\ell} = \\ln(S_e) $$\nFor the air phase:\n$$ k_a = k_{a,\\mathrm{sat}} k_{ra} = k_{a,\\mathrm{sat}} (1-S_e)^{\\ell} \\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right)^{2m} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln k_a = \\ln(k_{a,\\mathrm{sat}}) + \\ell \\ln(1-S_e) + 2m \\ln\\left(1 - S_e^{1/m}\\right) $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $\\ell$:\n$$ S_{k_a}^{(\\ell)} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln k_a}{\\partial \\ell} = \\ln(1-S_e) $$\nNow, we evaluate these sensitivities for the given state:\n$$ S_{k_w}^{(\\ell)} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right) \\approx -0.587786 $$\n$$ S_{k_a}^{(\\ell)} = \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{5}{9}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right) \\approx -0.810930 $$\n\n**Final Results**\nRounding the computed values to four significant figures:\n$k_w = 4.234 \\times 10^{-8}$ m/s\n$k_a = 6.914 \\times 10^{-6}$ m/s\n$S_{k_w}^{(\\ell)} = -0.5878$\n$S_{k_a}^{(\\ell)} = -0.8109$\n\nThese results are assembled into a row matrix.",

In the Barcelona Basic Model, a reduction in suction at constant net mean stress can induce plastic volumetric strains due to the inward movement of the loading–collapse surface, even without changes in net stress.\n\nE. In both models, the dilation angle at critical state increases with suction, so the critical state is not isochoric when $s>0$.\n\nF. The plastic flow rule in the Barcelona Basic Model contains an explicit suction-driven volumetric plastic strain component associated with wetting/drying yield mechanisms, whereas in suction-extended Modified Cam Clay with Bishop stress there is no explicit suction term in the plastic potential, so $ds$ affects plastic flow only indirectly through its impact on the mean effective stress and on hardening.\n\nSelect all that apply.",
            "solution": "We compare from first principles the two frameworks with respect to the critical state line and the roles of suction in hardening and plastic flow.\n\nFoundational definitions and concepts:\n\n- Suction is $s = u_a - u_w$. The net mean stress is $p^n = p - u_a$, where $p = (\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)/3$. The deviatoric stress is $q = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{2}\\, \\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s}}$ with $\\mathbf{s}$ the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor (under axisymmetric triaxial, $q = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3$).\n\n- Bishop’s effective stress defines the mean effective stress as $p' = p^n + \\chi(s)\\,s$, with $\\chi(s)$ a suction-dependent weighting in $[0,1]$. This provides a thermodynamically consistent work-conjugate stress for partially saturated media under common simplifying assumptions.\n\n- Critical state is characterized by isochoric plastic shear flow at constant stress, typically represented by a line $q = M \\, p_{\\text{cs}}$ in an appropriate $(q, \\text{mean stress})$ plane, with $M$ a material friction parameter for the critical state. At critical state, the plastic volumetric strain rate satisfies $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_v^p = 0$.\n\n- In Modified Cam Clay (MCC), the yield function in the saturated case can be written as $f(q, p'; p_c') = \\left(\\tfrac{q}{M}\\right)^2 + p'\\,(p' - p_c')$, with associative plastic flow and isotropic hardening governed by $dp_c' \\propto p_c' \\, d\\varepsilon_v^p$. A suction-extended MCC replaces $p'$ by Bishop’s effective stress and may allow $p_c'$ to evolve via the same plastic volumetric strain hardening law; if one excludes direct suction-hardening terms, $p_c'$ depends only on plastic volumetric strain history.\n\n- In the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM), the independent stress variables are $(p^n, s)$. The model includes a loading–collapse (LC) yield surface $p_0(s)$ in the $(p^n, s)$ plane, which expands with increasing $s$ (apparent preconsolidation grows) and contracts with decreasing $s$, thus incorporating suction-dependent hardening. BBM also includes wetting/drying yield mechanisms (e.g., suction increase or suction decrease yield loci) that may be activated by $ds$ even at constant $p^n$. Plastic flow is generally volumetric for the wetting/drying mechanisms, being contractive upon wetting (suction decrease) for collapsible soils.\n\nImplications for the critical state line:\n\n- In suction-extended MCC with Bishop’s stress, the CSL in $(q, p')$ remains $q = M \\, p'$; the slope $M$ and its form are the same as in saturation because the frictional mechanism at critical state is governed by the same associative flow and invariants in the effective stress space. In terms of net stress, this CSL is equivalently $q = M \\, (p^n + \\chi(s)\\,s)$, i.e., it is shifted in the $(q, p^n)$ plane by an amount proportional to $\\chi(s)\\,s$ but remains suction-invariant in $(q, p')$.\n\n- In BBM, if one represents critical state in terms of an effective-like mean stress $p^* = p^n + \\chi(s)\\,s$ with the same friction parameter $M$, then $q = M \\, p^*$ at critical state, consistent with a suction-invariant CSL in $(q, p^*)$. In terms of $(q, p^n)$ alone, the CSL exhibits a suction-dependent intercept (a rightward shift with increasing $s$), i.e., it does not pass through the origin for $s>0$ unless $\\chi(s) = 0$. Thus, expressing the CSL in $(q, p^n)$ makes it suction dependent, whereas in $(q, p^*)$ or $(q, p')$ it appears suction-invariant provided $M$ is treated as a material constant independent of $s$.\n\nImplications for hardening and plastic flow directions:\n\n- In suction-extended MCC with hardening driven solely by plastic volumetric strain, changes in $s$ enter only through $p' = p^n + \\chi(s)\\,s$. At fixed $p^n$, $dp' = \\chi(s)\\,ds + s\\,d\\chi(s)$. If the current state is strictly inside the yield surface, such changes induce elastic response. Plastic strains arise only if the change in $p'$ causes the state to reach the yield condition $f=0$. There is no explicit suction term in the plastic potential; flow directions are derived from $\\partial f/\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and are associative in effective stress space.\n\n- In BBM, the LC surface $p_0(s)$ contracts as $s$ decreases. Therefore, at constant $p^n$, wetting can bring the yield surface onto the current state, triggering plastic collapse strains (positive volumetric plastic strain in compression sign convention). This mechanism is activated by $ds$ without requiring a change in $p^n$. The plastic flow rule includes an explicit component associated with wetting/drying yield mechanisms, typically producing volumetric plastic contraction upon wetting and potentially small volumetric plastic expansion upon drying, distinct from the shear-induced associative flow.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. For suction-extended MCC in $(q, p')$, the CSL $q = M \\, p'$ is independent of $s$ because $p'$ already embeds suction. This matches the saturated form and is a core advantage of Bishop’s stress representation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. In BBM, in the $(q, p^n)$ plane the CSL does depend on $s$, exhibiting a suction-induced shift; it does not in general pass through the origin for $s>0$. Only in the trivial case $\\chi(s)=0$ would it pass through the origin, which is not generally valid. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. In suction-extended MCC with hardening driven solely by plastic volumetric strain, $ds$ at fixed $p^n$ affects $p'$, but plasticity ensues only when the state meets the yield surface; otherwise the response is elastic. There is no separate wetting/drying plastic mechanism. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. In BBM, decreasing $s$ at constant $p^n$ moves the LC surface inward; this can activate plastic collapse strains even without any change in $p^n$. This captures wetting-induced collapse. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. At critical state, by definition $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_v^p = 0$ (isochoric plastic flow), independent of suction in both frameworks when expressed in the appropriate mean stress variable. Suction does not make the critical state non-isochoric. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nF. BBM contains explicit suction-driven plastic mechanisms (e.g., along wetting/drying yield loci) that yield volumetric plastic strains due to $ds$, while suction-extended MCC with Bishop’s stress lacks an explicit suction term in the plastic potential; $ds$ influences plastic flow indirectly via its effect on $p'$ and on whether the yield surface is reached. Verdict: Correct.",
