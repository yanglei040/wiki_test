            "solution": "The problem will first be subject to rigorous validation to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe following data and conditions are explicitly provided in the problem statement:\n- The analysis method is two-dimensional discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA).\n- The contact is a single active vertex–edge normal contact between two rigid blocks.\n- The contact model is a linear normal penalty spring with stiffness $k_{n}$.\n- There is no viscous damping in the normal direction.\n- The signed gap, $g_{n}$, is positive for separation and negative for interpenetration.\n- The predicted overlap magnitude is $(-g_{n}) = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- The penalty stiffness is $k_{n} = 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$.\n- The normal contact force arises solely from the elastic penalty spring.\n- The reference configuration for the spring is zero overlap at the start of the step.\n- The incremental potential energy stored, $\\Delta \\Pi_{n}$, is the total elastic strain energy from zero overlap to the current overlap.\n- The normal contact force opposes interpenetration.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the penalty method, a standard and fundamental technique in computational mechanics for enforcing contact constraints. The concepts of linear elastic springs, potential energy, and force-displacement relationships are cornerstones of Newtonian mechanics. The context, Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA), is a well-established numerical method in computational geomechanics. The premises are scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($k_{n}$ and the overlap distance) to calculate the requested quantities (force and energy). The question is unambiguous, and a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal, and unbiased language. All terms are defined clearly (e.g., the sign convention for $g_{n}$).\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. The values provided ($k_n=10^9\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$, overlap $= 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$) are of a plausible order of magnitude for numerical simulations in this field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the normal contact force magnitude, $F_{n}$, and the incremental potential energy stored in the normal contact spring, $\\Delta \\Pi_{n}$, based on the principles of mechanics.\n\nLet us define the interpenetration distance, $d_n$, as the magnitude of the overlap. Based on the problem's definition of the signed gap $g_n$, where $g_n < 0$ signifies interpenetration, the overlap magnitude is given as $(-g_n)$.\nTherefore, the interpenetration distance is:\n$$d_n = -g_n = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**1. Magnitude of the Normal Contact Force ($F_{n}$)**\n\nThe contact is modeled as a linear elastic spring. According to Hooke's Law, the magnitude of the force, $F$, exerted by a linear spring is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. In this context, the force is the normal contact force magnitude $F_n$, and the displacement is the interpenetration distance $d_n$. The constant of proportionality is the spring stiffness, $k_n$.\n\nThe force-displacement relationship is:\n$$F_{n} = k_{n} d_{n}$$\nThe problem states that the force acts to oppose interpenetration, and we are asked for its magnitude, which is a positive scalar.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$k_{n} = 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$$\n$$d_{n} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe magnitude of the normal force is:\n$$F_{n} = (10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{N} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. The number $1000$ has four significant figures ($1, 0, 0, 0$). Thus, $F_{n} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**2. Incremental Potential Energy ($\\Delta \\Pi_{n}$)**\n\nThe potential energy, $\\Pi_n$, stored in a linear elastic spring is the work done to deform it from its reference (zero-energy) state. The problem specifies that the reference configuration is zero overlap, and the incremental energy $\\Delta \\Pi_n$ over the step is the total energy accumulated. The work done, and thus the stored potential energy, is the integral of the force over the displacement path from $0$ to $d_n$.\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\int_{0}^{d_n} F_{n}(x) \\,dx$$\nwhere $F_n(x) = k_n x$ is the force at an intermediate interpenetration $x$.\n\nSubstituting the force law into the integral:\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\int_{0}^{d_n} (k_{n} x) \\,dx = k_{n} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} x^{2} \\right]_{0}^{d_n} = \\frac{1}{2} k_{n} d_{n}^{2}$$\n\nThis demonstrates the principle of energy-force conjugacy. The force is the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the displacement:\n$$F_{n} = \\frac{d(\\Delta \\Pi_{n})}{d(d_{n})} = \\frac{d}{d(d_{n})}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_{n} d_{n}^{2}\\right) = k_{n} d_{n}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of our force and energy formulations.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the energy equation:\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\frac{1}{2} (10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2}$$\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10^{9} \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$$\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J} = 0.0005\\ \\mathrm{J}$$\n\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.0005$ has only one significant figure (the leading zeros are not significant). To express this value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros: $0.0005000$.\n\n**Final Result**\nThe requested quantities are the normal force magnitude $F_{n} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$ and the incremental potential energy $\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = 0.0005000\\ \\mathrm{J}$. These are to be reported as a row vector $(F_{n}, \\Delta \\Pi_{n})$.",

            "introduction": "Building upon the normal contact model, this exercise introduces the critical role of friction in block interactions. Real-world contacts exhibit stick-slip behavior, a non-linear phenomenon that DDA must capture.

            "problem": "In a Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) contact update for two deformable rock blocks, the interface friction is modeled by the classical Coulomb law. Let the signed tangential contact force be denoted by $f_{t}$ (positive in the local positive tangential direction), and let the normal contact reaction be denoted by $\\lambda_{n} \\ge 0$ (compression positive). The Coulomb friction model defines the admissible set for $f_{t}$ by $|f_{t}| \\le \\mu \\lambda_{n}$, where $\\mu$ is the friction coefficient. Under sticking, the inequality is strict and the elastic predictor remains admissible; under slipping, the inequality is active and the updated force lies on the boundary $|f_{t}| = \\mu \\lambda_{n}$ with direction aligned with the tangential slip tendency.\n\nDuring one time step, an elastic predictor (trial state) yields a trial tangential force $f_{t}^{\\text{trial}}$ that does not yet enforce the Coulomb admissibility. Using the principles of variational inequality and complementarity appropriate for frictional contact in computational plasticity analogs, determine whether the contact sticks or slips and compute the consistent updated tangential force $f_{t}$ that satisfies the Coulomb constraint and the sign convention given above.\n\nUse the following data: $\\mu = 0.6$, $f_{t}^{\\text{trial}} = 8$ kN (in the positive tangential direction), and $\\lambda_{n} = 10$ kN. Express the final $f_{t}$ in kN. No rounding is required; provide the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the final tangential contact force, $f_t$, based on a trial tangential force, $f_t^{\\text{trial}}$, a normal contact force, $\\lambda_n$, and a friction coefficient, $\\mu$, within the framework of the classical Coulomb friction model. This is a standard procedure in computational contact mechanics, often referred to as a return-mapping algorithm or a predictor-corrector scheme, which is analogous to procedures used in the theory of plasticity.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in enforcing the Coulomb admissibility condition. The Coulomb friction law states that the magnitude of the tangential force, $|f_t|$, cannot exceed the product of the friction coefficient, $\\mu$, and the magnitude of the normal force, $\\lambda_n$. The normal force is given as a positive compression, $\\lambda_n \\ge 0$. The admissibility criterion is therefore expressed as a variational inequality:\n$$\n|f_t| \\le \\mu \\lambda_n\n$$\nThis inequality defines an admissible set for the tangential force, which is a closed interval on the real number line: $f_t \\in [-\\mu \\lambda_n, \\mu \\lambda_n]$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two steps: a trial step (predictor) and a correction step (return-mapping).\n\nFirst, we must define the boundary of the admissible set. This boundary is determined by the maximum possible friction force, which we can denote as $f_{\\text{max}}$.\nGiven the data:\n- Friction coefficient, $\\mu = 0.6$\n- Normal contact reaction, $\\lambda_n = 10 \\text{ kN}$\n\nThe maximum admissible tangential force is calculated as:\n$$\nf_{\\text{max}} = \\mu \\lambda_n = 0.6 \\times 10 \\text{ kN} = 6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\nTherefore, the admissible range for the final tangential force $f_t$ is $|f_t| \\le 6 \\text{ kN}$, or equivalently, $f_t \\in [-6, 6]$.\n\nNext, we perform the admissibility check. We compare the trial tangential force, $f_t^{\\text{trial}}$, with the admissible set. The trial state is given as:\n- Trial tangential force, $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8 \\text{ kN}$\n\nWe check if the trial force lies within the admissible set by evaluating the condition $|f_t^{\\text{trial}}| \\le f_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\n|f_t^{\\text{trial}}| = |8 \\text{ kN}| = 8 \\text{ kN}\n$$\nComparing this to the maximum admissible force:\n$$\n8 \\text{ kN} > 6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\nSince $|f_t^{\\text{trial}}| > f_{\\text{max}}$, the trial force is outside the admissible set. This indicates that the assumption of an elastic \"stick\" condition is invalid. The contact must slip.\n\nBecause slipping occurs, a correction must be applied. The updated, physically consistent tangential force, $f_t$, must lie on the boundary of the admissible set. This is the \"return-mapping\" step, where the inadmissible trial state is projected onto the boundary of the admissible region. For the one-dimensional Coulomb model, this projection is a simple mapping to the nearest endpoint of the interval $[-\\mu \\lambda_n, \\mu \\lambda_n]$.\n\nThe direction of the final tangential force must be aligned with the direction of the slip tendency, which is given by the sign of the trial force $f_t^{\\text{trial}}$. The sign of the trial force is positive, since $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8 \\text{ kN}$. Therefore, the updated force $f_t$ must be on the positive boundary of the friction cone.\n\nThe updated tangential force is thus:\n$$\nf_t = f_{\\text{max}} \\cdot \\text{sgn}(f_t^{\\text{trial}})\n$$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(\\cdot)$ is the signum function.\nSince $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8 > 0$, we have $\\text{sgn}(f_t^{\\text{trial}}) = +1$.\nThe final tangential force is:\n$$\nf_t = (6 \\text{ kN}) \\cdot (+1) = 6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\nIn summary, the trial force of $8$ kN exceeds the friction capacity of $6$ kN, causing slip. During slip, the tangential force is equal to the friction capacity, and its direction opposes the impending motion (which is indicated by the direction of the trial force). Thus, the consistent tangential force is $6$ kN.",
