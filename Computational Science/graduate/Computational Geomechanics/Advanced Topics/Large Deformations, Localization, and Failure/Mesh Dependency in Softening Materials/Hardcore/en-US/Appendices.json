            "problem": "A prismatic one-dimensional bar of length $L$ and constant cross-sectional area $A$ is discretized for the Finite Element Method (FEM) into $N$ equal elements of length $h=L/N$. The bar is loaded in quasi-static, displacement-controlled tension such that after reaching peak stress, inelastic deformation localizes into a single element of length $h$ while the rest of the bar unloads elastically. The material exhibits linear elastic behavior up to a peak stress $\\sigma_{u}$ attained at strain $\\varepsilon_{u}$, followed by linear strain-softening down to zero stress at a failure strain $\\varepsilon_{f}(x)$, which may depend on the spatial coordinate $x$ in general.

Deformation localizes into a single element of length $h$. The rest of the bar unloads elastically.\n- Constitutive Law: Linear elastic behavior up to peak stress $\\sigma_{u}$ at strain $\\varepsilon_{u}$.

It addresses the classical issue of mesh dependency in computational modeling of strain-softening materials, a fundamental topic in computational mechanics. The concepts of linear softening, fracture energy $G_f$, and crack band regularization are standard and correctly described. The setup is self-contained and logical.\n\nHowever, there is a minor ambiguity in the definition of the dissipated energy, $W_d$. The provided integral, $W_{d}=\\int_{0}^{L}\\int_{\\varepsilon_{u}}^{\\varepsilon_{f}(x)}\\sigma(\\varepsilon)\\,d\\varepsilon\\,dx$, has units of energy per unit area ($J/m^2$), as $\\int\\sigma d\\varepsilon$ has units of stress (force/area) and the outer integral is over length. In contrast, the problem later refers to the energy dissipated in the localized element as $G_{f}A$, which has units of energy ($J$). Furthermore, it asks to express the final \"energy in Joules\". This strongly suggests that $W_d$ is intended to represent the total dissipated energy in the bar, which is an integral over the volume. The provided integral appears to be missing the cross-sectional area $A$. Assuming this is a notational oversight, the problem is solvable by using the physically consistent definition of total dissipated energy:\n$$ W_{d} = \\int_{V} \\left( \\int_{\\varepsilon_{u}}^{\\varepsilon_{f}(\\mathbf{x})} \\sigma(\\varepsilon) \\, d\\varepsilon \\right) dV = \\int_{0}^{L} A \\left( \\int_{\\varepsilon_{u}}^{\\varepsilon_{f}(x)} \\sigma(\\varepsilon) \\, d\\varepsilon \\right) dx $$\nThis interpretation renders the problem statement fully consistent. With this clarification, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**\n, with the clarification that $W_d$ represents the total dissipated energy. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving a general expression for the total dissipated energy, $W_d$. This expression will then be evaluated for the two specified material models.\n\nThe specific dissipated energy, or energy dissipated per unit volume, $w_d$, is the area under the stress-strain curve during softening. Given a linear softening branch from $(\\varepsilon_{u}, \\sigma_{u})$ to $(\\varepsilon_{f}, 0)$, this area is that of a triangle:\n$$ w_d = \\int_{\\varepsilon_{u}}^{\\varepsilon_{f}} \\sigma(\\varepsilon) \\, d\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2} (\\varepsilon_f - \\varepsilon_u) \\sigma_u $$\nThe problem states that inelastic deformation (and thus energy dissipation) is confined to a single element of length $h$. Outside this element, the material unloads elastically, so there is no energy dissipation. The volume of this single localized element is $V_{loc} = A \\cdot h$.\nThe total dissipated energy $W_d$ for the entire bar is the specific dissipated energy multiplied by the volume over which it occurs:\n$$ W_d = w_d \\cdot V_{loc} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_u (\\varepsilon_f - \\varepsilon_u) \\right] A h $$\nThis general expression forms the basis for analyzing the two cases.\n\n**Case 1: Purely Local Strain-Softening Material**\nIn a purely local constitutive model, the material properties are considered intrinsic and independent of the discretization. Thus, the failure strain $\\varepsilon_f$ is a constant material parameter, let's call it $\\varepsilon_{f,m}$. Substituting this into the general expression for $W_d$:\n$$ W_{d, \\text{local}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_u (\\varepsilon_{f,m} - \\varepsilon_u) A h $$\nThis result shows that the total dissipated energy is directly proportional to the element size, $h$. As the finite element mesh is refined, $h \\to 0$, and consequently $W_{d, \\text{local}} \\to 0$. This implies that with an infinitely fine mesh, the structure would require zero energy to fracture, a physically spurious result known as pathological mesh dependency.\n\n**Case 2: Crack Band Regularized Material**\nThe crack band model regularizes the problem by enforcing that the total energy dissipated in the localization band equals a mesh-independent material property. The problem specifies that this energy is $G_f A$, where $G_f$ is the fracture energy (energy per unit area of crack). Since dissipation only occurs in the localized element, the total dissipated energy for the bar, $W_d$, must equal this value.\n$$ W_{d, \\text{reg}} = G_f A $$\nThis is, by definition, the dissipated energy for the regularized case. To achieve this mesh-objective result, the material parameter $\\varepsilon_f$ can no longer be a constant. Instead, it must be adjusted based on the element size $h$. We enforce the condition by equating the general expression for $W_d$ with the target regularized energy:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_u (\\varepsilon_f - \\varepsilon_u) \\right] A h = G_f A $$\nWe can solve for the required failure strain $\\varepsilon_f$ as a function of $h$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_u (\\varepsilon_f - \\varepsilon_u) h = G_f $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_f - \\varepsilon_u = \\frac{2 G_f}{\\sigma_u h} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_f(h) = \\varepsilon_u + \\frac{2 G_f}{\\sigma_u h} $$\nThis relationship shows that for the regularized model, the softening modulus of the material is not constant but is adapted to the element size $h$ to ensure that the work of fracture remains constant. As the mesh is refined ($h \\to 0$), the required failure strain $\\varepsilon_f \\to \\infty$, making the softening response more brittle in the stress-strain diagram, but ensuring the total energy dissipation remains constant and physically meaningful.\n\n**Demonstration of Mesh-Objective Dissipation**\nA comparison of the two cases demonstrates the effect of regularization:\n- For the local model, $W_{d, \\text{local}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_u (\\varepsilon_{f,m} - \\varepsilon_u) A h$. The dissipated energy depends on the mesh size $h$ and vanishes as $h \\to 0$.\n- For the regularized model, $W_{d, \\text{reg}} = G_f A$. The dissipated energy is a constant material property, independent of the mesh size $h$.\n\nBy making the constitutive law (specifically, the softening behavior) dependent on the element size, the crack band model ensures that the total energy consumed during fracture is a mesh-objective quantity, resolving the pathological dependency observed in the local model.\n\nThe final answer required is the single closed-form analytical expression for the total dissipated energy in the regularized case. As established by the definition of the regularization procedure given in the problem, this energy is $G_f A$.",

We can simplify the integral by integrating over half the domain and multiplying by $2$:\n$$\nM = 2 \\int_{0}^{l} \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{l}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}s = 2 \\left[ s - \\frac{s^2}{2l} \\right]_{0}^{l} = 2 \\left(l - \\frac{l^2}{2l}\\right) = 2 \\left(l - \\frac{l}{2}\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right) = l\n$$\nThus, the full-space normalization constant is $M=l$. This result is also geometrically intuitive, as it is the area of a triangle with base $2l$ and height $1$.\n\nFinally, we determine the multiplicative renormalization factor $c(x)$ such that $c(x)D(x) = M$ for all $x \\in [0,l]$. From this relation, we have:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{M}{D(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $M$ and $D(x)$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{l}{\\frac{l}{2} + x - \\frac{x^2}{2l}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $2l$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{l(2l)}{(\\frac{l}{2} + x - \\frac{x^2}{2l})(2l)} = \\frac{2l^2}{l^2 + 2lx - x^2}\n$$\nThe two required expressions are therefore $D(x) = \\frac{l}{2} + x - \\frac{x^2}{2l}$ and $c(x) = \\frac{2l^2}{l^2 + 2lx - x^2}$.",
