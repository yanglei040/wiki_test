            "introduction": "A geothermal reservoir's value is tied to its ability to transport fluid and heat. In many cases, this transport is dominated by a network of fractures rather than the rock matrix itself. This first practice challenges you to build a macroscopic property—permeability—from the microscopic geometry of individual fractures, demonstrating how simple physical laws can be scaled up to characterize a complex system and reveal directional dependencies in flow.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit idealized, problem in the hydrogeology of fractured media, requiring derivation from first principles.\n\nWe begin by establishing the relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient for a single fracture, modeled as two smooth, parallel plates. We consider steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. Let the fracture be oriented such that flow is in the $x$-direction, and the plates are located at $z = \\pm b/2$, where $b$ is the fracture aperture. The governing equation is the reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations for this geometry, which describes the momentum balance:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 v_x}{dz^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nHere, $v_x$ is the fluid velocity in the $x$-direction, which varies only with $z$, and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is the constant pressure gradient driving the flow.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dv_x}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z + C_1\n$$\n$$\nv_x(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by applying the no-slip boundary conditions, $v_x(z = \\pm b/2) = 0$.\nDue to the symmetry of the velocity profile, the maximum velocity must occur at $z=0$, which implies that $\\frac{dv_x}{dz}|_{z=0} = 0$. This gives $C_1 = 0$.\nApplying the second boundary condition at $z = b/2$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{b^2}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants back, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$\nv_x(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( z^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\left( \\frac{b^2}{4} - z^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe volumetric flow rate per unit width of the fracture, $q_f$, is found by integrating the velocity profile across the aperture:\n$$\nq_f = \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} v_x(z) \\,dz = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\left( z^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4} \\right) \\,dz\n$$\n$$\nq_f = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{z^3}{3} - \\frac{b^2 z}{4} \\right]_{-b/2}^{b/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ 2 \\left( \\frac{(b/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{b^2(b/2)}{4} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nq_f = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{b^3}{24} - \\frac{b^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{b^3 - 3b^3}{24} \\right) = -\\frac{b^3}{12\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nThis result is the well-known cubic law for flow between parallel plates.\n\nNext, we homogenize the fractured medium to find the equivalent directional permeabilities $k_x$ and $k_y$. We use a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) argument. The rock matrix permeability is negligible, so all flow is carried by the fractures.\n\nTo find $k_x$, we consider a macroscopic pressure gradient in the $x$-direction. The flow occurs along Fracture Set 1, which consists of vertical fractures with traces aligned with the $x$-direction (i.e., planes parallel to the $x-z$ plane). These fractures have aperture $b_1$ and are separated by a spacing $s_1$. Consider an REV of dimensions $L_x \\times L_y \\times L_z$. The macroscopic Darcy flux in the $x$-direction, $Q_x$, is the total volumetric flow rate $\\mathcal{V}_x$ divided by the total area $A_x = L_y L_z$ normal to the flow.\nThe number of Set 1 fractures crossing the area $A_x$ over the length $L_y$ is $N_1 = L_y / s_1$.\nThe total volumetric flow rate is the flow rate in a single fracture multiplied by the number of fractures:\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}_x = N_1 \\times (q_{f1} \\times L_z) = \\left( \\frac{L_y}{s_1} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{b_1^3}{12\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right) L_z\n$$\nThe Darcy flux is then:\n$$\nQ_x = \\frac{\\mathcal{V}_x}{A_x} = \\frac{1}{L_y L_z} \\left( \\frac{L_y L_z}{s_1} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{b_1^3}{12\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right) = -\\frac{b_1^3}{12\\mu s_1} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nBy definition, Darcy's law for the homogenized medium is $Q_x = -\\frac{k_x}{\\mu} \\frac{DP}{dx}$, where $k_x$ is the permeability and $\\frac{DP}{dx}$ is the macroscopic pressure gradient, which is equivalent to the local gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ in the fractures. Comparing the two expressions for $Q_x$, we identify the permeability in the $x$-direction:\n$$\nk_x = \\frac{b_1^3}{12 s_1}\n$$\nBy an identical argument for flow in the $y$-direction, carried by Fracture Set 2 (aperture $b_2$, spacing $s_2$), we find the permeability in the $y$-direction:\n$$\nk_y = \\frac{b_2^3}{12 s_2}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values. All lengths must be in meters.\nGiven:\n$b_1 = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$s_1 = 5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$b_2 = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$s_2 = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nComputing $k_x$:\n$$\nk_x = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12 \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{60\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{8.0}{60} \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 1.333... \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $k_x = 1.33 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nComputing $k_y$:\n$$\nk_y = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12 \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{125 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{24\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{125}{24} \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 5.2083... \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $k_y = 5.21 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nFinally, we explain the physical reason for the permeability anisotropy. The $x$-direction is significantly more permeable ($k_x \\gg k_y$). As shown by the derived expressions, permeability is proportional to the fracture aperture cubed ($b^3$) and inversely proportional to the fracture spacing ($s$). The fractures aligned for $x$-direction flow (Set 1) are much wider than those for $y$-direction flow, and this effect, magnified by the cubic power, overwhelmingly dominates the countervailing effect of Set 1 fractures being more widely spaced.",

            "solution": "The analysis begins with the provided governing equation for one-dimensional heat transport in a porous medium, which accounts for advection and conduction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + |\\boldsymbol{v}|\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\alpha_{t}\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} T}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nHere, $T$ is temperature, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $|\\boldsymbol{v}|$ is the magnitude of the Darcy velocity, and $\\alpha_t$ is the thermal diffusivity of the saturated porous medium.\n\nThe problem requires a nondimensionalization of this equation to identify the dimensionless group that quantifies the relative importance of advective and conductive heat transport.
