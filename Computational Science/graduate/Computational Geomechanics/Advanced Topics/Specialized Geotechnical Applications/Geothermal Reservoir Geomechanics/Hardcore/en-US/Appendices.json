This exercise introduces the Péclet number, a crucial dimensionless group that quantifies the relative strength of these two processes. By calculating and interpreting the Péclet number, we can immediately classify a reservoir's thermal behavior and determine whether simpler advection- or conduction-dominated models are appropriate .",

The specified characteristic scales are the length of the reservoir segment, $L$, for the spatial coordinate, and the conductive time scale, $t_c = L^2/\\alpha_t$, for time.
