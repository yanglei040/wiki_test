Then, (ii) compute the resultant active thrust on the wall per unit length and its point of application measured vertically from the wall base. Next, (iii) adopt Jaky’s empirical relationship for the coefficient of earth pressure at rest, namely the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (EPR) $K_{0}$ as a function of $\\phi$, and compute the corresponding at-rest resultant thrust on the wall per unit length for the same configuration.

The stress is negative for $z  z_t$ and positive for $z > z_t$.

It can predict tensile stresses (negative pressures) due to the cohesion term $c^{\\prime}$. However, the interface between the soil and the retaining wall is a frictional contact. Soils, being particulate materials, and their interfaces with structures like walls, generally cannot sustain significant tensile forces. When the theory predicts a tensile stress $\\sigma_h  0$, it implies the wall would need to pull on the soil to maintain contact. Physically, this is impossible. The soil simply separates from the wall, forming a gap known as a \"tension crack\". Within this gap, the pressure exerted on the wall is zero, not negative. This is a crucial aspect of soil-structure interaction. Therefore, any computed negative pressures are physically inadmissible at the boundary, and the stress distribution is truncated at zero for practical design.\n\n- **Condition for No Lateral Earth Pressure**: The wall would experience no lateral earth pressure if the theoretical pressure distribution is non-positive over its entire height. The active pressure $\\sigma_h(z) = K_a \\gamma z - 2c'\\sqrt{K_a}$ is a linearly increasing function of depth $z$. It is most negative at the surface ($z=0$) and increases to its maximum value at the base of the wall ($z=H$). If the pressure at the base of the wall is zero or negative, it will be negative for all $z \\in [0, H)$. The condition for no resultant lateral pressure is therefore $\\sigma_h(H) \\leq 0$.\n$$\nK_a \\gamma H - 2c^{\\prime}\\sqrt{K_a} \\leq 0\n$$\n$$\nK_a \\gamma H \\leq 2c^{\\prime}\\sqrt{K_a}\n$$\n$$\nH \\leq \\frac{2c^{\\prime}}{\\gamma \\sqrt{K_a}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the condition $H \\leq z_t$. If the height of the wall is less than or equal to the theoretical tension crack depth, a crack can form over the full height of the wall, and the soil can stand vertically without support from the wall. In this case, the net thrust $P_a$ on the wall is zero. This height is known as the critical height of an unsupported vertical cut.",

The soil block is part of a larger soil mass under plane strain conditions ($\\epsilon_z = 0$, where $z$ is the out-of-plane direction).

The relevant elastic modulus for this condition is the constrained modulus, $M$ (also known as the oedometric modulus, $E_{oed}$).\n\nWe derive $M$ from the 3D isotropic linear elastic constitutive relations, with local coordinates $(n, s, z)$ for normal, shear (parallel to wall), and out-of-plane directions:\n$$ \\epsilon_n = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_n - \\nu_s (\\sigma_s + \\sigma_z) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_s = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_s - \\nu_s (\\sigma_n + \\sigma_z) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ \\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_z - \\nu_s (\\sigma_n + \\sigma_s) \\right] = 0 $$\nFrom $\\epsilon_z=0$, we have $\\sigma_z = \\nu_s(\\sigma_n + \\sigma_s)$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\epsilon_s=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_s - \\nu_s (\\sigma_n + \\nu_s(\\sigma_n + \\sigma_s)) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_s - \\nu_s \\sigma_n - \\nu_s^2 \\sigma_n - \\nu_s^2 \\sigma_s = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_s (1 - \\nu_s^2) = \\sigma_n (\\nu_s + \\nu_s^2) = \\sigma_n \\nu_s (1+\\nu_s) $$\n$$ \\sigma_s = \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\sigma_n $$\nNow we find $\\epsilon_n$ in terms of $\\sigma_n$. First, we note $\\sigma_z = \\sigma_s$:\n$$ \\sigma_z = \\nu_s \\left(\\sigma_n + \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\sigma_n\\right) = \\nu_s \\sigma_n \\left(1 + \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s}\\right) = \\nu_s \\sigma_n \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\nu_s}\\right) = \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\sigma_n $$\nSubstitute $\\sigma_s$ and $\\sigma_z$ into the expression for $\\epsilon_n$:\n$$ \\epsilon_n = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_n - \\nu_s \\left( \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\sigma_n + \\frac{\\nu_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\sigma_n \\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{E_s} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{2\\nu_s^2}{1-\\nu_s} \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_n = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{E_s} \\left[ \\frac{1-\\nu_s-2\\nu_s^2}{1-\\nu_s} \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{E_s} \\frac{(1+\\nu_s)(1-2\\nu_s)}{1-\\nu_s} $$\nThe constrained modulus is $M = \\sigma_n / \\epsilon_n$:\n$$ M = \\frac{E_s(1-\\nu_s)}{(1+\\nu_s)(1-2\\nu_s)} $$\nThe normal displacement across the soil block of thickness $h_n$ is $u_{soil, n} = \\epsilon_n h_n = (\\sigma_n/M)h_n$. The effective stiffness of this block, per unit area, is $K_{soil,n} = \\sigma_n / u_{soil,n} = M/h_n$.\n\nApplying the modeling principle for the normal direction:\n$$ \\Delta u_{int, n} = \\gamma \\cdot u_{soil, n} \\implies \\frac{\\sigma_n}{k_n} = \\gamma \\frac{\\sigma_n h_n}{M} $$\n$$ k_n = \\frac{M}{\\gamma h_n} = \\frac{E_s(1-\\nu_s)}{\\gamma h_n (1+\\nu_s)(1-2\\nu_s)} $$\n\n**2. Shear Stiffness, $k_s$**\n\nLet $\\tau_{ns}$ be a shear traction applied parallel to the wall. The relative shear displacement at the interface is:\n$$ \\Delta u_{int, s} = \\frac{\\tau_{ns}}{k_s} $$\nThe shear deformation of the adjacent soil block is governed by the soil's shear modulus, $G_s$. For an isotropic material:\n$$ G_s = \\frac{E_s}{2(1+\\nu_s)} $$\nThe shear strain in the soil block is $\\gamma_{ns} = \\tau_{ns}/G_s$. The shear displacement across the thickness $h_n$ is $u_{soil, s} = \\gamma_{ns} h_n = (\\tau_{ns}/G_s)h_n$. The effective shear stiffness of the block, per unit area, is $K_{soil,s} = \\tau_{ns} / u_{soil,s} = G_s/h_n$.\n\nApplying the modeling principle for the shear direction:\n$$ \\Delta u_{int, s} = \\gamma \\cdot u_{soil, s} \\implies \\frac{\\tau_{ns}}{k_s} = \\gamma \\frac{\\tau_{ns} h_n}{G_s} $$\n$$ k_s = \\frac{G_s}{\\gamma h_n} = \\frac{E_s}{2\\gamma h_n (1+\\nu_s)} $$\n\n**3.
