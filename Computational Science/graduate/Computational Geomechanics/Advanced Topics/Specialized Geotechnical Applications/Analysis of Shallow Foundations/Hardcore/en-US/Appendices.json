It is a standard exercise in applying fundamental principles of continuum mechanics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n#### Boussinesq's Solution for a Point Load\nThe problem begins with Boussinesq's solution for a vertical point load $P$ applied at the origin on the surface of a linear elastic half-space. The stress components in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, z)$ are functions of the load $P$, the coordinates $(r,z)$, and the material's Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$. The problem asks for the nonzero stress components beneath the point load, which corresponds to the axis $r=0$. Due to axial symmetry, all shear stresses are zero on this axis. The nonzero stress components are the principal stresses $\\sigma_z$, $\\sigma_r$, and $\\sigma_\\theta$.\n\nAt a point $(0, z)$ on the axis of the load, these are given by:\n-   Vertical stress: $\\sigma_z(0, z) = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi z^2}$\n-   Radial stress: $\\sigma_r(0, z) = -\\frac{P(1-2\\nu)}{4\\pi z^2}$\n-   Hoop stress: $\\sigma_\\theta(0, z) = \\sigma_r(0, z) = -\\frac{P(1-2\\nu)}{4\\pi z^2}$\n\nFor the main part of the problem, we only need the vertical stress component $\\sigma_z$ at a general point $(r, z)$, which is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_z(r, z) = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi} \\frac{z^3}{(r^2 + z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\n\n#### Discretization and Superposition\nThe square footing of side length $B$ is subjected to a uniform pressure $q$. The total load is $qB^2$. We discretize the loaded area into an $M \\times M$ grid of smaller, equal square subareas.\n\n-   The side length of each subarea is $b = B/M$.\n-   The area of each subarea is $A_{sub} = b^2 = (B/M)^2 = B^2/M^2$.\n-   The load on each subarea is treated as a concentrated point load, $dP$, applied at the centroid of the subarea. The magnitude of this point load is:\n    $$\n    dP = q \\cdot A_{sub} = q \\frac{B^2}{M^2}\n    $$\nWe define a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the footing. The subareas are indexed by $i$ and $j$, where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, M\\}$. The centroid of the $(i, j)$-th subarea has coordinates $(x_i, y_j)$. The $x$-coordinate of the centroid of the $i$-th column of subareas is given by:\n$$\nx_i = -\\frac{B}{2} + (i - \\frac{1}{2}) \\frac{B}{M} = \\frac{B}{M} \\left(i - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{M}{2}\\right) = \\frac{B}{M} \\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, the $y$-coordinate of the centroid of the $j$-th row of subareas is:\n$$\ny_j = \\frac{B}{M} \\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe vertical stress $\\sigma_z(0, z)$ at the point of interest $(0, 0, z)$ is found by superposing the contributions from each of the $M^2$ point loads. The contribution from the load $dP$ at $(x_i, y_j)$ is found using the Boussinesq formula, where the horizontal distance from the load to the point of evaluation is $r_{ij} = \\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_j^2}$.\nThe stress contribution from subarea $(i,j)$ is $d\\sigma_{z,ij}$:\n$$\nd\\sigma_{z,ij} = \\frac{3(dP)}{2\\pi} \\frac{z^3}{(r_{ij}^2 + z^2)^{5/2}} = \\frac{3}{2\\pi} \\left(q \\frac{B^2}{M^2}\\right) \\frac{z^3}{(x_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\nThe total vertical stress is the sum of all contributions:\n$$\n\\sigma_z(0, z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} d\\sigma_{z,ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{3qB^2}{2\\pi M^2} \\frac{z^3}{(x_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\n\n#### Non-dimensionalization\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless influence factor $I(M,\\eta) = \\sigma_z(0,z)/q$ and the dimensionless depth $\\eta = z/B$.\n$$\nI(M,\\eta) = \\frac{\\sigma_z(0, z)}{q} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{3B^2}{2\\pi M^2} \\frac{z^3}{(x_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2)^{5/2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $x_i$, $y_j$, and $z = \\eta B$:\n$$\nx_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2 = \\left[\\frac{B}{M}\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)\\right]^2 + \\left[\\frac{B}{M}\\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)\\right]^2 + (\\eta B)^2\n$$\nFactoring out $B^2$:\n$$\nx_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2 = B^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\eta^2 \\right]\n$$\nNow we substitute this into the denominator of the expression for $I(M,\\eta)$:\n$$\n(x_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2)^{5/2} = \\left(B^2\\right)^{5/2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left\\{\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2\\right\\} + \\eta^2 \\right]^{5/2}\n$$\n$$\n(x_i^2 + y_j^2 + z^2)^{5/2} = B^5 \\left[ \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left\\{\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2\\right\\} + \\eta^2 \\right]^{5/2}\n$$\nThe numerator of the summation term is $3B^2 z^3 = 3B^2 (\\eta B)^3 = 3\\eta^3 B^5$.\nSubstituting back into the expression for $I(M,\\eta)$:\n$$\nI(M,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{3\\eta^3 B^5}{2\\pi M^2 \\left( B^5 \\left[ \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left\\{\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2\\right\\} + \\eta^2 \\right]^{5/2} \\right)}\n$$\nThe $B^5$ terms cancel, yielding the final dimensionless expression:\n$$\nI(M,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{3\\eta^3}{2\\pi M^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left\\{\\left(i - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(j - \\frac{M+1}{2}\\right)^2\\right\\} + \\eta^2 \\right]^{-5/2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed analytic form for the influence factor as a finite double sum in terms of $M$ and $\\eta$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and consistency before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and definitions are provided in the problem statement:\n-   A rigid mat foundation of very large plan dimensions.\n-   The foundation is on a saturated, homogeneous clay layer over a rigid base.\n-   Clay layer thickness: $H = 4.0$ m.\n-   The stress increment is idealized as a spatially uniform contact pressure $q$ over the entire thickness $H$.\n-   The clay is modeled as a linear, isotropic, small-strain, one-dimensional compressible material.\n-   The constitutive relationship is given by: axial strain equals vertical stress increment divided by the constrained modulus $M$.\n-   Constrained modulus: $M = 30$ MPa.\n-   Allowable total settlement for Serviceability Limit State (SLS): $s_{allow} = 25$ mm.\n-   Ultimate bearing capacity: $q_u = 600$ kPa.\n-   Required factor of safety for Ultimate Geotechnical State (UGS): $FS = 3$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses fundamental concepts from soil mechanics and foundation engineering, including one-dimensional consolidation theory, limit state design (SLS and UGS), ultimate bearing capacity, and factor of safety. The idealization of a large mat foundation causing uniform stress increase for one-dimensional settlement calculation is a standard and valid engineering practice.

There are no contradictions.\n-   **Realism:** The given values for clay thickness, constrained modulus, settlement allowance, ultimate capacity, and factor of safety are all within realistic ranges for typical civil engineering projects.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, consistent, and realistic. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the allowable uniform contact pressure, $q_{allow}$, that simultaneously satisfies two conditions: the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) and the Ultimate Geotechnical State (UGS). This requires calculating the maximum pressure permitted by each limit state and selecting the more restrictive (i.e., lower) value.\n\n**1. Serviceability Limit State (SLS) Analysis**\nThe SLS is governed by the allowable settlement, $s_{allow}$. We must find the pressure, $q_{SLS}$, that would cause this exact amount of settlement.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the clay behaves as a one-dimensional compressible material. The vertical strain, $\\epsilon_z$, under a vertical stress increment, $\\Delta\\sigma_v$, is given by the constitutive law:\n$$\n\\epsilon_z = \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_v}{M}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the stress increment within the clay is uniform and equal to the applied contact pressure, so $\\Delta\\sigma_v = q$.\n$$\n\\epsilon_z = \\frac{q}{M}\n$$\nFor small strains, the vertical strain is also defined as the total settlement (change in thickness), $s$, divided by the initial thickness of the clay layer, $H$.\n$$\n\\epsilon_z = \\frac{s}{H}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for strain gives the relationship between pressure and settlement:\n$$\n\\frac{s}{H} = \\frac{q}{M}\n$$\nSolving for the settlement $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{qH}{M}\n$$\nThe SLS condition is that the calculated settlement $s$ must not exceed the allowable settlement $s_{allow}$:\n$$\ns \\le s_{allow}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s$, we find the constraint on the pressure $q$:\n$$\n\\frac{qH}{M} \\le s_{allow}\n$$\nThe maximum pressure that satisfies the SLS criterion, which we denote as $q_{SLS}$, is therefore:\n$$\nq_{SLS} = \\frac{s_{allow} M}{H}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given values, ensuring unit consistency. Let's use kPa for pressure/modulus and meters for length.\n-   $s_{allow} = 25$ mm $= 0.025$ m.\n-   $M = 30$ MPa $= 30,000$ kPa.\n-   $H = 4.0$ m.\n\n$$\nq_{SLS} = \\frac{(0.025 \\, \\text{m}) \\times (30,000 \\, \\text{kPa})}{4.0 \\, \\text{m}} = \\frac{750 \\, \\text{kPa} \\cdot \\text{m}}{4.0 \\, \\text{m}} = 187.5 \\, \\text{kPa}\n$$\nSo, the maximum allowable pressure based on the serviceability limit is $187.5$ kPa.\n\n**2. Ultimate Geotechnical State (UGS) Analysis**\nThe UGS is concerned with ensuring the foundation is safe from catastrophic bearing failure. This is managed by applying a factor of safety, $FS$, to the ultimate bearing capacity, $q_u$.\n\nThe allowable bearing capacity, which we denote as $q_{UGS}$, is defined as:\n$$\nq_{UGS} = \\frac{q_u}{FS}\n$$\nThe UGS condition is that the applied pressure $q$ must not exceed this allowable bearing capacity:\n$$\nq \\le q_{UGS}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $q_u = 600$ kPa.\n-   $FS = 3$.\n\n$$\nq_{UGS} = \\frac{600 \\, \\text{kPa}}{3} = 200 \\, \\text{kPa}\n$$\nSo, the maximum allowable pressure based on the ultimate geotechnical state is $200$ kPa.\n\n**3. Determination of Allowable Contact Pressure, $q_{allow}$**\nThe design must satisfy both the SLS and UGS conditions. This means the applied pressure $q$ must be less than or equal to both $q_{SLS}$ and $q_{UGS}$. Therefore, the overall allowable contact pressure, $q_{allow}$, is the minimum of the two values:\n$$\nq_{allow} = \\min(q_{SLS}, q_{UGS})\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nq_{allow} = \\min(187.5 \\, \\text{kPa}, 200 \\, \\text{kPa}) = 187.5 \\, \\text{kPa}\n$$\nThe lower value comes from the Serviceability Limit State. Therefore, the design is **governed by settlement (SLS)**.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nq_{allow} = 187.5 \\, \\text{kPa} \\approx 188 \\, \\text{kPa}\n$$\nThe allowable uniform contact pressure is $188$ kPa.",

Otherwise, they are tied.\n- **Units**: $q_u$ in $\\mathrm{kPa}$, lengths ($B, D_f$) in $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\gamma$ in $\\mathrm{kN/m^3}$, $\\phi'$ in radians.\n- **Test Cases**:\n    1. $(B, D_f, \\phi', \\gamma) = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.6108652381980153\\,\\mathrm{rad}, 18.0\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3})$\n    2. $(B, D_f, \\phi', \\gamma) = (1.5\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.4363323129985824\\,\\mathrm{rad}, 16.0\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3})$\n    3. $(B, D_f, \\phi', \\gamma) = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.5235987755982988\\,\\mathrm{rad}, 17.0\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3})$\n    4. $(B, D_f, \\phi', \\gamma) = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}, 0.7330382858376184\\,\\mathrm{rad}, 20.0\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3})$\n\n#### Validation Assessment\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the classical theory of plasticity for determining the bearing capacity of shallow foundations, a cornerstone of geotechnical engineering. The use of bearing capacity factors $N_q$ and $N_\\gamma$ as functions of $\\phi'$ is standard practice. The sensitivity analysis is a standard mathematical technique. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary parameters, equations, and criteria are provided. The request to use \"standard, well-tested definitions\" for $N_q$ and $N_\\gamma$ is specific enough to allow for the selection of widely accepted formulas (e.g., Prandtl, Vesic). The problem is structured to lead to a unique numerical answer for each test case.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.\n- **Complete and Consistent**: The problem is self-contained. All data for the test cases are provided. The unit system ($\\mathrm{kPa}$, $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{kN/m^3}$) is internally consistent, as $1\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^2} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. The requirement for angles to be in radians is clear.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined computational task in geotechnical engineering.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Analytical Expressions\n\n#### Ultimate Bearing Capacity, $q_u$\nThe general equation for the ultimate bearing capacity of a strip footing is:\n$$q_u = c'N_c s_c d_c i_c + qN_q s_q d_q i_q + 0.5 \\gamma B N_\\gamma s_\\gamma d_\\gamma i_\\gamma$$\nApplying the problem's simplifying assumptions:\n- Cohesionless soil, $c' = 0$: The first term vanishes.\n- Strip footing, vertical and centric load, and the explicit assumption that all shape, depth, and inclination factors are unity ($s_q = s_\\gamma = d_q = d_\\gamma = i_q = i_\\gamma = 1$).\n- Surcharge at foundation depth is $q = \\gamma D_f$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$q_u = (\\gamma D_f) N_q(\\phi') + 0.5 \\gamma B N_\\gamma(\\phi')$$\nThis is the governing equation for $q_u$. It can be factored as:\n$$q_u = \\gamma (D_f N_q(\\phi') + 0.5 B N_\\gamma(\\phi'))$$\n\n#### Bearing Capacity Factors and Their Derivatives\nStandard expressions for $N_q$ and $N_\\gamma$ and their derivatives with respect to $\\phi'$ are required. All angles must be in radians.\n\n1.  **Bearing Capacity Factor $N_q(\\phi')$**: The exact solution from plasticity theory by Prandtl is used.\n    $$N_q(\\phi') = e^{\\pi \\tan \\phi'} \\tan^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi'}{2}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Derivative of $N_q(\\phi')$**: We differentiate $N_q$ with respect to $\\phi'$ using the product rule and chain rule. A simplified expression for the derivative is:\n    $$\\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'} = N_q(\\phi') \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\cos^2 \\phi'} + \\frac{2}{\\cos \\phi'} \\right)$$\n\n3.  **Bearing Capacity Factor $N_\\gamma(\\phi')$**: A widely used and well-tested expression is that proposed by Vesic (1975), which relates $N_\\gamma$ to $N_q$.\n    $$N_\\gamma(\\phi') = 2(N_q(\\phi') + 1) \\tan \\phi'$$\n\n4.  **Derivative of $N_\\gamma(\\phi')$**: Using the product rule on the expression for $N_\\gamma$:\n    $$\\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'} = \\frac{d}{d\\phi'} [2(N_q + 1) \\tan \\phi']$$\n    $$\\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'} = \\left(2 \\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'}\\right) (\\tan \\phi') + (2(N_q + 1)) (\\sec^2 \\phi')$$\n    $$\\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'} = 2 \\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'} \\tan \\phi' + \\frac{2(N_q + 1)}{\\cos^2 \\phi'}$$\n\n#### Sensitivity Indices\nThe dimensionless sensitivity indices $S_{\\phi'}$ and $S_{\\gamma}$ are computed.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity to Soil Unit Weight, $S_\\gamma$**:\n    We differentiate $q_u$ with respect to $\\gamma$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial q_u}{\\partial \\gamma} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma} [\\gamma (D_f N_q + 0.5 B N_\\gamma)] = D_f N_q + 0.5 B N_\\gamma = \\frac{q_u}{\\gamma}$$\n    Substituting this into the definition of $S_\\gamma$:\n    $$S_{\\gamma} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial q_u}{\\partial \\gamma} \\frac{\\gamma}{q_u} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{q_u}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\gamma}{q_u} \\right| = |1| = 1$$\n    The sensitivity of $q_u$ to $\\gamma$ is unity, reflecting the linear relationship between them.\n\n2.  **Sensitivity to Friction Angle, $S_{\\phi'}$**:\n    We differentiate $q_u$ with respect to $\\phi'$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial q_u}{\\partial \\phi'} = \\gamma \\left(D_f \\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'} + 0.5 B \\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'}\\right)$$\n    The sensitivity index is then:\n    $$S_{\\phi'} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial q_u}{\\partial \\phi'} \\frac{\\phi'}{q_u} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\gamma \\left(D_f \\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'} + 0.5 B \\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'}\\right)}{\\gamma (D_f N_q + 0.5 B N_\\gamma)} \\phi' \\right|$$\n    Since $B, D_f, \\gamma, \\phi'$ are positive, and $N_q, N_\\gamma$ and their derivatives are positive for $\\phi' \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, the term inside the absolute value is positive. Thus:\n    $$S_{\\phi'} = \\frac{D_f \\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'} + 0.5 B \\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'}}{D_f N_q + 0.5 B N_\\gamma} \\phi'$$\n\n### Step 3: Computational Procedure\nThe final step is to implement these derived formulas to analyze the test cases.\n1.  For each test case $(B, D_f, \\phi', \\gamma)$, compute the necessary trigonometric terms for the given $\\phi'$.\n2.  Calculate $N_q(\\phi')$ and its derivative $\\frac{dN_q}{d\\phi'}$.\n3.  Calculate $N_\\gamma(\\phi')$ and its derivative $\\frac{dN_\\gamma}{d\\phi'}$.\n4.  Calculate the sensitivity index $S_{\\phi'}$.\n5.  Compare $S_{\\phi'}$ with $S_\\gamma = 1$ using the specified tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$.\n    - If $S_{\\phi'} - 1  10^{-9}$, the result is $0$ ($\\phi'$ is more influential).\n    - If $1 - S_{\\phi'}  10^{-9}$, the result is $1$ ($\\gamma$ is more influential).\n    - Otherwise, the result is $2$ (tied).\nThis procedure will be encapsulated in a Python program.",
