This exercise guides you through the derivation of the model's self-similar solution from first principles, a process that illuminates the fundamental coupling between viscous fluid flow and elastic rock deformation. By deriving the solution and then numerically verifying its internal consistency , you will gain a deep appreciation for the physics governing viscosity-dominated fracture propagation.",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model of a plane-strain hydraulic fracture driven by a Newtonian fluid, neglecting leak-off and fracture toughness (zero-toughness or viscosity-dominated limit). Let the opening be $w(x,t)$ and the half-length be $l(t)$ for $x \\in [0,l(t)]$. The plane-strain elasticity is local: $p(x,t) = k_e w(x,t)$ with $k_e = E'/h$, where $E'$ is the plane-strain modulus and $h$ is the constant fracture height. The lubrication flow is governed by Poiseuille’s law $q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{w(x,t)^3}{12 \\mu} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and mass conservation gives $\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$. The zero-toughness limit at the tip $x = l(t)$ enforces $w(l(t),t)=0$ and the speed equation $V(t)=\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}l}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lim_{x \\to l(t)^-} \\dfrac{q(x,t)}{w(x,t)}$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1) Starting from the fundamental laws and definitions given above, assume a self-similar form $w(x,t) = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f(\\xi)$ with $\\xi = x/l(t)$ and $l(t) = L_0 t^{\\beta}$. Derive the similarity exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by balancing time scalings only, and obtain the parameter-free ordinary differential equation satisfied by the similarity shape $f(\\xi)$ along with the appropriate boundary conditions in the zero-toughness limit. You must not assume any pre-existing formulas other than the physical statements provided at the beginning of this problem.\n\n2) Show that the parameter-free similarity equation admits a tip asymptotic $f(\\xi) \\sim A (1-\\xi)^{1/3}$ as $\\xi \\to 1^{-}$ and derive $A$ purely from the leading-order balance. Then, by integrating the parameter-free equation across the domain, prove the integral identity $-f(\\xi)^3 f'(\\xi)\\big|_{\\xi=0} = \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi$.\n\n3) Let $D = \\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu}$. Using the coupling consistency implied by the parameter-free similarity equation, show that the amplitude and length prefactors $W_0$ and $L_0$ must satisfy $D \\dfrac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$ and $W_0 L_0 \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi = Q_0$, where $Q_0$ is the constant injection rate per unit out-of-plane thickness. Deduce explicit expressions for $W_0$ and $L_0$ in terms of $D$, $Q_0$, and the shape integral $I_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi$.\n\n4) Two independent ways to compute the near-tip coefficient (for the physical opening) in $w(x,t) \\sim C(t)\\,(l(t)-x)^{1/3}$ must agree if the elasticity–flow coupling is self-consistent in the zero-toughness limit:\n\n- Global-similarity route: $C_{\\mathrm{global}}(t) = \\dfrac{W_0 A}{l(t)^{1/3}} t^{\\alpha}$, with $A$ as in task $2$.\n- Local-speed route: $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(t) = \\left[\\dfrac{36\\,\\mu\\,V(t)}{k_e}\\right]^{1/3}$, where $V(t) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}l}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nUsing your results, verify this consistency at time $t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ by computing the relative error\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\left|C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1) - C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)\\right|}{C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)}.\n$$\n\nTo make the problem testable, your program must numerically solve the parameter-free similarity equation for $f(\\xi)$ via an initial-value integration launched from the tip using the asymptotic expansion to initialize at $\\xi = 1 - \\varepsilon$ for a small $\\varepsilon > 0$. Use the tip asymptotic to correct the missing integral segment on $(1-\\varepsilon,1)$ when computing $I_1$. Then, for each parameter set, compute $W_0$, $L_0$, $V(1)$, $C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1)$, $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)$, and finally $\\delta$.\n\nAll quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI). In particular, $E'$ must be in pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), $h$ in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$), $\\mu$ in pascal-seconds ($\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$), $Q_0$ in square meters per second ($\\mathrm{m^2/s}$), and time in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$). The relative error $\\delta$ is dimensionless and must be reported as a decimal.\n\nTest Suite (each line is one parameter set $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0)$):\n\n- Case A (happy path): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(3.0 \\times 10^{10},\\, 15,\\, 0.1,\\, 0.05\\right)$\n- Case B (low viscosity, higher rate): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(2.5 \\times 10^{10},\\, 10,\\, 0.001,\\, 0.1\\right)$\n- Case C (high viscosity, low rate): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(3.5 \\times 10^{10},\\, 30,\\, 10,\\, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\right)$\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\"), where each entry is the relative error $\\delta$ corresponding to the above cases, evaluated at $t=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a problem on the self-similar solution of the Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model for a hydraulic fracture in the zero-toughness, viscosity-dominated regime. The solution requires analytical derivations followed by a numerical implementation to verify a consistency condition.\n\n### Step 1: Governing Equation and Self-Similarity\n\nThe problem provides the following governing equations in one dimension ($x$) and time ($t$):\n1.  Plane-strain elasticity: $p(x,t) = k_e w(x,t)$, with $k_e = E'/h$.\n2.  Poiseuille flow (lubrication theory): $q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{w(x,t)^3}{12 \\mu} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$.\n3.  Mass conservation: $\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting (1) into (2), we obtain the flux in terms of the opening $w$:\n$$q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu} w(x,t)^3 \\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$$\nLet $D = \\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu}$. The mass conservation equation (3) becomes a single non-linear partial differential equation for $w(x,t)$:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} = D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( w^3 \\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} \\right)$$\nThis equation is valid for $x \\in (0, l(t))$.\n\nWe assume a self-similar solution of the form:\n$$w(x,t) = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f(\\xi)$$\n$$l(t) = L_0 t^{\\beta}$$\nwhere $\\xi = x/l(t)$ is the dimensionless coordinate. The derivatives of $w$ are found using the chain rule:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} = W_0 \\alpha t^{\\alpha-1} f(\\xi) + W_0 t^{\\alpha} f'(\\xi) \\left( -\\dfrac{\\beta \\xi}{t} \\right) = W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f(\\xi) - \\beta \\xi f'(\\xi))$$\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f'(\\xi) \\dfrac{1}{l(t)} = \\dfrac{W_0}{L_0} t^{\\alpha-\\beta} f'(\\xi)$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE:\n$$W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f') = D \\dfrac{1}{L_0 t^{\\beta}} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} \\left[ \\left( W_0 t^{\\alpha} f \\right)^3 \\left( \\dfrac{W_0}{L_0} t^{\\alpha-\\beta} f' \\right) \\right]$$\n$$W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f') = D \\dfrac{W_0^4}{L_0^2} t^{4\\alpha-2\\beta} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f')$$\nFor self-similarity, the time-dependent terms must cancel out. Equating the exponents of $t$:\n$$\\alpha - 1 = 4\\alpha - 2\\beta \\implies 3\\alpha - 2\\beta = -1$$\nA second relation is obtained from global mass conservation. The volume injected per unit height is $Q_0 t$. The volume stored in the fracture per unit height is $\\mathcal{V}(t) = \\int_0^{l(t)} w(x,t) dx$. Thus, $\\int_0^{l(t)} w(x,t) dx = Q_0 t$.\n$$\\int_0^{l(t)} W_0 t^{\\alpha} f\\left(\\frac{x}{l(t)}\\right) dx = W_0 L_0 t^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi = Q_0 t$$\nThis requires the exponent of $t$ to be $1$, so $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$. Solving the system of linear equations for the exponents:\n$$3\\alpha - 2(1-\\alpha) = -1 \\implies 5\\alpha = 1 \\implies \\alpha = 1/5$$\n$$\\beta = 1 - \\alpha = 4/5$$\nThe remaining terms yield the similarity equation. To obtain a parameter-free form, we define $W_0$ and $L_0$ such that the group of constants is unity, $D \\frac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$:\n$$\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f' = \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f')$$\n$$\\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f'(\\xi)) = \\frac{1}{5} f(\\xi) - \\frac{4}{5} \\xi f'(\\xi)$$\nThe boundary conditions are: $w(l(t), t) = 0 \\implies f(1)=0$. The condition at the inlet, $x=0$, is that the flux is the specified injection rate, $q(0,t)=Q_0$. This implicitly determines the solution scale and boundary condition at $\\xi=0$, as will be shown.\n\n### Step 2: Tip Asymptotic and Integral Identity\n\nNear the tip $\\xi \\to 1^-$, let $\\eta = 1-\\xi \\to 0^+$. The ODE becomes $\\dfrac{d}{d\\eta}(f^3 \\frac{df}{d\\eta}) = \\frac{1}{5}f + \\frac{4}{5}(1-\\eta)\\frac{df}{d\\eta}$. Assume a power-law form $f(\\eta) \\sim A \\eta^p$. The dominant terms are on the right $\\frac{df}{d\\eta}$ and on the left $\\frac{d}{d\\eta}(f^3 \\frac{df}{d\\eta})$.\n$$\\dfrac{d}{d\\eta}( (A\\eta^p)^3 (Ap\\eta^{p-1}) ) \\sim \\frac{4}{5} Ap\\eta^{p-1}$$\n$$A^4 p(4p-1) \\eta^{4p-2} \\sim \\frac{4}{5} Ap\\eta^{p-1}$$\nEquating exponents: $4p-2 = p-1 \\implies 3p = 1 \\implies p=1/3$.\nEquating coefficients: $A^3(4p-1) = 4/5 \\implies A^3(4/3 - 1) = 4/5 \\implies A^3/3 = 4/5 \\implies A^3 = 12/5$. So, $A = (12/5)^{1/3}$.\nThe tip asymptotic is $f(\\xi) \\sim (12/5)^{1/3} (1-\\xi)^{1/3}$.\n\nTo prove the integral identity, we integrate the parameter-free ODE from $\\xi=0$ to $\\xi=1$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f') d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{5} f - \\frac{4}{5} \\xi f'\\right) d\\xi$$\n$$[f(\\xi)^3 f'(\\xi)]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{5}\\int_{0}^{1} f d\\xi - \\frac{4}{5}\\int_{0}^{1} \\xi f' d\\xi$$\nThe term at $\\xi=1$ is $\\lim_{\\xi\\to 1^-} f^3 f' \\sim (A^3(1-\\xi))(-A/3(1-\\xi)^{-2/3}) = -A^4/3(1-\\xi)^{1/3} \\to 0$.\nThe RHS can be simplified using integration by parts on the second term: $\\int_{0}^{1} \\xi f' d\\xi = [\\xi f(\\xi)]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 f d\\xi = (f(1) - 0) - \\int_0^1 f d\\xi = -\\int_0^1 f d\\xi$.\nLetting $I_1 = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi$, the equation becomes:\n$$-f(0)^3 f'(0) = \\frac{1}{5}I_1 - \\frac{4}{5}(-I_1) = I_1$$\nThis yields the requested identity: $-f(0)^3 f'(0) = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi$.\n\n### Step 3: Amplitude and Length Prefactors\n\nThe problem states three key relations for the prefactors:\n1.  $D \\dfrac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$ (from making the ODE parameter-free)\n2.  $W_0 L_0 I_1 = Q_0$ (from global mass conservation, where $I_1=\\int_0^1 f d\\xi$)\nFrom (1), $L_0 = \\sqrt{D} W_0^{3/2}$. Substituting this into (2):\n$$W_0 (\\sqrt{D} W_0^{3/2}) I_1 = Q_0 \\implies W_0^{5/2} = \\frac{Q_0}{I_1 \\sqrt{D}}$$\n$$W_0 = \\left( \\frac{Q_0}{I_1 \\sqrt{D}} \\right)^{2/5}$$\nSubstituting $W_0$ back into the expression for $L_0$:\n$$L_0 = \\frac{Q_0}{W_0 I_1} = \\frac{Q_0}{I_1} \\left( \\frac{I_1 \\sqrt{D}}{Q_0} \\right)^{2/5} = Q_0^{3/5} I_1^{-3/5} D^{1/5} = \\left( \\frac{Q_0^3 D}{I_1^3} \\right)^{1/5}$$\n\n### Step 4: Consistency Verification\n\nThe two expressions for the near-tip coefficient $C(t)$ are:\n-   Global-similarity: $w(x,t) \\sim \\frac{W_0 A t^\\alpha}{l(t)^{1/3}}(l(t)-x)^{1/3} \\implies C_{\\mathrm{global}}(t) = \\frac{W_0 A t^\\alpha}{l(t)^{1/3}}$.\n-   Local-speed: from the physics near the tip, $V = \\lim (q/w)$, it can be shown that $V(t) = D C(t)^3 / 3$, which gives $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(t) = \\left(\\frac{3V(t)}{D}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{36\\mu V(t)}{k_e}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\nWe must show these are identical. Let's evaluate at $t=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$l(1) = L_0$ and $V(1) = \\frac{d}{dt}(L_0 t^\\beta)|_{t=1} = L_0 \\beta = \\frac{4}{5}L_0$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1) = \\frac{W_0 A}{L_0^{1/3}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1) = \\left( \\frac{36\\mu}{k_e} \\frac{4}{5}L_0 \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{3}{D} \\frac{4}{5}L_0 \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{12 L_0}{5D} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nFor them to be equal, their cubes must be equal:\n$$\\frac{W_0^3 A^3}{L_0} = \\frac{12 L_0}{5D} \\implies 5D W_0^3 A^3 = 12 L_0^2$$\nUsing the derived value $A^3 = 12/5$:\n$$5D W_0^3 \\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right) = 12 L_0^2 \\implies 12 D W_0^3 = 12 L_0^2 \\implies D W_0^3 = L_0^2$$\nThis is precisely the condition $D W_0^3 / L_0^2 = 1$ used to make the similarity ODE parameter-free. Thus, the formulation is self-consistent and the theoretical relative error $\\delta$ is $0$. Any non-zero result from the numerical implementation will be due to numerical precision and approximation errors.\n\nThe numerical part involves solving the ODE for $f(\\xi)$ by integrating backwards from the tip, using the asymptotic solution to provide initial conditions. This determines the value of the shape integral $I_1 = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi)d\\xi$. With $I_1$ known, all other quantities can be calculated.",

Then, for each test case, evaluate $\\,L(t)\\,$ for three internal lengths: $\\,\\ell\\,$, $\\,\\ell/2\\,$, and $\\,2\\ell\\,$, keeping all other parameters fixed, to quantify sensitivity.\n\nYour implementation must use the following material constants and test suites.\n\n- Material constants common to all tests: plane-strain modulus $\\,E' = 25\\times 10^9\\,$ pascals; fracture energy $\\,G_f = 40\\,$ joules per square meter.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fracture mechanics and computational geomechanics, is well-posed with a clear and complete set of data and objectives, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, workflow for model calibration and sensitivity analysis, free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nHerein, a complete, reasoned solution is provided, following a principle-based design. The solution is presented in two main parts: first, the calibration of the internal length parameter $\\,\\ell\\,$ from size effect data, and second, the derivation and application of a hydraulic fracture propagation model to assess sensitivity to $\\,\\ell\\,$.\n\n### Part 1: Calibration of Internal Length $\\,\\ell\\,$ via Size Effect Law\n\nThe calibration of the internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$ is based on the Bažant size effect law, a cornerstone of quasi-brittle fracture mechanics. This law describes the transition of failure mode from strength-controlled (in small specimens) to fracture-controlled (in large specimens). For notched geometries, the nominal strength $\\,\\sigma_N\\,$ as a function of a characteristic specimen size $\\,D\\,$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_N(D) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{D}{D_0}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\,\\sigma_0\\,$ is the asymptotic strength of an infinitely large specimen (corresponding to the plastic limit load for a non-hardening material) and $\\,D_0\\,$ is the transitional size, which characterizes the size at which the behavior is intermediate between strength-based criteria and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM).\n\nTo determine $\\,\\sigma_0\\,$ and $\\,D_0\\,$ from experimental data $\\,(D_i, \\sigma_{N,i})\\,$, the equation is linearized. Squaring and taking the reciprocal yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_N^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{D}{D_0}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2 D_0}\\right)D + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $\\,Y = A X + B\\,$, where:\n- $\\,Y = 1/\\sigma_N^2\\,$\n- $\\,X = D\\,$\n- The slope is $\\,A = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2 D_0}\\,$\n- The intercept is $\\,B = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}\\,$\n\nGiven a set of $\\,n\\,$ data points $\\,(X_i, Y_i)\\,$, the coefficients $\\,A\\,$ and $\\,B\\,$ are found via a standard least-squares linear regression. Once $\\,A\\,$ and $\\,B\\,$ are known, the physical parameters can be recovered:\n$$\n\\sigma_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{B}}\n$$\n$$\nD_0 = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThe problem states that for the nonlocal damage model being considered, the internal length parameter $\\,\\ell\\,$ is identified with the transitional size $\\,D_0\\,$. This is a common practice in the field, as both $\\,\\ell\\,$ and $\\,D_0\\,$ represent intrinsic length scales related to the size of the fracture process zone. Thus, we set:\n$$\n\\ell = D_0 = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThis procedure will be applied to the calibration data provided for each test case.\n\n### Part 2: Hydraulic Fracture Propagation and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe second part of the problem involves modeling the propagation of a hydraulic fracture and assessing its sensitivity to the calibrated internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$. The model is based on two fundamental principles for a plane-strain crack of half-length $\\,L\\,$ driven by a uniform net pressure $\\,p\\,$.\n\n1.  **Elastic Compliance:** The relationship between crack volume per unit thickness, $\\,V'\\,$, pressure $\\,p\\,$, and half-length $\\,L\\,$ is given by a classical LEFM solution:\n    $$\n    V' = \\frac{2\\pi}{E'} p L^2\n    $$\n    where $\\,E'\\,$ is the plane-strain elastic modulus.\n\n2.  **Fluid Mass Conservation:** The rate of change of crack volume must equal the fluid injection rate per unit thickness, $\\,Q'\\,$, assuming an incompressible fluid and no leak-off into the surrounding medium:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV'}{dt} = Q'\n    $$\n\nTo derive the evolution law for the fracture half-length $\\,L(t)\\,$, we differentiate the compliance equation with respect to time $\\,t\\,$. The problem specifies an early-time, high-viscosity fluid scenario where crack growth is primarily resisted by the material's toughness. This justifies the simplifying assumption that the net pressure is constant and equal to the material's tensile strength, $\\,p \\approx f_t\\,$.\n$$\n\\frac{dV'}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi p}{E'} L(t)^2\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi p}{E'} L(t) \\frac{dL(t)}{dt}\n$$\nEquating this with the mass conservation law gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\,L(t)\\,$:\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{4\\pi p}{E'} L(t) \\frac{dL(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis ODE is separable. We rearrange and integrate from an initial state of $\\,L=0\\,$ at $\\,t=0\\,$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{L(t)} L \\, dL = \\int_0^t \\frac{Q' E'}{4\\pi p} \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L(t)^2}{2} = \\frac{Q' E'}{4\\pi p} t\n$$\nSolving for $\\,L(t)\\,$ yields the propagation law:\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' E' t}{2\\pi p}}\n$$\nThe model is completed by linking the pressure $\\,p\\,$ to the calibrated internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$. The problem provides the relationship $\\,f_t = \\sqrt{E' G_f / \\ell}\\,$, where $\\,G_f\\,$ is the fracture energy. Setting $\\,p = f_t\\,$, we substitute this into the expression for $\\,L(t)\\,$:\n$$\nL(t, \\ell) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' E' t}{2\\pi \\sqrt{E' G_f / \\ell}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' t}{2\\pi}} (E')^{1/4} (G_f)^{-1/4} \\ell^{1/4}\n$$\nThis final equation explicitly shows the dependence of the fracture half-length on the internal length: $\\,L \\propto \\ell^{1/4}\\,$. For each test case, after calibrating $\\,\\ell\\,$, this equation will be used to compute $\\,L(t)\\,$ for the calibrated $\\,\\ell\\,$, as well as for perturbed values $\\,\\ell/2\\,$ and $\\,2\\ell\\,$, to quantify the model's sensitivity to this crucial parameter.\n\nThe numerical implementation will proceed by first performing the linear regression on the transformed data $\\,(D, 1/\\sigma_N^2)\\,$ for each case to find $\\,\\ell = B/A\\,$. Then, the derived formula for $\\,L(t, \\ell)\\,$ will be evaluated at the specified time $\\,t\\,$ and injection rate $\\,Q'\\,$ for the three required values of the internal length.",

The universal asymptote is given in the form $w(r) \\sim A\\, r^{\\alpha}$ for small crack-tip distance $r$, with known fluid viscosity $\\mu$ and plane-strain modulus $E'$; however, only the pair $(A,\\alpha)$ is used to enforce the near-tip opening target because the amplitude constant $A$ encapsulates the fluid–structure coupling in the viscosity-dominated regime.\n\nYou must write a complete program that, for each test case, computes the calibration triple $[l_0, G_c, \\tau_c]$ as follows, expressed in International System of Units (SI):\n- $l_0$ in meters,\n- $G_c$ in joules per square meter,\n- $\\tau_c$ in pascals.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions to be used:\n1) Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) in plane strain: The energy release rate is $G = K_I^2 / E'$, where $K_I$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor and $E'$ is the plane-strain modulus. The near-tip crack opening displacement (displacement jump) for a traction-free crack in plane strain relates to $K_I$ as\n$$\nw(r) = \\frac{8 K_I}{E'} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}}.\n$$\nAt propagation under toughness control, $K_I = K_{IC} = \\sqrt{E' G_c}$.

This can be written in the form $w(r) \\sim A_{\\mathrm{tough}} r^{1/2}$, with the toughness-controlled amplitude being:\n    $$\n    A_{\\mathrm{tough}}(G_c, E') = \\frac{8}{E'} \\sqrt{\\frac{E' G_c}{2\\pi}} = 8 \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{2\\pi E'}}\n    $$\n    To match the target asymptote, we equate the amplitudes, $A_{\\mathrm{tough}} = A$.\n    $$\n    8 \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{2\\pi E'}} = A\n    $$\n    Solving for the critical energy release rate $G_c$ yields:\n    $$\n    \\frac{64 G_c}{2\\pi E'} = A^2 \\implies G_c = \\frac{A^2 (2\\pi) E'}{64}\n    $$\n    For this regime, the transition radius $r_m$ is provided as an independent input parameter. The phase-field length is then directly set as $l_0 = r_m$. The peak cohesive traction $\\tau_c$ is determined by equating Irwin's estimate for the cohesive zone size, $r_{\\mathrm{cz}}$, to $r_m$.\n    $$\n    r_{\\mathrm{cz}} = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{IC}}{\\tau_c}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\frac{E' G_c}{\\tau_c^2} = r_m\n    $$\n    Solving for $\\tau_c$ gives:\n    $$\n    \\tau_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E' G_c}{6\\pi r_m}}\n    $$\n    With $G_c$ and $r_m$ known, $\\tau_c$ is fully determined.\n\n2.  **Viscosity-Dominated Regime Target ($\\alpha = 2/3$):**\n    The target crack opening is $w(r) \\sim A r^{2/3}$. This corresponds to the universal asymptote for a hydraulic fracture in the viscosity-dominated limit. The calibration strategy is to enforce that the crossover between the model's inherent toughness-dominated behavior and the target viscosity-dominated behavior occurs at a specified transition radius $r_m$. At this radius, the two asymptotic opening laws must intersect:\n    $$\n    A_{\\mathrm{tough}}(G_c, E') r_m^{1/2} = A r_m^{2/3}\n    $$\n    This condition determines the required amplitude for the toughness-dominated asymptote:\n    $$\n    A_{\\mathrm{tough}}(G_c, E') = A r_m^{1/6}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{tough}}$:\n    $$\n    8 \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{2\\pi E'}} = A r_m^{1/6}\n    $$\n    Solving for $G_c$ yields:\n    $$\n    \\frac{64 G_c}{2\\pi E'} = A^2 r_m^{1/3} \\implies G_c = \\frac{A^2 r_m^{1/3} (2\\pi) E'}{64}\n    $$\n    As before, the phase-field length scale is set to the transition radius, $l_0 = r_m$, and the peak cohesive traction $\\tau_c$ is computed using the same relationship, but with the value of $G_c$ derived for this regime:\n    $$\n    \\tau_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E' G_c}{6\\pi r_m}}\n    $$\n    These derived formulas are implemented to compute the calibration triple $[l_0, G_c, \\tau_c]$ for each test case. The numerical values are then rounded to six significant figures, and all quantities are expressed in SI units. Specifically, $l_0$ is in meters (m), $G_c$ is in joules per square meter (J/m$^2$), and $\\tau_c$ is in pascals (Pa).",
