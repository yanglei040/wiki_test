The Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model, despite its idealizations, provides a powerful analytical framework for this purpose. This practice challenges you to derive the celebrated self-similar solution for a viscosity-dominated PKN fracture from first principles, offering deep insight into the scaling laws that govern fracture length and opening .",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model of a plane-strain hydraulic fracture driven by a Newtonian fluid, neglecting leak-off and fracture toughness (zero-toughness or viscosity-dominated limit). Let the opening be $w(x,t)$ and the half-length be $l(t)$ for $x \\in [0,l(t)]$. The plane-strain elasticity is local: $p(x,t) = k_e w(x,t)$ with $k_e = E'/h$, where $E'$ is the plane-strain modulus and $h$ is the constant fracture height. The lubrication flow is governed by Poiseuille’s law $q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{w(x,t)^3}{12 \\mu} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and mass conservation gives $\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$. The zero-toughness limit at the tip $x = l(t)$ enforces $w(l(t),t)=0$ and the speed equation $V(t)=\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}l}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lim_{x \\to l(t)^-} \\dfrac{q(x,t)}{w(x,t)}$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1) Starting from the fundamental laws and definitions given above, assume a self-similar form $w(x,t) = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f(\\xi)$ with $\\xi = x/l(t)$ and $l(t) = L_0 t^{\\beta}$. Derive the similarity exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by balancing time scalings only, and obtain the parameter-free ordinary differential equation satisfied by the similarity shape $f(\\xi)$ along with the appropriate boundary conditions in the zero-toughness limit. You must not assume any pre-existing formulas other than the physical statements provided at the beginning of this problem.\n\n2) Show that the parameter-free similarity equation admits a tip asymptotic $f(\\xi) \\sim A (1-\\xi)^{1/3}$ as $\\xi \\to 1^{-}$ and derive $A$ purely from the leading-order balance. Then, by integrating the parameter-free equation across the domain, prove the integral identity $-f(0)^3 f'(0) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi$.\n\n3) Let $D = \\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu}$. Using the coupling consistency implied by the parameter-free similarity equation, show that the amplitude and length prefactors $W_0$ and $L_0$ must satisfy $D \\dfrac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$ and $W_0 L_0 \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi = Q_0$, where $Q_0$ is the constant injection rate per unit out-of-plane thickness. Deduce explicit expressions for $W_0$ and $L_0$ in terms of $D$, $Q_0$, and the shape integral $I_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi$.\n\n4) Two independent ways to compute the near-tip coefficient (for the physical opening) in $w(x,t) \\sim C(t)\\,(l(t)-x)^{1/3}$ must agree if the elasticity–flow coupling is self-consistent in the zero-toughness limit:\n\n- Global-similarity route: $C_{\\mathrm{global}}(t) = \\dfrac{W_0 A}{l(t)^{1/3}} t^{\\alpha}$, with $A$ as in task $2$.\n- Local-speed route: $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(t) = \\left[\\dfrac{36\\,\\mu\\,V(t)}{k_e}\\right]^{1/3}$, where $V(t) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}l}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nUsing your results, verify this consistency at time $t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ by computing the relative error\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\left|C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1) - C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)\\right|}{C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)}.\n$$\n\nTo make the problem testable, your program must numerically solve the parameter-free similarity equation for $f(\\xi)$ via an initial-value integration launched from the tip using the asymptotic expansion to initialize at $\\xi = 1 - \\varepsilon$ for a small $\\varepsilon > 0$. Use the tip asymptotic to correct the missing integral segment on $(1-\\varepsilon,1)$ when computing $I_1$. Then, for each parameter set, compute $W_0$, $L_0$, $V(1)$, $C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1)$, $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1)$, and finally $\\delta$.\n\nAll quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI). In particular, $E'$ must be in pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), $h$ in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$), $\\mu$ in pascal-seconds ($\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$), $Q_0$ in square meters per second ($\\mathrm{m^2/s}$), and time in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$). The relative error $\\delta$ is dimensionless and must be reported as a decimal.\n\nTest Suite (each line is one parameter set $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0)$):\n\n- Case A (happy path): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(3.0 \\times 10^{10},\\, 15,\\, 0.1,\\, 0.05\\right)$\n- Case B (low viscosity, higher rate): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(2.5 \\times 10^{10},\\, 10,\\, 0.001,\\, 0.1\\right)$\n- Case C (high viscosity, low rate): $(E', h, \\mu, Q_0) = \\left(3.5 \\times 10^{10},\\, 30,\\, 10,\\, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\right)$\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\"), where each entry is the relative error $\\delta$ corresponding to the above cases, evaluated at $t=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a problem on the self-similar solution of the Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model for a hydraulic fracture in the zero-toughness, viscosity-dominated regime. The solution requires analytical derivations followed by a numerical implementation to verify a consistency condition.\n\n### Step 1: Governing Equation and Self-Similarity\n\nThe problem provides the following governing equations in one dimension ($x$) and time ($t$):\n1.  Plane-strain elasticity: $p(x,t) = k_e w(x,t)$, with $k_e = E'/h$.\n2.  Poiseuille flow (lubrication theory): $q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{w(x,t)^3}{12 \\mu} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$.\n3.  Mass conservation: $\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting (1) into (2), we obtain the flux in terms of the opening $w$:\n$$q(x,t) = -\\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu} w(x,t)^3 \\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$$\nLet $D = \\dfrac{k_e}{12 \\mu}$. The mass conservation equation (3) becomes a single non-linear partial differential equation for $w(x,t)$:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} = D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( w^3 \\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} \\right)$$\nThis equation is valid for $x \\in (0, l(t))$.\n\nWe assume a self-similar solution of the form:\n$$w(x,t) = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f(\\xi)$$\n$$l(t) = L_0 t^{\\beta}$$\nwhere $\\xi = x/l(t)$ is the dimensionless coordinate. The derivatives of $w$ are found using the chain rule:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} = W_0 \\alpha t^{\\alpha-1} f(\\xi) + W_0 t^{\\alpha} f'(\\xi) \\left( -\\dfrac{\\beta \\xi}{t} \\right) = W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f(\\xi) - \\beta \\xi f'(\\xi))$$\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = W_0 t^{\\alpha} f'(\\xi) \\dfrac{1}{l(t)} = \\dfrac{W_0}{L_0} t^{\\alpha-\\beta} f'(\\xi)$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE:\n$$W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f') = D \\dfrac{1}{L_0 t^{\\beta}} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} \\left[ \\left( W_0 t^{\\alpha} f \\right)^3 \\left( \\dfrac{W_0}{L_0} t^{\\alpha-\\beta} f' \\right) \\right]$$\n$$W_0 t^{\\alpha-1} (\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f') = D \\dfrac{W_0^4}{L_0^2} t^{4\\alpha-2\\beta} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f')$$\nFor self-similarity, the time-dependent terms must cancel out. Equating the exponents of $t$:\n$$\\alpha - 1 = 4\\alpha - 2\\beta \\implies 3\\alpha - 2\\beta = -1$$\nA second relation is obtained from global mass conservation. The total volume injected is $\\mathcal{V}_{inj}(t) = Q_0 t$ (per unit height). The volume stored in the fracture is $\\mathcal{V}(t) = \\int_0^{l(t)} w(x,t) dx$. Thus, $\\int_0^{l(t)} w(x,t) dx = Q_0 t$.\n$$\\int_0^{l(t)} W_0 t^{\\alpha} f\\left(\\frac{x}{l(t)}\\right) dx = W_0 L_0 t^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi = Q_0 t$$\nThis requires the exponent of $t$ to be $1$, so $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$. Solving the system of linear equations for the exponents:\n$$3\\alpha - 2(1-\\alpha) = -1 \\implies 5\\alpha = 1 \\implies \\alpha = 1/5$$\n$$\\beta = 1 - \\alpha = 4/5$$\nThe remaining terms yield the similarity equation. To obtain a parameter-free form, we define $W_0$ and $L_0$ such that the group of constants is unity, $D \\frac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$:\n$$\\alpha f - \\beta \\xi f' = \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f')$$\n$$\\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f'(\\xi)) = \\frac{1}{5} f(\\xi) - \\frac{4}{5} \\xi f'(\\xi)$$\nThe boundary conditions are: $w(l(t), t) = 0 \\implies f(1)=0$. The condition at the inlet, $x=0$, is that the flux is the specified injection rate, $q(0,t)=Q_0$. This implicitly determines the solution scale and boundary condition at $\\xi=0$, as will be shown.\n\n### Step 2: Tip Asymptotic and Integral Identity\n\nNear the tip $\\xi \\to 1^-$, let $\\eta = 1-\\xi \\to 0^+$. The ODE becomes $\\dfrac{d}{d\\eta}(f^3 \\frac{df}{d\\eta}) = \\frac{1}{5}f + \\frac{4}{5}(1-\\eta)\\frac{df}{d\\eta}$. Assume a power-law form $f(\\eta) \\sim A \\eta^p$. The dominant terms are on the right $\\frac{df}{d\\eta}$ and on the left $\\frac{d}{d\\eta}(f^3 \\frac{df}{d\\eta})$.\n$$\\dfrac{d}{d\\eta}( (A\\eta^p)^3 (Ap\\eta^{p-1}) ) \\sim \\frac{4}{5} Ap\\eta^{p-1}$$\n$$A^4 p(4p-1) \\eta^{4p-2} \\sim \\frac{4}{5} Ap\\eta^{p-1}$$\nEquating exponents: $4p-2 = p-1 \\implies 3p = 1 \\implies p=1/3$.\nEquating coefficients: $A^3(4p-1) = 4/5 \\implies A^3(4/3 - 1) = 4/5 \\implies A^3/3 = 4/5 \\implies A^3 = 12/5$. So, $A = (12/5)^{1/3}$.\nThe tip asymptotic is $f(\\xi) \\sim (12/5)^{1/3} (1-\\xi)^{1/3}$.\n\nTo prove the integral identity, we integrate the parameter-free ODE from $\\xi=0$ to $\\xi=1$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} (f^3 f') d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{5} f - \\frac{4}{5} \\xi f'\\right) d\\xi$$\n$$[f(\\xi)^3 f'(\\xi)]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{5}\\int_{0}^{1} f d\\xi - \\frac{4}{5}\\int_{0}^{1} \\xi f' d\\xi$$\nThe term at $\\xi=1$ is $\\lim_{\\xi\\to 1^-} f^3 f' \\sim (A^3(1-\\xi))(-A/3(1-\\xi)^{-2/3}) = -A^4/3(1-\\xi)^{1/3} \\to 0$.\nThe RHS can be simplified using integration by parts on the second term: $\\int_{0}^{1} \\xi f' d\\xi = [\\xi f(\\xi)]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 f d\\xi = (f(1) - 0) - \\int_0^1 f d\\xi = -\\int_0^1 f d\\xi$.\nLetting $I_1 = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi$, the equation becomes:\n$$-f(0)^3 f'(0) = \\frac{1}{5}I_1 - \\frac{4}{5}(-I_1) = I_1$$\nThis yields the requested identity: $-f(0)^3 f'(0) = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi) d\\xi$.\n\n### Step 3: Amplitude and Length Prefactors\n\nThe problem states three key relations for the prefactors:\n1.  $D \\dfrac{W_0^3}{L_0^2} = 1$ (from making the ODE parameter-free)\n2.  $W_0 L_0 I_1 = Q_0$ (from global mass conservation, where $I_1=\\int_0^1 f d\\xi$)\nFrom (1), $L_0 = \\sqrt{D} W_0^{3/2}$. Substituting this into (2):\n$$W_0 (\\sqrt{D} W_0^{3/2}) I_1 = Q_0 \\implies W_0^{5/2} = \\frac{Q_0}{I_1 \\sqrt{D}}$$\n$$W_0 = \\left( \\frac{Q_0}{I_1 \\sqrt{D}} \\right)^{2/5}$$\nSubstituting $W_0$ back into the expression for $L_0$:\n$$L_0 = \\frac{Q_0}{W_0 I_1} = \\frac{Q_0}{I_1} \\left( \\frac{I_1 \\sqrt{D}}{Q_0} \\right)^{2/5} = Q_0^{3/5} I_1^{-3/5} D^{1/5} = \\left( \\frac{Q_0^3 D}{I_1^3} \\right)^{1/5}$$\n\n### Step 4: Consistency Verification\n\nThe two expressions for the near-tip coefficient $C(t)$ are:\n-   Global-similarity: $w(x,t) \\sim \\frac{W_0 A t^\\alpha}{l(t)^{1/3}}(l(t)-x)^{1/3} \\implies C_{\\mathrm{global}}(t) = \\frac{W_0 A t^\\alpha}{l(t)^{1/3}}$.\n-   Local-speed: from the physics near the tip, $V = \\lim (q/w)$, it can be shown that $V(t) = D C(t)^3 / 3$, which gives $C_{\\mathrm{local}}(t) = \\left(\\frac{3V(t)}{D}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{36\\mu V(t)}{k_e}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\nWe must show these are identical. Let's evaluate at $t=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$l(1) = L_0$ and $V(1) = \\frac{d}{dt}(L_0 t^\\beta)|_{t=1} = L_0 \\beta = \\frac{4}{5}L_0$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{global}}(1) = \\frac{W_0 A}{L_0^{1/3}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{local}}(1) = \\left( \\frac{36\\mu}{k_e} \\frac{4}{5}L_0 \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{3}{D} \\frac{4}{5}L_0 \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{12 L_0}{5D} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nFor them to be equal, their cubes must be equal:\n$$\\frac{W_0^3 A^3}{L_0} = \\frac{12 L_0}{5D} \\implies 5D W_0^3 A^3 = 12 L_0^2$$\nUsing the derived value $A^3 = 12/5$:\n$$5D W_0^3 \\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right) = 12 L_0^2 \\implies 12 D W_0^3 = 12 L_0^2 \\implies D W_0^3 = L_0^2$$\nThis is precisely the condition $D W_0^3 / L_0^2 = 1$ used to make the similarity ODE parameter-free. Thus, the formulation is self-consistent and the theoretical relative error $\\delta$ is $0$. Any non-zero result from the numerical implementation will be due to numerical precision and approximation errors.\n\nThe numerical part involves solving the ODE for $f(\\xi)$ by integrating backwards from the tip, using the asymptotic solution to provide initial conditions. This determines the value of the shape integral $I_1 = \\int_0^1 f(\\xi)d\\xi$. With $I_1$ known, all other quantities can be calculated.",

            "problem": "A vertical Hydraulic Fracture (HF) is modeled in plane strain using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The fracture tip is advancing within an upper sedimentary layer and is within a small distance of a horizontal interface to a lower layer. Due to elastic mismatch, the near-tip stress state from a high-fidelity numerical simulation yields mixed-mode stress intensity factors $K_I$ and $K_{II}$. Assume the crack tip coordinate system has the crack currently aligned with the $x$-axis and the upper half-plane is at positive polar angle $\\theta > 0$. The upper layer has plane strain modulus $E'_{\\mathrm{upper}}$ and fracture toughness energy $G_{c,\\mathrm{upper}}$, while the lower layer has plane strain modulus $E'_{\\mathrm{lower}}$ and fracture toughness energy $G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and principles are provided in the problem statement:\n- **Model Setup**: A vertical Hydraulic Fracture (HF) is modeled in plane strain using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The fracture tip is near a horizontal interface between an upper and a lower sedimentary layer. The crack is aligned with the $x$-axis, and the upper half-plane corresponds to polar angles $\\theta > 0$.\n- **Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs)**: $K_I = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$, $K_{II} = -0.3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$. It is given that $K_I > 0$.\n- **Upper Layer Properties**: Plane strain modulus $E'_{\\mathrm{upper}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, Fracture toughness energy $G_{c,\\mathrm{upper}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n- **Lower Layer Properties**: Plane strain modulus $E'_{\\mathrm{lower}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, Fracture toughness energy $G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n- **Propagation Direction Criterion**: The maximum hoop stress criterion is to be applied. The fracture kinks in the direction $\\theta_0$ that maximizes the near-tip circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,\\theta)$.\n- **Propagation Viability Criterion**: An energetic condition $J(\\theta_0) \\geq G_c$ must be satisfied for the layer the crack attempts to enter.\n- **Energy Release Rate Approximation**: The energy release rate $J$ under plane strain is approximated by $J \\approx (K_I^2+K_{II}^2)/E'$, using the plane strain modulus $E'$ of the target layer.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of LEFM, a cornerstone of solid mechanics and geomechanics. The use of SIFs ($K_I$, $K_{II}$), the maximum hoop stress criterion (a version of the Erdogan-Sih criterion), and an energy release rate condition ($J \\geq G_c$) are standard methodologies for analyzing fracture propagation. The physical scenario—a hydraulic fracture interacting with a geological interface—is a critical, well-studied problem in the field. The material properties are within a realistic range for sedimentary rocks.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($K_I$, $K_{II}$, material properties) and explicitly states the criteria to be used for determining both the direction and the viability of propagation. The provided approximation for $J$, while a simplification, is clearly defined, ensuring a unique solution can be calculated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language. There are no subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **VALID**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, albeit simplified, application of fracture mechanics principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe analysis is performed in two parts as prescribed by the problem: determining the kink direction and then checking the energetic condition for propagation.\n\n**Part 1: Determine the Fracture Kink Angle $\\theta_0$**\n\nThe maximum hoop stress criterion states that the crack will propagate in the direction $\\theta_0$ that maximizes the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$. The condition for this maximization, derived by setting $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial\\theta} = 0$, is equivalent to finding the angle $\\theta_0$ where the shear stress $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ is zero. This leads to the following equation relating the SIFs and the kink angle:\n$$ K_I \\sin(\\theta_0) + K_{II} (3\\cos(\\theta_0) - 1) = 0 $$\nWe are given $K_I = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $K_{II} = -0.3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$ (1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}) \\sin(\\theta_0) + (-0.3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}) (3\\cos(\\theta_0) - 1) = 0 $$\nDividing the entire equation by $0.3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ simplifies it to:\n$$ 4 \\sin(\\theta_0) - (3\\cos(\\theta_0) - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ 4 \\sin(\\theta_0) - 3\\cos(\\theta_0) + 1 = 0 $$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $\\theta_0$. We can solve it numerically or by using the exact solution derived from the half-angle substitution $t = \\tan(\\theta_0/2)$, which yields a quadratic equation $2t^2 K_{II} - t K_I - K_{II} = 0$. Using the given SIF values, $2(-0.3)t^2 - (1.2)t - (-0.3) = 0$, or $-0.6t^2 - 1.2t + 0.3 = 0$. The physically relevant root gives $t \\approx 0.22475$.\nThe kink angle is then:\n$$ \\theta_0 = 2 \\arctan(t) = 2 \\arctan(0.22475) \\approx 2 \\times 12.66^\\circ \\approx 25.32^\\circ $$\nThe angle is positive, $\\theta_0 > 0$, which corresponds to kinking upward into the upper layer according to the problem's coordinate system definition. Thus, the fracture is predicted to turn upward at an angle of approximately $\\theta_0 \\approx 25^\\circ$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluate the Energetic Propagation Condition**\n\nThe problem requires checking the propagation condition $J(\\theta_0) \\geq G_c$ for both the upper and lower layers, using the approximation $J \\approx (K_I^2+K_{II}^2)/E'$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, ensuring consistent SI units.\n$K_I = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n$K_{II} = -0.3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = -0.3 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n$$ K_I^2 + K_{II}^2 = (1.2 \\times 10^6)^2 + (-0.3 \\times 10^6)^2 \\, (\\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}) $$\n$$ K_I^2 + K_{II}^2 = (1.44 \\times 10^{12}) + (0.09 \\times 10^{12}) \\, (\\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}) $$\n$$ K_I^2 + K_{II}^2 = 1.53 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the energy release rate $J$ for potential propagation into each layer.\n\n*   **Propagation into the Upper Layer:**\n    The target layer is the upper layer, so we use its properties: $E'_{\\mathrm{upper}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 10 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $G_{c,\\mathrm{upper}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n    $$ J_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\approx \\frac{K_I^2 + K_{II}^2}{E'_{\\mathrm{upper}}} = \\frac{1.53 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}}{10 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}} = 153 \\, \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m} = 153 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\n    The energetic criterion is $J_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\geq G_{c,\\mathrm{upper}}$.\n    $$ 153 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} \\geq 50 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\n    This condition is satisfied. Therefore, **propagation is allowed in the upper layer.**\n\n*   **Propagation into the Lower Layer:**\n    We check the hypothetical case of the crack entering the lower layer, using its properties: $E'_{\\mathrm{lower}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 40 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n    $$ J_{\\mathrm{lower}} \\approx \\frac{K_I^2 + K_{II}^2}{E'_{\\mathrm{lower}}} = \\frac{1.53 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m}}{40 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}} = 38.25 \\, \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m} = 38.25 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\n    The energetic criterion is $J_{\\mathrm{lower}} \\geq G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}}$.\n    $$ 38.25 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} \\geq 300 \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\n    This condition is not satisfied. Therefore, **propagation is not allowed in the lower layer.**\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n1.  **Direction**: The fracture kinks upward into the upper layer.\n2.  **Angle**: The kink angle is $\\theta_0 \\approx 25^\\circ$.\n3.  **Viability**: Propagation is energetically allowed in the upper layer, but not in the lower layer.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. The fracture kinks upward into the upper layer at $\\theta_0 \\approx 25^\\circ$; propagation is allowed in the upper layer but not in the lower layer.**\n    This statement perfectly matches all three aformentioned results from our derivation. The direction is upward, the angle is correct, and the propagation viability for both layers is correctly identified.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The fracture kinks downward into the lower layer at $\\theta_0 \\approx -25^\\circ$; propagation is allowed in the lower layer but not in the upper layer.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The calculated kink angle is positive ($\\approx +25^\\circ$), indicating an upward turn, not downward. Furthermore, our analysis showed propagation is allowed in the upper layer and disallowed in the lower layer, the opposite of what is stated here.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The fracture remains straight with $\\theta_0 \\approx 0^\\circ$ because $K_{II}$ does not influence direction under internal pressurization; propagation is allowed in both layers.**\n    This statement is incorrect. A non-zero Mode II stress intensity factor ($K_{II} \\neq 0$) will cause the fracture to kink, so it will not remain straight. The reasoning provided is also flawed; $K_{II}$ is precisely the term that governs deviation from a straight path in the maximum hoop stress criterion. Finally, our calculations show propagation is not allowed in both layers.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The fracture kinks upward into the upper layer at $\\theta_0 \\approx 25^\\circ$; propagation is allowed in both the upper and lower layers because the energy release rate exceeds both $G_{c,\\mathrm{upper}}$ and $G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}}$.**\n    This statement is partially correct about the direction and angle of kinking. However, it incorrectly claims that propagation is allowed in both layers. Our calculation explicitly showed that the energy release rate for the lower layer ($J_{\\mathrm{lower}} \\approx 38.25\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$) is significantly less than its fracture toughness ($G_{c,\\mathrm{lower}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

All results must be produced in the International System of Units and reported in meters, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nThe derivation must start from the following fundamental bases and well-tested facts:\n- Balance of energy for quasi-brittle fracture as captured by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), namely that the energy release rate equals the material fracture energy at propagation. Define the plane-strain modulus as $\\,E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)\\,$.\n- The Irwin characteristic length $\\,l_{\\mathrm{ch}} = E' G_f / f_t^2\\,$, where $\\,G_f\\,$ is the fracture energy and $\\,f_t\\,$ is the tensile strength.\n- The Bažant size effect law for notched specimens, which in its regression-friendly form can be expressed as a linear relation between the inverse squared nominal strength and a characteristic size of the structure.

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, workflow for model calibration and sensitivity analysis, free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nHerein, a complete, reasoned solution is provided, following a principle-based design. The solution is presented in two main parts: first, the calibration of the internal length parameter $\\,\\ell\\,$ from size effect data, and second, the derivation and application of a hydraulic fracture propagation model to assess sensitivity to $\\,\\ell\\,$.\n\n### Part 1: Calibration of Internal Length $\\,\\ell\\,$ via Size Effect Law\n\nThe calibration of the internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$ is based on the Bažant size effect law, a cornerstone of quasi-brittle fracture mechanics. This law describes the transition of failure mode from strength-controlled (in small specimens) to fracture-controlled (in large specimens). For notched geometries, the nominal strength $\\,\\sigma_N\\,$ as a function of a characteristic specimen size $\\,D\\,$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_N(D) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{D}{D_0}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\,\\sigma_0\\,$ is the asymptotic strength of an infinitely large specimen (corresponding to the plastic limit load for a non-hardening material) and $\\,D_0\\,$ is the transitional size, which characterizes the size at which the behavior is intermediate between strength-based criteria and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM).\n\nTo determine $\\,\\sigma_0\\,$ and $\\,D_0\\,$ from experimental data $(D_i, \\sigma_{N,i})$, the equation is linearized. Squaring and taking the reciprocal yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_N^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{D}{D_0}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2 D_0}\\right)D + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $Y = A X + B$, where:\n- $Y = 1/\\sigma_N^2$\n- $X = D$\n- The slope is $A = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2 D_0}$\n- The intercept is $B = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}$\n\nGiven a set of $\\,n\\,$ data points $(X_i, Y_i)$, the coefficients $\\,A\\,$ and $\\,B\\,$ are found via a standard least-squares linear regression.

Thus, we set:\n$$\n\\ell = D_0 = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThis procedure will be applied to the calibration data provided for each test case.\n\n### Part 2: Hydraulic Fracture Propagation and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe second part of the problem involves modeling the propagation of a hydraulic fracture and assessing its sensitivity to the calibrated internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$. The model is based on two fundamental principles for a plane-strain crack of half-length $\\,L\\,$ driven by a uniform net pressure $\\,p\\,$.\n\n1.  **Elastic Compliance:** The relationship between crack volume per unit thickness, $\\,V'\\,$, pressure $\\,p\\,$, and half-length $\\,L\\,$ is given by a classical LEFM solution:\n    $$\n    V' = \\frac{2\\pi}{E'} p L^2\n    $$\n    where $\\,E'\\,$ is the plane-strain elastic modulus.\n\n2.  **Fluid Mass Conservation:** The rate of change of crack volume must equal the fluid injection rate per unit thickness, $\\,Q'\\,$, assuming an incompressible fluid and no leak-off into the surrounding medium:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV'}{dt} = Q'\n    $$\n\nTo derive the evolution law for the fracture half-length $\\,L(t)\\,$, we differentiate the compliance equation with respect to time $\\,t\\,$. The problem specifies an early-time, high-viscosity fluid scenario where crack growth is primarily resisted by the material's toughness. This justifies the simplifying assumption that the net pressure is constant and equal to the material's tensile strength, $\\,p \\approx f_t\\,$.\n$$\n\\frac{dV'}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi p}{E'} L(t)^2\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi p}{E'} L(t) \\frac{dL(t)}{dt}\n$$\nEquating this with the mass conservation law gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\,L(t)\\,$:\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{4\\pi p}{E'} L(t) \\frac{dL(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis ODE is separable. We rearrange and integrate from an initial state of $\\,L=0\\,$ at $\\,t=0\\,$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{L(t)} L \\, dL = \\int_0^t \\frac{Q' E'}{4\\pi p} \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L(t)^2}{2} = \\frac{Q' E'}{4\\pi p} t\n$$\nSolving for $\\,L(t)\\,$ yields the propagation law:\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' E' t}{2\\pi p}}\n$$\nThe model is completed by linking the pressure $\\,p\\,$ to the calibrated internal length $\\,\\ell\\,$. The problem provides the relationship $\\,f_t = \\sqrt{E' G_f / \\ell}\\,$, where $\\,G_f\\,$ is the fracture energy. Setting $\\,p = f_t\\,$, we substitute this into the expression for $\\,L(t)\\,$:\n$$\nL(t, \\ell) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' E' t}{2\\pi \\sqrt{E' G_f / \\ell}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Q' t}{2\\pi}} (E')^{1/4} (G_f)^{-1/4} \\ell^{1/4}\n$$\nThis final equation explicitly shows the dependence of the fracture half-length on the internal length: $\\,L \\propto \\ell^{1/4}\\,$. For each test case, after calibrating $\\,\\ell\\,$, this equation will be used to compute $\\,L(t)\\,$ for the calibrated $\\,\\ell\\,$, as well as for perturbed values $\\,\\ell/2\\,$ and $\\,2\\ell\\,$, to quantify the model's sensitivity to this crucial parameter.\n\nThe numerical implementation will proceed by first performing the linear regression on the transformed data $(D, 1/\\sigma_N^2)$ for each case to find $\\,\\ell = B/A\\,$. Then, the derived formula for $\\,L(t, \\ell)\\,$ will be evaluated at the specified time $\\,t\\,$ and injection rate $\\,Q'\\,$ for the three required values of the internal length.",
