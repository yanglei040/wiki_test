This exercise  models a landslide as a simple block, calculating the runout distance by equating the initial potential energy to the energy dissipated by a constant Coulomb friction force. Mastering this first-principles calculation provides a crucial intuition for how fall height $H$ and the basal friction coefficient $\\mu$ govern the primary scale of landslide mobility.",

            "problem": "A rock avalanche initiates at the crest of a mountain and descends a vertical elevation drop of $H=500\\ \\mathrm{m}$ before transitioning onto a horizontal runout surface. Model the mass as a rigid body of mass $m$ that starts from rest, and assume the basal resistance on the runout surface is governed by Coulomb friction with an effective friction coefficient $\\mu=0.2$, constant over the runout distance. Neglect entrainment, air drag, pore-pressure transients, and any topographic variability along the runout surface, and take gravitational acceleration as $g$.\n\nUsing only first principles (Newton's second law and the work-energy theorem) and the Coulomb friction law, estimate the horizontal runout distance $L$ such that the energy input from the fall is fully dissipated by basal friction along the runout. Round your numerical result to four significant figures and express the answer in meters. Then, in your reasoning, discuss the local sensitivity of $L$ to $\\mu$ at the nominal value $\\mu=0.2$ using a dimensionless relative sensitivity defined by $(\\mu/L)\\,dL/d\\mu$, but report only the runout distance $L$ as your final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics, well-posed with a clear and objective setup, and provides sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The simplifications made (e.g., rigid body, constant friction) are explicitly stated and are standard for introductory runout models.\n\nThe problem requires the estimation of the horizontal runout distance, $L$, of a rock avalanche. The solution will be derived from first principles, specifically the work-energy theorem, which states that the net work done on a system, $W_{\\text{net}}$, is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, $\\Delta K$.\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K$$\nThe system is the rock mass, $m$. The process involves two phases: a vertical drop and a horizontal slide. We can analyze the entire process from the initial state to the final state.\n\nInitial state: The mass $m$ is at rest at a vertical elevation $H$ above the horizontal runout plane.\n- Initial velocity $v_i = 0$.\n- Initial kinetic energy $K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = 0$.\n- Initial height $h_i = H$. We define the potential energy reference datum ($U=0$) at the level of the horizontal runout plane.\n- Initial potential energy $U_i = mgH$.\n\nFinal state: The mass $m$ comes to rest on the horizontal runout plane after sliding a distance $L$.\n- Final velocity $v_f = 0$.\n- Final kinetic energy $K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = 0$.\n- Final height $h_f = 0$.\n- Final potential energy $U_f = mgh_f = 0$.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is $\\Delta K = K_f - K_i = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\nThe net work done, $W_{\\text{net}}$, is the sum of the work done by all forces acting on the mass. The forces are gravity and friction.\n1.  Work done by gravity ($W_g$): Gravity is a conservative force. The work done by gravity is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy.\n    $$W_g = - \\Delta U = - (U_f - U_i) = - (0 - mgH) = mgH$$\n    Alternatively, one can consider the work done by the gravitational force, $mg$, over the vertical displacement $H$. This work is positive as the force and displacement are in the same direction, so $W_g = mgH$.\n\n2.  Work done by friction ($W_f$): Friction is a non-conservative force. The frictional force acts only on the horizontal runout surface over the distance $L$. On this horizontal surface, the normal force, $N$, is equal in magnitude to the gravitational force, $N=mg$. The Coulomb friction law gives the magnitude of the kinetic friction force as $F_f = \\mu N = \\mu mg$. This force opposes the direction of motion. Therefore, the work done by friction is negative.\n    $$W_f = - F_f \\cdot L = - \\mu mgL$$\n\nThe net work done is the sum of the work done by gravity and friction:\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = W_g + W_f = mgH - \\mu mgL$$\n\nApplying the work-energy theorem:\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K$$\n$$mgH - \\mu mgL = 0$$\nThis equation represents the conservation of total mechanical energy, where the initial potential energy, $mgH$, is entirely dissipated by the work done by friction, $\\mu mgL$, over the runout distance.\n$$mgH = \\mu mgL$$\nThe mass $m$ and gravitational acceleration $g$ are non-zero and can be canceled from the equation. This demonstrates that the runout distance, under these assumptions, is independent of the mass of the avalanche.\n$$H = \\mu L$$\nSolving for the runout distance $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{H}{\\mu}$$\nThe ratio $H/L$ is often referred to as the \"Fahrböschung\" or apparent friction coefficient. In this model, it is equal to the microscopic basal friction coefficient, $H/L = \\mu$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $H = 500\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mu = 0.2$.\n$$L = \\frac{500\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.2} = 2500\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $2500$. This can be written as $2.500 \\times 10^3$ to explicitly denote four significant figures.\n\nThe problem also asks for a discussion of the local sensitivity of $L$ to $\\mu$ at the nominal value $\\mu=0.2$. The dimensionless relative sensitivity is defined as $S = (\\mu/L)\\,dL/d\\mu$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $L$ with respect to $\\mu$.\n$$L(\\mu) = H\\mu^{-1}$$\n$$\\frac{dL}{d\\mu} = -H\\mu^{-2} = -\\frac{H}{\\mu^2}$$\nNow, we compute the sensitivity $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\mu}{L} \\frac{dL}{d\\mu}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $L$ and $dL/d\\mu$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\mu}{(H/\\mu)} \\left(-\\frac{H}{\\mu^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu^2}{H} \\left(-\\frac{H}{\\mu^2}\\right) = -1$$\nThe dimensionless relative sensitivity is exactly $-1$. This value is a constant, independent of the specific values of $H$ and $\\mu$. This indicates a perfect inverse proportionality between $L$ and $\\mu$. A relative change in $\\mu$ of a given magnitude (e.g., a $1\\%$ increase) will result in a relative change in $L$ of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction (a $1\\%$ decrease). This highlights the critical role of the basal friction coefficient in controlling landslide runout distance within this simplified model. A small uncertainty or error in estimating $\\mu$ translates directly into a proportional uncertainty in the predicted runout distance.\nThe final answer required is only the numerical value for the runout distance $L$.",

Within each step, from time $t_i$ to $t_{i+1} = t_i + \\Delta t$:\n    1.  **Determine Current Slope Angle**: The angle $\\theta_{\\text{current}}$ is set to $\\theta_1$ (in radians) if the current position $s_i \\le L_s$, and to $0$ otherwise.\n    2.  **Calculate Acceleration**: The acceleration $a_i$ is computed using the velocity $v_i$ and the angle $\\theta_{\\text{current}}$:\n        $$\n        a_i = g \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{current}}) - \\mu g \\cos(\\theta_{\\text{current}}) - \\frac{v_i^2}{\\Xi}\n        $$\n    3.  **Update Velocity**: The velocity for the next time step, $v_{i+1}$, is calculated using the explicit forward Euler method:\n        $$\n        v_{i+1} = v_i + a_i \\Delta t\n        $$\n    4.  **Enforce Non-Negativity**: The velocity is clamped to prevent unphysical backward motion:\n        $$\n        v_{i+1} = \\max(0, v_{i+1})\n        $$\n    5.  **Update Position**: The position is updated using the newly computed velocity $v_{i+1}$:\n        $$\n        s_{i+1} = s_i + v_{i+1} \\Delta t\n        $$\n        This is a semi-implicit Euler (or symplectic Euler) integration step, as prescribed.\n    6.  **Check Stopping Criterion**: The simulation terminates if either of two conditions is met:\n        *   **Velocity Threshold**: If $v_{i+1}$ is less than $v_{\\text{cut}} = 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m/s}$, `hold_time` is incremented by $\\Delta t$. If $v_{i+1} \\ge v_{\\text{cut}}$, `hold_time` is reset to $0$. The simulation halts if `hold_time` reaches or exceeds $\\tau_{\\text{hold}} = 2.0 \\, \\text{s}$.\n        *   **Maximum Time**: The simulation halts if the total time $t_{i+1}$ exceeds $t_{\\max} = 300 \\, \\text{s}$.\n        The first condition to be met triggers the termination.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate Horizontal Runout ($L_{\\text{sim}}$)**: Once the simulation stops, let the final path distance be $s_{\\text{stop}}$. The total horizontal runout distance $L_{\\text{sim}}$ is calculated by projecting the path onto the horizontal plane:\n    *   If the mass stops on the slope ($s_{\\text{stop}} \\le L_s$):\n        $$\n        L_{\\text{sim}} = s_{\\text{stop}} \\cos(\\theta_1)\n        $$\n    *   If the mass stops on the horizontal plane ($s_{\\text{stop}}  L_s$): The path consists of the full slope length plus some distance on the flat. The horizontal projection is the sum of the horizontal projection of the slope and the runout distance on the flat.\n        $$\n        L_{\\text{sim}} = L_s \\cos(\\theta_1) + (s_{\\text{stop}} - L_s)\n        $$\n\n**3. Discrepancy Calculation ($\\Delta L$)**\n\nFor each test case, after computing both $L_{\\text{emp}}$ and $L_{\\text{sim}}$, the discrepancy is found by simple subtraction:\n$$\n\\Delta L = L_{\\text{sim}} - L_{\\text{emp}}\n$$\nThe three results, $L_{\\text{emp}}$, $L_{\\text{sim}}$, and $\\Delta L$, are then rounded to three decimal places and collected for the final output. This process is repeated for all specified test cases.",
