            "problem": "An organic molecule is analyzed by Mass Spectrometry (MS) in a singly charged state. The molecule contains $n_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$ sulfur atoms and $n_{\\mathrm{Si}}=2$ silicon atoms. Assume isotopic selections at each atom are independent and follow the natural isotopic abundances for sulfur and silicon. For sulfur, take the fractional abundances of $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ and $^{33}\\mathrm{S}$ as $p_{34}=0.0425$ and $p_{33}=0.0075$, and define the baseline $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$ fraction as $p_{32}=1-p_{33}-p_{34}$. For silicon, take the fractional abundances of $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$ and $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$ as $q_{30}=0.0310$ and $q_{29}=0.0469$, and define the baseline $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$ fraction as $q_{28}=1-q_{29}-q_{30}$. Neglect $^{36}\\mathrm{S}$ due to its very low abundance, and ignore contributions from all other elements in the molecule.\n\nIn isotopic pattern analysis, the monoisotopic composition ($^{32}\\mathrm{S}$ and $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$) defines the $M$ peak. The presence of an isotope that is heavier by $+1$ relative to baseline contributes $+1$ to the mass shift, and an isotope heavier by $+2$ contributes $+2$ to the mass shift. Specifically, $^{33}\\mathrm{S}$ and $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$ contribute $+1$, while $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ and $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$ contribute $+2$. The observed $M+2$ intensity arises from configurations whose net mass shift is exactly $+2$.\n\nStarting from the independence of isotopic selections and the basic counting principles for identical sites, derive from first principles a closed-form expression for the probability that this molecule exhibits exactly an $+2$ Dalton mass shift relative to the monoisotopic composition owing solely to sulfur and silicon isotopes. Your expression must sum disjoint contributions from all allowed configurations that yield a net $+2$ shift. Then evaluate the expression numerically using $p_{34}$, $p_{33}$, $p_{32}$, $q_{30}$, $q_{29}$, and $q_{28}$ as specified above.\n\nExpress your final answer as a dimensionless decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures.",

We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of observing a mass shift of $+2$ Daltons relative to the monoisotopic mass, which corresponds to the $M+2$ peak in the mass spectrum. The molecule contains $n_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$ sulfur atoms and $n_{\\mathrm{Si}}=2$ silicon atoms.

Configuration: ($2 \\times ^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$).\n    Probability: $\\frac{2!}{0!2!0!} q_{28}^0 q_{29}^2 q_{30}^0 = q_{29}^2$.\n    The total probability is the sum: $P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=2) = 2 q_{28} q_{30} + q_{29}^2$.\n\n**3. Final Closed-Form Expression for $P(M+2)$**\nSubstituting these derived expressions into our original formula for $P(M+2)$:\n$$\nP(M+2) = (p_{32}^3) \\cdot (2 q_{28} q_{30} + q_{29}^2) + (3 p_{32}^2 p_{33}) \\cdot (2 q_{28} q_{29}) + (3 p_{32}^2 p_{34} + 3 p_{32} p_{33}^2) \\cdot (q_{28}^2)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression derived from first principles.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values for the component probabilities:\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=0) = (0.9500)^3 = 0.857375$\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=1) = 3(0.9500)^2(0.0075) = 0.02030625$\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=2) = 3(0.9500)^2(0.0425) + 3(0.9500)(0.0075)^2 = 0.11506875 + 0.0001603125 = 0.1152290625$\n\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=0) = (0.9221)^2 = 0.85026841$\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=1) = 2(0.9221)(0.0469) = 0.08649298$\n$P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=2) = 2(0.9221)(0.0310) + (0.0469)^2 = 0.0571702 + 0.00219961 = 0.05936981$\n\nNow, we compute the three terms for $P(M+2)$:\nTerm 1: $P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=0)P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=2) = (0.857375)(0.05936981) \\approx 0.05089850$\nTerm 2: $P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=1)P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=1) = (0.02030625)(0.08649298) \\approx 0.00175635$\nTerm 3: $P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{S}}=2)P(\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{Si}}=0) = (0.1152290625)(0.85026841) \\approx 0.09798028$\n\nSumming these terms gives the total probability:\n$P(M+2) \\approx 0.05089850 + 0.00175635 + 0.09798028 = 0.15063513$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1506$.\nLet's use the full precision values for the final sum:\n$P(M+2) = (0.857375)(0.05936981) + (0.02030625)(0.08649298) + (0.1152290625)(0.85026841)$\n$P(M+2) = 0.050898495146875 + 0.001756346288875 + 0.09798028213200625$\n$P(M+2) = 0.15063512356775625$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the final result is $0.1506$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, containing no invalidating flaws. It presents a standard, multi-part exercise in mass spectrometry.\n\nThe solution is structured into three parts as requested by the problem statement: first, a derivation of the isotopic spacing for multiply charged ions; second, an explanation of the role of sulfur and silicon isotopes in spectral interpretation; and third, a calculation of specific mass-to-charge ratios for the given analyte.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Isotopic Spacing for Multiply Charged Ions**\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, denoted as $m/z$, is the quantity measured by a mass spectrometer. It is defined as the ratio of an ion's mass, $m$, to its charge number, $z$. The charge of the ion is $ze$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nLet us consider an ion population corresponding to a specific molecular formula. This population is not uniform in mass due to the natural existence of isotopes for its constituent elements. The peak corresponding to the ion containing only the most abundant, lightest stable isotopes of each element is called the monoisotopic peak. Let the mass of this monoisotopic ion be $m_{mono}$ and its charge number be $z$. The observed mass-to-charge ratio for this ion is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_0 = \\frac{m_{mono}}{z} $$\n\nNow, consider an isotopologue of this ion, which differs by the substitution of one or more heavier isotopes. For instance, a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom might replace a $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom. This substitution changes the total mass of the ion by a small amount, $\\Delta m$. The new mass of the isotopologue ion is $m' = m_{mono} + \\Delta m$. The charge, $z$, remains unchanged by isotopic substitution.\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio of this new ion is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_1 = \\frac{m'}{z} = \\frac{m_{mono} + \\Delta m}{z} = \\frac{m_{mono}}{z} + \\frac{\\Delta m}{z} $$\n\nThe spacing, or separation, between these two isotopic peaks on the $m/z$ axis is the difference between their respective $m/z$ values:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_1 - \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_0 = \\left(\\frac{m_{mono}}{z} + \\frac{\\Delta m}{z}\\right) - \\frac{m_{mono}}{z} = \\frac{\\Delta m}{z} $$\n\nThis result is exact. The approximation that the spacing is $1/z$ arises from the nature of the mass difference, $\\Delta m$. The peaks in an isotopic envelope that are commonly labeled $M+1$, $M+2$, etc., arise from substitutions that increase the nominal mass by $1$, $2$, etc. A nominal mass increase of $1$ corresponds to an increase in the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) by one, which most often is a single neutron. For example, the mass difference between $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ is $\\Delta m = m(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 1.00335\\,\\mathrm{u}$. Similarly, $m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) \\approx 0.99703\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m(^{2}\\mathrm{H}) - m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) \\approx 1.00628\\,\\mathrm{u}$. In all these common cases, the exact mass difference $\\Delta m$ is approximately $1\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\nTherefore, for an isotopic peak resulting from a substitution that increases the nominal mass by $1$ (an \"$M+1$\" peak), the observed spacing on the $m/z$ axis is approximately:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{u}}{z} $$\nFor a peak corresponding to a nominal mass increase of $k$ units (an \"$M+k$\" peak), the mass difference is $\\Delta m \\approx k\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and the spacing from the monoisotopic peak is approximately $k/z$. The spacing between adjacent peaks in the envelope (e.g., between $M+k$ and $M+k+1$) is thus approximately $1/z$. This explains why the isotopic envelope of a multiply charged ion appears compressed on the $m/z$ axis.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of Sulfur and Silicon Isotopic Patterns**\n\nThe relative intensities of the peaks in an isotopic cluster ($M$, $M+1$, $M+2$, etc.) depend on the elemental composition of the ion and the natural abundances of the isotopes of each element. For molecules composed solely of C, H, N, and O, the $M+1$ peak is primarily due to the natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ (around $1.1\\%$), and the $M+2$ peak is typically very small.\n\nHowever, certain elements, including sulfur (S) and silicon (Si), have distinctive isotopic signatures because of their heavier isotopes with relatively high natural abundances.\nThe natural isotopic abundances for sulfur are approximately:\n- $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$: $94.99\\%$ (contributes to the $M$ peak)\n- $^{33}\\mathrm{S}$: $0.75\\%$ (contributes to the $M+1$ peak)\n- $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$: $4.25\\%$ (contributes to the $M+2$ peak)\n\nThe natural isotopic abundances for silicon are approximately:\n- $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$: $92.23\\%$ (contributes to the $M$ peak)\n- $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$: $4.68\\%$ (contributes to the $M+1$ peak)\n- $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$: $3.09\\%$ (contributes to the $M+2$ peak)\n\nThe key feature for both elements is a significant contribution to the $M+2$ peak. A molecule containing one sulfur atom will exhibit an $M+2$ peak with an intensity of about $4.25\\%$ relative to the $M$ peak. This is unusually high and serves as a strong indicator for the presence of sulfur. Similarly, a molecule with one silicon atom will show a significant $M+1$ peak (from $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$) and a significant $M+2$ peak (from $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$).\n\nTherefore, observing an isotopic cluster with an $M+2$ peak that is significantly more intense than expected from carbon content alone strongly suggests the presence of elements like S, Si, Cl, or Br. The unique relative intensities of the $M$, $M+1$, and $M+2$ peaks for S and Si allow for their identification. For the analyte in this problem, which contains both S and Si, the resulting isotopic pattern is a convolution of the individual patterns of all its elements. The intensities of the $M+1$ and $M+2$ peaks would be elevated due to contributions from both $^{29}\\mathrm{Si}$/${33}\\mathrm{S}$ and $^{30}\\mathrm{Si}$/${34}\\mathrm{S}$, respectively, in addition to the contributions from $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. This informs the interpretation of the spectrum by allowing the analyst to deduce the presence of these specific heteroatoms.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Monoisotopic m/z Values**\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the $m/z$ value for the monoisotopic ion and the next two isotopic positions based on the simplified $1/z$ spacing model.\n\nFirst, we calculate the monoisotopic mass of the neutral monomer, $M$, with elemental composition $\\mathrm{C}_{4}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{Si}\\mathrm{S}$. We use the provided masses for the most abundant, lightest isotopes: $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, $^{28}\\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$.\nMass of monomer, $m_{M} = 4 \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 12 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\times m(^{28}\\mathrm{Si}) + 1 \\times m(^{32}\\mathrm{S})$.\n$$ m_{M} = 4 \\times (12.000000\\,\\mathrm{u}) + 12 \\times (1.007825032\\,\\mathrm{u}) + 1 \\times (27.976926535\\,\\mathrm{u}) + 1 \\times (31.972071174\\,\\mathrm{u}) $$\n$$ m_{M} = 48.000000\\,\\mathrm{u} + 12.093900384\\,\\mathrm{u} + 27.976926535\\,\\mathrm{u} + 31.972071174\\,\\mathrm{u} = 120.042898093\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n\nThe observed ion is the doubly protonated dimer, $\\left[2M + 2\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{2+}$. Its charge state is $z = 2$. Its mass, $m_{ion}$, is the sum of the masses of two neutral monomers and two protons.\nMass of ion, $m_{ion} = 2 \\times m_{M} + 2 \\times m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$.\nUsing the given mass of a proton, $m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = 1.00727646688\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n$$ m_{ion} = 2 \\times (120.042898093\\,\\mathrm{u}) + 2 \\times (1.00727646688\\,\\mathrm{u}) $$\n$$ m_{ion} = 240.085796186\\,\\mathrm{u} + 2.01455293376\\,\\mathrm{u} = 242.10034911976\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n\nThe monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio, which the problem denotes as $M$, is:\n$$ M = \\frac{m_{ion}}{z} = \\frac{242.10034911976\\,\\mathrm{u}}{2} = 121.05017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} $$\n\nThe problem then asks for the $m/z$ values of the next two isotopic positions using the approximate spacing derived in Part 1. These positions are $M + 1/z$ and $M + 2/z$. With $z=2$, these are $M + 0.5$ and $M + 1.0$.\n\nFirst isotopic position:\n$$ (m/z)_0 = M = 121.05017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} $$\nSecond isotopic position:\n$$ (m/z)_1 = M + \\frac{1}{2} = 121.05017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Th} = 121.55017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} $$\nThird isotopic position:\n$$ (m/z)_2 = M + \\frac{2}{2} = 121.05017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} + 1.0\\,\\mathrm{Th} = 122.05017455988\\,\\mathrm{Th} $$\n\nFinally, we round these values to five significant figures as requested:\n- $(m/z)_0 \\approx 121.05\\,\\mathrm{Th}$\n- $(m/z)_1 \\approx 121.55\\,\\mathrm{Th}$\n- $(m/z)_2 \\approx 122.05\\,\\mathrm{Th}$\n\nThese three values represent the calculated positions for the monoisotopic peak ($M$), the $M+1$ peak, and the $M+2$ peak for the given ion under the specified model.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem statement has been meticulously reviewed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass spectrometry, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Model of Isotopic Intensities\n\nThe relative intensity of isotopic peaks in a mass spectrum is governed by the natural abundances of heavy isotopes for each element in the molecule. For a molecule with an elemental composition given by the counts $\\left(n_{\\mathrm{C}}, n_{\\mathrm{H}}, n_{\\mathrm{N}}, n_{\\mathrm{O}}, n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\right)$, we can model the distribution of mass shifts relative to the monoisotopic mass.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is that isotopic substitutions are independent events, both within and across elements. For each atom of an element $E$, there are probabilities $p^{(E)}_{+1}$ and $p^{(E)}_{+2}$ of it being a heavy isotope that contributes a mass shift of $+1$ or $+2$ Da, respectively. The probability of a zero shift (i.e., being the most abundant light isotope) is $p^{(E)}_{0} = 1 - p^{(E)}_{+1} - p^{(E)}_{+2}$.\n\nA powerful tool for this analysis is the probability generating function (PGF). For a single atom of element $E$, the PGF for its mass shift is:\n$$G_E(z) = p^{(E)}_{0} + p^{(E)}_{+1}z^1 + p^{(E)}_{+2}z^2$$\nFor a group of $n_E$ independent and identically distributed atoms of element $E$, the PGF for their total mass shift is the product of their individual PGFs:\n$$G_{E, n_E}(z) = \\left( G_E(z) \\right)^{n_E} = \\left( p^{(E)}_{0} + p^{(E)}_{+1}z + p^{(E)}_{+2}z^2 \\right)^{n_E}$$\nDue to the independence of contributions from different elements, the PGF for the total mass shift of the entire molecule is the product of the PGFs for each elemental group:\n$$G_{\\text{total}}(z) = \\prod_{E \\in \\{\\mathrm{C,H,N,O,S,Si}\\}} G_{E, n_E}(z) = \\prod_{E} \\left( p^{(E)}_{0} + p^{(E)}_{+1}z + p^{(E)}_{+2}z^2 \\right)^{n_E}$$\nThe unnormalized theoretical intensities of the first three isotopic peaks, $I'_{0}$ (M), $I'_{1}$ (M+1), and $I'_{2}$ (M+2), are the coefficients of $z^0$, $z^1$, and $z^2$ in the Maclaurin series expansion of $G_{\\text{total}}(z)$:\n$$G_{\\text{total}}(z) = I'_{0} + I'_{1}z + I'_{2}z^2 + \\mathcal{O}(z^3)$$\nThese coefficients can be found by evaluating the derivatives of $G_{\\text{total}}(z)$ at $z=0$:\n$$I'_{0} = G_{\\text{total}}(0)$$\n$$I'_{1} = \\frac{G'_{\\text{total}}(0)}{1!}$$\n$$I'_{2} = \\frac{G''_{\\text{total}}(0)}{2!}$$\nTo simplify the derivative calculations, we define $H(z) = \\ln G_{\\text{total}}(z) = \\sum_E n_E \\ln G_E(z)$. The derivatives are:\n$G'_{\\text{total}}(z) = G_{\\text{total}}(z) H'(z)$\n$G''_{\\text{total}}(z) = G_{\\text{total}}(z) \\left( (H'(z))^2 + H''(z) \\right)$\n\nEvaluating at $z=0$:\n$G_E(0) = p^{(E)}_0$, so $I'_{0} = G_{\\text{total}}(0) = \\prod_E \\left(p^{(E)}_0\\right)^{n_E}$.\n$H'(0) = \\sum_E n_E \\frac{G'_E(0)}{G_E(0)} = \\sum_E n_E \\frac{p^{(E)}_{+1}}{p^{(E)}_0}$. Let $u_E = p^{(E)}_{+1}/p^{(E)}_0$.\nThen $I'_{1} = G_{\\text{total}}(0) H'(0) = I'_{0} \\sum_E n_E u_E$.\n\n$H''(0) = \\sum_E n_E \\frac{G''_E(0)G_E(0) - (G'_E(0))^2}{(G_E(0))^2} = \\sum_E n_E \\frac{2p^{(E)}_{+2}p^{(E)}_0 - (p^{(E)}_{+1})^2}{(p^{(E)}_0)^2}$. Let $v_E = p^{(E)}_{+2}/p^{(E)}_0$.\nThen $H''(0) = \\sum_E n_E (2v_E - u_E^2)$.\n$I'_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} G_{\\text{total}}(0) \\left( (H'(0))^2 + H''(0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} I'_{0} \\left( \\left(\\sum_E n_E u_E\\right)^2 + \\sum_E n_E(2v_E - u_E^2) \\right)$.\n\nSo, the formulas for the unnormalized intensities are:\n$$I'_{0} = \\prod_E \\left(p^{(E)}_0\\right)^{n_E}$$\n$$I'_{1} = I'_{0} \\left( \\sum_E n_E \\frac{p^{(E)}_{+1}}{p^{(E)}_0} \\right)$$\n$$I'_{2} = \\frac{I'_{0}}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_E n_E \\frac{p^{(E)}_{+1}}{p^{(E)}_0}\\right)^2 + \\sum_E n_E \\left( \\frac{2p^{(E)}_{+2}}{p^{(E)}_0} - \\left(\\frac{p^{(E)}_{+1}}{p^{(E)}_0}\\right)^2 \\right) \\right]$$\nThese raw intensities are then normalized to sum to $1$ to yield the final theoretical intensities $(I_0, I_1, I_2)$ for comparison with observed data:\n$$S = I'_{0} + I'_{1} + I'_{2}$$\n$$I_m = \\frac{I'_{m}}{S} \\quad \\text{for } m \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\n\n### 2. Parameter Estimation via Least-Squares Minimization\n\nGiven the known counts $(n_{\\mathrm{C}}, n_{\\mathrm{H}}, n_{\\mathrm{N}}, n_{\\mathrm{O}})$ and observed normalized intensities $(I_{0}^{\\mathrm{obs}}, I_{1}^{\\mathrm{obs}}, I_{2}^{\\mathrm{obs}})$, the goal is to estimate the unknown counts $(n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}})$. This is formulated as a non-linear least-squares optimization problem. We seek to find the values of $n_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the theoretical and observed intensities:\n$$\\text{SSE}(n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}}) = \\sum_{m=0}^{2} \\left( I_{m}^{\\mathrm{theory}}(n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}}) - I_{m}^{\\mathrm{obs}} \\right)^2$$\nThe optimization is performed under the physically necessary constraints $n_{\\mathrm{S}} \\ge 0$ and $n_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\ge 0$. Although atom counts are integers, it is standard practice to treat them as continuous variables during optimization for computational convenience, and then round the final continuous estimate to the nearest integer. This minimization problem is solved using a numerical algorithm such as L-BFGS-B, which can handle box constraints.\n\n### 3. Identifiability Analysis using the Jacobian\n\nIdentifiability concerns whether the parameters of a model, here $(n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}})$, can be uniquely determined from the observed data. Poor identifiability arises when different combinations of parameter values produce very similar model outputs. We assess this locally at the estimated solution $(\\hat{n}_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\hat{n}_{\\mathrm{Si}})$ by examining the sensitivity of the model output to small changes in the parameters.\n\nThis sensitivity is captured by the Jacobian matrix, $J$, of the normalized intensity vector $I = (I_0, I_1, I_2)^T$ with respect to the vector of unknown parameters $n_{\\text{unk}} = (n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}})^T$:\n$$J = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial n_{\\text{unk}}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial I_0}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{S}}}  \\frac{\\partial I_0}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{Si}}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial I_1}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{S}}}  \\frac{\\partial I_1}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{Si}}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial I_2}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{S}}}  \\frac{\\partial I_2}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{Si}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe columns of $J$ represent how the intensity pattern changes with an infinitesimal change in $n_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, respectively. If these columns are nearly linearly dependent, it becomes difficult to distinguish the effect of sulfur from that of silicon.\n\nThe degree of this linear dependence is quantified by the condition number, $\\kappa(J)$, of the Jacobian matrix, defined as the ratio of its largest singular value ($\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$) to its smallest singular value ($\\sigma_{\\text{min}}$):\n$$\\kappa(J) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{min}}}$$\nA large condition number indicates that the matrix is close to being singular (rank-deficient), implying poor identifiability. The problem specifies a quantitative criterion: the parameters $(n_{\\mathrm{S}}, n_{\\mathrm{Si}})$ are considered identifiable if and only if $\\kappa(J) \\le 10^3$.\n\nThe partial derivatives in the Jacobian are computed numerically using a central finite difference scheme for accuracy and implementation simplicity:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x_i} \\approx \\frac{f(x + h e_i) - f(x - h e_i)}{2h}$$\nwhere $e_i$ is a standard basis vector and $h$ is a small step size.",
