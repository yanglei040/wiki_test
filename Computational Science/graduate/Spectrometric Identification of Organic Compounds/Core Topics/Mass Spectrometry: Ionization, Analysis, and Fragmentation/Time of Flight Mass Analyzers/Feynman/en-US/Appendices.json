            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. First, to derive the relationship between the relative mass error $\\frac{\\delta m}{m}$ and the absolute timing error $\\delta t$ in a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Second, to calculate the maximum allowable timing jitter $|\\delta t|$ for given performance specifications.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation**\n\nWe begin from the principles of conservation of energy and elementary kinematics.\n\nAn ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$ is accelerated from rest by an electric field over a potential difference $V$. According to the principle of conservation of energy, the potential energy $qV$ lost by the ion is converted into kinetic energy, $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final velocity of the ion.\n$$qV = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nThe problem specifies singly charged ions, for which the charge $q$ is equal to the elementary charge $e$.\n$$eV = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nWe can solve this equation for the ion's velocity $v$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2eV}{m} \\implies v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2eV}{m}}$$\nAfter acceleration, the ion enters a field-free drift region of length $L$, traveling at this constant velocity $v$. The problem assumes that the acceleration time is negligible compared to the drift time. Thus, the total time of flight $t$ is approximately equal to the time taken to traverse the drift region.\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nBy substituting the expression for $v$ from the energy conservation equation into the kinematic equation, we can relate the time of flight $t$ to the ion's mass $m$.\n$$t = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2eV}{m}}} = L\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2eV}}$$\nTo analyze the effect of errors, it is convenient to express the mass $m$ as a function of the time of flight $t$. We square both sides of the equation and rearrange for $m$:\n$$t^2 = L^2 \\left(\\frac{m}{2eV}\\right)$$\n$$m(t) = \\left(\\frac{2eV}{L^2}\\right) t^2$$\nFor a given experimental setup, the acceleration voltage $V$ and the drift length $L$ are constant. Therefore, the term $\\frac{2eV}{L^2}$ is a constant, which we can denote as $C$.\n$$m(t) = C t^2$$\nThis equation shows that the mass of an ion is proportional to the square of its time of flight.\n\nTo determine how a small error in the measurement of time, $\\delta t$, propagates into an error in the determination of mass, $\\delta m$, we use first-order error analysis. We differentiate the expression for $m$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(Ct^2) = 2Ct$$\nFor small, finite changes $\\delta t$ and $\\delta m$, we can approximate the differential relationship $dm = \\frac{dm}{dt} dt$ as:\n$$\\delta m \\approx (2Ct) \\delta t$$\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relative mass error, $\\frac{\\delta m}{m}$. We divide the expression for $\\delta m$ by the expression for $m = Ct^2$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta m}{m} \\approx \\frac{2Ct \\cdot \\delta t}{Ct^2}$$\nUpon simplification, we arrive at the first-order relationship between the relative mass error and the absolute timing error:\n$$\\frac{\\delta m}{m} = \\frac{2\\delta t}{t}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Maximum Allowable Timing Jitter**\n\nThe derived relationship is $\\frac{\\delta m}{m} = \\frac{2\\delta t}{t}$. We are interested in the magnitudes of these small quantities.\n$$\\left|\\frac{\\delta m}{m}\\right| = \\frac{2|\\delta t|}{t}$$\nThe problem provides the following specifications:\n1.  The maximum allowable relative mass error, corresponding to a two-sided mass accuracy specification of $\\pm 2$ parts-per-million ($ppm$). This means:\n    $$\\left|\\frac{\\delta m}{m}\\right|_{max} = 2~\\text{ppm} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n2.  The measured time of flight is:\n    $$t = 50~\\mu\\text{s} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s}$$\nWe need to find the maximum allowable magnitude of the start-trigger timing jitter, which we denote as $|\\delta t|_{max}$. We rearrange the error equation to solve for $|\\delta t|$:\n$$|\\delta t| = \\frac{t}{2}\\left|\\frac{\\delta m}{m}\\right|$$\nSubstituting the maximum allowable relative mass error, we find the maximum allowable timing jitter:\n$$|\\delta t|_{max} = \\frac{t}{2}\\left|\\frac{\\delta m}{m}\\right|_{max}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$|\\delta t|_{max} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s}}{2} \\times (2 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$|\\delta t|_{max} = (25 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$|\\delta t|_{max} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}~\\text{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in picoseconds ($ps$), where $1~\\text{ps} = 10^{-12}~\\text{s}$.\n$$|\\delta t|_{max} = 50~\\text{ps}$$\nThe result must be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value of $50$ already has two significant figures (as implied by the given data, e.g., $t = 50~\\mu\\text{s}$), so no further rounding is necessary.",

            "problem": "A small singly charged organic cation is analyzed by a Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass analyzer at $m/z = 200$.

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The parameters and conditions are consistent with the principles of time-of-flight mass spectrometry.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main parts:\n1.  Calculation of the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between the two specified isotopologues.\n2.  Determination of the resolvability by comparing the required resolving power, $R_{\\mathrm{req}}$, with the instrument's specified resolving power, $R_{\\mathrm{TOF}}$.\n3.  Calculation of the maximum allowable temporal peak width, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$, that would permit the resolution of the two peaks.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles of a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. An ion with mass $m$ and charge $q$ is accelerated from rest through an electric potential $U$. It gains a kinetic energy $K$ given by:\n$$K = qU$$\nThis kinetic energy is also expressed as $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final velocity of the ion. Equating these two expressions for energy gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qU$$\nSolving for the velocity $v$:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qU}{m}}$$\nThe ion then travels through a field-free drift region of length $L$. The time of flight, $t$, is the time taken to traverse this distance:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2qU}}$$\nThis equation shows the fundamental relationship in TOF mass spectrometry: the time of flight is proportional to the square root of the mass-to-charge ratio, $t \\propto \\sqrt{m/q}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between the two isotopologues of interest. The parent ion has a nominal mass-to-charge ratio of $m/z = 200$. We are considering two different singly-substituted isotopologues in the $M+1$ region: one where a $^{12}\\text{C}$ atom is replaced by a $^{13}\\text{C}$ atom, and another where a $^{14}\\text{N}$ atom is replaced by a $^{15}\\text{N}$ atom. Let $m_{\\mathrm{M}}$ be the mass of the parent molecule containing the specific $^{12}\\text{C}$ and $^{14}\\text{N}$ atoms that are substituted.\n\nThe mass of the first isotopologue, $m_1$, is:\n$$m_1 = m_{\\mathrm{M}} - m(^{12}\\text{C}) + m(^{13}\\text{C})$$\nThe mass of the second isotopologue, $m_2$, is:\n$$m_2 = m_{\\mathrm{M}} - m(^{14}\\text{N}) + m(^{15}\\text{N})$$\nThe mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between these two peaks is:\n$$\\Delta m = |m_1 - m_2| = |(m_{\\mathrm{M}} - m(^{12}\\text{C}) + m(^{13}\\text{C})) - (m_{\\mathrm{M}} - m(^{14}\\text{N}) + m(^{15}\\text{N}))|$$\n$$\\Delta m = |(m(^{13}\\text{C}) - m(^{12}\\text{C})) - (m(^{15}\\text{N}) - m(^{14}\\text{N}))|$$\nUsing the provided exact atomic masses:\n$m(^{12}\\text{C}) = 12.00000000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m(^{13}\\text{C}) = 13.00335483521\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m(^{14}\\text{N}) = 14.00307400443\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m(^{15}\\text{N}) = 15.00010889888\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\nThe mass differences for the substitutions are:\n$$m(^{13}\\text{C}) - m(^{12}\\text{C}) = 1.00335483521\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n$$m(^{15}\\text{N}) - m(^{14}\\text{N}) = 0.99703489445\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta m$:\n$$\\Delta m = |1.00335483521 - 0.99703489445|\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.00631994076\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nNow, we determine if the instrument can resolve these two peaks. Resolving power, $R$, is defined as $R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$. To resolve two peaks, the instrument's resolving power must be at least equal to the required resolving power, $R_{\\mathrm{req}}$. The two isotopologues have a nominal mass of $m \\approx 201\\,\\mathrm{u}$ (since they are in the $M+1$ cluster of a parent with nominal mass $200\\,\\mathrm{u}$).\n$$R_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{201\\,\\mathrm{u}}{0.00631994076\\,\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 31804.2$$\nThe instrument has a specified resolving power of $R_{\\mathrm{TOF}} = 40000$. Since $R_{\\mathrm{TOF}} > R_{\\mathrm{req}}$ ($40000 > 31804.2$), the instrument is capable of resolving these two peaks. The resolvability indicator is $1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the maximum allowable temporal full-width at half-maximum, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$, that would just achieve resolution. We need to relate the mass resolving power, $R_m = m/\\Delta m$, to the temporal resolving power. From $t = k\\sqrt{m}$ (where $k = L/\\sqrt{2qU}$ is a constant), we can find the relationship between small differences in mass, $\\Delta m$, and time, $\\Delta t$, by differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dt}{dm} = \\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{m}}$$\nFor small finite differences, $\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{dt}{dm}\\Delta m = \\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{m}}\\Delta m$. Substituting $k = t/\\sqrt{m}$:\n$$\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{t/\\sqrt{m}}{2\\sqrt{m}}\\Delta m = \\frac{t}{2m}\\Delta m$$\nThis gives the important relation $\\frac{\\Delta m}{m} \\approx \\frac{2\\Delta t}{t}$.\nIn TOF mass spectrometry, resolving power is commonly defined in terms of the temporal peak width at half-maximum, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$, as $R = \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}}$. This definition relates the instrumental peak width to the mass resolving power, $R = m/\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$.\nTo \"just achieve resolution\" of the two peaks separated by $\\Delta m$, the instrument's resolving power must be equal to $R_{\\mathrm{req}}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}, max}}$$\nSolving for the maximum allowable temporal width, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}, max}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FWHM}, max} = \\frac{t}{2R_{\\mathrm{req}}}$$\nTo use this formula, we must first calculate the time of flight, $t$, for an ion with $m \\approx 201\\,\\mathrm{u}$.

First, we must calculate the flight time $t$.\nGiven values:\n$m = 500\\,u = 500 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg} = 8.302695333 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\text{kg}$\n$q = e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n$U = 10.0\\,\\text{kV} = 1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{V}$\n$L = 1.500\\,\\text{m}$\n\n$$t = 1.500\\,\\text{m} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{8.302695333 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\text{kg}}{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{V})}} \\approx 2.414506 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{s}$$\nWith this flight time, we can compute the fractional uncertainties for time and length:\n$\\sigma_t = 10\\,\\text{ps} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{s}$\n$\\sigma_L = 0.86\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.86 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_t}{t} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{s}}{2.414506 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{s}} \\approx 4.14161 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_L}{L} = \\frac{0.86 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}}{1.500\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 5.73333 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nNow we calculate $C_{TL}^2$:\n$$C_{TL}^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_t}{t}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_L}{L}\\right)^2 = 4\\left( (4.14161 \\times 10^{-7})^2 + (5.73333 \\times 10^{-7})^2 \\right)$$\n$$C_{TL}^2 \\approx 4(1.7153 \\times 10^{-13} + 3.2871 \\times 10^{-13}) = 4(5.0024 \\times 10^{-13}) \\approx 2.001 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nThe design criterion states that the combined voltage-related contribution equals the combined timing-plus-length contribution, i.e., $C_V^2 = C_{TL}^2$.\n$$C_V^2 \\approx 2.001 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nThis is consistent with the total target mass accuracy, since $(\\sigma_m/m)^2 = C_V^2 + C_{TL}^2 = 2 \\times C_{TL}^2 \\approx 4.002 \\times 10^{-12}$, which gives $\\sigma_m/m \\approx \\sqrt{4.002 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 2.0005 \\times 10^{-6}$, matching the target of $2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nWe now solve for the required RMS fractional voltage stability, $\\sigma_U/U$, using the expression for $C_V^2$:\n$$C_V^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_U}{U}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_E}{E}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given $\\sigma_E/E = 8.0 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_U}{U}\\right)^2 = C_V^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_E}{E}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_U}{U}\\right)^2 \\approx 2.001 \\times 10^{-12} - (8.0 \\times 10^{-7})^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_U}{U}\\right)^2 \\approx 2.001 \\times 10^{-12} - 0.64 \\times 10^{-12} = 1.361 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nTaking the square root gives the required voltage stability:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_U}{U} = \\sqrt{1.361 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 1.1666 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $1.17 \\times 10^{-6}$.",
