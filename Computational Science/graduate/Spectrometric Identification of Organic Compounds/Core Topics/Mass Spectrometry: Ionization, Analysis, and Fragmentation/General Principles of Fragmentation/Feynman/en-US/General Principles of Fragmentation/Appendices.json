Calculation of Precursor Ion Masses**\n\nFirst, we calculate the exact mass of the neutral ethanol molecule, $M$, using the provided monoisotopic masses: $m_{\\mathrm{C}}=12.000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{O}}=15.994915\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\nThe molecular formula of ethanol is $\\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$.\n$$m_M = 2 \\times m_{\\mathrm{C}} + 6 \\times m_{\\mathrm{H}} + 1 \\times m_{\\mathrm{O}}$$\n$$m_M = 2 \\times 12.000000 + 6 \\times 1.007825 + 1 \\times 15.994915$$\n$$m_M = 24.000000 + 6.046950 + 15.994915 = 46.041865\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nNext, we determine the masses of the two precursor ions:\na) The odd-electron molecular ion, $M^{+\\cdot}$: The problem instructs to neglect the mass of the electron in its formation from the neutral molecule $M$. Therefore, its mass is considered equal to the mass of the neutral molecule. A molecular ion is an odd-electron (OE) species because it is formed by removing one electron from an even-electron neutral molecule.\n$$m_{M^{+\\cdot}} = m_M = 46.041865\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nb) The even-electron protonated molecule, $[M+H]^+$: This ion is formed by the addition of a proton ($m_{\\mathrm{H}^+}=1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u}$) to the neutral molecule.

Application of the Even-Electron Rule**\n\nThe even-electron rule is a guiding principle in mass spectrometry stating that even-electron (EE) ions have a strong tendency to fragment by losing neutral, even-electron molecules, resulting in the formation of another even-electron ion. Fragmentation of an EE ion by loss of a radical (odd-electron, OE) to form an OE ion is generally disfavored.\n\nWe apply this rule to the fragmentation of the precursor $[M+H]^+$, which is an even-electron ion.\n\n- **Pathway with loss of $\\text{OH}^{\\bullet}$**:\nThe reaction is $[M+H]^+ \\rightarrow [\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]^{+\\cdot} + \\text{OH}^{\\bullet}$.\nThe precursor $[M+H]^+$ is an EE ion. The lost species, $\\text{OH}^{\\bullet}$, is a radical and therefore an OE species. The resulting fragment ion, $[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]^{+\\cdot}$, is a radical cation and thus an OE species. The process is $\\mathrm{EE}_{ion} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{OE}_{ion} + \\mathrm{OE}_{neutral}$. This pathway violates the preferred fragmentation pattern described by the even-electron rule.\nTherefore, this pathway does not comply, and $E_{\\mathrm{rad}}=0$.\n\n- **Pathway with loss of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$**:\nThe reaction is $[M+H]^+ \\rightarrow [\\mathrm{C_2H_5}]^+ + \\mathrm{H_2O}$.\nThe precursor $[M+H]^+$ is an EE ion. The lost species, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, is a stable, neutral molecule with an even number of electrons (EE). The resulting fragment ion, the ethyl cation $[\\mathrm{C_2H_5}]^+$, is a carbocation, which is an EE species. The process is $\\mathrm{EE}_{ion} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{EE}_{ion} + \\mathrm{EE}_{neutral}$. This pathway is fully compliant with the even-electron rule.\nTherefore, this pathway complies, and $E_{\\mathrm{neu}}=1$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- $m/z$ for $M^{+\\cdot}-\\text{OH}^{\\bullet}$: $29.039$\n- $m/z$ for $M^{+\\cdot}-\\mathrm{H_2O}$: $28.031$\n- $m/z$ for $[M+H]^{+}-\\text{OH}^{\\bullet}$: $30.046$\n- $m/z$ for $[M+H]^{+}-\\mathrm{H_2O}$: $29.039$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{rad}}$: $0$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{neu}}$: $1$\n\nThese six values are arranged in the specified order within a row matrix for the final answer.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass spectrometry, well-posed, and objective. It requires reasoning based on the interplay of ion structure, collisional activation energy, and collision regime to predict fragmentation behavior.\n\nThe core of the question addresses the conditions under which an even-electron precursor ion, which typically fragments via heterolytic cleavage to produce an even-electron product ion and a neutral molecule (the \"even-electron rule\"), will instead undergo a high-energy homolytic cleavage to produce an odd-electron radical and an odd-electron product ion. This is considered a \"violation\" of the empirical even-electron rule. The specific type of fragmentation is \"charge-remote,\" meaning the bond cleavage occurs at a site distant from the charge-carrying moiety.\n\nThe general principles governing the observation of such fragmentation pathways are:\n\n1.  **Ion Structure**: The precursor ion must possess a fixed, localized charge site that is chemically stable and does not readily participate in or direct fragmentation. Classic examples are quaternary ammonium ($R_4N^+$) or N-alkylpyridinium groups. This forces fragmentation to occur elsewhere in the molecule. Additionally, the ion should have a large, non-polar, and typically saturated hydrocarbon backbone (e.g., a long alkyl chain or a steroid nucleus) where the charge-remote cleavage can occur. Ions with mobile protons are poor candidates, as the proton will migrate to direct lower-energy fragmentation pathways.\n\n2.  **Activation Energy**: Homolytic bond cleavages (radical formation) generally have higher activation energies than heterolytic cleavages for even-electron ions. Therefore, a large amount of internal energy must be deposited into the ion to make these high-energy channels competitive. This is achieved through high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HE-CID), where precursor ions are accelerated to kiloelectronvolt ($keV$) kinetic energies. The center-of-mass collision energy, $E_{cm} = E_{lab} \\frac{m_{\\text{gas}}}{m_{\\text{ion}} + m_{\\text{gas}}}$, must be high (hundreds of $eV$).\n\n3.  **Activation Timescale**: The energy must be deposited on a timescale faster than the rate of fragmentation through lower-energy pathways and faster than collisional or radiative cooling. This is achieved in a single-collision or near single-collision regime, which is characteristic of beam-type instruments (e.g., sectors, TOF/TOF) operating with a low-pressure collision gas. \"Slow heating\" via multiple low-energy collisions (e.g., in an ion trap or a triple quadrupole collision cell) allows the ion to explore its potential energy surface and invariably find the lowest-energy pathway, which is typically a heterolytic cleavage.\n\nBased on these principles, we will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. A fixed-charge N-alkylpyridinium derivative of a saturated $C_{18}$ fatty acyl chain is analyzed by beam-type high-energy Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) in a sector instrument. The precursor is accelerated to $8\\,\\text{keV}$ and collides with xenon ($m_{\\text{gas}} \\approx 131\\,\\text{u}$) in a low-pressure, near single-collision cell. The precursor mass is $m_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 600\\,\\text{u}$.**\n\n*   **Ion Structure**: The precursor has a fixed-charge N-alkylpyridinium group and a long, saturated $C_{18}$ chain. This is the archetypal structure for promoting charge-remote fragmentation.\n*   **Activation Energy**: The experiment uses high-energy CID ($E_{lab} = 8\\,\\text{keV} = 8000\\,\\text{eV}$). The center-of-mass energy is substantial:\n    $$E_{cm} = E_{lab} \\frac{m_{\\text{gas}}}{m_{\\text{ion}} + m_{\\text{gas}}} = 8000\\,\\text{eV} \\times \\frac{131}{600 + 131} \\approx 1432\\,\\text{eV}$$\n    A single collision can deposit a very large amount of internal energy, sufficient to access high-energy homolytic cleavage channels. The use of a heavy collision gas (xenon) maximizes the efficiency of this energy transfer.\n*   **Activation Timescale**: The analysis is performed in a \"low-pressure, near single-collision cell,\" which ensures rapid, impulsive activation, favoring high-energy pathways over slower, lower-energy rearrangements.\n*   **Conclusion**: This option describes the textbook conditions for observing charge-remote radical losses from a fatty acid derivative. All three principles point toward this outcome.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A protonated tertiary amine lipid (mobile proton) is activated by resonance excitation in a quadrupole ion trap (qIT) with helium bath gas ($m_{\\text{gas}} \\approx 4\\,\\text{u}$) at $\\sim$ $1\\,\\text{mTorr}$, yielding multiple low-energy collisions amounting to $\\lesssim$ $2\\,\\text{eV}$ per collision. The precursor mass is $m_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 600\\,\\text{u}$.**\n\n*   **Ion Structure**: The precursor has a \"mobile proton.\" This mobile charge site will direct fragmentation via low-energy, heterolytic pathways (charge-directed fragmentation), which is contrary to the requirements for charge-remote fragmentation.\n*   **Activation Energy**: The activation is explicitly \"low-energy,\" involving collisions of $\\lesssim$ $2\\,\\text{eV}$ each. Such low energy input is insufficient to efficiently populate high-energy radical channels.\n*   **Activation Timescale**: The process involves \"multiple low-energy collisions\" in an ion trap, which constitutes a \"slow heating\" regime. This method overwhelmingly favors the lowest-energy fragmentation pathway available to the ion.\n*   **Conclusion**: All factors described in this option (mobile proton, low-energy activation, multiple-collision regime) strongly disfavor charge-remote radical losses and instead promote conventional, low-energy, charge-directed fragmentation.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A deprotonated $C_{18}$ fatty acid anion (even-electron) is subjected to low-energy CID in a triple quadrupole with argon ($m_{\\text{gas}} \\approx 40\\,\\text{u}$) at $2\\,\\text{mTorr}$ and laboratory-frame collision energy of $20\\,\\text{eV}$; $m_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 300\\,\\text{u}$.**\n\n*   **Ion Structure**: A deprotonated fatty acid has a localized charge (carboxylate, $-\\text{COO}^-$) and a long alkyl chain, which is a suitable structure for charge-remote fragmentation.\n*   **Activation Energy**: The experiment uses low-energy CID. The laboratory-frame energy is only $20\\,\\text{eV}$. The center-of-mass energy is:\n    $$E_{cm} = E_{lab} \\frac{m_{\\text{gas}}}{m_{\\text{ion}} + m_{\\text{gas}}} = 20\\,\\text{eV} \\times \\frac{40}{300 + 40} \\approx 2.35\\,\\text{eV}$$\n    This low $E_{cm}$ means that the maximum energy deposited per collision is very small, insufficient to drive energetically demanding radical reactions.\n*   **Activation Timescale**: The pressure of $2\\,\\text{mTorr}$ in a triple quadrupole's collision cell ensures a multiple-collision regime, leading to slow, stepwise heating that favors low-energy fragmentation channels (e.g., loss of $\\text{CO}_2$ or $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n*   **Conclusion**: Despite having a suitable ion structure, the low-energy, multiple-collision activation conditions will not lead to significant radical losses.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A protonated peptide is dissociated by Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) in a quadrupole ion trap, producing radical $c$- and $z$-type fragments.**\n\n*   **Mechanism**: ETD is a non-collisional fragmentation technique. It involves the transfer of an electron to a multiply charged even-electron precursor ion, $[M+nH]^{n+}$, to produce an odd-electron radical ion, $[M+nH]^{(n-1)+\\cdot}$. This odd-electron species then fragments.\n*   **Relation to Even-Electron Rule**: The even-electron rule describes the expected fragmentation behavior of even-electron ions. In ETD, the precursor is converted to an odd-electron ion *before* fragmentation. The subsequent fragmentation of this radical ion is expected to proceed via radical pathways and is thus not a \"violation\" of the even-electron rule. The rule is circumvented by changing the nature of the fragmenting species itself.\n*   **Relation to Problem**: The question asks about collisional activation conditions that cause an even-electron ion to violate the rule. ETD is an entirely different chemical process.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A fixed-charge quaternary ammonium tagged steroid is analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Time-of-Flight/Time-of-Flight (TOF/TOF) with high-energy CID in a collision cell using argon ($m_{\\text{gas}} \\approx 40\\,\\text{u}$). The acceleration potential imparts approximately $15\\,\\text{keV}$ to $z=+1$ precursors ($m_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 500\\,\\text{u}$) under low collision gas pressure conditions.**\n\n*   **Ion Structure**: The precursor has a fixed-charge quaternary ammonium group, which localizes the charge. The steroid nucleus provides a large, saturated hydrocarbon framework for charge-remote cleavages. This structure is suitable.\n*   **Activation Energy**: The experiment employs high-energy CID with $E_{lab} \\approx 15\\,\\text{keV} = 15000\\,\\text{eV}$. The center-of-mass energy is high:\n    $$E_{cm} = E_{lab} \\frac{m_{\\text{gas}}}{m_{\\text{ion}} + m_{\\text{gas}}} = 15000\\,\\text{eV} \\times \\frac{40}{500 + 40} \\approx 1111\\,\\text{eV}$$\n    This is a large amount of available energy, capable of inducing high-energy homolytic cleavages throughout the steroid backbone.\n*   **Activation Timescale**: The experiment is run under \"low collision gas pressure conditions,\" which corresponds to the near single-collision regime required for impulsive, high-energy activation characteristic of TOF/TOF instruments.\n*   **Conclusion**: This option describes conditions—a suitable fixed-charge precursor, high-energy CID, and a single-collision regime—that are highly plausible for producing observable charge-remote radical losses.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
