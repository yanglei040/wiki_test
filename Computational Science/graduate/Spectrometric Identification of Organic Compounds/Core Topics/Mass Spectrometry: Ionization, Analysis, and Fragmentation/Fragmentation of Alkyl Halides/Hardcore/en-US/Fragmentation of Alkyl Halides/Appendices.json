            "problem": "An unknown monobromoalkane is analyzed by Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrometry, where EI stands for Electron Ionization. In the molecular-ion region, two peaks separated by approximately $2$ unified atomic mass units appear, conventionally labeled $M$ and $M+2$. Assume the following: (i) the only element contributing a $2$ unified atomic mass unit separation in this region is bromine, (ii) isotopologues that differ only in the isotopic composition of bromine have equal ionization and detection efficiencies, and (iii) the isotopic abundances of bromine are $p_{79} = 0.5069$ for ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$ and $p_{81} = 0.4931$ for ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$. Define $M$ as the monoisotopic molecular ion containing ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$ (with all other atoms in their most abundant isotopes), and define $M+2$ as the corresponding isotopologue containing ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$. \n\nStarting from the principle that relative ion intensities for isotopologues are proportional to their isotopic probabilities, derive the expected $M:M+2$ intensity ratio for a monobromoalkane under the above assumptions. Round your final numerical ratio to four significant figures. Express the ratio as a single real number equal to $\\dfrac{I(M)}{I(M+2)}$. No units are required for the final ratio.\n\nThen, briefly justify, in words, how this two-peak pattern and the computed ratio can be used to identify bromine in a congested EI mass spectrum of an alkyl halide, with reference to the typical fragmentation behavior of alkyl halides. Your qualitative justification will not be graded numerically, but it must be physically sound and consistent with the quantitative result. For the calculation, you may neglect isotopic contributions from elements other than bromine; if you discuss such contributions qualitatively (for example, ${}^{13}\\text{C}$), clearly state any approximations you make. Use mass-to-charge ratio $(m/z)$ notation where appropriate, with $m/z$ denoting mass-to-charge ratio.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected intensity ratio of the molecular ion peak, $I(M)$, to its isotopologue peak, $I(M+2)$, for a monobromoalkane in an Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrum. The peak $M$ corresponds to the molecular ion containing the ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$ isotope, and the peak $M+2$ corresponds to the molecular ion containing the ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$ isotope. All other atoms are assumed to be in their most abundant isotopic forms.\n\nThe fundamental principle provided is that the relative intensity of a mass spectral peak is proportional to the abundance of the corresponding ion. A key assumption is that the ionization and detection efficiencies for the two isotopologues in question, which differ only by the bromine isotope, are equal. This allows us to equate the ratio of ion intensities directly to the ratio of the natural abundances of the neutral molecular isotopologues.\n\nLet the monobromoalkane be denoted by the general formula $\\text{R-Br}$, where $\\text{R}$ represents an alkyl group. The problem is concerned with two populations of this molecule: those containing ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$ and those containing ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$. The relative abundance of these two types of molecules in any macroscopic sample is determined by the natural isotopic abundances of bromine.\n\nLet $I(M)$ be the intensity of the peak for the ion $[\\text{R}-{}^{79}\\text{Br}]^{+\\bullet}$, which has a mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) corresponding to $M$.\nLet $I(M+2)$ be the intensity of the peak for the ion $[\\text{R}-{}^{81}\\text{Br}]^{+\\bullet}$, which has a mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) corresponding to $M+2$. The mass difference is indeed $81 - 79 = 2$ unified atomic mass units.\n\nThe given isotopic abundances for bromine are:\n-   Abundance of ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$, denoted as $p_{79} = 0.5069$.\n-   Abundance of ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$, denoted as $p_{81} = 0.4931$.\n\nAccording to the stated principle of proportionality and the assumption of equal efficiencies, the ratio of the peak intensities is equal to the ratio of the isotopic abundances:\n$$\n\\frac{I(M)}{I(M+2)} = \\frac{p_{79}}{p_{81}}\n$$\nThis relationship holds because the molecule is a monobromoalkane, containing exactly one bromine atom. Therefore, the probability of a molecule containing ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$ is simply the natural abundance of ${}^{79}\\text{Br}$, and likewise for ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$. The problem specifies to neglect isotopic contributions from other elements (like ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ or ${}^{2}\\text{H}$), which simplifies the calculation to this direct ratio.\n\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{I(M)}{I(M+2)} = \\frac{0.5069}{0.4931}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\frac{0.5069}{0.4931} \\approx 1.02800648955...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{I(M)}{I(M+2)} \\approx 1.028\n$$\n\nFor the qualitative justification, the calculated ratio of approximately $1.028:1$, which is very close to $1:1$, is a highly distinctive signature for the presence of a single bromine atom in an ion. This signature consists of two peaks of nearly equal intensity separated by $2$ $m/z$ units. This pattern is often referred to as an \"A/A+2 doublet\".\n\nThis signature is invaluable for identifying bromine in a complex mass spectrum for several reasons. Firstly, very few elements possess naturally occurring isotopes that produce such a pattern. The most common alternative is chlorine, which has isotopes ${}^{35}\\text{Cl}$ (abundance $\\approx 75.8\\%$) and ${}^{37}\\text{Cl}$ (abundance $\\approx 24.2\\%$). A monochlorinated compound gives an $M:M+2$ intensity ratio of roughly $3:1$, which is easily distinguished from bromine's $\\approx 1:1$ ratio. Other elements like sulfur (${}^{34}\\text{S}$ abundance $\\approx 4.2\\%$) or oxygen (${}^{18}\\text{O}$ abundance $\\approx 0.2\\%$) yield much weaker $M+2$ peaks. The contribution to the $M+2$ peak from ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ is also generally small; for an ion with $n$ carbons, the probability of having two ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms is proportional to $\\binom{n}{2}(0.011)^2$, which is typically negligible compared to the contribution from ${}^{81}\\text{Br}$.\n\nSecondly, fragmentation of alkyl halides provides further confirmation. The molecular ion ($M^{+\\bullet}$) for alkyl halides is often unstable and may be of low intensity or entirely absent. A common fragmentation pathway for the odd-electron molecular ion is the homolytic cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond. For a monobromoalkane $\\text{R-Br}$, this leads to the loss of a bromine radical ($\\text{Br}^{\\bullet}$) and the formation of an even-electron alkyl carbocation, $\\text{R}^{+}$. This $\\text{R}^{+}$ fragment ion will *not* contain bromine, and therefore its peak in the mass spectrum will not exhibit the characteristic $1:1$ doublet pattern.\n\nHowever, other fragmentation pathways, such as alpha-cleavage (cleavage of a C-C bond adjacent to the C-Br bond), can produce fragment ions that *do* retain the bromine atom. For example, a primary bromoalkane might fragment to give a $[\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}]^{+}$ ion. This fragment ion, because it contains one bromine atom, will appear in the spectrum as a pair of peaks (at $m/z = 93$ and $m/z = 95$) with the same characteristic $\\approx 1:1$ intensity ratio. Observing this isotopic signature on multiple fragment ions, even if the molecular ion is not observed, provides powerful and unambiguous evidence for the presence of a bromine atom in the original molecule. This \"isotopic tag\" helps to track bromine-containing fragments through the complex fragmentation pattern, greatly aiding structural elucidation.",

            "problem": "An electron ionization (Electron Ionization (EI)) mass spectrum of $sec$-butyl chloride (systematic name $2$-chlorobutane, molecular formula $\\mathrm{C_4H_9Cl}$) exhibits prominent alpha-cleavage pathways adjacent to the carbon–chlorine bond. Under EI, the neutral molecule is first converted to a radical cation, after which homolytic cleavage of one of the two $\\alpha$ carbon–carbon bonds occurs to yield a chlorinated cationic fragment and a neutral radical. Use only the following foundational principles as your starting point: (i) conservation of mass and charge in fragmentation processes, (ii) the qualitative ordering of radical stabilities (more substituted alkyl radicals are thermodynamically more stable than less substituted alkyl radicals), (iii) the general observation that in alpha cleavage of alkyl halide radical cations, the positive charge preferentially resides on the halogen-bearing fragment due to stabilization by the halogen lone pairs and inductive effects, and (iv) the nominal integer atomic masses ${}^{12}\\text{C}=12$, ${}^{1}\\text{H}=1$, and ${}^{35}\\text{Cl}=35$. \n\nFrom these principles, determine which alpha-cleavage pathway is expected to be dominant for $2$-chlorobutane: cleavage that expels a methyl radical ($\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$) or cleavage that expels an ethyl radical ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5^{\\bullet}$). Then, compute the monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ (take the charge number to be $+1$) of the resulting chlorinated cationic fragment that corresponds to the favored pathway, using the ${}^{35}\\text{Cl}$ isotopologue only. \n\nExpress your final answer as a single integer $m/z$ value with no units. No rounding instruction is necessary because $m/z$ should be an integer by construction.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the dominant alpha-cleavage fragmentation pathway for $2$-chlorobutane in an electron ionization mass spectrometer and the calculation of the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) for the resulting primary fragment ion. The solution must be derived strictly from the provided principles.\n\nFirst, we identify the structure of the molecule, $2$-chlorobutane, with the molecular formula $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{Cl}$. The structure is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(Cl)CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. The carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom is the $\\alpha$-carbon. In the IUPAC numbering scheme ($\\text{C}_1\\text{H}_3\\text{-C}_2\\text{H(Cl)-C}_3\\text{H}_2\\text{-C}_4\\text{H}_3$), this is the $\\text{C}_2$ carbon.\n\nThe initial step in electron ionization is the removal of an electron from the neutral molecule to form a molecular ion, which is a radical cation, denoted as $[M]^{\\bullet+}$. For $2$-chlorobutane, this process is:\n$$ \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{Cl} \\rightarrow [\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{Cl}]^{\\bullet+} + e^- $$\nThe problem states that this molecular ion undergoes alpha-cleavage, which is the homolytic cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the $\\alpha$-carbon. For $2$-chlorobutane, there are two such bonds: the $\\text{C}_1-\\text{C}_2$ bond and the $\\text{C}_2-\\text{C}_3$ bond. This leads to two possible fragmentation pathways.\n\nPathway A: Cleavage of the $\\text{C}_1-\\text{C}_2$ bond.\nThis pathway involves the breaking of the bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon and the methyl group ($\\text{CH}_3$). Homolytic cleavage results in the expulsion of a methyl radical, $\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$. According to Principle (i) on conservation of mass and charge, and Principle (iii) that the charge remains on the halogen-bearing fragment, the reaction is:\n$$ [\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(Cl)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3]^{\\bullet+} \\rightarrow \\underbrace{[\\text{CH(Cl)CH}_2\\text{CH}_3]^+}_{\\text{Cationic Fragment A}} + \\underbrace{\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}}_{\\text{Radical A}} $$\nThe ejected radical is a methyl radical. The resulting cation has the formula $[\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6\\text{Cl}]^+$.\n\nPathway B: Cleavage of the $\\text{C}_2-\\text{C}_3$ bond.\nThis pathway involves breaking the bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon and the ethyl group ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$). Homolytic cleavage results in the expulsion of an ethyl radical, $\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$. The corresponding reaction is:\n$$ [\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(Cl)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3]^{\\bullet+} \\rightarrow \\underbrace{[\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(Cl)}]^+}_{\\text{Cationic Fragment B}} + \\underbrace{\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}}_{\\text{Radical B}} $$\nThe ejected radical is an ethyl radical, which is a primary alkyl radical. The resulting cation has the formula $[\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4\\text{Cl}]^+$.\n\nTo determine which pathway is dominant, we apply Principle (ii), which states that the stability of the products influences the reaction rate. Specifically, the formation of a more stable neutral radical is favored. We must compare the stability of Radical A ($\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$) and Radical B ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$).\nAccording to the established hierarchy of alkyl radical stability (tertiary $>$ secondary $>$ primary $>$ methyl), the ethyl radical ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$), being a primary radical, is thermodynamically more stable than the methyl radical ($\\text{CH}_3^{\\bullet}$).\nTherefore, Pathway B, which results in the expulsion of the more stable ethyl radical, is the dominant fragmentation pathway.\n\nThe final step is to compute the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, of the cationic fragment produced in this dominant pathway (Pathway B). The fragment is Cationic Fragment B, with the formula $[\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4\\text{Cl}]^+$. The problem specifies that the charge number, $z$, is $+1$. Thus, the $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the mass of the ion, $m$. We are instructed to use the nominal integer atomic masses: $\\text{C}=12$, $\\text{H}=1$, and for chlorine, the specific isotopologue ${}^{35}\\text{Cl}=35$.\n\nThe mass, $m$, of the ion $[\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4{}^{35}\\text{Cl}]^+$ is calculated as follows:\n$$ m = (2 \\times \\text{mass of C}) + (4 \\times \\text{mass of H}) + (1 \\times \\text{mass of } {}^{35}\\text{Cl}) $$\n$$ m = (2 \\times 12) + (4 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 35) $$\n$$ m = 24 + 4 + 35 $$\n$$ m = 63 $$\nSince the charge $z$ is $1$, the mass-to-charge ratio is:\n$$ m/z = \\frac{63}{1} = 63 $$\nThis is the $m/z$ value of the most prominent fragment ion resulting from alpha-cleavage of the $2$-chlorobutane (${}^{35}\\text{Cl}$ isotopologue) molecular ion.",

Fragmentation under Electron Ionization (EI)**\nThe precursor ion is the molecular ion, $M^{+\\cdot}$, which is an **odd-electron ion**.\n- According to Principle 2, odd-electron ions can undergo both neutral and radical losses.\n- According to Principle 3, homolytic cleavage is consistent with the fragmentation of odd-electron ions.\n\nTwo primary pathways involving the chlorine atom are considered:\n\n- **Pathway 1: Radical Loss (Homolytic Cleavage)**\nThe $\\mathrm{C{-}Cl}$ bond cleaves homolytically, where one electron goes to the chlorine atom and one stays with the carbon framework, which retains the charge.\n$$ \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{Cl}^{+\\cdot} \\rightarrow \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+ + \\text{Cl}^{\\bullet} $$\nThis reaction involves the loss of a chlorine radical ($\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$), which is a **radical loss**. The resulting product is the butyl cation, $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+$.\nThe nominal mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+$ is calculated as: $(4 \\times 12) + (9 \\times 1) = 48 + 9 = 57$. This fragmentation produces a peak at $m/z\\;57$.\n\n- **Pathway 2: Neutral Loss (Rearrangement and Elimination)**\nThe ion can undergo a rearrangement to eliminate a neutral molecule of hydrogen chloride ($\\mathrm{HCl}$).\n$$ \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{Cl}^{+\\cdot} \\rightarrow \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8^{+\\cdot} + \\mathrm{HCl} $$\nThis reaction involves the loss of a neutral molecule ($\\mathrm{HCl}$), which is a **neutral loss**. The resulting product is the butene radical cation, $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8^{+\\cdot}$, which is itself an odd-electron ion.\nThe nominal $m/z$ of $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8^{+\\cdot}$ is calculated as: $(4 \\times 12) + (8 \\times 1) = 48 + 8 = 56$. This fragmentation produces a peak at $m/z\\;56$.\n\nBoth Pathways 1 and 2 are permitted for odd-electron ions according to the given principles.\n\n**2. Fragmentation under Chemical Ionization (CI)**\nThe precursor ion is the protonated molecule, $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$, which is an **even-electron ion**.\n- According to Principle 2 (The Even-Electron Rule), even-electron ions **preferentially** undergo losses of neutral species. Radical losses are strongly disfavored.\n- According to Principle 3, heterolytic cleavage is consistent with the fragmentation of even-electron ions.\n\nLet's analyze the fragmentation of $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$. The protonation typically occurs on the most basic site, which is the chlorine atom with its lone pairs of electrons, forming a chloronium-type ion.\n\n- **Pathway 1: Neutral Loss (Heterolytic Cleavage)**\nThe precursor ion eliminates a neutral molecule of $\\mathrm{HCl}$. This is a heterolytic process where the chlorine atom takes the bonding pair of electrons.\n$$ \\left[\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{ClH}\\right]^+ \\rightarrow \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+ + \\mathrm{HCl} $$\nThis reaction involves the loss of a neutral molecule ($\\mathrm{HCl}$), which is a **neutral loss**. This pathway is strongly favored for an even-electron ion according to the Even-Electron Rule. The product is the butyl cation, $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+$, with an $m/z$ of $57$.\n\n- **Pathway 2: Radical Loss**\nThis would involve the loss of a radical, for example, $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$.\n$$ \\left[\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9\\text{ClH}\\right]^+ \\rightarrow \\left[\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_{10}\\right]^{+\\cdot} (?) + \\text{Cl}^{\\bullet} $$\nThis process is a radical loss. According to the Even-Electron Rule, this pathway is strongly suppressed for the even-electron precursor ion $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$.\n\n**Conclusion Summary:**\n- **EI ($M^{+\\cdot}$):** Two major pathways are allowed: loss of $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ (radical) to give $m/z\\;57$ and loss of $\\mathrm{HCl}$ (neutral) to give $m/z\\;56$.\n- **CI ($\\left[M+H\\right]^+$):** The dominant pathway must be a neutral loss, consistent with the Even-Electron Rule. The loss of neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ to give the even-electron cation $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+$ at $m/z\\;57$ is the predicted dominant fragmentation. Radical loss is suppressed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under EI, $M^{+\\cdot}$ undergoes dominant homolytic $\\mathrm{C{-}Cl}$ cleavage to lose $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ (radical) and form $\\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$ at $m/z\\,57$; neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ elimination to $\\mathrm{C_4H_8^{+\\cdot}}$ at $m/z\\,56$ is secondary. Under CI, $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ undergoes dominant neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ loss to yield $\\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$ at $m/z\\,57$; radical $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ loss from $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ is strongly suppressed by the Even-Electron Rule.**\n- EI analysis: This part is consistent with our derived possibilities. It presents a plausible hierarchy where both allowed pathways occur. $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ loss via homolysis is correctly identified as a radical loss leading to $m/z\\;57$. $\\mathrm{HCl}$ elimination is correctly identified as a neutral loss leading to $m/z\\;56$.\n- CI analysis: This part is perfectly consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the dominant neutral loss of $\\mathrm{HCl}$ leading to $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9^+$ ($m/z\\;57$), and correctly states that radical loss is suppressed by the Even-Electron Rule.\n- **Verdict: Correct.** This option correctly applies all the stated principles to both ionization methods.\n\n**B. Under EI, $M^{+\\cdot}$ predominantly eliminates neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ to give a base peak at $m/z\\,56$, whereas under CI, $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ primarily loses $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ (radical) to form $\\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$ at $m/z\\,57$.**\n- The EI analysis describes a valid pathway.\n- The CI analysis is incorrect. It claims that the even-electron ion $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ primarily undergoes a radical loss ($\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$). This is in direct violation of the Even-Electron Rule given in the problem statement.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both EI $M^{+\\cdot}$ and CI $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ predominantly lose $\\text{Cl}^{\\bullet}$ (radical), producing $\\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$ at $m/z\\,57$ in each case; neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ elimination is disfavored for $M^{+\\cdot}$.**\n- The CI analysis is incorrect. It claims the even-electron ion $\\left[M+H\\right]^+$ loses a radical, violating the Even-Electron Rule.\n- The statement that neutral $\\mathrm{HCl}$ elimination is \"disfavored\" for $M^{+\\cdot}$ is also questionable, as Principle 2 explicitly allows for neutral losses from odd-electron ions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under EI, charge localizes on chlorine to give a base peak at $\\mathrm{Cl^+}$ with $m/z\\,35$ and $m/z\\,37$; under CI, neutral-loss pathways are negligible compared to direct radical losses.**\n- The EI analysis proposes fragmentation to $\\mathrm{Cl^+}$, which is generally inconsistent with the known relative ionization energies (the charge prefers to stay on the alkyl fragment). It also neglects the major fragmentation pathways described in option A.\n- The CI analysis is flagrantly incorrect. It states the exact opposite of the Even-Electron Rule, claiming radical losses dominate over neutral losses for an even-electron ion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the principles provided in the problem statement, Option A is the only one that presents a correct and consistent set of predictions for both EI and CI fragmentation.",
