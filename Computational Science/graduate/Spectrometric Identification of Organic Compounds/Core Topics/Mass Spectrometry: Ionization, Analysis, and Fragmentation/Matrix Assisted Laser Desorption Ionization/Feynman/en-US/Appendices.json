            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained, solvable problem based on fundamental principles of physics.\n\nThe derivation of the arrival time $t$ for an ion in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer proceeds from first principles, namely the work-energy theorem and the kinematics of motion in a field-free region. The total time of flight is the sum of the time spent in the acceleration region and the time spent in the drift region.\n\nLet an ion have mass $m$ and charge $q = ze$, where $z$ is the integer charge state and $e$ is the elementary charge. The ion starts with an initial axial velocity component $v_0$. It is accelerated by a potential difference $V$.\n\nAccording to the work-energy theorem, the work done on the ion by the electric field, $W$, is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, $\\Delta K$.\nThe work done is $W = qV = zeV$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is $K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$.\nThe final kinetic energy, after the ion has been fully accelerated and enters the drift region with velocity $v_f$, is $K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$.\n\nThe work-energy theorem states $W = K_f - K_i$, therefore:\n$$zeV = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$$\nWe can solve this equation for the final velocity $v_f$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = zeV + \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$$\n$$v_f^2 = \\frac{2zeV}{m} + v_0^2$$\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m} + v_0^2}$$\nThis is the velocity of the ion as it enters the field-free drift region.\n\nThe total arrival time $t$ is the sum of the time spent in the acceleration region ($t_{\\text{accel}}$) and the time spent in the drift region ($t_{\\text{drift}}$). To obtain a simple, closed-form relation, we make two key assumptions.\n\nAssumption $1$: Instrument Idealization. We assume that the length of the acceleration region is negligible compared to the length of the drift region, $L$. Consequently, the time the ion spends accelerating is negligible compared to the time it spends drifting. This is a common and reasonable idealization for many TOF instruments. Under this assumption, the total arrival time $t$ is well-approximated by the drift time:\n$$t \\approx t_{\\text{drift}}$$\nIn the field-free drift region of length $L$, the ion travels at a constant velocity $v_f$. The time taken is:\n$$t_{\\text{drift}} = \\frac{L}{v_f}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_f$, we obtain the arrival time:\n$$t \\approx \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m} + v_0^2}}$$\n\nAssumption $2$: Negligible Initial Velocity. To isolate the leading-order dependence of $t$ on the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$), we assume that the initial kinetic energy of the ion, $\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$, which arises from the desorption process, is negligible compared to the energy gained from the accelerating potential, $zeV$. This is expressed as:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\ll zeV$$\nThis assumption is physically justified because the accelerating potential $V$ is typically on the order of kilovolts, whereas the initial energy spread of ions in MALDI is on the order of electronvolts. With this assumption, the term $v_0^2$ can be neglected in the expression for $v_f$, which is equivalent to assuming the ions start from rest ($v_0 \\approx 0$). The velocity upon entering the drift region is then:\n$$v_f \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m}}$$\nSubstituting this simplified velocity into the expression for the arrival time gives the leading-order dependence:\n$$t \\approx \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m}}}$$\n\nTo find the instrument-dependent constant $k$ such that the scaling form is $t = k\\sqrt{m/z}$, we rearrange the expression for $t$:\n$$t = L \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2zeV}} = L \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{2zeV}} = L \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{z} \\sqrt{2eV}}$$\n$$t = \\left( \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2eV}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{z}}$$\nBy comparing this to the form $t = k\\sqrt{m/z}$, we can directly identify the constant $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2eV}}$$\nThis expression for $k$ is given in terms of the instrument-dependent parameters $L$ and $V$, and the fundamental constant $e$. The units of the quantities in SI are: $L$ in meters (m), $e$ in coulombs (C), and $V$ in volts (V). The product $eV$ has units of energy, joules (J). The SI base units of a joule are $\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$. Therefore, the SI base units of $k$ are:\n$$\\frac{[\\text{m}]}{\\sqrt{[\\text{C}] \\cdot [\\text{V}]}} = \\frac{[\\text{m}]}{\\sqrt{[\\text{J}]}} = \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\sqrt{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}}} = \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{1/2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1/2}$$\nThis is consistent with the units derived from $t = k\\sqrt{m/z}$, where $t$ is in seconds ($\\text{s}$), $m$ is in kilograms ($\\text{kg}$), and $z$ is dimensionless. The final closed-form symbolic expression for $k$ is thus determined.",

Protonation of the analyte $\\mathrm{A}$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AH}^{+} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{1} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{prot}}(\\mathrm{A}) = -G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) $$\n2.

The target reaction has $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ as a reactant and $\\mathrm{M}$ as a product. This requires us to reverse reaction $(2)$:\n\nReverse of reaction $(2)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MH}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for this reversed reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2}$, is the negative of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{2}$:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2} = -(\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{2}) = -(-G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M})) = G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) $$\n\nNow, we add reaction $(1)$ and the reversed reaction $(2)$:\n$$ (\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) + (\\mathrm{MH}^{+}) \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{AH}^{+}) + (\\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) $$\nThe proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled, yielding the target reaction:\n$$ \\mathrm{MH}^{+} + \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{AH}^{+} $$\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, for this target reaction is the sum of the Gibbs free energies of the constituent steps:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{1} + \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of gas-phase basicities:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) + G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) $$\nThus, the derived expression is:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) - G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ using the given numerical values:\n$G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) = 844.56\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) = 878.03\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = 844.56\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} - 878.03\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -33.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe result $-33.47$ contains four significant figures, as requested.\n\nFinally, we explain the thermodynamic significance of this result. The standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to the equilibrium constant, $K$, by the equation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe calculated value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is $-33.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is negative. A negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ signifies that the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction under standard conditions. This implies that the equilibrium constant $K > 1$, meaning the products are favored at equilibrium.\n\nIn the context of MALDI, this indicates that the transfer of a proton from the protonated matrix, $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$, to the neutral analyte, $\\mathrm{A}$, is a thermodynamically favorable process. The analyte $\\mathrm{A}$ has a higher gas-phase basicity ($G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) > G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M})$), which means it has a stronger affinity for a proton in the gas phase compared to the matrix $\\mathrm{M}$. Consequently, in the MALDI plume, collisions between $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{A}$ will efficiently lead to the formation of protonated analyte, $\\mathrm{AH}^{+}$. The significant negative magnitude of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ suggests a strong thermodynamic drive for this proton transfer, leading to a high yield of $\\mathrm{AH}^{+}$ ions relative to any remaining $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ ions or other matrix-related adducts. This is a desired outcome in MALDI for the effective analysis of the analyte.",

Since all ions are singly charged ($z=1$) sodium adducts $\\mathrm{[M+Na]^+}$, the relationship is $M_i = (m/z)_i - m_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$. Given $m_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = 22.98977 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, we calculate the $M_i$ values:\n- $M_1 = 1066.506 - 22.98977 = 1043.51623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_2 = 1170.656 - 22.98977 = 1147.66623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_3 = 1274.806 - 22.98977 = 1251.81623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_4 = 1378.956 - 22.98977 = 1355.96623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_5 = 1483.106 - 22.98977 = 1460.11623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_6 = 1587.256 - 22.98977 = 1564.26623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we compute the necessary sums using the given intensities $I_i$ and the calculated molar masses $M_i$:\n- $\\sum_i I_i = 80 + 140 + 200 + 160 + 100 + 40 = 720$\n\n- $\\sum_i I_i M_i$:\n$ (80 \\times 1043.51623) + (140 \\times 1147.66623) + (200 \\times 1251.81623) + (160 \\times 1355.96623) + (100 \\times 1460.11623) + (40 \\times 1564.26623) $\n$ = 83481.2984 + 160673.2722 + 250363.246 + 216954.5968 + 146011.623 + 62570.6492 = 920054.6856 $\n\n- $\\sum_i I_i M_i^2$:\n$ (80 \\times (1043.51623)^2) + (140 \\times (1147.66623)^2) + (200 \\times (1251.81623)^2) + (160 \\times (1355.96623)^2) + (100 \\times (1460.11623)^2) + (40 \\times (1564.26623)^2) $\n$ \\approx 87114064.03 + 184399312.9 + 313408840.1 + 294183287.8 + 213193951.1 + 97884342.43 = 1190183798.36 $\n\nNow we can calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i}{\\sum_i I_i} = \\frac{920054.6856}{720} \\approx 1277.85373 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i I_i M_i} = \\frac{1190183798.36}{920054.6856} \\approx 1293.60017 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the polydispersity index, $\\mathrm{PDI}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} = \\frac{1293.60017}{1277.85373} \\approx 1.012322$$\n\nRounding each result to four significant figures as required:\n- $M_n = 1278 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_w = 1294 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.012$\n\nThe final answers are $M_n = 1278 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, $M_w = 1294 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.012$.",
