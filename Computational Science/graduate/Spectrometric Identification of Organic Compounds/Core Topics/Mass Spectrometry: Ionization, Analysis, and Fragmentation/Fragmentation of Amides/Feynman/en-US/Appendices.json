This exercise provides practice in this core task by examining how a simple structural modification—substituting one alkyl group for another—translates into a predictable shift in the spectrum . You will also connect this structural change to the principles of carbocation stability to rationalize why this modification might alter the fragment's relative intensity.",

            "problem": "An amide under Electron Ionization (EI) conditions frequently undergoes cleavage adjacent to the amide nitrogen to yield an alkyl iminium cation derived from the N-alkyl substituent, an observation widely reported for N-alkyl amides. For singly charged fragment ions, the observed mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ equals the monoisotopic mass of the ion divided by its charge $z$, and for $z=1$ the electron mass cancels in differences between isomeric or homologous ions. Consider two spectra collected under identical conditions for two isomeric substrates that differ only by replacing an $N$-methyl group $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ with an $N$-ethyl group $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$, with the base peak in each spectrum assigned to the iminium cation that retains the N-alkyl substituent. Assume that the cation composition changes only by the replacement of the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group with $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$ in the fragment that becomes the base peak. Using the monoisotopic atomic masses $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C})=12.000000$, $m(\\mathrm{^1H})=1.007825$, and $m(\\mathrm{^{14}N})=14.003074$ (in daltons), compute the expected shift $\\Delta(m/z)$ in the base peak between the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$-substituted and $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$-substituted amide spectra. Round your answer to five significant figures and express it in daltons. Briefly justify, based on intrinsic cation stability and fragmentation energetics, why the iminium ion intensity might increase upon replacing $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ with $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$ on the amide nitrogen. Your final numerical answer must be only the value of $\\Delta(m/z)$.",
            "solution": "The goal is to determine how the base peak $m/z$ shifts when the iminium cation that dominates the spectrum changes its N-alkyl substituent from $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ to $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$. Under Electron Ionization (EI) conditions, a well-tested observation for N-alkyl amides is that cleavage $\\alpha$ to the nitrogen yields an iminium-type cation that retains the N-alkyl moiety. Because the base peak is attributed to this cation in both spectra and the charge state is $z=1$, the shift in $m/z$ equals the difference in the monoisotopic masses of the two iminium ions.\n\nBy the problem’s setup, the only compositional change in the fragment that becomes the base peak is the replacement of the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group by the $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$ group on nitrogen. Therefore, the shift in $m/z$ is the monoisotopic mass difference between $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$:\n\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)=m(\\mathrm{C_2H_5})-m(\\mathrm{CH_3}).\n$$\n\nUsing the given monoisotopic atomic masses $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C})=12.000000$ and $m(\\mathrm{^1H})=1.007825$, we compute\n\n$$\nm(\\mathrm{C_2H_5})=2\\,m(\\mathrm{C})+5\\,m(\\mathrm{H})=2\\times 12.000000+5\\times 1.007825=24.000000+5.039125=29.039125,\n$$\n\n\n$$\nm(\\mathrm{CH_3})=1\\,m(\\mathrm{C})+3\\,m(\\mathrm{H})=1\\times 12.000000+3\\times 1.007825=12.000000+3.023475=15.023475.\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)=29.039125-15.023475=14.015650.\n$$\n\nRounded to five significant figures, this becomes\n\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)=14.016.\n$$\n\n\nQualitative justification for increased iminium ion intensity upon replacing $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ with $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$: The iminium cation features positive charge delocalization between carbon and nitrogen. Increased alkyl substitution enhances stabilization by both hyperconjugation (more $\\sigma \\rightarrow p$ donation into the cationic center) and inductive electron donation. Replacing $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ with $\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$ adds additional $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bonds capable of hyperconjugation and slightly increases polarizability. This stabilization lowers the appearance energy of the iminium cation and makes its formation more favorable relative to competing channels, often resulting in higher relative intensity (and thus a more prominent or even base-peak) for the ethyl-substituted iminium cation. Because the charge state is unchanged ($z=1$ in both cases), the electron mass cancels in the difference, and the observed shift is determined solely by the added $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ unit mass.",
