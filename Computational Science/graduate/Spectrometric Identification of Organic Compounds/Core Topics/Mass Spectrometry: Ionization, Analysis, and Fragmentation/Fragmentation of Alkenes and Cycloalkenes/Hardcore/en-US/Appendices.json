This hands-on exercise challenges you to apply this principle by predicting the major fragmentation pathways for a series of simple alkene isomers. By determining which pathway yields the most stable (most substituted) allylic cation, you will develop the foundational skill of correlating a molecule's structure with its most prominent peaks in an Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrum .",

            "problem": "A set of three structural isomers of $\\text{C}_{6}$ alkenes is considered: terminal (1-hexene), internally disubstituted (trans-2-hexene), and tetra-substituted (2,3-dimethyl-2-butene). In Electron Ionization (EI), singly charged radical cations fragment to produce resonance-stabilized allylic cations via cleavage adjacent to the carbon–carbon double bond. Start from the following fundamental bases: (i) the nominal mass of a fragment ion is the integer sum of the nominal atomic masses of its constituent atoms, taking $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ as $12$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ as $1$; (ii) the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ equals the ion mass when the charge $z$ is $1$; and (iii) for alkenes, allylic cleavage pathways that yield more substituted allylic carbocations are favored because hyperconjugation stabilizes the developing cation and lowers the fragmentation barrier, increasing the corresponding peak intensity in EI mass spectra.\n\nUsing only these bases, perform the following:\n- Compute the nominal $m/z$ values for the allylic cations $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$, $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$, and $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$.\n- For each of the three alkenes named above, identify which of these allylic cations is expected to dominate as the base peak under EI conditions, based on allylic cation stabilization by substitution.\n- Finally, compute the sum of the three nominal $m/z$ values corresponding to the predicted base peaks for $1$-hexene, trans-$2$-hexene, and $2,3$-dimethyl-$2$-butene.\n\nExpress your final result as a single number in daltons (Da) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass spectrometry, specifically the fragmentation of alkenes via allylic cleavage. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, objective, and provides a clear set of rules and definitions for its solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as per the problem's requirements.\n\nFirst, we compute the nominal mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) for the specified allylic cations. The problem states that the nominal mass is the integer sum of the nominal atomic masses of the constituent atoms, with $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ as $12$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ as $1$. For a singly charged ion with charge $z=1$, the $m/z$ ratio is numerically equal to its mass.\n\n1.  For the $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$ cation:\n    $$m/z = (3 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) = 36 + 5 = 41$$\n\n2.  For the $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$ cation:\n    $$m/z = (4 \\times 12) + (7 \\times 1) = 48 + 7 = 55$$\n\n3.  For the $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$ cation:\n    $$m/z = (5 \\times 12) + (9 \\times 1) = 60 + 9 = 69$$\n\nSecond, we identify the dominant allylic cation fragment for each of the three given $\\text{C}_{6}$ alkene isomers. The fragmentation mechanism is specified as allylic cleavage, which is cleavage of a bond adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond to produce a resonance-stabilized allylic cation. The favored pathway is the one yielding the most substituted, and therefore most stable, allylic cation.\n\n1.  **$1$-Hexene**: The structure is $\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$. The double bond is between carbons $1$ and $2$. The sole allylic C-C bond is the one between carbon $3$ and carbon $4$. Cleavage of this bond results in the loss of a propyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7$) and the formation of an allylic cation.\n    $$[\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CH-CH}_2]^{+} + \\cdot\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$$\n    The cation formed is the unsubstituted allyl cation, $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$. This is a primary allylic cation. Its calculated $m/z$ value is $41$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for $1$-hexene is at $m/z=41$.\n\n2.  **trans-$2$-Hexene**: The structure is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$. The double bond is between carbons $2$ and $3$. There are two allylic positions: carbon $1$ and carbon $4$. The C-C bond cleavage adjacent to the double bond occurs at the C$4$-C$5$ bond. Cleavage at this position results in the loss of an ethyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$) and the formation of a substituted allylic cation.\n    $$[\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH=CH-CH}_2]^{+} + \\cdot\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$$\n    The cation formed is $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$, which is a secondary allylic cation due to the methyl substituent on the allyl system ($[\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}^+\\text{-CH=CH}_2] \\leftrightarrow [\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH=CH-CH}_2^+]$). Its calculated $m/z$ value is $55$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for trans-$2$-hexene is at $m/z=55$.\n\n3.  **$2,3$-Dimethyl-$2$-butene**: The structure is $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)_2$. The double bond is between carbons $2$ and $3$. All four methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond, making all four C-C single bonds allylic. Cleavage of any of these equivalent bonds results in the loss of a methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$) and the formation of a cation.\n    $$[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)_2]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_9]^{+} + \\cdot\\text{CH}_3$$\n    The resulting cation is $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$. According to the problem's premises, this process yields a stable, substituted allylic cation. This fragment corresponds to a tertiary allylic cation (the most stable class), as it is the most substituted allylic system possible from the given options. Its calculated $m/z$ value is $69$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for $2,3$-dimethyl-$2$-butene is at $m/z=69$.\n\nThird, we compute the sum of the nominal $m/z$ values for the three predicted base peaks.\nThe predicted base peak $m/z$ values are:\n- For $1$-hexene: $41$\n- For trans-$2$-hexene: $55$\n- For $2,3$-dimethyl-$2$-butene: $69$\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\\text{Sum} = 41 + 55 + 69 = 165$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed as a single number and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated sum is an integer, $165$. To present this value with four significant figures, we express it as $165.0$.",

The described fragmentation processes (allylic cleavage, neutral loss of small molecules like ethylene, dehydrogenation, Retro-Diels-Alder) are textbook examples in organic mass spectrometry.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined: use the provided spectral data and chemical principles to select the best decision tree for distinguishing between two specific isomers. The data provided allows for a unique and logical solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem uses precise terminology and quantitative data ($m/z$ values, mass differences). The descriptions of peak intensities (weak, prominent, base peak) are standard conventions in spectroscopy.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides sufficient data in the descriptions of $\\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\\mathcal{S}_2$ to perform the requested identification. The molecular formulas are consistent with the molecular ion masses, and the described fragmentations are chemically plausible for the candidate structures. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. It is a valid problem in analytical chemistry. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nA scientifically defensible decision tree must be constructed from first principles, proceeding from the most reliable information (molecular ion) to more specific fragmentation patterns.\n\n**1. Molecular Ion Analysis**\n\nThe first and most fundamental piece of information in a mass spectrum is the molecular ion ($\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$), which gives the nominal mass of the molecule.\n-   **$1$-hexene**, with the chemical formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$, has a nominal mass of $(6 \\times 12) + (12 \\times 1) = 72 + 12 = 84$. Its molecular ion peak will appear at $m/z\\ 84$. This corresponds to a molecule with one degree of unsaturation.\n-   **Cyclohexene**, with the chemical formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}$, has a nominal mass of $(6 \\times 12) + (10 \\times 1) = 72 + 10 = 82$. Its molecular ion peak will appear at $m/z\\ 82$. This corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation (a ring and a double bond).\n\nTherefore, the initial branching of any logical decision tree must use the molecular ion mass.\n-   A spectrum with $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z\\ 84$ corresponds to $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$ ($1$-hexene).\n-   A spectrum with $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z\\ 82$ corresponds to $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}$ (cyclohexene).\n\nApplying this to the given spectra:\n-   $\\mathcal{S}_1$ shows a molecular ion near $m/z\\ 84$, so it is consistent with $1$-hexene.\n-   $\\mathcal{S}_2$ shows a molecular ion near $m/z\\ 82$, so it is consistent with cyclohexene.\n\n**2. Fragmentation Pattern Analysis for Confirmation**\n\nNext, we analyze the characteristic fragmentation patterns for each structure to confirm the initial assignment.\n\n**Analysis of $1$-Hexene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$, $m/z\\ 84$) fragmentation:**\n-   **Neutral Loss of Ethylene**: Acyclic alkenes often undergo rearrangements leading to the loss of small neutral alkenes. For $1$-hexene, a common pathway is the loss of ethylene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$, mass $28$). This would produce a fragment ion at $m/z\\ 84 - 28 = 56$. The data for $\\mathcal{S}_1$ shows a significant fragment at $m/z\\ 56$ from a loss of $28$, which strongly supports the $1$-hexene structure.\n-   **Dehydrogenation**: Acyclic structures do not have a straightforward, low-energy pathway to form a stable aromatic ring like benzene. Therefore, significant loss of $\\text{H}_2$ molecules (e.g., loss of mass $4$ to give $m/z\\ 80$ or $m/z\\ 78$) is not expected. The data for $\\mathcal{S}_1$ (negligible intensity at $m/z\\ 78$) is consistent with this.\n-   **Allylic Cleavage**: Allylic cleavage can occur, e.g., loss of a propyl radical ($\\bullet \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7$, mass $43$) to give a fragment at $m/z\\ 41$, or loss of an ethyl radical ($\\bullet \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$, mass $29$) to give a fragment at $m/z\\ 55$. The presence of a prominent $m/z\\ 55$ peak is plausible.\n-   **Fragment $m/z\\ 67$**: This would correspond to a loss of a methyl radical ($\\bullet \\text{CH}_3$, mass $15$), $m/z\\ 84 - 15 = 69$, not $m/z\\ 67$. Formation of $m/z\\ 67$ from $1$-hexene is not a major, simple fragmentation pathway and would require significant rearrangement. Its minor intensity in $\\mathcal{S}_1$ is consistent with the $1$-hexene assignment.\n\n**Analysis of Cyclohexene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}$, $m/z\\ 82$) fragmentation:**\n-   **Dehydrogenation**: The six-membered ring structure of cyclohexene provides a template for aromatization. The radical cation can lose two molecules of hydrogen ($\\mathrm{2H_2}$, total mass loss of $4$) to form the highly stable benzene radical cation ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6^{+\\bullet}$) at $m/z\\ 78$. The observation of a prominent peak at $m/z\\ 78$ in $\\mathcal{S}_2$ is a powerful indicator for the cyclohexene structure.\n-   **Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) Reaction**: This is a characteristic fragmentation of cyclohexene systems. The ring breaks apart to lose a neutral molecule of ethylene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$, mass $28$) and form the 1,3-butadiene radical cation ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_6^{+\\bullet}$) at $m/z\\ 82 - 28 = 54$. The presence of a fragment near $m/z\\ 54$ in $\\mathcal{S}_2$ is consistent with an RDA reaction and supports the cyclohexene assignment.\n-   **Allylic Cleavage and Rearrangement**: Cleavage of an allylic bond followed by rearrangement and loss of a methyl radical ($\\bullet \\text{CH}_3$, mass $15$) is a well-known major fragmentation pathway for cyclohexene, yielding a stable cyclopentenyl cation, $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_7^+$, at $m/z\\ 82 - 15 = 67$. The observation that $m/z\\ 67$ is the **base peak** in $\\mathcal{S}_2$ is a classic diagnostic feature of cyclohexene.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the $m/z\\ 55$ Peak**\nThe ion at $m/z\\ 55$ corresponds to the formula $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_7^+$. As noted above, a plausible pathway for its formation exists for $1$-hexene (loss of $\\bullet\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$). For cyclohexene, it can be formed via complex rearrangement pathways, for example, from the $m/z\\ 67$ ion by loss of $\\text{C}$ and $\\text{H}$ atoms, or from the M$^{+\\bullet}$ ion by loss of a vinyl radical ($\\bullet\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_3$, mass $27$), $m/z\\ 82 - 27 = 55$. Since this fragment can be formed from both parent structures (and many other alkene isomers), its mere presence is not a strong discriminator. The unique, structure-specific pathways (RDA, dehydrogenation) are far more informative. It is scientifically sound to treat $m/z\\ 55$ as non-discriminatory in this context.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\n-   Spectrum $\\mathcal{S}_1$ ($m/z\\ 84$, loss of $28 \\to m/z\\ 56$, negligible $m/z\\ 78$) is definitively assigned to $1$-hexene.\n-   Spectrum $\\mathcal{S}_2$ ($m/z\\ 82$, loss of $4 \\to m/z\\ 78$, base peak $m/z\\ 67$, loss of $28 \\to m/z\\ 54$) is definitively assigned to cyclohexene.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. First branch: If a molecular ion is observed near $m/z\\ 84$, assign a $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$ formula and tentatively $1$-hexene; if near $m/z\\ 82$, assign a $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{10}$ formula and tentatively cyclohexene. Second branch: If neutral loss of $28$ from the molecular ion region gives a strong fragment at $m/z\\ 56$ (from $m/z\\ 84$), this supports an acyclic cleavage consistent with $1$-hexene; if neutral loss of $4$ from $m/z\\ 82$ yields $m/z\\ 78$ prominently, this supports dehydrogenation toward an aromatic cation consistent with cyclohexene. Third branch: If $m/z\\ 67$ is the base peak and $m/z\\ 78$ is prominent, this reinforces cyclohexene; if $m/z\\ 67$ is minor and $m/z\\ 78$ negligible while $m/z\\ 56$ is strong, this reinforces $1$-hexene. Treat $m/z\\ 55$ as non-discriminatory because allylic cleavage to $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_7^+$ occurs in both classes. Classify $\\mathcal{S}_1$ as $1$-hexene and $\\mathcal{S}_2$ as cyclohexene.**\n\nThis option follows a perfectly logical and scientifically sound procedure.\n1.  It correctly uses the molecular ion as the primary branching point.\n2.  It correctly identifies the key diagnostic neutral losses for each structure: loss of $28$ (giving $m/z\\ 56$) for $1$-hexene, and loss of $4$ for cyclohexene.\n3.  It correctly uses the relative intensities of other diagnostic peaks ($m/z\\ 67$, $m/z\\ 78$, $m/z\\ 56$) to confirm the assignments, matching the details of $\\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\\mathcal{S}_2$.\n4.  It correctly assesses the $m/z\\ 55$ peak as non-discriminatory.\n5.  It reaches the correct final classifications.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. First branch: Use the intensity of $m/z\\ 55$ as the discriminator: if $m/z\\ 55$ is the base peak, assign cyclohexene; if $m/z\\ 55$ is only prominent, assign $1$-hexene. Second branch: A neutral loss of $14$ from the molecular ion region is indicative of acyclic alkenes, whereas cycloalkenes do not show such losses. Classify $\\mathcal{S}_1$ as cyclohexene and $\\mathcal{S}_2$ as $1$-hexene.**\n\nThis option is flawed.\n1.  The first branch violates the principle of starting with the most reliable information (the molecular ion). It also makes a factually incorrect claim: the problem states $m/z\\ 67$ is the base peak for $\\mathcal{S}_2$, not $m/z\\ 55$.\n2.  The second branch invokes a \"neutral loss of $14$\". Loss of a methylene radical ($\\bullet\\text{CH}_2$) is known as a \"forbidden fragmentation\" in mass spectrometry as it is energetically highly unfavorable. This is a scientifically unsound claim.\n3.  The final classification is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. First branch: If a molecular ion near $m/z\\ 84$ is observed, assign cyclohexene; if near $m/z\\ 82$, assign $1$-hexene. Second branch: Presence of $m/z\\ 78$ indicates dehydrogenation of $1$-hexene to benzene, whereas cyclohexene cannot yield $m/z\\ 78$. Classify $\\mathcal{S}_1$ as cyclohexene and $\\mathcal{S}_2$ as $1$-hexene.**\n\nThis option is flawed.\n1.  The first branch incorrectly assigns the molecular masses to the compounds. $m/z\\ 84$ is $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$ ($1$-hexene), not cyclohexene.\n2.  The second branch completely inverts the dehydrogenation mechanism. The cyclic structure (cyclohexene) is the one that readily yields the benzene cation ($m/z\\ 78$), not the acyclic one.\n3.  The final classification is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. First branch: If neutral loss of $28$ from the molecular ion region is present, assign cyclohexene; if differences of $2$ between molecular ion and a lower-mass ion are present, assign $1$-hexene. Second branch: Treat $m/z\\ 67$ as non-diagnostic because allylic cations occur in both acyclic and cyclic alkenes. Classify $\\mathcal{S}_1$ as cyclohexene and $\\mathcal{S}_2$ as $1$-hexene.**\n\nThis option is flawed.\n1.  The first branch is ambiguous and incorrect. Both compounds can lose a neutral of mass $28$. More importantly, it claims a loss of $2$ ($\\text{H}_2$) is characteristic of $1$-hexene, which is wrong; this is a step in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene. It misassigns the fragmentation patterns.\n2.  The second branch incorrectly dismisses $m/z\\ 67$ as non-diagnostic. While the formation of allylic cations is general, the formation of $m/z\\ 67$ as a **base peak** is a highly specific and powerful diagnostic feature for cyclohexene.\n3.  The final classification is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "An electron ionization (EI) mass spectrum of a mixed sample containing alkenes and cycloalkenes often exhibits intense allylic cation fragment peaks formed by cleavage adjacent to the double bond and rearrangements stabilized by resonance. Consider three such hydrocarbon fragment ions: the allylic series $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$, $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$, and $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$, commonly observed near $m/z \\approx 41$, $55$, and $69$ in EI spectra of alkenes and cycloalkenes. In complex matrices, isobaric interferences can arise from heteroatom-containing ions that share the same nominal mass but differ in exact mass; in particular, $\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{N}^{+}$ interferes at $m/z \\approx 41$, $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}$ at $m/z \\approx 55$, and $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{+}$ at $m/z \\approx 69$.\n\nUsing the following exact monoisotopic atomic masses: $^{12}\\mathrm{C} = 12.0000$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H} = 1.007825$, $^{14}\\mathrm{N} = 14.003074$, and $^{16}\\mathrm{O} = 15.994915$ (all in unified atomic mass units, u), compute the monoisotopic exact masses of $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$, $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$, and $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$. Then, for each hydrocarbon ion, compute the exact mass difference to its indicated isobaric interference and determine the resolving power required to achieve baseline separation of each pair in the usual mass spectrometric sense.\n\nFinally, report a single resolving power value that guarantees baseline separation for all three hydrocarbon ions from their respective isobaric interferences. Express the final resolving power as a dimensionless number, and round your answer to four significant figures. State all intermediate masses in unified atomic mass units (u) and base your reasoning on first principles of monoisotopic mass calculation and the standard definition of resolving power.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is based on fundamental principles of mass spectrometry and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem involves two main principles of mass spectrometry: the calculation of monoisotopic exact mass and the definition of resolving power.\n\nFirst, the monoisotopic exact mass of an ion is calculated by summing the exact masses of the most abundant isotopes of its constituent elements. For the elements given, these are $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, and $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$. The mass of the electron lost during ionization ($m_e \\approx 5.486 \\times 10^{-4}$ u) is negligible in this context and is, by convention, ignored. The exact mass $M$ of an ion with formula $\\text{C}_x\\text{H}_y\\text{N}_z\\text{O}_w$ is given by:\n$$M = x \\cdot M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + y \\cdot M(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + z \\cdot M(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + w \\cdot M(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\nwhere $M(^{A}\\mathrm{X})$ is the exact mass of the specified isotope.\n\nSecond, the resolving power, $R$, of a mass spectrometer is a measure of its ability to distinguish between two peaks of slightly different mass-to-charge ratios. For two peaks at masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ to be baseline-resolved, the required resolving power is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the species (conventionally, the average mass $m = \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{2}$ is used for this calculation) and $\\Delta m = |m_1 - m_2|$ is the mass difference between the two species.\n\nTo guarantee separation for all three pairs of ions, we must calculate the required resolving power for each pair and then select the maximum of these values. The instrument's resolving power must be at least this high.\n\nThe provided atomic masses are:\n$M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 12.0000$ u\n$M(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 1.007825$ u\n$M(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 14.003074$ u\n$M(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 15.994915$ u\n\nWe will now analyze each isobaric pair.\n\n**Pair 1: $m/z \\approx 41$ (Hydrocarbon $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$ vs. Interference $\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{N}^{+}$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the exact mass of the hydrocarbon ion, $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}) = 3 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 5 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}) = 3 \\times 12.0000 + 5 \\times 1.007825 = 36.0000 + 5.039125 = 41.039125$ u.\n\nNext, we calculate the exact mass of the interfering ion, $\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{N}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{N}^{+}) = 2 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 3 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\times M(^{14}\\mathrm{N})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{N}^{+}) = 2 \\times 12.0000 + 3 \\times 1.007825 + 1 \\times 14.003074 = 24.0000 + 3.023475 + 14.003074 = 41.026549$ u.\n\nThe mass difference $\\Delta m_1$ is:\n$\\Delta m_1 = |41.039125 - 41.026549| = 0.012576$ u.\n\nThe average mass $m_1$ is:\n$m_1 = \\frac{41.039125 + 41.026549}{2} = 41.032837$ u.\n\nThe required resolving power $R_1$ for this pair is:\n$R_1 = \\frac{m_1}{\\Delta m_1} = \\frac{41.032837}{0.012576} \\approx 3263.15$\n\n**Pair 2: $m/z \\approx 55$ (Hydrocarbon $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$ vs. Interference $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}$)**\n\nExact mass of $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}) = 4 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 7 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{7}^{+}) = 4 \\times 12.0000 + 7 \\times 1.007825 = 48.0000 + 7.054775 = 55.054775$ u.\n\nExact mass of $\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}) = 3 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 3 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\times M(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}) = 3 \\times 12.0000 + 3 \\times 1.007825 + 1 \\times 15.994915 = 36.0000 + 3.023475 + 15.994915 = 55.018390$ u.\n\nThe mass difference $\\Delta m_2$ is:\n$\\Delta m_2 = |55.054775 - 55.018390| = 0.036385$ u.\n\nThe average mass $m_2$ is:\n$m_2 = \\frac{55.054775 + 55.018390}{2} = 55.0365825$ u.\n\nThe required resolving power $R_2$ for this pair is:\n$R_2 = \\frac{m_2}{\\Delta m_2} = \\frac{55.0365825}{0.036385} \\approx 1512.62$\n\n**Pair 3: $m/z \\approx 69$ (Hydrocarbon $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$ vs. Interference $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{+}$)**\n\nExact mass of $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}) = 5 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 9 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{9}^{+}) = 5 \\times 12.0000 + 9 \\times 1.007825 = 60.0000 + 9.070425 = 69.070425$ u.\n\nExact mass of $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{+}$:\n$M(\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{+}) = 4 \\times M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 5 \\times M(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\times M(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$\n$M(\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{+}) = 4 \\times 12.0000 + 5 \\times 1.007825 + 1 \\times 15.994915 = 48.0000 + 5.039125 + 15.994915 = 69.034040$ u.\n\nThe mass difference $\\Delta m_3$ is:\n$\\Delta m_3 = |69.070425 - 69.034040| = 0.036385$ u.\n\nThe average mass $m_3$ is:\n$m_3 = \\frac{69.070425 + 69.034040}{2} = 69.0522325$ u.\n\nThe required resolving power $R_3$ for this pair is:\n$R_3 = \\frac{m_3}{\\Delta m_3} = \\frac{69.0522325}{0.036385} \\approx 1897.82$\n\n**Final Determination of Required Resolving Power**\n\nTo ensure baseline separation for all three potential interferences, the mass spectrometer must operate at a resolving power sufficient to resolve the most challenging pair, which is the one requiring the highest resolving power.
