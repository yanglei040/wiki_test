            "introduction": "One of the most powerful and definitive methods for identifying labile protons, such as those in hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{O-H}$) or amine ($\\mathrm{N-H}$) groups, is through isotope exchange with deuterium oxide ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$). This practice demonstrates how to interpret the corroborating evidence from both ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR and IR spectroscopy, grounding the analysis in the fundamental principles of isotopic mass effects on vibrational frequency and nuclear spin properties . By observing the disappearance of a proton signal in the NMR and a predictable frequency shift in the IR, you can unambiguously confirm the presence of an exchangeable proton.",

            "problem": "An unknown organic liquid sample is suspected to contain an alcohol functional group.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard chemical analysis technique ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$ exchange for identifying labile protons) and provides realistic spectroscopic data. The question requires applying fundamental principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy to interpret the results.\n\nThe central task is to determine which set of spectroscopic changes most convincingly confirms the presence of an exchangeable proton on an oxygen atom, i.e., an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group, based on the provided experimental observations and first principles. The experiment involves comparing spectra before and after shaking the sample with deuterium oxide ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$).\n\nThe chemical process underlying the experiment is an acid-base equilibrium involving the analyte, assumed to be an alcohol $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H}$, and $\\mathrm{D_2O}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H} + \\mathrm{D_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!D} + \\mathrm{HOD} $$\nGiven that a small aliquot of $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ is used, which acts as the solvent for the exchange, deuterium is in vast excess. Le Châtelier's principle dictates that the equilibrium will be driven strongly to the right, converting nearly all of the $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H}$ species into $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!D}$. We must now analyze the expected spectroscopic consequences of this isotopic substitution.\n\n**Analysis of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe problem states as a first principle that $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR detects transitions of spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ hydrogen nuclei (${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) and does not record deuterium (${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ or $\\mathrm{D}$), a spin-$1$ nucleus, at the operating frequency of a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrometer. The gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium is significantly different from that of a proton.\n\nBefore the exchange, the spectrum shows a broad singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ integrating to approximately $1$ proton. This is characteristic of an alcohol proton, which is often broadened due to hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water. After shaking with $\\mathrm{D_2O}$, the proton of the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group is replaced with a deuteron, forming an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ group. Since the deuteron is not detected in the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum, the signal corresponding to the hydroxyl proton should vanish. The observed disappearance of the broad singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is therefore direct evidence that this proton is \"exchangeable\" and has been replaced by deuterium. This matches the experimental data provided.\n\n**Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\nThe problem provides the harmonic oscillator model for the vibrational frequency of a diatomic-like stretch:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the bond force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass. For a bond between two atoms of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$, $\\mu = \\dfrac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$.\n\nAccording to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic structure and thus the bond force constant $k$ are nearly identical for an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond and an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ bond. The significant change is in the reduced mass.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the vibrational frequencies, $\\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}$.\n$$ \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} $$\nWe use the atomic masses for hydrogen ($m_H \\approx 1.008\\,\\mathrm{amu}$), deuterium ($m_D \\approx 2.014\\,\\mathrm{amu}$), and oxygen ($m_O \\approx 15.999\\,\\mathrm{amu}$).\n\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}} = \\dfrac{m_O m_H}{m_O + m_H} \\approx \\dfrac{16 \\times 1}{16 + 1} = \\dfrac{16}{17} \\approx 0.941\\,\\mathrm{amu} $$\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ bond is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}} = \\dfrac{m_O m_D}{m_O + m_D} \\approx \\dfrac{16 \\times 2}{16 + 2} = \\dfrac{32}{18} = \\dfrac{16}{9} \\approx 1.778\\,\\mathrm{amu} $$\nThe ratio of the frequencies is therefore:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{16/17}{32/18}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{16}{17} \\times \\dfrac{18}{32}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{9}{17}} \\approx 0.728 $$\nA common and simpler approximation assumes the oxygen atom is infinitely heavy compared to H or D, giving $\\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{m_H}{m_D}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.707$. Both approximations predict a substantial decrease in frequency.\n\nGiven the initial $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch is near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the new $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch is predicted to appear at:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}} \\times \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} \\times 0.728 \\approx 2512\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nThe experimental observation of the disappearance of the band at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and the appearance of a new band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in excellent agreement with this theoretical prediction. This strongly confirms that the vibration being observed is indeed an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch, which has been converted to an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch.\n\nThe combination of the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal disappearance and the predictable frequency shift in the IR spectrum provides unambiguous and corroborating evidence for the presence of an exchangeable $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal assigned to $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ disappears, and the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is replaced by an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, consistent with the predicted isotopic frequency ratio from the harmonic oscillator model.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with our derivation from first principles and with the provided experimental data. The disappearance of the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal confirms the exchangeable nature of the proton. The replacement of the IR band at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ with one at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ confirms the identity of the bond as $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ based on the mass-dependent frequency shift.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ resonance shifts downfield and becomes sharp due to reduced exchange, while the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ band remains at the same frequency and narrows.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton disappears; it does not shift or sharpen. Adding $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ would increase, not decrease, the rate of exchange. Second, the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretching band is replaced by an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ band at a significantly lower frequency; it does not remain the same.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, a new $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR resonance for $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ appears near $\\delta \\approx 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ due to the deuteron’s different gyromagnetic ratio, while the IR spectrum is unchanged.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. A $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment is specifically tuned to the resonance frequency of protons. It cannot and does not detect deuterons. A separate $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment would be required. Furthermore, the IR spectrum is not unchanged; the isotopic substitution causes a large, predictable frequency shift.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the IR carbonyl band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1710\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ shifts by the same factor as the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch would, confirming isotopic substitution at oxygen, even if $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR shows no change.**\nThis option contradicts the problem statement, which explicitly states that a \"carbonyl-like band is absent\". It also posits that the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR shows no change, which is contrary to the provided data. Finally, the isotopic substitution at the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ site has a negligible vibrational coupling to a remote carbonyl group ($\\mathrm{C\\!=\\!O}$), so its frequency would not shift significantly, let alone by the same large factor as the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the vicinal methine multiplet next to oxygen collapses in the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR due to loss of scalar coupling to $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$, even though the IR spectrum shows no new band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; this collapse alone confirms an exchangeable proton.**\nThis option contradicts the provided data on two counts. First, it assumes the IR spectrum shows no new band, whereas the problem states a new band appears near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Second, it describes a collapse of a multiplet. However, the initial data states that the methine at $\\delta \\approx 3.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ \"shows no resolved scalar coupling to the broad singlet\". If there is no resolved coupling to begin with (a common situation due to rapid proton exchange), there is no multiplet to collapse.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe identity of the functional group in compound $\\mathrm{X}$ is determined by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n\n1.  **The Band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3308~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$**: This absorption falls in the region of $\\mathrm{X-H}$ stretching vibrations, where $\\mathrm{X}$ is typically $\\mathrm{O}$, $\\mathrm{N}$, or $\\mathrm{C}$ (in an alkyne).\n    -   The relationship for vibrational frequency in the harmonic oscillator approximation is $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$, where $k$ is the bond force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n    -   **O–H bonds**: Stretches for alcohols and phenols typically appear as very broad bands (FWHM $\\gg 100~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) in the $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3200-3600~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range due to strong intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Free, non-H-bonded O-H groups give a very sharp signal at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3600-3650~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Carboxylic acid O-H stretches are exceptionally broad, spanning $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2500-3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   **N–H bonds**: Stretches for amines and amides appear in the $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300-3500~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. A key feature is that they are significantly sharper than H-bonded O-H stretches because hydrogen bonding involving N-H is generally weaker (due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen). A secondary amine ($\\mathrm{R_2NH}$) or a secondary amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R'}$) will show a single N-H stretch. A primary amine or amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}NH_2}$ or $\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH_2}$) will show two bands (symmetric and asymmetric stretches).\n    -   **Terminal Alkyne C–H bonds**: These show a strong, sharp stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. However, the NMR data will help distinguish this from N-H/O-H.\n    -   The observed band is described as \"single, moderately sharp\" with a FWHM $\\approx 35~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This characteristic lineshape strongly argues against a typical H-bonded alcohol or phenol, and is highly characteristic of an N–H stretch. The presence of a single band indicates a secondary amine or amide.\n\n2.  **The Band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$**: This strong absorption is in the double bond region ($\\tilde{\\nu} = 1600-1850~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    -   This region is characteristic of carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) and alkene ($\\mathrm{C=C}$) stretches.\n    -   Saturated ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids absorb at higher frequencies ($\\tilde{\\nu}  1700~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The problem explicitly states there are no bands near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1710-1750~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, ruling out these functional groups as well as saturated esters.\n    -   Amide carbonyls ($\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch, known as the Amide I band) absorb strongly in the $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1630-1680~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. The frequency is lowered relative to ketones due to resonance delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair, which imparts single-bond character to the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond and reduces its force constant $k$.\n    -   The observed strong band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is a perfect match for an amide carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of IR Data**: The combination of a moderately sharp N-H-like stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3308~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a strong Amide I band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ provides compelling evidence for a secondary amide functional group.\n\n**Analysis of ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum**\n\n1.  **The Signal at $\\delta = 7.60$**: This signal for one proton is in the downfield region. Its disappearance upon addition of D${}_{2}$O confirms it is an exchangeable or \"labile\" proton, such as one from an O-H, N-H, or S-H group. The chemical shift of $\\delta = 7.60$ is typical for an amide N-H proton ($\\delta \\approx 5-9$).\n\n2.  **The Signal at $\\delta = 4.10$**: This resonance is a methine proton ($\\mathrm{-CH-}$) coupled to another proton. The chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is adjacent to an electronegative atom (like N or O).\n\n3.  **The D${}_{2}$O Exchange Experiment**: The key observation is the simultaneous disappearance of the $\\delta = 7.60$ signal and the collapse of the $\\delta = 4.10$ doublet to a singlet. This definitively proves that the proton at $\\delta = 7.60$ (the labile proton) was scalar-coupled to the methine proton at $\\delta = 4.10$. The coupling constant is ${}^{3}J_{\\mathrm{H-N-C-H}} = 5.5~\\mathrm{Hz}$ (assuming an amide). Upon exchange, the N-H proton is replaced by a deuterium atom (${}^2\\mathrm{H}$). Since the standard ${}^1\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment does not detect ${}^2\\mathrm{H}$, the coupling interaction is removed, and the methine proton's signal simplifies to a singlet. This confirms the presence of an $\\mathrm{R-XH-CH-R'}$ fragment, where $\\mathrm{XH}$ is the labile proton group.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\nThe IR data strongly suggest a secondary amide. The NMR data independently confirm the presence of a labile N-H proton that is three bonds away from a methine proton. The combination of all data points unambiguously to the presence of a secondary amide functional group with the substructure $\\mathrm{-C(=O)-NH-CH-}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A secondary amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R}$): one N–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3200$–$3400~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and an amide $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ band near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1630$–$1680~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the N–H proton couples to a neighboring methine and disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange.**\n-   IR: The single, moderately sharp N-H stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu}=3308~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and the strong amide I band at $\\tilde{\\nu}=1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ are perfectly consistent with this description.\n-   NMR: The labile proton signal at $\\delta=7.60$ is characteristic of an amide N-H. The observed coupling to an adjacent methine group ($\\delta=4.10$) and the decoupling upon D${}_2$O exchange provides definitive confirmation of the $\\mathrm{-C(=O)-NH-CH-}$ substructure.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**. All provided data are fully and precisely explained by this assignment.\n\n**B. A phenol ($\\mathrm{Ar{-}OH}$) hydrogen-bonded to a conjugated carbonyl (enone), giving an O–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a conjugated $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H proton disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and may couple to a neighboring methine.**\n-   The IR band shape is the primary inconsistency. A hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch is characteristically broad, not \"moderately sharp\" with a FWHM of $\\approx 35~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. While the NMR data could superficially fit, the IR evidence strongly disfavors an O-H group. The problem's hint to \"avoid mislabeling\" this as an O-H stretch reinforces this conclusion.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A carboxylic acid ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}OH}$) forming dimers, with a very broad O–H band spanning $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2500$–$3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1700$–$1720~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and could induce downfield shifts.**\n-   This is inconsistent with the IR spectrum on two counts: the O-H stretch is described as \"moderately sharp\", not extremely broad, and the carbonyl frequency for a dimer is in a region ($\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1700-1725~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) that was explicitly stated to be empty. The NMR shift for a carboxylic proton is also typically much further downfield ($\\delta = 10-13$).\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A secondary amine ($\\mathrm{R{-}NH{-}R}$) lacking a carbonyl, showing one N–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300$–$3500~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the N–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and can couple to adjacent methine.**\n-   While the N-H stretch and NMR data are consistent with a secondary amine, this option fails to explain the strong IR absorption at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. A simple amine lacks a carbonyl group or any other group that would typically give rise to such a strong band in this region. Option A explains all features; this one does not.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. An alcohol ($\\mathrm{R{-}OH}$) intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded to a ketone, with an O–H stretch shifted to $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a ketone $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1715~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and may couple to a neighboring methine under dry conditions.**\n-   This option is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement, which says \"No bands are observed near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1710$–$1750~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\". The ketone C=O band is expected in this region. Furthermore, as with option B, an H-bonded O-H group would produce a much broader IR band than observed.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$’s $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ in CDCl$_3$ is less hydrogen-bonded than in DMSO-d$_6$, showing a downfield, broadened shift and lower IR frequency in DMSO-d$_6$; the persistent carbonyl near $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 1650\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ supports an amide.

In CDCl$_3$, Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$’s $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ is strongly hydrogen-bonded by the solvent (hence high-frequency, sharp IR), and DMSO-d$_6$ disrupts hydrogen bonding (causing the IR band to broaden and shift lower, and the $^{1}$H resonance to move downfield and broaden).

The stated principles regarding the effects of hydrogen bonding on IR and NMR spectra are correct and fundamental to organic spectroscopy. The properties attributed to the solvents CDCl$_3$ and DMSO-d$_6$ are accurate. The provided spectroscopic data are plausible and internally consistent with a well-designed comparative experiment. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data to draw a logical conclusion about the functional groups and their interactions. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to interpret the provided spectroscopic data for two unknown compounds, $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, in two different solvents, CDCl$_3$ and DMSO-d$_6$, to determine their functional groups and analyze the effects of hydrogen bonding.\n\n**Analysis of Unknown A:**\n\n1.  **IR Spectroscopy:**\n    -   In CDCl$_3$, a weak hydrogen-bond-accepting solvent, the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch appears as a sharp band at a high wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 3648\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is characteristic of a *free* (non-hydrogen-bonded) hydroxyl group, typically found in dilute solutions of alcohols in non-polar solvents.\n    -   In DMSO-d$_6$, a strong hydrogen-bond-accepting solvent, this band shifts to a much lower wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 3400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and becomes markedly broadened. This shift to lower frequency (a decrease of $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 248\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) and significant broadening are classic indicators of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the solute's $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group and the solvent's sulfoxide oxygen.\n    -   The absence of a carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) band rules out functional groups like carboxylic acids and esters containing a hydroxyl group.\n\n2.  **$^{1}$H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    -   In CDCl$_3$, the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton resonates as a narrow singlet at a relatively upfield position, $\\delta\\approx 1.55\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This chemical shift is typical for an alcohol proton that is not significantly involved in hydrogen bonding.\n    -   In DMSO-d$_6$, the same proton signal shifts significantly downfield to $\\delta\\approx 5.30\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (a shift of $\\Delta\\delta = 3.75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$) and broadens. The downfield shift is a direct consequence of deshielding caused by the formation of a strong hydrogen bond to the DMSO-d$_6$ solvent. The broadening is consistent with slower chemical exchange in the hydrogen-bonded state.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for Unknown A:** The combined data consistently indicate that Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$ is an alcohol. The sharp, high-frequency IR band and upfield NMR signal in CDCl$_3$ confirm the presence of a largely free $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group. The broad, low-frequency IR band and downfield NMR signal in DMSO-d$_6$ confirm strong hydrogen bonding to the solvent. It cannot be a carboxylic acid, which would show a very broad $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ IR band from $\\approx 2500-3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a $\\mathrm{C=O}$ band, as well as a much more downfield proton ($\\delta  10\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$).\n\n**Analysis of Unknown B:**\n\n1.  **IR Spectroscopy:**\n    -   The key observation is the simultaneous presence of an $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ stretch and a strong carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 1650\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ in CDCl$_3$. This combination is the defining characteristic of an anilide, lactam, or generally an **amide** functional group. An amine would lack the carbonyl group.\n    -   In CDCl$_3$, the $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ stretch is at $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 3330\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This frequency is already indicative of some degree of hydrogen bonding (e.g., intermolecular self-association), as free secondary amide N-H stretches are typically higher ($\\approx 3400-3460\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    -   In DMSO-d$_6$, the $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ stretch shifts to a lower wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 3270\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and broadens. This indicates the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds between the amide $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ and the DMSO-d$_6$ solvent, as expected. The carbonyl band shows a negligible shift to $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 1652\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is not unusual.\n\n2.  **$^{1}$H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    -   In CDCl$_3$, the $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ proton resonates as a broad signal at a downfield position, $\\delta\\approx 6.35\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is a typical range for amide protons, which are deshielded by the adjacent electronegative nitrogen and carbonyl group, and are often broad due to intermediate exchange rates or quadrupolar coupling from the $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ nucleus.\n    -   In DMSO-d$_6$, the signal shifts further downfield to $\\delta\\approx 8.35\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (a shift of $\\Delta\\delta = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$) and remains broad. This significant downfield shift confirms increased deshielding due to stronger hydrogen bonding with the DMSO-d$_6$ solvent.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for Unknown B:** The presence of both $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ and $\\mathrm{C=O}$ IR bands compellingly identifies Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$ as an amide. The solvent-dependent shifts in both the IR ($\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ stretch) and $^{1}$H NMR ($\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ proton) spectra demonstrate that the amide proton acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, with the interaction being significantly stronger in the highly accepting DMSO-d$_6$ solvent.\n\n**Overall Interpretation:**\nThe experiment successfully uses the different hydrogen-bonding capabilities of CDCl$_3$ and DMSO-d$_6$ to probe the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ and $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ groups. The spectroscopic changes (lower $\\tilde{\\nu}$ and higher $\\delta$ in DMSO-d$_6$) are hallmark indicators of hydrogen bonding. Based on the full dataset, Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$ is an alcohol and Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$ is an amide.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In CDCl$_3$, Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$’s $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ is largely free (high-frequency, sharp IR; upfield, narrow $\\delta$), whereas in DMSO-d$_6$ it becomes solvent-hydrogen-bonded (lower-frequency, broad IR; downfield, broadened $\\delta$). Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$’s $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ in CDCl$_3$ is less hydrogen-bonded than in DMSO-d$_6$, showing a downfield, broadened shift and lower IR frequency in DMSO-d$_6$; the persistent carbonyl near $\\tilde{\\nu}\\approx 1650\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ supports an amide. Thus, $\\mathrm{A}$ is an alcohol and $\\mathrm{B}$ is an amide; the solvent dependence differentiates free (CDCl$_3$) versus hydrogen-bonded (DMSO-d$_6$) $\\mathrm{X\\!-\\!H}$.**\n- This option correctly interprets the data for Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$ in both solvents, correctly interprets the data for Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$ in both solvents, correctly identifies the significance of the carbonyl band for $\\mathrm{B}$, correctly assigns the functional groups ($\\mathrm{A}$=alcohol, $\\mathrm{B}$=amide), and correctly states the overall conclusion of the experiment. Every statement is consistent with the provided data and foundational principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In CDCl$_3$, Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$’s $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ is strongly hydrogen-bonded by the solvent (hence high-frequency, sharp IR), and DMSO-d$_6$ disrupts hydrogen bonding (causing the IR band to broaden and shift lower, and the $^{1}$H resonance to move downfield and broaden). Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$ is a secondary amine, because its $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ moves downfield in DMSO-d$_6$ solely due to increased solvent polarity; hydrogen bonding is not required.**\n- This option contains multiple fundamental errors. Strong hydrogen bonding causes a *low-frequency, broad* IR band, not a high-frequency, sharp one. DMSO-d$_6$ *promotes*, not disrupts, hydrogen bonding. The effects described (lower frequency, downfield shift) are due to the *formation* of stronger hydrogen bonds. The identification of B as a secondary amine ignores the critical carbonyl band data, which is definitive for an amide.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The downfield shifts in DMSO-d$_6$ for both $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ arise from the larger bulk magnetic susceptibility of DMSO-d$_6$ relative to CDCl$_3$, which uniformly deshields all protons regardless of hydrogen bonding. The IR band broadening and frequency shifts are secondary and not diagnostic, so no differentiation of free versus hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{X\\!-\\!H}$ can be made.**\n- This option incorrectly attributes the large observed NMR shifts ($\\Delta\\delta = 3.75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\Delta\\delta = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for $\\mathrm{B}$) to bulk magnetic susceptibility, an effect that is far too small to account for such changes. It incorrectly dismisses the IR frequency shifts and broadening, which are primary and highly diagnostic indicators of hydrogen bonding, as stated in the problem's premises.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Unknown $\\mathrm{A}$ is a carboxylic acid (its $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ is always strongly hydrogen-bonded), and Unknown $\\mathrm{B}$ is an aliphatic amine; switching to DMSO-d$_6$ increases shielding of exchangeable protons, so both $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ and $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ should move upfield and sharpen while their IR stretches shift to higher frequency due to stronger hydrogen bonding in polar solvents, matching the observations given.**\n- This option makes incorrect functional group assignments. The data for $\\mathrm{A}$ are inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. The data for $\\mathrm{B}$ are inconsistent with an amine. Furthermore, it incorrectly states the effects of hydrogen bonding: it causes *deshielding* (downfield NMR shift), not shielding (upfield shift), and it causes IR stretches to shift to *lower* frequency, not higher. The final claim that these incorrect principles \"match the observations\" is a direct contradiction of the provided data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
