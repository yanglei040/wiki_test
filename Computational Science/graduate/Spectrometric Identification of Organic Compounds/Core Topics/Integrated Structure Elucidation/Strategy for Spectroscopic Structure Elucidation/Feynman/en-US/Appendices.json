            "problem": "You are designing a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiment strategy to distinguish carbon types in a molecule by Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT). Consider an unknown organic molecule whose carbon framework is known a priori to consist of $1$ quaternary aromatic carbon (no directly attached hydrogen), $2$ aromatic methine carbons ($\\text{C}_\\text{ar}\\text{-H}$), $1$ aliphatic methylene ($\\text{CH_2}$), and $1$ aliphatic methyl ($\\text{CH_3}$). You acquire carbon-$13$ ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) spectra using DEPT-$90$ and DEPT-$135$ under ideal conditions: uniform $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ matching, perfect $90^{\\circ}$/$135^{\\circ}$ pulse calibration, complete decoupling during acquisition, and conventional phase cycling, with all spectra properly phased to the conventional display. Assume typical chemical shift ranges for aromatic carbons near $\\delta \\approx 110$–$160$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$ and for aliphatic carbons near $\\delta \\approx 10$–$50$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$. No accidental chemical shift degeneracy or signal overlap occurs.\n\nStarting from first principles of polarization transfer and selection based on the number of directly attached hydrogens, determine the consistent pattern of observed DEPT-$90$ and DEPT-$135$ signals (how many signals appear in each, their presence/absence by carbon type, and their relative phase/sign in DEPT-$135$). Which option below is consistent with the stated composition and the physics of DEPT?\n\nA. DEPT-$90$: $2$ signals, both in the aromatic region. DEPT-$135$: $3$ positive signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and $1$ negative signal (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$); the quaternary aromatic carbon is absent in both.\n\nB.

DEPT-$90$: $0$ signals because proton decoupling removes all multiplicities. DEPT-$135$: $4$ negative signals (including the quaternary aromatic carbon); no positive signals.\n\nD. DEPT-$90$: $2$ signals, both in the aromatic region. DEPT-$135$: $2$ positive signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$) and $1$ negative signal (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$); the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ is absent, and the quaternary aromatic carbon appears weakly in DEPT-$135$ at positive phase.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to predict the appearance of a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR spectrum under two different DEPT pulse sequences (DEPT-90 and DEPT-135) for a molecule with a known composition of carbon types: one quaternary ($\\mathrm{C_q}$), two methine ($\\mathrm{CH}$), one methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$), and one methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$).\n\nThe DEPT experiment edits the spectrum based on the number of protons attached to a carbon atom. Quaternary carbons, having no protons, are always absent in DEPT spectra. The appearance of other carbon types depends on the final proton pulse angle, $\\theta$.\n\n**1. DEPT-90 Experiment ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$):**\n\nIn a DEPT-90 experiment, only carbons with a single attached proton (methine, $\\mathrm{CH}$) produce a signal.\n-   **Quaternary C ($\\mathrm{C_q}$):** Absent.\n-   **Methine CH:** Present and positive.\n-   **Methylene CH$_2$:** Absent (nulled).\n-   **Methyl CH$_3$:** Absent (nulled).\n\nGiven the molecule has $2$ aromatic methine ($\\text{C}_\\text{ar}\\text{-H}$) carbons, the DEPT-90 spectrum will show exactly **$2$ signals**, both in the aromatic region.\n\n**2. DEPT-135 Experiment ($\\theta = 135^\\circ$):**\n\nIn a DEPT-135 experiment, the signals are phased according to the number of attached protons.\n-   **Quaternary C ($\\mathrm{C_q}$):** Absent.\n-   **Methine CH:** Present and **positive**.\n-   **Methylene CH$_2$:** Present and **negative**.\n-   **Methyl CH$_3$:** Present and **positive**.\n\nApplying this to our molecule:\n-   The $2$ aromatic methine ($\\mathrm{CH}$) carbons will give $2$ positive signals.\n-   The $1$ aliphatic methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) carbon will give $1$ positive signal.\n-   The $1$ aliphatic methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) carbon will give $1$ negative signal.\n\nIn total, the DEPT-135 spectrum will show **$3$ positive signals** (two aromatic, one aliphatic) and **$1$ negative signal** (aliphatic).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n-   **DEPT-90:** Shows $2$ signals from the two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ groups.\n-   **DEPT-135:** Shows $3$ positive signals (from the two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and one aliphatic $\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and $1$ negative signal (from the one aliphatic $\\mathrm{CH_2}$). The quaternary carbon is absent from both spectra.\n\nThis outcome perfectly matches the description in option A. Let's analyze the options.\n\n*   **A. DEPT-$90$: $2$ signals, both in the aromatic region. DEPT-$135$: $3$ positive signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and $1$ negative signal (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$); the quaternary aromatic carbon is absent in both.**\n    This is consistent with our derivation.\n\n*   **B.** Incorrect. A $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group does not appear in a DEPT-90 spectrum, and it appears as a positive, not negative, signal in a DEPT-135 spectrum.\n\n*   **C.** Incorrect. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the DEPT experiment. Signals are edited, not eliminated by decoupling. Phasing in DEPT-135 is mixed, not all negative.\n\n*   **D.** Incorrect. The $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal is present and positive in a DEPT-135 spectrum. Under ideal conditions, the quaternary carbon does not appear.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct description.",

Isotope constraints: the measured relative isotopic intensities for the same peak group are $I_{1}/I_{0} = 0.116$ and $I_{2}/I_{0} = 0.0102$, where $I_{k}/I_{0}$ denotes the intensity ratio of the $M+k$ peak to the monoisotopic peak.
