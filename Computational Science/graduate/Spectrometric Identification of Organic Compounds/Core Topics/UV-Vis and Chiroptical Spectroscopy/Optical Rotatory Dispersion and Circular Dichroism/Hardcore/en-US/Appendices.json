            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All provided data and foundational facts are consistent with established principles of physics and chemistry concerning optical activity. The task is to derive standard definitions from first principles and then apply them to compute a specific quantity, which is a valid pedagogical and scientific exercise.\n\nThe derivation and calculation proceed as follows.\n\nThe first foundational principle states that the observed optical rotation, $\\alpha(\\lambda)$, is directly proportional to the optical path length, $l$, and the number density of chiral molecules, $N$. We can express this as a formal equation:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\lambda) = \\phi(\\lambda) l N\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(\\lambda)$ is a proportionality constant characteristic of the molecule at a given wavelength $\\lambda$, known as the molecular rotatory power. This quantity is intrinsic to the molecule, but its units are inconvenient for practical use. Therefore, standard normalizations are defined.\n\n**1. Derivation of Specific Rotation, $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}$**\n\nSpecific rotation is a normalization of the observed rotation with respect to the mass concentration of the solute. The goal is to define an intensive property of the substance that is independent of the specific experimental setup ($l$ and concentration). The mass concentration, $c_m$, has units of mass per unit volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$).\n\nFrom the second foundational fact, the number density $N$ is related to the mass concentration $c_m$ and molar mass $M$ by $N = \\frac{N_A}{M} c_m$, where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant. Substituting this into the primary equation gives:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\lambda) = \\phi(\\lambda) l \\left(\\frac{N_A}{M} c_m\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\phi(\\lambda) N_A}{M}\\right) l c_m\n$$\nTo create a mass-normalized quantity, we group the experimental variables $l$ and $c_m$ and define the specific rotation, $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}$, as the observed rotation per unit path length and per unit mass concentration.\n$$\n[\\alpha]_{\\lambda} \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha(\\lambda)}{l \\cdot c_m}\n$$\nThe value of $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}$ is thus an intrinsic property of the substance, as $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\phi(\\lambda) N_A}{M}$. By convention in chemistry, the path length $l$ is expressed in decimeters ($\\mathrm{dm}$), the mass concentration $c_m$ in grams per milliliter ($\\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$), and the observed rotation $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ in degrees ($\\mathrm{deg}$). The units of specific rotation are therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Units of } [\\alpha]_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{deg}}{\\mathrm{dm} \\cdot (\\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1})} = \\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Molar Rotation, $[M]_{\\lambda}$**\n\nMolar rotation is a normalization with respect to the molar amount density (or molar concentration), $c_n$. This provides a measure of rotation on a per-mole basis, which is useful for comparing molecules of different masses. The molar concentration $c_n$ has units of moles per unit volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$).\n\nUsing the second foundational fact, $N = N_A c_n$, we substitute this into the primary equation:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\lambda) = \\phi(\\lambda) l (N_A c_n) = (\\phi(\\lambda) N_A) l c_n\n$$\nTo create a mole-normalized quantity, we define the molar rotation, $[M]_{\\lambda}$, as the observed rotation per unit path length and per unit molar concentration.\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda} \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha(\\lambda)}{l \\cdot c_n}\n$$\nThe value of $[M]_{\\lambda}$ is also an intrinsic property, $[M]_{\\lambda} = \\phi(\\lambda) N_A$. The problem requires the final answer in units of $\\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. This dictates the use of $l$ in $\\mathrm{dm}$ and $c_n$ in $\\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, with $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ in degrees. The units of molar rotation are thus:\n$$\n\\text{Units of } [M]_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{deg}}{\\mathrm{dm} \\cdot (\\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1})} = \\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**3. Conversion between $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}$ and $[M]_{\\lambda}$**\n\nThe relationship between specific and molar rotation can be derived from their definitions. We require the relationship between mass concentration $c_m$ and molar concentration $c_n$. By definition, $c_n = c_m / M$, where $M$ is the molar mass (e.g., in $\\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$).\n\nWe start with the definition of molar rotation and substitute for $c_n$:\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\alpha(\\lambda)}{l \\cdot c_n} = \\frac{\\alpha(\\lambda)}{l \\cdot (c_m / M)} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha(\\lambda)}{l \\cdot c_m}\\right) \\cdot M\n$$\nRecognizing the term in parentheses as the definition of specific rotation, $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}$, we obtain the conversion formula:\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda} = [\\alpha]_{\\lambda} \\cdot M\n$$\nThis relationship is dimensionally consistent with the units derived above:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = (\\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})\n$$\nIt is worth noting that some reference texts include a factor of $1/100$ in this formula. This arises from the historical use of inconsistent units (e.g., $c_m$ in $\\mathrm{g} / 100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$) and is not required when using a coherent system of units as derived here.\n\n**4. Calculation of Molar Rotation**\n\nWe are given the following experimental data:\n-   Observed rotation: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{obs}} = +0.872 \\ \\mathrm{deg}$ at $\\lambda = 589 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Path length: $l = 1.000 \\ \\mathrm{dm}$\n-   Mass concentration: $c_{m} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$\n-   Molar mass: $M = 250.31 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nWe can compute the molar rotation $[M]_{\\lambda}$ directly by combining the expressions for its definition and the concentration relationship:\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{obs}}(\\lambda) \\cdot M}{l \\cdot c_m}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda=589 \\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{(+0.872 \\ \\mathrm{deg}) \\cdot (250.31 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}{(1.000 \\ \\mathrm{dm}) \\cdot (1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda=589 \\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{218.27032}{1.25 \\times 10^{-2}} \\ \\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda=589 \\mathrm{nm}} = 17461.6256 \\ \\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem statement requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The input data with the lowest precision ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ and $c_m$) have three significant figures, which would ordinarily limit the result to three significant figures ($1.75 \\times 10^4$). However, adhering to the explicit formatting instruction, we round the calculated value to four significant figures.\n$$\n[M]_{\\lambda=589 \\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 17460 \\ \\mathrm{deg} \\ \\mathrm{dm}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nTo unambiguously represent this value with four significant figures, scientific notation is appropriate: $1.746 \\times 10^4$.",

The tasks are well-defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution through standard methods of data analysis and error propagation. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Derive a baseline-corrected estimator for $\\text{ee}$.\nThe measured ellipticity $\\theta$ is assumed to be the sum of the signal from the chiral analyte and a baseline offset $\\theta_{\\text{baseline}}$. The true signal is therefore the baseline-corrected ellipticity, $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{\\text{measured}} - \\theta_{\\text{baseline}}$. The problem states that this signal is proportional to both the concentration $c$ and the enantiomeric excess $\\text{ee}$. We can write this relationship with a proportionality constant $K$:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = K \\cdot c \\cdot \\text{ee} $$\nThis constant $K$ encapsulates the instrumental response and the intrinsic chiroptical properties of the molecule (i.e., the differential molar ellipticity). We can determine $K$ using the enantiopure calibrant, for which $\\text{ee} = 1$.\nFor the calibrant, the corrected ellipticity is $\\Delta\\theta_{p} = \\theta_{p} - \\theta_{b}$. The concentration is $c_{0}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{p} = K \\cdot c_{0} \\cdot 1 \\implies K = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_{p}}{c_{0}} = \\frac{\\theta_{p} - \\theta_{b}}{c_{0}} $$\nFor the unknown sample, the corrected ellipticity is $\\Delta\\theta_{u} = \\theta_{u} - \\theta_{b}'$. The concentration is $c$ and the enantiomeric excess is $\\text{ee}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{u} = K \\cdot c \\cdot \\text{ee} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K$ derived from the calibrant:\n$$ \\theta_{u} - \\theta_{b}' = \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{p} - \\theta_{b}}{c_{0}} \\right) c \\cdot \\text{ee} $$\nSolving for the enantiomeric excess, $\\text{ee}$:\n$$ \\text{ee} = \\frac{(\\theta_{u} - \\theta_{b}')c_{0}}{(\\theta_{p} - \\theta_{b})c} $$\nThis is the baseline-corrected estimator for $\\text{ee}$.\n\nTask 2: Compute the unknown sample concentration $c$ and its uncertainty $\\sigma_{c}$.\nThe concentration $c$ is determined from the Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon c \\ell$.\n$$ c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon \\ell} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ c = \\frac{0.450}{(1200\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1})(0.10\\,\\text{cm})} = \\frac{0.450}{120\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}} = 0.00375\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nSince the calibrant concentration $c_{0}$ is given in millimolar ($mM$), we convert $c$ to the same units:\n$$ c = 0.00375\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\text{mM}}{1\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}} = 3.75\\,\\text{mM} $$\nTo find the uncertainty $\\sigma_{c}$, we use first-order Gaussian error propagation for independent variables in a quotient/product.

Let's first define the baseline-corrected ellipticities:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{u} = \\theta_{u} - \\theta_{b}' = 6.10 - 0.22 = 5.88\\,\\text{mdeg} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{p} = \\theta_{p} - \\theta_{b} = 12.40 - 0.18 = 12.22\\,\\text{mdeg} $$\nThe uncertainties for these differences are found by adding the variances of the independent measurements:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta\\theta_{u}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\theta_{u}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\theta_{b}'}^2 = (0.08)^2 + (0.03)^2 = 0.0064 + 0.0009 = 0.0073\\,\\text{mdeg}^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta\\theta_{p}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\theta_{p}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\theta_{b}}^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.03)^2 = 0.0144 + 0.0009 = 0.0153\\,\\text{mdeg}^2 $$\nThe estimator can now be written as $\\text{ee} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_{u} \\cdot c_{0}}{\\Delta\\theta_{p} \\cdot c}$.

A single-conformer, crystal-structure-based octant rule analysis, however, predicts a negative Cotton effect for the $n \\rightarrow \\pi^\\ast$ band.\n\nThe molecule is conformationally flexible: two rapidly interconverting conformers, $A$ and $B$, differ by rotation of a substituent about the carbonyl–$\\alpha$ bond, changing the spatial placement of substituents relative to the carbonyl chromophore. Their relative electronic energies are $E_A = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $E_B = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. For the $n \\rightarrow \\pi^\\ast$ transition, quantum-chemistry benchmarks indicate rotational strengths $R_A = +2.0$ (arbitrary consistent units) and $R_B = -3.0$, reflecting opposite signs due to the conformationally altered magneto–electric coupling. The barrier between $A$ and $B$ is low enough that interconversion is faster than the spectroscopic timescale, so the observed spectrum is a thermal ensemble average.\n\nStarting from the Beer–Lambert law $A(\\lambda) = \\epsilon(\\lambda)\\,c\\,l$, the definition of CD as $\\Delta A(\\lambda) = A_L(\\lambda) - A_R(\\lambda)$ with $\\Delta A(\\lambda) \\propto \\Delta \\epsilon(\\lambda)\\,c\\,l$, and the rotational strength definition $R_{nm} = \\Im\\!\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{nm}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{m}_{nm}\\right)$ for an electric–magnetic dipole allowed transition, derive the ensemble-averaged CD near $\\lambda \\approx 300\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ by Boltzmann weighting over conformers using $p_i = \\exp(-E_i/k_B T)/Z$ with $Z = \\sum_i \\exp(-E_i/k_B T)$. Use $k_B = 1.987\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nThen, address the empirical-rule-based assignment in this flexible system. Consider the following statements and select all that correctly (i) explain why octant and sector rules can misassign flexible systems, and (ii) propose a conformer-resolved analysis that avoids such misassignments while remaining consistent with first principles linking CD and ORD.\n\nA. The octant rule is infallible for carbonyl chromophores; the observed discrepancy must arise from sample impurities. Increasing concentration to boost signal will restore agreement with the rule-predicted sign.\n\nB. When barriers are low and multiple conformers contribute within the measurement timescale, the fixed-geometry assumptions of the octant and sector rules can fail. A robust approach is to compute, for each conformer $i$, transition properties and rotational strengths, form $\\Delta \\epsilon_i(\\lambda)$, apply Boltzmann weights $p_i = \\exp(-E_i/k_B T)/Z$, and sum $\\Delta \\epsilon(\\lambda) = \\sum_i p_i\\,\\Delta \\epsilon_i(\\lambda)$ for comparison with experiment.\n\nC. The sector rule can be salvaged in flexible systems by averaging the predicted signs over conformers without considering energies or intensities; if most conformers predict a negative sign, the ensemble CD must be negative.\n\nD. Solvent-specific interactions can differentially stabilize conformers and invert the ensemble CD sign. Including solvent effects explicitly or via a polarizable continuum model in Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and checking Kramers–Kronig consistency between simulated CD and ORD, reduces misassignment risk.\n\nE. ORD depends only on far-from-resonance refractive indices and is therefore unaffected by conformational dynamics; absolute configuration should be assigned solely from $[\\alpha]_{589}$ at the sodium D line.\n\nAnswer the following in sequence: (1) compute the Boltzmann populations $p_A$ and $p_B$ at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the sign of the ensemble rotational strength near $\\lambda \\approx 300\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; (2) briefly justify, from first principles, whether empirical octant/sector rules can misassign the configuration here; and (3) select all correct statements from A–E above.",
            "solution": "The problem statement provides a scientifically sound and well-posed scenario in chiroptical spectroscopy, allowing for a rigorous analysis. We proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\n(1) Computation of Boltzmann populations and ensemble rotational strength.\n\nThe observed chiroptical properties are an ensemble average over the rapidly interconverting conformers $A$ and $B$. The population of each conformer $i$, denoted $p_i$, is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$p_i = \\frac{\\exp(-E_i/k_B T)}{Z}$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the relative energy of conformer $i$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z$ is the partition function, $Z = \\sum_i \\exp(-E_i/k_B T)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy term, $k_B T$, using the given values $k_B = 1.987\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ and $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$k_B T = (1.987\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.5921\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe relative energies are given as $E_A = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $E_B = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Boltzmann factors for each conformer:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.0}{0.5921}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.6}{0.5921}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-1.0133) \\approx 0.3630$$\n\nThe partition function $Z$ is the sum of these factors:\n$$Z = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 + 0.3630 = 1.3630$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Boltzmann populations (molar fractions) $p_A$ and $p_B$:\n$$p_A = \\frac{1}{1.3630} \\approx 0.7337 \\quad (73.4\\%)$$\n$$p_B = \\frac{0.3630}{1.3630} \\approx 0.2663 \\quad (26.6\\%)$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_B \\approx 0.7337 + 0.2663 = 1.0000$.\n\nThe observed rotational strength, $\\langle R \\rangle$, for the $n \\rightarrow \\pi^\\ast$ transition is the Boltzmann-weighted average of the individual rotational strengths, $R_A = +2.0$ and $R_B = -3.0$ (in arbitrary units):\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = p_A R_A + p_B R_B$$\n$$\\langle R \\rangle \\approx (0.7337)(+2.0) + (0.2663)(-3.0) \\approx 1.4674 - 0.7989 = +0.6685$$\nThe sign of the ensemble rotational strength is **positive**. This is consistent with the experimental observation of a small positive Cotton effect, despite the octant rule prediction of a negative one based on a single conformer.\n\n(2) Justification for the misassignment by empirical rules.\n\nFrom first principles, the measured Circular Dichroism (CD) spectrum, characterized by $\\Delta \\epsilon(\\lambda) = \\epsilon_L(\\lambda) - \\epsilon_R(\\lambda)$, is an intensive property that reflects the weighted average of the contributions from all species present in the sample. For a molecule existing as a dynamic equilibrium of conformers, the observed spectrum is the sum of the individual spectra of each conformer, weighted by their respective mole fractions (i.e., Boltzmann populations):\n$$\\Delta\\epsilon(\\lambda)_{\\text{obs}} = \\sum_i p_i\\,\\Delta\\epsilon_i(\\lambda)$$\nThe rotational strength $R$ of a specific electronic transition is proportional to the integrated area of the corresponding CD band, $\\int (\\Delta\\epsilon(\\lambda)/\\lambda) d\\lambda$. Therefore, the total observed rotational strength is also a Boltzmann-weighted average:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle_{\\text{obs}} = \\sum_i p_i R_i$$\nEmpirical rules, such as the octant rule for carbonyls, are qualitative models that predict the sign of the Cotton effect (and thus the sign of $R$) from the three-dimensional arrangement of substituents in a single, fixed molecular geometry. The rule is applied to a static picture.\nThe misassignment in this case arises because the octant rule was applied to a single conformation (e.g., one from a crystal structure or a simple energy minimization) which predicts a negative Cotton effect. However, the molecule in solution is a conformational mixture. As calculated above, the lower-energy conformer $A$ has a population of $\\approx 73\\%$ and a positive rotational strength $R_A = +2.0$. The higher-energy conformer $B$ has a population of $\\approx 27\\%$ and a negative rotational strength $R_B = -3.0$. The ensemble average is dominated by the more abundant conformer $A$, leading to a net positive rotational strength $(\\langle R \\rangle > 0)$, which contradicts the prediction based on a single conformer (likely conformer $B$ or a similar structure). This demonstrates that applying a static rule to a dynamic system without accounting for the full conformational ensemble can lead to erroneous conclusions about absolute configuration.\n\n(3) Evaluation of statements A–E.\n\nA. The statement claims the octant rule is infallible and blames the discrepancy on impurities. This is **Incorrect**. The octant rule is an empirical correlation with known exceptions and is particularly prone to failure in conformationally flexible systems. The problem described is a classic example of conformational effects, not necessarily impurity. Increasing concentration would change the measured absorbance $\\Delta A$, but not the molar property $\\Delta \\epsilon$ or its sign, as $\\Delta \\epsilon = \\Delta A / (c l)$.\n\nB. This statement correctly identifies the failure of fixed-geometry assumptions for flexible molecules and accurately describes the modern, robust computational methodology. One must consider all significantly populated conformers, calculate their individual chiroptical properties (like $\\Delta \\epsilon_i(\\lambda)$ or $R_i$), and then perform a Boltzmann-weighted summation to obtain the ensemble-averaged spectrum for comparison with experiment. This is the standard procedure to avoid misassignments in such systems. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nC. This statement proposes averaging the signs predicted by the rule for each conformer, without considering energies (populations) or intensities (magnitudes of $R_i$). This is **Incorrect**. Such a simple \"voting\" system is unphysical. A high-energy conformer contributes negligibly to the ensemble average, regardless of its sign. Similarly, a conformer with a very small rotational strength has little impact. The contributions must be properly weighted by both population and magnitude, as described by the equation $\\langle R \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i R_i$.\n\nD. This statement correctly points out another critical aspect of accurate computational prediction. The solvent can significantly influence the relative stabilities of conformers (affecting $E_i$ and hence $p_i$) and their geometries (affecting $R_i$). Thus, including solvent effects, for instance through a polarizable continuum model (PCM) in Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) calculations, is essential for a more realistic and reliable prediction. The mention of checking Kramers-Kronig consistency between the calculated CD and ORD spectra is also valid, as it serves as a check on the theoretical quality and completeness of the spectral simulation. This statement describes important refinements to the method in B. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nE. This statement claims ORD is unaffected by conformational dynamics. This is fundamentally **Incorrect**. ORD and CD are two manifestations of the same phenomenon (chirality), linked by the Kramers-Kronig transforms. The total ORD spectrum is a superposition of the contributions from all conformers, just like the CD spectrum. Any property that affects the CD spectrum (like conformational population shifts) will also affect the ORD spectrum. A measurement at a single wavelength, such as the specific rotation at the sodium D-line, $[\\alpha]_{589}$, is an ensemble-averaged property and is most certainly dependent on the conformational equilibrium. Basing an assignment solely on $[\\alpha]_{589}$ without a full spectral understanding is unreliable.",
