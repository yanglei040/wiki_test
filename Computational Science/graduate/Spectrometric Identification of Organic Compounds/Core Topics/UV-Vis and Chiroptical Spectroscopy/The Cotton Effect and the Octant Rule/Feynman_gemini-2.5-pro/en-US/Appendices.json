            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System:** A conformationally locked cyclohexanone framework.\n- **Transition:** nonbonding-to-antibonding ($n\\to\\pi^*$).\n- **Methodology:** Octant rule for predicting the sign of the Cotton effect.\n- **Coordinate System:** A right-handed system is defined. The carbonyl bond lies on the $x$-axis with the oxygen atom at a positive $x$ value. The carbonyl C=O group lies in the $xy$-plane. The $z$-axis is perpendicular to this plane.\n- **Compounds:** Two diastereomeric derivatives, compound $1$ and compound $2$, are considered. They are identical except for the position of a single bulky substituent.\n- **Substituent Locations (from X-ray crystallography):**\n    - Compound $1$: The substituent centroid is at approximately $(x,y,z)=(-1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+2.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+1.2\\,\\text{\\AA})$.\n    - Compound $2$: The substituent centroid is at approximately $(x,y,z)=(-1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},-2.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+1.1\\,\\text{\\AA})$.\n- **Assumptions:**\n    1. Contributions to the Cotton effect from atoms common to both compounds $1$ and $2$ are assumed to cancel each other out.\n    2. Contributions from the front-half space ($x>0$) are smaller than contributions from the rear-half space ($x<0$).\n    3. The chromophore is isolated.\n    4. The molecules are rigid under the experimental conditions (low temperature, nonpolar solvent).\n- **Question:** Predict the sign of the $n\\to\\pi^*$ Cotton effect (observed near $\\sim 290\\,\\text{nm}$) for compounds $1$ and $2$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The octant rule is a well-established principle in stereochemistry for correlating the three-dimensional structure of chiral ketones with the sign of the Cotton effect associated with their $n\\to\\pi^*$ electronic transition. The described coordinate system is standard for this application. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary geometric information and explicit assumptions required to apply the rule. The language is objective and precise. The data are physically realistic for molecular dimensions. The setup does not violate any fundamental principles and is a classic textbook example of applying stereochemical rules to spectroscopy.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe sign of the Cotton effect for the $n\\to\\pi^*$ transition in a saturated ketone is predicted by the octant rule. This rule divides the space around the carbonyl chromophore into eight regions, or octants, by three nodal surfaces. Perturbing groups (substituents) located in these octants contribute to the rotational strength, $R$, of the transition with a sign that depends on the octant they occupy. The sign of the Cotton effect is the same as the sign of $R$.\n\n**1. Nodal Surfaces and the Coordinate System:**\nThe three nodal surfaces, within the specified coordinate system, are:\n- A vertical plane containing the C=O bond and perpendicular to the ring. In the given coordinate system, this is the $xy$-plane (where $z=0$). This is a nodal plane of the $\\pi^*$ molecular orbital.\n- A plane perpendicular to the C=O bond, which contains the carbonyl carbon. This is approximately the $yz$-plane (where $x=0$). This separates the molecule into \"front\" ($x>0$) and \"rear\" ($x<0$) halves. This plane is related to the nodal properties of the non-bonding ($n$) orbital on the oxygen.\n- A third plane, the $xz$-plane (where $y=0$), is also a nodal surface that bisects the C=O bond.\n\nAtoms lying on any of these three nodal planes ($x=0$, $y=0$, or $z=0$) make no contribution to the Cotton effect. The problem explicitly directs us to consider the rear octants ($x<0$) as dominant.\n\n**2. Sign Convention for Rear Octants:**\nAccording to the established convention for the octant rule (when looking from the oxygen atom towards the carbon atom, i.e., along the negative $x$-axis):\n- A substituent in the **Upper-Right-Rear** octant ($x<0$, $y>0$, $z>0$) makes a **POSITIVE** contribution to the Cotton effect.\n- A substituent in the **Upper-Left-Rear** octant ($x<0$, $y<0$, $z>0$) makes a **NEGATIVE** contribution.\n- A substituent in the **Lower-Left-Rear** octant ($x<0$, $y<0$, $z<0$) makes a **POSITIVE** contribution.\n- A substituent in the **Lower-Right-Rear** octant ($x<0$, $y>0$, $z<0$) makes a **NEGATIVE** contribution.\nThe sign of the contribution in the rear octants is given by the sign of the product of the $y$ and $z$ coordinates, i.e., $\\text{sign}(y \\cdot z)$. Front octants ($x>0$) have the opposite signs.\n\n**3. Application to Compounds 1 and 2:**\nThe problem states to focus on the contribution of the single bulky substituent, as other contributions are assumed to cancel.\n\n- **Compound 1:**\nThe substituent is located at $(x,y,z)=(-1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+2.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+1.2\\,\\text{\\AA})$.\nThe signs of the coordinates are $(-, +, +)$. The substituent resides in the **Upper-Right-Rear** octant.\nBased on the sign convention, a substituent in this octant makes a **POSITIVE** contribution to the Cotton effect. Therefore, compound $1$ is predicted to exhibit a positive Cotton effect.\n\n- **Compound 2:**\nThe substituent is located at $(x,y,z)=(-1.0\\,\\text{\\AA},-2.0\\,\\text{\\AA},+1.1\\,\\text{\\AA})$.\nThe signs of the coordinates are $(-, -, +)$. The substituent resides in the **Upper-Left-Rear** octant.\nBased on the sign convention, a substituent in this octant makes a **NEGATIVE** contribution to the Cotton effect. Therefore, compound $2$ is predicted to exhibit a negative Cotton effect.\n\nThe magnitudes of the coordinates for the two substituents are very similar: $|x_1|=|x_2|$, $|y_1|=|y_2|$, and $z_1 \\approx z_2$. Since the magnitude of the contribution to the rotational strength $|R|$ is a function of these coordinates, it is reasonable to predict that the magnitudes of the Cotton effects for compounds $1$ and $2$ will be similar.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compound $1$ will exhibit a positive Cotton effect, and compound $2$ will exhibit a negative Cotton effect of similar magnitude, because moving the substituent from $y>0$ to $y<0$ in the same $z>0$ half-space inverts the sign while keeping $|R|$ similar.**\n- **Prediction:** Compound $1$ gives a positive Cotton effect, and compound $2$ gives a negative Cotton effect. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n- **Magnitude:** \"similar magnitude\" is a correct inference from the similar coordinate magnitudes.\n- **Reasoning:** \"...moving the substituent from $y>0$ to $y<0$...\" describes the change from compound $1$ to $2$. This corresponds to crossing the $xz$-plane (where $y=0$), which is a nodal plane. Crossing a nodal plane must invert the sign of the contribution. The reasoning provided is correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Compound $1$ will exhibit a negative Cotton effect, and compound $2$ will exhibit the same negative sign, because the $x<0$ (rear) location determines the sign independent of $y$ when $z>0$.**\n- **Prediction:** The predicted signs (negative for $1$, negative for $2$) are incorrect. Compound $1$ should be positive. The signs should be opposite, not the same.\n- **Reasoning:** The claim that the sign is \"independent of $y$\" is fundamentally wrong. The $xz$-plane ($y=0$) is a nodal plane, and the sign of the contribution depends critically on which side of this plane the substituent lies.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both compounds will exhibit near-zero Cotton effects because a single substituent contribution cancels with the rest of the ring in the rear half-space, and moving from $y>0$ to $y<0$ does not change this cancellation.**\n- **Prediction:** This predicts near-zero effects, which contradicts the purpose of the octant rule for bulky substituents that are known to induce significant effects.\n- **Reasoning:** This option ignores the problem's explicit assumption that the contributions of the common ring atoms cancel when comparing the two diastereomers, leaving the bulky substituent's contribution as the dominant differential effect. Furthermore, as explained for option A, moving the substituent across the $y=0$ plane inverts the sign of its contribution, which would not result in a persistent cancellation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The sign cannot be predicted by the octant rule without knowing the solvent polarity, because the solvent-dependent shift of the $n\\to\\pi^*$ transition controls the sign of the Cotton effect.**\n- **Reasoning:** The octant rule is specifically formulated to predict the sign of the rotational strength based on molecular geometry, which is the primary determinant. Solvent polarity can affect the position ($\\lambda_{max}$) and magnitude of a CD band, but it does not typically \"control the sign\" for a rigid conformer. The problem specifies a nonpolar solvent and a conformationally locked system, minimizing such effects and setting up an ideal scenario for the application of the octant rule.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, option A provides the correct predictions for the signs of the Cotton effects for both compounds and offers a sound and accurate justification based on the principles of the octant rule.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the ensemble-averaged Cotton-effect amplitude, denoted as $\\langle a \\rangle(T)$, for a chiral ketone in solution at a given absolute temperature $T$. The system is treated as an ensemble of distinct conformers, each contributing to the observed spectroscopic property based on its thermodynamic population. The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe core principle is that at thermal equilibrium, the probability of finding the system in a particular conformational state $j$ is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The relative population of a conformer $j$ is determined by its relative Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_j(T)$, and its degeneracy (or statistical weight), $g_j$.\n\nFirst, we define the relative Gibbs free energy for each conformer $j$ at a temperature $T$. This is given by the standard thermodynamic relation:\n$$ \\Delta G_j(T) = \\Delta H_j - T \\Delta S_j $$\nHere, $\\Delta H_j$ is the relative enthalpy and $\\Delta S_j$ is the relative entropy of conformer $j$. The problem provides $\\Delta H_j$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta S_j$ in $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$. To ensure consistent units for the calculation of $\\Delta G_j(T)$ in $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$, the enthalpy values must be converted. Let $\\Delta H_j^{\\text{(J)}}$ be the enthalpy in $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$, then $\\Delta H_j^{\\text{(J)}} = \\Delta H_j \\times 1000$. The Gibbs free energy is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta G_j(T) = (\\Delta H_j \\times 1000) - T \\Delta S_j $$\n\nThe Boltzmann weight, $w_j$, for each conformer $j$ is proportional to its statistical weight multiplied by the Boltzmann factor. The statistical weight includes the degeneracy $g_j$ of the conformational state.\n$$ w_j \\propto g_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_j(T)}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, given as $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$.\n\nThe ensemble-averaged value of any observable property $X$ is the sum of the property for each state, $X_j$, weighted by the probability of that state, $p_j$.\n$$ \\langle X \\rangle = \\sum_j p_j X_j $$\nThe probability $p_j$ is the normalized Boltzmann weight:\n$$ p_j = \\frac{w_j}{\\sum_k w_k} $$\nSubstituting this into the general formula for the average, we obtain the expression for the ensemble-averaged Cotton-effect amplitude $\\langle a \\rangle(T)$:\n$$ \\langle a \\rangle(T) = \\frac{\\sum_j a_j w_j}{\\sum_j w_j} = \\frac{\\sum_j a_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G_j(T)}{RT}\\right)}{\\sum_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G_j(T)}{RT}\\right)} $$\nwhere $a_j$ is the specific amplitude for conformer $j$.\n\nFor robust numerical computation, it is advisable to prevent potential floating-point overflow or underflow issues that can arise from the exponential term, especially if the arguments $\\frac{-\\Delta G_j(T)}{RT}$ are very large or small. A standard technique is to shift the energy scale. Let $\\Delta G_{\\text{min}} = \\min_k(\\Delta G_k(T))$ be the minimum Gibbs free energy among all conformers. We can define a shifted Gibbs free energy $\\Delta G'_j(T) = \\Delta G_j(T) - \\Delta G_{\\text{min}}$. Substituting this into the averaging formula:\n$$ \\langle a \\rangle(T) = \\frac{\\sum_j a_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G'_j(T) + \\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\sum_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G'_j(T) + \\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right) \\sum_j a_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G'_j(T)}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right) \\sum_j g_j \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G'_j(T)}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThe common factor $\\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT})$ cancels out, yielding a numerically stable expression:\n$$ \\langle a \\rangle(T) = \\frac{\\sum_j a_j w'_j}{\\sum_j w'_j} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad w'_j = g_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_j(T) - \\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nBy construction, the argument of the exponential, $-\\frac{\\Delta G'_j(T)}{RT}$, is always less than or equal to $0$, which constrains the value of the exponential function between $0$ and $1$, thus ensuring numerical stability.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1. For each test case, take the temperature $T$ and the list of conformer properties $(\\Delta H_j, \\Delta S_j, g_j, a_j)$.\n2. For each conformer $j$, calculate its relative Gibbs free energy $\\Delta G_j(T)$ in $\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n3. Find the minimum Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{min}}$, across all conformers in the set.\n4. For each conformer $j$, calculate its numerically stabilized Boltzmann weight $w'_j = g_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_j(T) - \\Delta G_{\\text{min}}}{RT}\\right)$.\n5. Calculate the numerator of the averaging formula, $N = \\sum_j a_j w'_j$.\n6. Calculate the denominator (the partition function), $Z = \\sum_j w'_j$.\n7. The ensemble-averaged amplitude is $\\langle a \\rangle(T) = N/Z$. If $Z=0$ (e.g., no conformers), the result is undefined, but this is not a concern for the given test cases.\n8. Round the final result to six decimal places as required.",
