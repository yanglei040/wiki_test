Decomposition of $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$ into its constituent irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group.\n3.  Application of the IR selection rule to determine the number of IR-active modes.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Reducible Representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$**\n\nThe basis set consists of the four out-of-plane displacement coordinates of the hydrogens at positions $2$, $3$, $5$, and $6$. Let these be denoted by vectors perpendicular to the molecular plane. The character $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(g)$ of the reducible representation for each symmetry operation $g$ is found by counting the number of hydrogen atoms that are not moved by the operation, multiplied by the character of the transformation of the $z$-coordinate under that operation.\n\nThe transformation of a vector along the $z$-axis under each operation is:\n- $E(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $C_{2}(z)(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $C_{2}(y)(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $C_{2}(x)(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $i(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $\\sigma_{xy}(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $\\sigma_{xz}(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $\\sigma_{yz}(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n\nNow we determine the number of unshifted hydrogen atoms for each operation:\n- $E$: The identity operation leaves all $4$ hydrogens unmoved. $\\chi(E) = 4 \\times (+1) = 4$.\n- $C_{2}(z)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the ring's center). It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_5$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(z)) = 0 \\times (+1) = 0$.\n- $C_{2}(y)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $y$-axis. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_3$ and $H_5 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(y)) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $C_{2}(x)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $x$-axis (passing through the substituents). It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_6$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_5$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(x)) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $i$: Inversion through the center of the ring. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_5$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(i) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_{xy}$: Reflection in the molecular plane. All $4$ hydrogen atoms lie in this plane and are unshifted. The displacement vectors are perpendicular to the plane and are inverted ($z \\rightarrow -z$). $\\chi(\\sigma_{xy}) = 4 \\times (-1) = -4$.\n- $\\sigma_{xz}$: Reflection in the vertical plane containing the substituents. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_6$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_5$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(\\sigma_{xz}) = 0 \\times (+1) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_{yz}$: Reflection in the vertical plane bisecting the C-C bonds.

Since $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(g)$ is non-zero only for $g=E$ and $g=\\sigma_{xy}$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ n_{r} = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ \\chi_{\\Gamma}(E)\\chi_{r}(E) + \\chi_{\\Gamma}(\\sigma_{xy})\\chi_{r}(\\sigma_{xy}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\chi_{r}(E) - 4 \\cdot \\chi_{r}(\\sigma_{xy}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\chi_{r}(E) - \\chi_{r}(\\sigma_{xy}) \\right] $$\nFor all irreducible representations in $D_{2h}$, $\\chi_{r}(E) = 1$. So, $n_{r} = \\frac{1}{2} [1 - \\chi_{r}(\\sigma_{xy})]$.\n\nUsing the provided character table:\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n\nThe decomposition of the reducible representation is:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}} = \\mathrm{B}_{2g} + \\mathrm{B}_{3g} + \\mathrm{A}_{u} + \\mathrm{B}_{1u} $$\nThis decomposition correctly accounts for all four vibrational modes, as the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations is $1+1+1+1=4$, which equals the dimension of the reducible representation, $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(E)=4$.\n\n**Part 3: Application of IR Selection Rule**\n\nA vibrational mode is IR-active if its symmetry species is the same as one of the components of the electric dipole moment vector. For the $D_{2h}$ point group, these components transform as:\n- $x \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{3u}$\n- $y \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{2u}$\n- $z \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{1u}$\n\nWe compare the symmetries of the four out-of-plane bending modes with the symmetries required for IR activity:\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2g}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3g}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{u}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}$: IR-active, as it transforms as the $z$-component of the dipole moment.\n\nOnly the mode with $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}$ symmetry is IR-active. Since each non-degenerate mode corresponds to a distinct vibrational band, there is only one IR-active out-of-plane C-H bending band expected.\n\nThe number of distinct IR-active bands is $1$.",

The number and frequencies of these modes are highly sensitive to the number and relative positions of hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring.\n\nThe fundamental principles are:\n1.  **IR Activity:** For a vibrational mode to be infrared (IR) active, it must induce a change in the net electric dipole moment of the molecule.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Molecular symmetry governs which vibrational modes are IR active. For centrosymmetric molecules (those possessing a center of inversion, $i$, like para-disubstituted benzene), modes that are symmetric with respect to inversion (gerade, 'g') are IR inactive. Only modes that are antisymmetric (ungerade, 'u') can be IR active.\n3.  **Coupling:** The individual C-H wagging motions are not independent. They couple together to form collective normal modes with distinct frequencies. The frequency of the most intense OOP C-H absorption, typically the in-phase motion of a group of adjacent hydrogens, is highly characteristic of the number of hydrogens in that group.\n\nWe will now evaluate each possible substitution pattern against the observed spectrum ($\\tilde{\\nu} = 704\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $778\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and $882\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$).\n\n**A.

The molecule belongs to the $C_{2v}$ point group.\n*   **Expected Spectrum:** Molecules with $5$ adjacent hydrogens typically show two characteristic strong bands in this region:\n    1.  A very strong absorption from the in-phase wagging of the $5$ C-H bonds, usually in the range $770-730\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    2.  Another strong absorption, often attributed to a ring deformation mode, in the range $710-690\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n*   **Analysis:** The observed bands at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 778\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu} = 704\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are consistent with a monosubstituted pattern. However, this pattern does not provide a direct explanation for the third medium-to-strong band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 882\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. While combination or overtone bands can occur, they are typically much weaker, and the problem describes three \"distinct, medium-to-strong\" absorptions. Therefore, this assignment is incomplete.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Ortho-disubstituted benzene**\n\n*   **Structure:** With identical substituents, this pattern has a single block of $4$ adjacent hydrogen atoms. The molecule belongs to the $C_{2v}$ point group.\n*   **Expected Spectrum:** The in-phase OOP wag of the $4$ adjacent hydrogens gives rise to a single characteristic strong absorption, typically in the range $770-735\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n*   **Analysis:** This pattern predicts only one prominent band in the C-H wagging region. The observation of three strong bands is in stark contradiction to this prediction.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Meta-disubstituted benzene**\n\n*   **Structure:** With identical substituents, this pattern possesses two distinct groups of hydrogens: a block of $3$ adjacent hydrogens and a single, isolated hydrogen atom. The molecule belongs to the $C_{2v}$ point group. The lack of equivalence between the C-H environments is key.\n*   **Expected Spectrum:** This structure is expected to show distinct absorptions corresponding to each C-H environment, plus a characteristic ring deformation.\n    1.  **3-Adjacent H's:** The in-phase wagging of this group gives a strong absorption, typically in the range $810-750\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 778\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ fits this perfectly.\n    2.  **Isolated H:** The wagging of an isolated hydrogen atom (flanked by substituents) gives a strong absorption at a higher frequency, typically in the range $900-860\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 882\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a perfect match.\n    3.  **Ring Deformation:** Meta-disubstituted benzenes also typically show a strong OOP ring bending (puckering) mode in the range $725-680\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 704\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is an excellent match for this mode.\n*   **Analysis:** The meta-disubstitution pattern provides a consistent and complete explanation for the number, position, and typical intensity of all three observed bands.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. Para-disubstituted benzene**\n\n*   **Structure:** With identical substituents, this pattern has two equivalent blocks of $2$ adjacent hydrogen atoms. The molecule is highly symmetric, belonging to the $D_{2h}$ point group, which possesses a center of inversion ($i$).\n*   **Expected Spectrum:** The high symmetry has a profound consequence. The most intense potential C-H wagging mode, where all hydrogens move in phase, is symmetric with respect to inversion (type $A_g$) and is therefore **IR-inactive**. The IR-active mode (type $B_{3u}$ in $D_{2h}$), where the two pairs of hydrogens move out-of-phase with each other, gives rise to a single strong absorption, typically in the range $850-800\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n*   **Analysis:** This pattern predicts only one prominent C-H wagging band. The observation of three strong bands is inconsistent with this prediction.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
