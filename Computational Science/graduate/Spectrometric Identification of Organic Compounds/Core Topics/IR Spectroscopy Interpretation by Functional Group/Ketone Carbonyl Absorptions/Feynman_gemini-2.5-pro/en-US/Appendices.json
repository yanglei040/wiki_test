This practice  explores a realistic scenario where an aldehyde's carbonyl ($\\text{C=O}$) absorption is shifted into the typical ketone region due to electronic effects. The exercise will test your ability to look beyond a single band and use corroborating evidence from other spectral regions and techniques to make a definitive structural assignment.",

            "problem": "An analytical team is tasked with assigning the carbonyl functionality of an unknown aromatic compound that shows a strong Infrared (IR) carbonyl band at approximately $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and a weak doublet near $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The compound is known to be conjugated with an aryl ring and to carry a para substituent that is either electron donating or electron withdrawing, but the precise identity of the functional group (aldehyde versus ketone) is unknown. The team is concerned that the apparent carbonyl wavenumber could lead to misassignment, because the measured value lies in a range commonly associated with one functionality but may be attainable by the other under specific electronic conditions. Using first principles applicable to vibrational spectroscopy and bonding, predict how conjugation and substitution can shift an aldehyde carbonyl stretching wavenumber into the range often associated with ketones, and identify the most reliable spectrometric features to confirm the aldehyde assignment and avoid misidentification.\n\nWhich option best captures the correct mechanistic prediction about the shift and the appropriate confirmatory features to prevent misassignment?\n\nA. Conjugation with an aryl $\\pi$ system and an electron-donating para substituent reduce the effective $\\text{C=O}$ force constant by delocalizing $\\pi$ electron density out of the carbonyl, thereby lowering the carbonyl stretching wavenumber into the $1700$–$1685\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region often associated with ketones; the identity can be confirmed by the aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ Fermi doublet as two weak bands around $2820\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, together with a $^{1}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) resonance near $\\delta \\approx 9$–$10\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nB. Electron-withdrawing substitution at the para position reduces electron density at the carbonyl, lowering the effective force constant and shifting an aldehyde carbonyl into the ketone range near $1705\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$; the assignment is best confirmed by the sharper line shape of the carbonyl band and the absence of any bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nC. The dominant origin of the aldehyde versus ketone frequency difference is the reduced mass of the oscillator, which decreases substantially upon replacing an alkyl group with hydrogen and thus lowers the aldehyde frequency; consequently, an aldehyde can readily appear near $1700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the most definitive confirmation is a $^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR carbonyl resonance above $\\delta \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nD. Conjugation with an aryl ring increases the $\\text{C=O}$ force constant by enhancing $\\pi$ bonding, raising the aldehyde frequency into the $1750$–$1780\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region; the identity should be confirmed by an intense overtone series in the $5600$–$6000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ near-IR region rather than by features near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The subject is an unknown aromatic compound.\n-   It exhibits a strong Infrared (IR) carbonyl band at approximately $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n-   It exhibits a weak doublet near $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n-   The carbonyl group is conjugated with an aryl ring.\n-   The aryl ring possesses a para substituent that is either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing.\n-   The functional group identity is unknown, being either an aldehyde or a ketone.\n-   The core task is to explain how an aldehyde's carbonyl stretching frequency could be shifted into a range typically associated with ketones and to identify the most reliable confirmatory spectral features.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is grounded in the fundamental principles of vibrational spectroscopy (specifically, Infrared spectroscopy) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which are standard techniques for organic structure elucidation. The relationship between bond strength (force constant), electronic effects (conjugation, inductive/resonance effects of substituents), and vibrational frequency is a cornerstone of this field. The specified IR absorption values ($1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) are chemically realistic and characteristic of the scenario described. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for a deductive analysis based on established chemical principles. The question asks for a specific mechanistic explanation and the identification of corroborating evidence, which can be uniquely determined from the provided information and background theory.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is objective and uses standard, unambiguous terminology from organic chemistry and spectroscopy. The question requires a factual, evidence-based answer, not a subjective opinion.\n4.  **Flaw Check:**\n    -   **Scientific Unsoundness:** None. The premises are consistent with established spectroscopic theory.\n    -   **Incompleteness/Contradiction:** The provided data are sufficient and self-consistent. The presence of the weak doublet at $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a strong clue, but the problem's framing correctly focuses on explaining the potential ambiguity of the carbonyl stretch *before* using the doublet as confirmation.\n    -   **Unrealistic Data:** The vibrational frequencies are well within plausible ranges for a para-substituted aromatic aldehyde. For instance, benzaldehyde has its $\\text{C=O}$ stretch at $\\approx 1703\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and an electron-donating group would lower this value, making $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ entirely feasible.\n    -   **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, ill-posed, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe vibrational frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ of a bond (in wavenumbers, $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) is described by the harmonic oscillator model:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond (a measure of its stiffness or strength) and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms in the bond. For a $\\text{C=O}$ double bond, a higher force constant (stronger bond) results in a higher stretching frequency, while a lower force constant (weaker bond) results in a lower frequency.\n\n1.  **Baseline Frequencies and Electronic Effects:** In the absence of other effects, a saturated aliphatic aldehyde $\\text{C=O}$ stretch appears at $\\approx 1740-1720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, while a saturated aliphatic ketone is slightly lower at $\\approx 1725-1705\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This small difference is primarily electronic; the two alkyl groups of a ketone are more electron-donating than the single alkyl group and hydrogen of an aldehyde, slightly weakening the $\\text{C=O}$ bond.\n\n2.  **Effect of Conjugation:** The problem states the compound is aromatic, meaning the carbonyl is conjugated with the aryl $\\pi$ system. This allows for resonance delocalization of electron density:\n    $$ \\text{Ar-C(H)=O} \\longleftrightarrow \\text{Ar}^+\\text{=C(H)-O}^- $$\n    The resonance hybrid has a contribution from a structure with a $\\text{C-O}$ single bond. This reduces the overall bond order of the carbonyl group, weakening it. Consequently, the force constant $k$ decreases, and the stretching frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is lowered significantly, typically by $25-40\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This places the typical aryl aldehyde $\\text{C=O}$ stretch in the range of $1710-1685\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and the aryl ketone stretch in the range of $1690-1670\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed value of $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is in the region where these two ranges overlap.\n\n3.  **Effect of Para Substituent on an Aryl Aldehyde:**\n    -   An **electron-donating group (EDG)** at the para position (e.g., $-\\text{OCH}_3$, $-\\text{NR}_2$) pushes electron density into the ring, which can then be further delocalized onto the carbonyl oxygen. This enhances the contribution of the resonance structure with the $\\text{C-O}$ single bond, further weakening the $\\text{C=O}$ bond. This causes an additional decrease in the force constant $k$ and thus a further lowering of $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n    -   An **electron-withdrawing group (EWG)** at the para position (e.g., $-\\text{NO}_2$) pulls electron density from the ring. This makes delocalization of ring electrons onto the carbonyl less favorable. The net effect is an increase in the $\\text{C=O}$ bond order compared to the unsubstituted case, which increases $k$ and raises $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\n    Therefore, for an aryl aldehyde's stretching frequency to be shifted down to $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (a value often seen for aryl ketones), it must be subject to both **conjugation** and the electronic influence of an **electron-donating para substituent**.\n\n4.  **Confirmatory Spectroscopic Features:**\n    -   **IR Spectroscopy:** Aldehydes possess a unique $\\text{C-H}$ bond on the carbonyl carbon. The stretching vibration of this aldehydic proton ($\\text{C}_{\\text{sp}^2}\\text{-H}$) gives rise to a characteristic signal. Due to Fermi resonance with the overtone of the aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ bending vibration, this signal usually appears as a pair of weak to medium intensity bands, one near $2820\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and another near $2720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The problem statement provides data for a weak doublet at $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is a definitive signature of an aldehyde. Ketones, which have the structure $\\text{R-CO-R}'$, lack this specific $\\text{C-H}$ bond and do not show this feature.\n    -   **$^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR Spectroscopy:** The aldehydic proton is highly deshielded due to the magnetic anisotropy of the $\\text{C=O}$ bond and the electronegativity of oxygen. It appears as a very distinct resonance in the far downfield region of the spectrum, typically between $\\delta \\approx 9-10\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This region is typically devoid of other signals, making this a highly diagnostic peak for an aldehyde.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Conjugation with an aryl $\\pi$ system and an electron-donating para substituent reduce the effective $\\text{C=O}$ force constant by delocalizing $\\pi$ electron density out of the carbonyl, thereby lowering the carbonyl stretching wavenumber into the $1700$–$1685\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region often associated with ketones; the identity can be confirmed by the aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ Fermi doublet as two weak bands around $2820\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, together with a $^{1}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) resonance near $\\delta \\approx 9$–$10\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThis option correctly describes the combined effects of conjugation and an electron-donating group in lowering the aldehyde $\\text{C=O}$ frequency by reducing the force constant. The resulting frequency range is correct. Furthermore, it correctly identifies the two most reliable confirmatory features: the aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ Fermi doublet in the IR (and at the correct positions) and the downfield aldehydic proton signal in the $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum. This analysis is fully consistent with the provided data and established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Electron-withdrawing substitution at the para position reduces electron density at the carbonyl, lowering the effective force constant and shifting an aldehyde carbonyl into the ketone range near $1705\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$; the assignment is best confirmed by the sharper line shape of the carbonyl band and the absence of any bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.**\nThis option is incorrect. An electron-withdrawing group *increases* the $\\text{C=O}$ force constant and *raises* the vibrational frequency, contrary to what is stated. It also suggests confirmation by the *absence* of bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, directly contradicting the explicit data given in the problem statement ($2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The dominant origin of the aldehyde versus ketone frequency difference is the reduced mass of the oscillator, which decreases substantially upon replacing an alkyl group with hydrogen and thus lowers the aldehyde frequency; consequently, an aldehyde can readily appear near $1700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the most definitive confirmation is a $^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR carbonyl resonance above $\\delta \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThis option presents multiple flaws. The dominant factor influencing the $\\text{C=O}$ frequency is the electronic environment affecting the force constant $k$, not the reduced mass $\\mu$. A lower reduced mass would *increase*, not decrease, the frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$). Finally, a $^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR resonance above $\\delta \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is characteristic of ketones, not aldehydes (which are typically in the $\\delta \\approx 190-205\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Conjugation with an aryl ring increases the $\\text{C=O}$ force constant by enhancing $\\pi$ bonding, raising the aldehyde frequency into the $1750$–$1780\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region; the identity should be confirmed by an intense overtone series in the $5600$–$6000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ near-IR region rather than by features near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.**\nThis option is fundamentally wrong. Conjugation *lowers* the $\\text{C=O}$ stretching frequency by decreasing the force constant, not increasing it. The suggested frequency range of $1750-1780\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is incorrect for a conjugated aldehyde. It also incorrectly dismisses the highly diagnostic aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ stretching bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Hyperconjugation from alkyl substituents in an aldehyde lowers the reduced mass more than in ketones and therefore shifts aldehyde bands down to $1680\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$; confirmation should rely primarily on the presence of a strong band at $2850\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ attributable to an aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ stretch, since this feature is absent in ketones.**\nThis option contains several errors. The dominant electronic effect in an aromatic system is resonance, not hyperconjugation. Hyperconjugation is an electronic effect and does not alter the reduced mass. Most importantly, the aldehydic $\\text{C-H}$ stretch is characterized as weak-to-medium in intensity and typically appears as a doublet (Fermi doublet), not a single *strong* band at $2850\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

An enol tautomer, by definition, has a $\\text{C=C-OH}$ functional group and lacks a carbonyl ($\\text{C=O}$) group. The term \"enolic $\\text{C=O}$\" is a chemical contradiction. While $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketones show a $\\text{C=O}$ stretch that can be shifted down to ~$1685\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ due to conjugation, this is a different molecule, not an enol tautomer.

Replacing a proton with a deuteron ($H \\rightarrow D$) significantly increases the reduced mass ($\\mu$) of the bond's vibration. Since the vibrational frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$, the $\\text{O-H}$ stretch at ~$3450\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ would shift to a much lower frequency. The reduced mass of $\\text{O-D}$ is roughly twice that of $\\text{O-H}$, so the new frequency would be approximately $3450\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} / \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2440\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which falls in the described $2500$–$2700\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region. This shift moves the peak to a less crowded region of the IR spectrum (the \"deuterium window\"), which can improve measurement accuracy by avoiding overlap with other bands (e.g., $\\text{C-H}$ stretches near $3000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$). The proposed quantitative analysis method, using the Beer-Lambert law for the now-shifted $\\text{O-D}$ band (and/or the $\\text{C=C}$ band) with the necessary \"known $\\epsilon$ values,\" is sound.

First, the molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$, is not a universal constant. It is highly dependent on the molecule, solvent, temperature, and specific band. The $\\text{O-H}$ stretch is particularly sensitive to its chemical environment, and its $\\epsilon$ value and band shape change significantly with hydrogen bonding, which in turn is affected by solvent and concentration. The assumption of a universal, constant $\\epsilon_{\\text{O-H}}$ is invalid. Second, assigning the band near $1620\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to the ketone tautomer is incorrect.

            "problem": "An Infrared (IR) transmission method is proposed to quantify the concentration of a dissolved ketone via its carbonyl stretching band near $1715\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Begin from the fundamental definitions that govern absorption of electromagnetic radiation in homogeneous media: the decadic absorbance defined by $A = \\log_{10}(I_{0}/I)$, where $I_{0}$ is the incident intensity and $I$ is the transmitted intensity, and from the first-order attenuation of a collimated beam due to independent absorbers of concentration $c$ over an optical path length $l$. Using these foundations, derive the linear relationship connecting absorbance to concentration for a single, non-overlapping vibrational band and establish a calibration model that accounts for a non-zero baseline offset. Design a quantitative method, including calibration and uncertainty analysis, suitable for determining the ketone concentration from the carbonyl band.\n\nA transmission IR cell with demountable windows is used, with nominal path length $l = 0.0250\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Five calibration solutions of the ketone in a non-absorbing solvent are prepared gravimetrically and measured after baseline correction. The concentrations $c_{i}$ and corresponding baseline-corrected peak absorbances $A_{i}$ at $1715\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are:\n\n- $c_{1} = 0.050\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$, $A_{1} = 0.211$\n- $c_{2} = 0.100\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$, $A_{2} = 0.407$\n- $c_{3} = 0.150\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$, $A_{3} = 0.613$\n- $c_{4} = 0.200\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$, $A_{4} = 0.804$\n- $c_{5} = 0.250\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$, $A_{5} = 1.015$\n\nAssume the concentration uncertainties of the calibrants are negligible compared to measurement noise in absorbance and baseline, and that the instrument response is linear over this range. The standard uncertainty of each absorbance measurement during calibration is $u(A_{i}) = 0.004$. A baseline offset is present due to residual scatter and window absorption; model this by an intercept in the calibration.\n\nAn unknown sample of the ketone is measured in the same cell and solvent, and its baseline-corrected absorbance at $1715\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $A_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.725$ with standard uncertainty $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = 0.003$. Using a least-squares calibration of absorbance versus concentration, estimate the ketone concentration in the unknown and propagate uncertainties from the calibration (including the correlation between slope and intercept) and the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ into the final concentration uncertainty. You may assume independent noise between calibration and unknown measurements.\n\nRound your final numerical concentration to four significant figures and express it in $\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$. Report only the concentration value as the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and conditions for performing a quantitative analysis using linear regression and uncertainty propagation, based on the fundamental principles of absorption spectroscopy. Therefore, a full solution is provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the linear relationship between absorbance and concentration, followed by a quantitative analysis of an unknown sample using a least-squares calibration, including a full uncertainty propagation.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation, the Beer-Lambert law. The attenuation of a collimated beam of light through a homogeneous absorbing medium is described by the differential equation:\n$$dI = -\\alpha I c \\, dx$$\nwhere $dI$ is the change in intensity $I$ over an infinitesimal path length $dx$, $c$ is the concentration of the absorber, and $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant characteristic of the absorbing species and the wavelength of light. Rearranging and integrating over the full path length $l$ of the sample cell gives:\n$$\\int_{I_{0}}^{I} \\frac{dI}{I} = - \\int_{0}^{l} \\alpha c \\, dx$$\nAssuming a uniform concentration $c$ throughout the path length $l$, the integration yields:\n$$\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_{0}) = -\\alpha c l$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I}\\right) = \\alpha c l$$\nThe problem defines the decadic absorbance $A$ as $A = \\log_{10}(I_{0}/I)$. The natural logarithm ($\\ln$) and decadic logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) are related by $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Substituting this relationship into the equation gives:\n$$\\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I}\\right) = \\alpha c l$$\n$$\\ln(10) A = \\alpha c l$$\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\ln(10)}\\right) c l$$\nDefining the molar absorptivity (or extinction coefficient) as $\\epsilon = \\alpha / \\ln(10)$, we arrive at the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon l c$$\nThis equation predicts a linear relationship between absorbance $A$ and concentration $c$, with a slope of $\\epsilon l$ and an intercept of zero.\n\nThe problem states that a baseline offset exists, which is common due to factors like solvent absorption, cell window scattering, or instrumental effects. Therefore, the calibration model is modified to include an intercept term, $b$:\n$$A_i = m c_i + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope (related to $\\epsilon l$) and $b$ is the absorbance offset.\n\nGiven that the uncertainties in the concentrations $c_i$ are negligible and the uncertainty in each absorbance measurement $A_i$ is constant ($u(A_i) = 0.004$), the most appropriate method to determine the parameters $m$ and $b$ is ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. The OLS method minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical residuals. The best-fit parameters are given by:\n$$m = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\bar{A} - m \\bar{c}$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of calibration points, and we define:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\quad \\quad \\bar{A} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i$$\n$$S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - \\bar{c})^2 = \\sum c_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum c_i)^2}{N}$$\n$$S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - \\bar{c})(A_i - \\bar{A}) = \\sum c_i A_i - \\frac{(\\sum c_i)(\\sum A_i)}{N}$$\n\nWe use the provided calibration data ($N=5$):\n$c_i$ ($\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$): $\\{0.050, 0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250\\}$\n$A_i$: $\\{0.211, 0.407, 0.613, 0.804, 1.015\\}$\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary sums:\n$$\\sum c_i = 0.050 + 0.100 + 0.150 + 0.200 + 0.250 = 0.750\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n$$\\sum A_i = 0.211 + 0.407 + 0.613 + 0.804 + 1.015 = 3.050$$\n$$\\sum c_i^2 = (0.050)^2 + (0.100)^2 + (0.150)^2 + (0.200)^2 + (0.250)^2 = 0.1375\\,\\text{mol}^2\\,\\text{L}^{-2}$$\n$$\\sum c_i A_i = (0.050)(0.211) + (0.100)(0.407) + (0.150)(0.613) + (0.200)(0.804) + (0.250)(1.015) = 0.55775\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the averages and sums of squares:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\frac{0.750}{5} = 0.150\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n$$\\bar{A} = \\frac{3.050}{5} = 0.610$$\n$$S_{xx} = 0.1375 - \\frac{(0.750)^2}{5} = 0.1375 - 0.1125 = 0.0250\\,\\text{mol}^2\\,\\text{L}^{-2}$$\n$$S_{xy} = 0.55775 - \\frac{(0.750)(3.050)}{5} = 0.55775 - 0.4575 = 0.10025\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nNow we can determine the slope $m$ and intercept $b$:\n$$m = \\frac{0.10025}{0.0250} = 4.01\\,\\text{L\\,mol}^{-1}$$\n$$b = 0.610 - (4.01)(0.150) = 0.610 - 0.6015 = 0.0085$$\nThe calibration equation is thus $A = (4.01)c + 0.0085$.\n\nFor the unknown sample with measured absorbance $A_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.725$, its concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is found by inverting the calibration equation:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{u}} - b}{m} = \\frac{0.725 - 0.0085}{4.01} = \\frac{0.7165}{4.01} \\approx 0.178678\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nTo determine the uncertainty in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$, we must propagate the uncertainties from the absorbance measurement of the unknown, $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}})$, and from the calibration parameters $m$ and $b$. The concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is a function of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$, $m$, and $b$. The variance $u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}})$ is given by the law of propagation of uncertainty. Since the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is independent of the calibration process, there is no covariance between $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and the parameters $m$ and $b$. However, $m$ and $b$ are correlated.\nThe general expression for $c_{\\mathrm{u}} = (A_{\\mathrm{u}} - b)/m$ is:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial A_{\\mathrm{u}}}\\right)^2 u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial m}\\right)^2 u^2(m) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 u^2(b) + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial b}\\right)\\mathrm{cov}(m,b)$$\nThis can be simplified into a standard form for inverse prediction from an OLS calibration. The total variance in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is composed of the variance projected from the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and the variance due to the uncertainty of the calibration line itself at that point. Let $\\sigma_A$ be the standard uncertainty of the calibration absorbance measurements, which is given as $\\sigma_A = u(A_i) = 0.004$. The variance of the predicted absorbance on the line for a given concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is $\\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)$. The variance from the measurement of the unknown itself is $u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}})$. These two sources of variance in absorbance are propagated to the concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ by dividing by $m^2$:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\frac{1}{m^2} \\left[ u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) + \\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right) \\right]$$\nWe are given $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = 0.003$ and $\\sigma_A = 0.004$. We substitute the known values:\n$$m = 4.01 \\quad \\quad u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = (0.003)^2 = 9 \\times 10^{-6} \\quad \\quad \\sigma_A^2 = (0.004)^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$N = 5 \\quad \\quad c_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 0.178678 \\quad \\quad \\bar{c} = 0.150 \\quad \\quad S_{xx} = 0.0250$$\nFirst, calculate the term for the calibration uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{(0.178678 - 0.150)^2}{0.0250} = \\frac{(0.028678)^2}{0.0250} \\approx \\frac{8.2243 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.0250} \\approx 0.032897$$\n$$\\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right) = (1.6 \\times 10^{-5}) \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + 0.032897\\right) = (1.6 \\times 10^{-5}) (0.232897) \\approx 3.7264 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nNow, combine with the uncertainty from the unknown measurement:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\frac{1}{(4.01)^2} [9 \\times 10^{-6} + 3.7264 \\times 10^{-6}] = \\frac{12.7264 \\times 10^{-6}}{16.0801} \\approx 7.9144 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{mol}^2\\,\\text{L}^{-2}$$\nThe standard uncertainty in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$u(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\sqrt{7.9144 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 0.0008896\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\nThe result for the concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.178678 \\pm 0.000890\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$. The problem asks for the concentration value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$c_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 0.1787\\,\\text{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\nThis value is consistent with the calculated uncertainty, which affects the fourth decimal place.",
