Upon forming a moderate hydrogen bond to a carbonyl oxygen, the hydroxyl stretch is observed at $3200 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Assume the following:\n\n- The hydroxyl stretching mode can be modeled as a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the effective harmonic force constant, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ for the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ pair.\n- Under the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), isotopic substitution changes only the masses (and therefore the reduced mass) while leaving the electronic potential energy surface unaltered; consequently, hydrogen bonding modifies $k$ by the same fractional amount for both isotopologues $\\mathrm{O-H}$ and $\\mathrm{O-D}$.\n- Neglect anharmonicity and vibrational coupling (e.g., Fermi resonance), and assume the hydrogen bond does not change the bond geometry enough to invalidate the harmonic approximation.\n\nUse the following atomic masses (in unified atomic mass units):\n$m_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825$, $m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102$.\n\nCompute the predicted hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-D}$ stretching wavenumber in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. The assumptions, data, and conditions provided are consistent and sufficient to determine a unique, meaningful solution within the framework of physical chemistry and spectroscopy. The problem is valid.\n\nThe central task is to predict the stretching wavenumber of a deuterium-substituted hydroxyl group ($\\mathrm{O-D}$) participating in a hydrogen bond, given the wavenumbers for the corresponding protiated hydroxyl group ($\\mathrm{O-H}$) in both its free and hydrogen-bonded states. The solution rests on the harmonic oscillator model for a diatomic system and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n\nAccording to the problem, the vibrational stretching mode is modeled as a harmonic oscillator. The wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is given by the expression:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the effective force constant of the bond, $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the oscillator, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThis relationship can be applied to both the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ oscillator and its deuterated isotopologue, the $\\mathrm{O-D}$ oscillator. Let us denote the reduced masses as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}$, respectively. The problem concerns four distinct vibrational states:\n1.  Free $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H, free}} = 3657 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n2.  Hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H, bonded}} = 3200 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n3.  Free $\\mathrm{O-D}$ stretch: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, free}}$ (unknown)\n4.  Hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-D}$ stretch: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}}$ (the quantity to be calculated)\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation posits that the potential energy surface, and thus the force constant $k$, is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, for a given electronic environment (either \"free\" or \"hydrogen-bonded\"), the force constant is the same for both $\\mathrm{O-H}$ and $\\mathrm{O-D}$.\n\nLet us compare the hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch to the hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-D}$ stretch. Let the force constant for the hydrogen-bonded state be $k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}$. The corresponding wavenumbers are:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H, bonded}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} $$\nBy taking the ratio of these two equations, the unknown terms $\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}$ are eliminated:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H, bonded}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bonded}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} $$\nThis elegant result shows that the ratio of the vibrational frequencies for two isotopologues depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their reduced masses. The additional information about the free hydroxyl stretch and the assumption that hydrogen bonding modifies $k$ by the same fractional amount for both isotopologues are consistent with this direct approach and would be required if the problem were posed differently, but are not necessary for the most direct solution path. The relationship holds irrespective of the specific bonding environment (free or hydrogen-bonded), as long as we compare the two isotopes within the same environment.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the desired quantity, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}}$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H, bonded}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} $$\nFirst, we must calculate the reduced masses using the given atomic masses: $m_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825$, and $m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102$. The units are unified atomic mass units ($\\mathrm{u}$), which will cancel in the ratio.\n\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ oscillator is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(15.999)(1.007825)}{15.999 + 1.007825} = \\frac{16.124192175}{17.006825} \\approx 0.9481050 \\; \\mathrm{u} $$\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O-D}$ oscillator is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{(15.999)(2.014102)}{15.999 + 2.014102} = \\frac{32.223617898}{18.013102} \\approx 1.7889154 \\; \\mathrm{u} $$\nNow we compute the ratio of the reduced masses:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}} \\approx \\frac{0.9481050}{1.7889154} \\approx 0.5299893 $$\nThe square root of this ratio is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5299893} \\approx 0.7280036 $$\nFinally, we calculate the predicted hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{O-D}$ stretching wavenumber:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}} = (3200 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}) \\times 0.7280036 \\approx 2329.6115 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D, bonded}} \\approx 2330 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nThe trailing zero is significant in this representation.",

The physical constants are Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$, and the speed of light, $c = 2.99792458\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- The wavenumber shift in units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h c}\n$$\n- This is converted to the conventional spectroscopic unit of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ by dividing by $100$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}}{100}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Final Shifted Wavenumber**\nThe final shifted wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{new}}$, is obtained by adding the calculated shift to the initial unperturbed wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{new}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe result for each test case is then rounded to three decimal places as required. This algorithm is applied to each of the five test cases provided.",
