One of the most rigorous methods for confirming an assignment is to leverage the effect of isotopic substitution. This practice challenges you to apply the harmonic oscillator model quantitatively to predict the observable fine structure of a carbon-chlorine stretch arising from the natural abundance of $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ and $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ isotopes. By mastering this, you will learn to make precise, falsifiable predictions based on fundamental physical principles, transforming a tentative assignment into a confirmed structural feature .",

You aim to confirm the C–Cl assignment specifically by resolving the fine structure induced by the two naturally occurring chlorine isotopes, $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ and $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$.

The effect of isotopic substitution on vibrational frequency via the reduced mass is a well-established phenomenon. The provided atomic masses and natural abundances are accurate. The vibrational frequency of $\\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a typical value for a C–Cl stretch. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary information (masses, abundances, a model) to calculate the expected isotopic shift and intensity ratio, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. It asks for a specific, identifiable experimental outcome.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is phrased using precise, quantitative, and objective scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous analysis. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe vibrational frequency, expressed in wavenumbers ($\\tilde{\\nu}$), of a diatomic harmonic oscillator is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the force constant of the bond, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system.\n\nFor a C–Cl bond, the reduced mass $\\mu$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{C}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}{m_{\\mathrm{C}} + m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}} $$\nA critical assumption in isotopic substitution analysis is that the force constant $k$ is determined by the electronic structure of the bond and is therefore independent of the nuclear masses of the constituent atoms. Thus, $k$ is the same for the C–$\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ and C–$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ bonds.\n\nThe ratio of the vibrational wavenumbers for the two isotopologues is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}}{\\mu_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}}} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced masses for the two isotopologues in atomic mass units ($\\mathrm{u}$).\nFor C–$\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$:\n$$ \\mu_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot m_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}}{m_{\\mathrm{C}} + m_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}} = \\frac{(12.000000)(34.968853)}{12.000000 + 34.968853}\\,\\mathrm{u} = \\frac{419.626236}{46.968853}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 8.934141\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nFor C–$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$:\n$$ \\mu_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot m_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}}{m_{\\mathrm{C}} + m_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}} = \\frac{(12.000000)(36.965903)}{12.000000 + 36.965903}\\,\\mathrm{u} = \\frac{443.590836}{48.965903}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 9.059235\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n\nAs expected, the reduced mass for the bond with the heavier isotope, $\\mu_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}$, is greater than for the bond with the lighter isotope, $\\mu_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}$. Since $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$, the C–$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ bond will vibrate at a lower wavenumber than the C–$\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ bond.\n\nNow, we can predict the wavenumber for the C–$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ stretch, assuming the C–$\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ stretch is the dominant contributor to the observed band at $\\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Let's set $\\tilde{\\nu}_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}}}{\\mu_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}}}} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{8.934141}{9.059235}} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times \\sqrt{0.986191} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times 0.993072 \\approx 705.08\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe expected wavenumber separation is:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 705.08\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 4.92\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nSo, we expect a doublet with a splitting of approximately $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, with the C–$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ peak appearing at a lower wavenumber.\n\nNext, we consider the relative intensities of the two absorption bands. In a natural-abundance sample, the integrated intensity of each peak is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding isotopologue, which is determined by the natural isotopic abundance.\nThe ratio of the integrated intensities will be:\n$$ \\frac{I(^{35}\\mathrm{Cl})}{I(^{37}\\mathrm{Cl})} = \\frac{p(^{35}\\mathrm{Cl})}{p(^{37}\\mathrm{Cl})} \\approx \\frac{0.758}{0.242} \\approx 3.13 $$\nThis corresponds to an intensity ratio of roughly $3.1 : 1$.\n\nFinally, we consider the experimental conditions necessary to observe this fine structure. To resolve two peaks separated by $\\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the instrumental resolution must be significantly better than this separation. A resolution of $4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ would be insufficient, while a resolution of $\\leq 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ would be more than adequate. Furthermore, in the condensed phase, vibrational bands are subject to various broadening mechanisms (e.g., intermolecular interactions, lifetime broadening), which can obscure fine details. Recording the spectrum at cryogenic temperatures narrows these bands by reducing thermal motion and intermolecular collisions, thereby facilitating the resolution of closely spaced peaks.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Record a high-resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrum at cryogenic temperature to minimize homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, using a natural-abundance sample containing both $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$ and $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$. With instrumental resolution $\\leq 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, expect a resolvable doublet near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with the heavier $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ component at lower wavenumber by approximately $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and integrated intensity ratio reflecting isotopic fractions of roughly $3.1:1$ for $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$:$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$.**\n-   **Experimental Design:** Proposes high resolution ($\\leq 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) and cryogenic temperature. This is the correct approach to resolve fine structure.\n-   **Spectral Outcome:** Predicts a doublet (correct for two isotopes).\n-   **Frequency Shift:** Predicts the heavier $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ is at lower wavenumber (correct) by $\\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (matches our calculation of $4.92\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$).\n-   **Intensity Ratio:** Predicts a ratio of roughly $3.1:1$ (matches our calculation of $3.13$).\n-   **Verdict:** This option accurately describes both the necessary experimental conditions and the correct theoretical predictions. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use standard-resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) at room temperature with instrumental resolution of about $4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and do not vary isotopic composition; then rely on the mass-spectrometric isotope pattern alone to confirm the C–Cl assignment, as the infrared band will remain a single unresolved feature.**\n-   **Experimental Design:** Proposes standard resolution ($4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) at room temperature. This resolution is insufficient to resolve a $\\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ splitting, and room temperature conditions would further broaden the bands.\n-   **Conclusion:** It correctly concludes the band would be unresolved but then defaults to a different technique (mass spectrometry), failing to answer the question of how to use IR spectroscopy for this purpose. The goal of the problem is to design an IR experiment that *succeeds*, not one that fails.\n-   **Verdict:** This option proposes an inadequate experiment and evades the central question. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Prepare a $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$-enriched sample and record a high-resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrum at low temperature. Expect two lines near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 710\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with the $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ component shifted to higher wavenumber by approximately $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and an intensity ratio near $1:3$ for $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$:$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ under natural-abundance conditions.**\n-   **Frequency Shift:** This option claims the $\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$ component is shifted to *higher* wavenumber. This contradicts the fundamental principle that a larger reduced mass leads to a *lower* vibrational frequency. This is a critical scientific error.\n-   **Intensity Ratio:** It claims a natural abundance ratio of $1:3$ for $\\mathrm{^{35}Cl}$:$\\mathrm{^{37}Cl}$, which is the inverse of the correct ratio ($3.1:1$). It also nonsensically applies a natural-abundance ratio to an isotopically enriched sample.\n-   **Verdict:** This option contains multiple fundamental errors of fact and principle. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Replace chlorine with bromine and then collect a Raman spectrum to observe isotopic fine structure; predict a triplet with separations $\\approx 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and intensity ratio $1:2:1$, which confirms a C–Cl band indirectly by analogy to the C–Br region in the fingerprint window.**\n-   **Experimental Design:** Proposes chemical substitution (Cl to Br) and a different technique (Raman). This does not confirm the C–Cl assignment in the original molecule; it analyzes a different molecule.\n-   **Spectral Outcome:** It incorrectly predicts a triplet. Bromine has two major isotopes ($^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ and $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$), which would produce a *doublet*. The $1:2:1$ intensity ratio is characteristic of species with two equivalent atoms of a certain type (e.g., two Cl atoms in a molecule's mass spectrum), not a single C-Br bond's vibrational spectrum.\n-   **Verdict:** The proposed experiment is irrelevant to the stated goal, and the predicted outcome is scientifically baseless. **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis is that Option A is the only one that is scientifically sound and correctly describes the experiment and its expected outcome.",

A solution will be derived by analyzing each option.\n\n### Principal-Based Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is evaluating the validity of arguments based on \"negative evidence\"—the absence of expected spectral bands. Such arguments are only valid if the band in question is predicted to be both (a) characteristic of the functional group or structure being ruled out and (b) intense enough to be easily observed above the noise floor of the instrument. The given experimental conditions, particularly the high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{S/N} > 2000$) and low noise floor ($0.1\\,\\%$ transmittance), are excellent and imply that any absorption with even a modest transition dipole moment integral would be detectable. Therefore, the absence of a band can be powerful evidence if the band is known to be inherently strong.\n\nFrom the positive evidence, a preliminary structural hypothesis can be formed:\n1.  The aromatic nature is confirmed by bands at $1600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n2.  The single, strong $\\mathrm{C=O}$ band at $1735\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is highly indicative of an ester.\n3.  The two strong bands at $1245\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1035\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric $\\mathrm{C-O-C}$ stretches of an ester, respectively, which supports the ester hypothesis.\n4.  The strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ combined with the declared absence of bands in the $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region is a classic pattern for para-disubstitution on an aromatic ring.\n\nThus, the unknown is likely a para-disubstituted aromatic ester. We will now evaluate each option against this background and fundamental spectroscopic principles.\n\n**A. Using the absence of intense bands at $1540$–$1560\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1340$–$1380\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out an aromatic nitro group, because the antisymmetric and symmetric $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ stretches are strongly IR-allowed in this window and would be observed at the stated resolution and $\\mathrm{S/N}$ unless severely overlapped or chemically transformed.**\n\nThe nitro group, $-\\mathrm{NO_2}$, possesses two characteristic stretching vibrations: the antisymmetric stretch ($\\nu_{as}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$) and the symmetric stretch ($\\nu_{s}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$). For aromatic nitro compounds, $\\nu_{as}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$ typically appears between $1550$–$1490\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\nu_{s}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$ between $1355$–$1315\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The ranges specified in the option ($1540$–$1560\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1340$–$1380\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) are correct diagnostic windows. Crucially, both stretching modes involve a very large change in dipole moment due to the high polarity of the $\\mathrm{N-O}$ bonds. As a result, they are typically two of the most intense absorptions in an IR spectrum. Given the high S/N ratio and low noise floor ($0.1\\,\\%$ transmittance means a band of just $0.23\\,\\%$ absorbance would be detectable at S/N of 2), it is inconceivable that two such strong bands would be \"not detectable\". The possibility of severe overlap is minimal for *both* bands, as they are well-separated from each other and from other strong bands in the spectrum. Therefore, their absence is exceptionally strong evidence for the absence of a nitro group. The reasoning is sound and represents a textbook application of negative evidence.\n\n*Verdict:* **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using the absence of bands at $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, together with the presence of a strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, to rule out meta-disubstitution on the ring and to support para-disubstitution, because the out-of-plane $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bending pattern is substitution-sensitive and IR-allowed.**\n\nThe out-of-plane (OOP) $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bending vibrations in the $900$–$675\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region are highly reliable for determining the substitution pattern on an aromatic ring. The number and position of these strong bands are determined by the number of adjacent hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n-   *Para-disubstitution* (two sets of two adjacent H's) characteristically shows one strong band in the $860$–$800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range. The observed strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ fits this pattern perfectly.\n-   *Meta-disubstitution* (one set of three adjacent H's and one isolated H) typically shows a strong band from the three-adjacent-H-bend in the $780$–$750\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range and another strong band from a C-C ring pucker in the $710$–$690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range.\n-   *Ortho-disubstitution* (one set of four adjacent H's) shows a strong band in the $770$–$735\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range.\nThe problem explicitly states there are \"No significant peaks at $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". This negative evidence effectively rules out ortho- and meta-disubstitution. This, combined with the positive evidence of the strong $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band, provides a very strong case for para-disubstitution. The reasoning presented in the option is entirely correct and standard practice.\n\n*Verdict:* **Correct**.\n\n**C. Using the absence of an IR band near $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out para-disubstitution on the ring, because the ring-breathing mode is diagnostic of para-disubstitution and must appear in IR if present.**\n\nThis statement concerns the \"ring-breathing\" mode, a totally symmetric in-plane vibration of the benzene skeleton. For unsubstituted benzene ($D_{6h}$ symmetry), this mode occurs at $992\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and is IR-inactive by symmetry ($\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}/\\partial Q = 0$), although it is the strongest band in the Raman spectrum. In a para-disubstituted ring, the symmetry is lowered (e.g., to $C_{2v}$ if substituents differ, or $D_{2h}$ if they are identical). In the $D_{2h}$ case, the mode remains IR-inactive. In the $C_{2v}$ case, it becomes formally IR-allowed. However, because the vibration is still fundamentally a symmetric motion of the carbon ring, the change in dipole moment is typically very small. Consequently, the ring-breathing mode is characteristically **weak or absent** in the IR spectrum, even when formally allowed. Its diagnostic power lies in Raman spectroscopy, where it is strong. The assertion that this mode \"must appear in IR if present\" is fundamentally incorrect. Using its absence to *rule out* para-disubstitution is a grave misinterpretation of spectroscopic selection rules.\n\n*Verdict:* **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Using the absence of a single band near $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out an aryl ester, because the aryl–oxygen $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!O}$ stretch is uniquely localized and cannot be shifted or intensity-borrowed outside this narrow window by coupling.**\n\nThis option contains two critical flaws.\nFirst, the premise of the argument is factually incorrect based on the provided data. The argument is based on the \"absence of a single band near $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". However, the problem statement explicitly lists a \"strong band at $1245\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". This band lies squarely within the specified $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ window. Therefore, the argument is self-contradictory.\nSecond, the underlying principle invoked is flawed. The claim that any stretch in the fingerprint region is \"uniquely localized\" and \"cannot be shifted or intensity-borrowed\" is an oversimplification that ignores the fundamental nature of this spectral region. As stated in the problem's own given principles, \"fingerprint region bands arise from coupled skeletal motions\". Single bond stretches like $\\mathrm{C-O}$ and $\\mathrm{C-C}$ are of similar energy to bending modes and therefore couple extensively. This means their frequencies and intensities are sensitive to the overall molecular structure, not fixed in a narrow window. While the Ar-O stretch of an aryl ester (Ar-O-C(=O)R) is indeed a useful diagnostic band, often found strong around $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, it is not an immutable, isolated vibration. The reasoning is invalid on both factual and theoretical grounds.\n\n*Verdict:* **Incorrect**.",

You are tasked with designing a sequence of experiments to unambiguously assign which portion of this composite band arises from the sulfoxide sulfur–oxygen stretch and which arises from an ether carbon–oxygen stretch, using only first principles of vibrational spectroscopy, standard complementary spectroscopies, and chemoselective transformations. Consider feasibility, selectivity, and the ability to make quantitative, testable predictions before any data are collected. Which option below most robustly enables disambiguation?\n\nA. Record a Raman spectrum, then selectively reduce the sulfoxide to the corresponding sulfide under conditions that do not cleave ethers (e.g., a single-electron transfer reducing system such as titanium(III) chloride in coordinating solvent).

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- An unknown organic sample is suspected to contain both a sulfoxide functionality ($\\mathrm{S=O}$) and an aliphatic ether functionality ($\\mathrm{C-O-C}$).\n- The FTIR spectrum exhibits a broad, composite absorption band centered near $1050\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n- The spectral region of interest is the fingerprint region, defined as $600$–$1500\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n- The goal is to design an experimental sequence to unambiguously assign the contributions of the sulfoxide sulfur–oxygen stretch and the ether carbon–oxygen stretch to this composite band.\n- The methods must adhere to first principles of vibrational spectroscopy, involve standard complementary spectroscopies, and utilize chemoselective transformations.\n- The evaluation criteria for the experimental design are feasibility, selectivity, and the ability to make quantitative, testable predictions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The premise is sound. Sulfoxide ($\\mathrm{S=O}$) stretching absorptions are strong and typically found in the $1030$–$1070\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Aliphatic ether ($\\mathrm{C-O-C}$) asymmetric stretching absorptions are also strong and typically appear in the $1070$–$1150\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range, but structural variations can shift this band to lower wavenumbers, making an overlap with the sulfoxide band at $1050\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ plausible. The problem represents a realistic challenge in spectroscopic analysis. The proposed categories of methods (spectroscopy, chemical reactions) are standard in chemical structure elucidation.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the evaluation and selection of the *most robust* experimental plan from a given set of options, based on clearly stated criteria. A unique, best option is expected.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with a full analysis of the options.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Options\n\nThe fundamental challenge is to deconvolute two overlapping vibrational bands. An ideal solution will selectively perturb one functional group while leaving the other unaffected, leading to a predictable change in the infrared spectrum that allows for unambiguous assignment. The vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, is given by the harmonic oscillator approximation:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the bond force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating atoms. A successful experiment will selectively modify either $k$ or $\\mu$ for only one of the two functional groups.\n\n**Option A: Analysis**\nThis option proposes a sophisticated, multi-step approach:\n1.  **Raman Spectroscopy:** The sulfoxide $\\mathrm{S=O}$ bond is highly polarizable and thus gives a strong Raman signal. The ether $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bond is less polarizable. While this can provide supporting evidence based on relative intensities, it is not definitive by itself for deconvoluting an overlapped band.\n2.  **Chemoselective Reduction:** Sulfoxides ($\\mathrm{R_2S=O}$) are known to be selectively reduced to sulfides ($\\mathrm{R_2S}$) using reagents like titanium(III) chloride ($\\mathrm{TiCl_3}$). Ethers are chemically inert under these mild reducing conditions. This step is highly selective. Upon reduction, the $\\mathrm{S=O}$ bond is eliminated, and therefore its characteristic stretching vibration must vanish from the IR spectrum. The portion of the composite band at $1050\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ that disappears can be definitively assigned to the sulfoxide.\n3.  **Isotopic Labeling and Re-oxidation:** The sulfide product is re-oxidized to the sulfoxide using an $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labeled oxidant. This recreates the sulfoxide functionality, but with an isotopically heavier oxygen atom ($^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ vs. $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$).\n4.  **Prediction of Frequency Shift:** This isotopic substitution increases the reduced mass of the oscillator. Let's calculate the expected shift. The reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{S-O}$ bond is $\\mu = \\frac{m_S m_O}{m_S + m_O}$. Using atomic masses $m(^{32}\\mathrm{S}) \\approx 31.97\\ \\mathrm{u}$, $m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 15.99\\ \\mathrm{u}$, and $m(^{18}\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 18.00\\ \\mathrm{u}$:\n    $$ \\mu(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = \\frac{31.97 \\times 15.99}{31.97 + 15.99} \\approx 10.66\\ \\mathrm{u} $$\n    $$ \\mu(^{18}\\mathrm{O}) = \\frac{31.97 \\times 18.00}{31.97 + 18.00} \\approx 11.51\\ \\mathrm{u} $$\n    The ratio of the new frequency ($\\nu_{18}$) to the original frequency ($\\nu_{16}$) is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\nu_{18}}{\\nu_{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu(^{16}\\mathrm{O})}{\\mu(^{18}\\mathrm{O})}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{10.66}{11.51}} \\approx 0.963 $$\n    If the original sulfoxide band is at $1050\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the new band is predicted to appear at $1050 \\times 0.963 \\approx 1011\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is a large, predictable, and quantitative downshift of approximately $39\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which would be easily observable. The ether band would remain unshifted.\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound, relies on fundamental principles, and provides multiple, unambiguous, falsifiable tests. It is an exemplary method for spectroscopic assignment.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Analysis**\nThis option proposes using an acid titration. Both ether and sulfoxide oxygens are Lewis basic and can be protonated by a strong acid like trifluoroacetic acid. Sulfoxide oxygens are generally considered more basic than ether oxygens. Therefore, the statement \"assuming sulfoxide is less perturbed by acid than ether\" is likely incorrect, undermining the proposed logic. Since both functional groups will interact with the acid, both of their corresponding vibrational bands are expected to shift. Differentiating them based on the *magnitude* of the shift is qualitative and ambiguous, not a robust or quantitative method. This approach lacks the required selectivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Analysis**\nThis option combines unrelated techniques.\n1.  **Proton NMR:** $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$ NMR can confirm the presence of protons alpha to an ether oxygen (typically $\\delta = 3.3-4.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$) and protons alpha to a sulfoxide group (typically $\\delta = 2.5-3.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$). While NMR can confirm the existence of both functionalities in the molecule, it provides no direct link to assign specific vibrational absorptions in the IR spectrum.\n2.  **DSC:** Differential Scanning Calorimetry measures thermal properties. There is no direct, principled way to correlate a thermal transition with the frequency of a specific bond vibration.\nThe final step, \"correlate these data qualitatively,\" is scientifically weak and does not constitute a rigorous method for assignment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Analysis**\nThis option suggests hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange. The key premise is that protons on the carbon alpha to an ether oxygen ($\\alpha$-protons) are acidic enough to be exchanged in a basic deuterated solvent. This is chemically false. The pKa of such protons is typically greater than $40$, meaning they are not acidic and will not exchange under such conditions. While protons $\\alpha$ to a sulfoxide are more acidic (pKa $\\approx 35$), they still require a very strong base for deprotonation. The proposed chemical transformation is not feasible as described. Furthermore, the assumption of a strong, predictable coupling between the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ stretch and $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bending modes that would lead to a large, assignable shift upon deuteration is speculative. This method is based on a flawed chemical premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Analysis**\nThis option proposes using polarized ATR-FTIR. This technique (dichroism) can reveal information about the orientation of transition dipole moments, but *only if the sample molecules are ordered* at the ATR crystal interface. For a typical bulk sample of a small organic molecule (either as a neat liquid or cast film from a solution), the molecules are randomly oriented. In such a case, no polarization dependence would be observed for either band. The method's success hinges on an unsubstantiated and unlikely assumption of molecular ordering, making it not a robust or generally applicable technique for this purpose.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A describes the most scientifically rigorous and robust plan. It employs a highly chemoselective reaction to remove one functional group, allowing for a definitive assignment by subtraction. It then confirms this assignment with a second, elegant experiment using isotopic labeling, which produces a large and quantitatively predictable frequency shift. This multi-pronged approach provides unambiguous and falsifiable evidence, perfectly satisfying the problem's requirements.",
