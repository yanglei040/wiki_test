            "problem": "In spectrometric identification of aromatic compounds, out-of-plane carbon–hydrogen bending vibrations in benzene derivatives serve as diagnostic markers for substitution patterns because they are sensitive to the local mass distribution while largely preserving the same local restoring force when isotopically substituted. Consider a para-disubstituted benzene whose out-of-plane carbon–hydrogen bend is observed at a wavenumber of $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}} = 825\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ in Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Assume the bending coordinate can be modeled as a small-amplitude harmonic motion of the hydrogen (or its isotopologue deuterium) relative to a rigid aromatic ring treated as an effective mass. The potential near equilibrium is quadratic with a force constant $k$ that is unchanged by isotopic substitution, and the kinetic term is governed by the reduced mass of a two-body system composed of the atom $X \\in \\{\\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{D}\\}$ and the ring.\n\nUse the fundamental definition of reduced mass for a two-body system and the harmonic oscillator model to derive the dependence of the vibrational wavenumber on the reduced mass, then estimate the expected isotopic shift upon deuteration. Take the effective mass of the ring to be $M_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 72.00\\ \\mathrm{u}$, the hydrogen mass $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{u}$, and the deuterium mass $m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102\\ \\mathrm{u}$, where $\\mathrm{u}$ denotes the atomic mass unit.

Round your final shift to four significant figures. Express the final answer in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of vibrational spectroscopy and the harmonic oscillator model, is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the vibrational wavenumber for a deuterated C-D bond, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}}$, and the corresponding isotopic shift, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$, based on the observed wavenumber for the C-H bond, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}}$. The analysis is based on the harmonic oscillator model.\n\nThe angular frequency, $\\omega$, of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by the relation:\n$$ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond (representing the stiffness of the spring) and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system.\n\nThe vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, is related to the angular frequency by $\\omega = 2\\pi\\nu$. The wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is related to the frequency by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Combining these relationships, we can express the wavenumber as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nThe problem states that the motion can be modeled as a two-body system consisting of the atom $X$ (where $X$ is either hydrogen, $\\mathrm{H}$, or deuterium, $\\mathrm{D}$) and the effective mass of the aromatic ring, $M_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The reduced mass, $\\mu$, for a two-body system with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$\nFor the C-H system, the reduced mass, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}$, is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nFor the C-D system, the reduced mass, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}$, is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nThe corresponding wavenumbers are:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}}} $$\nA key assumption in isotopic substitution problems is that the electronic structure, and thus the potential energy surface, remains unchanged. This implies that the force constant $k$ is the same for both the C-H and C-D bonds.\n\nTo find the relationship between the two wavenumbers, we can take their ratio. This conveniently cancels the unknown force constant $k$ and the physical constants $2$, $\\pi$, and $c$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}}} $$\nThis equation shows that the wavenumber is inversely proportional to the square root of the reduced mass. We can now solve for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}}$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}}} $$\nLet's substitute the expressions for the reduced masses into the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}} = \\frac{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\cdot \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}} M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\cdot \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given mass values:\n$m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n$m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 72.00\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{D}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{2.014102 + 72.00}{1.007825 + 72.00} = \\frac{74.014102}{73.007825} \\approx 1.013783 $$\nNext, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{1.007825}{2.014102} \\approx 0.5003842 $$\nNow we find the ratio of the reduced masses:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{CD}}} = (0.5003842) \\cdot (1.013783) \\approx 0.5072833 $$\nThe ratio of the wavenumbers is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CD}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}}} = \\sqrt{0.5072833} \\approx 0.7122382 $$\nWe are given $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CH}} = 825\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.

The heavier deuterium atom leads to a lower vibrational frequency, resulting in a downward shift (a shift to lower wavenumber) in the spectrum.",

All givens and assumptions are standard and correct. The values for frequencies and depolarization ratios are physically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The data provided are sufficient to deduce the symmetry of the molecule, which in turn constrains the possible substitution patterns. A unique and meaningful conclusion can be reached.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws from the invalidity checklist. It is a valid, well-formulated problem in chemical spectroscopy.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe most powerful piece of information is Observation 4, which states that across the vibrational spectrum, \"bands that are strong in the Raman spectrum are absent in the FTIR spectrum and vice versa.\" This is a textbook description of the **rule of mutual exclusion**.\n\nAs stated in Assumption (iii), the rule of mutual exclusion is a direct consequence of a molecule possessing a center of inversion symmetry ($i$). Molecules with an inversion center belong to a **centrosymmetric point group**. In such groups, vibrational normal modes are classified as either symmetric with respect to inversion (gerade, subscript $g$) or antisymmetric with respect to inversion (ungerade, subscript $u$).\n-   Gerade ($g$) modes are Raman-active and FTIR-inactive.\n-   Ungerade ($u$) modes are FTIR-active and Raman-inactive.\n\nTherefore, the unknown derivative must belong to a centrosymmetric point group. We must now examine the point groups of the molecular structures proposed in the options.\n\nA. **$1,4$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents**: For example, $p$-xylene or $p$-dichlorobenzene. This structure has $D_{2h}$ symmetry. The $D_{2h}$ point group contains an inversion center $i$. Thus, this molecule is **centrosymmetric**.\n\nB. **$1,2$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents**: For example, $o$-xylene. This structure has $C_{2v}$ symmetry. The $C_{2v}$ point group ($E, C_2, \\sigma_v, \\sigma_v'$) does not contain an inversion center. This molecule is **not centrosymmetric**.\n\nC. **$1,3$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents**: For example, $m$-xylene. This structure also has $C_{2v}$ symmetry and is **not centrosymmetric**.\n\nD. **Monosubstituted benzene**: For example, chlorobenzene. If the substituent has axial symmetry (like -Cl), the point group is $C_{2v}$. If the substituent is asymmetric (like -CHDBr), the point group is $C_s$. Neither $C_{2v}$ nor $C_s$ is centrosymmetric.\n\nE. **$1,4$-disubstituted benzene with different substituents**: For example, $p$-chlorotoluene. An inversion operation through the center of the ring would interchange the two different substituents, meaning the molecule is not superimposable on itself. The molecule is **not centrosymmetric**. Its point group is typically $C_{2v}$ (if substituents are symmetric) or lower.\n\nBased on the requirement of mutual exclusion (Observation 4), only option A, which describes a molecule with $D_{2h}$ symmetry, is a viable candidate. The other options describe non-centrosymmetric molecules, for which the rule of mutual exclusion does not hold; in those point groups (e.g., $C_{2v}$), many vibrational modes are active in both Raman and FTIR spectra, which contradicts Observation 4.\n\nWe must now verify that the $D_{2h}$ structure is consistent with the remaining observations.\n\n-   **Observation 1 (Splitting of the $E_{2g}$ mode)**: The parent molecule, benzene, has $D_{6h}$ symmetry. Upon substitution to a $1,4$-disubstituted pattern with identical substituents, the symmetry is lowered to $D_{2h}$. We need to determine how the doubly degenerate $E_{2g}$ representation of $D_{6h}$ transforms under this symmetry reduction. Using a correlation table for the $D_{6h} \\to D_{2h}$ reduction, the $E_{2g}$ irreducible representation correlates to two one-dimensional representations:\n    $$ E_{2g} (D_{6h}) \\to A_g(D_{2h}) + B_{1g}(D_{2h}) $$\n    This means the original doubly degenerate vibrational mode splits into two non-degenerate modes. This is perfectly consistent with Observation 1, which reports the appearance of two distinct bands at $1602\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1588\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n-   **Observation 2 (Polarization)**: The two new modes have symmetries $A_g$ and $B_{1g}$. According to Raman selection rules (Assumption iv):\n    -   The $A_g$ representation is the totally symmetric representation in the $D_{2h}$ point group. Vibrations of this symmetry must give rise to **polarized** Raman lines (low $\\rho$).\n    -   The $B_{1g}$ representation is not totally symmetric. Vibrations of this symmetry must give rise to **depolarized** Raman lines. For non-totally symmetric, non-cubic groups, the theoretical value is $\\rho = 3/4 = 0.75$.\n    Observation 2 reports one line at $1602\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ with $\\rho \\approx 0.05$ (polarized) and another at $1588\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ with $\\rho \\approx 0.72$ (depolarized). This matches the predictions perfectly. We can assign the $1602\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band to the $A_g$ mode and the $1588\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band to the $B_{1g}$ mode.\n\n-   **Observation 3 (FTIR Inactivity)**: The two new modes have symmetries $A_g$ and $B_{1g}$. The '$g$' subscript (gerade) indicates that they are symmetric with respect to inversion. In a centrosymmetric group, only ungerade ($u$) modes are FTIR-active. Therefore, both the $A_g$ and $B_{1g}$ modes are predicted to be **FTIR-inactive**. This is perfectly consistent with Observation 3, which reports no measurable absorption at these frequencies.\n\nAll four observations are fully and uniquely explained if the molecule has $D_{2h}$ symmetry, which corresponds to a $1,4$-disubstituted benzene derivative with identical substituents.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **$1,4$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents (point group $D_{2h}$)**: This structure is centrosymmetric ($D_{2h}$), consistent with the observed mutual exclusion (Observation 4). The symmetry lowering $D_{6h} \\to D_{2h}$ correctly predicts the splitting of the $E_{2g}$ mode into one totally symmetric ($A_g$) and one non-totally symmetric ($B_{1g}$) mode. This explains the two Raman bands (Observation 1), their polarization properties (Observation 2), and their inactivity in the FTIR spectrum (Observation 3).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. **$1,2$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents (point group $C_{2v}$)**: This structure is non-centrosymmetric. The rule of mutual exclusion does not apply. Vibrational modes can be, and generally are, active in both Raman and FTIR. For example, the $E_{2g}$ mode would split into $A_1 + B_2$ modes in $C_{2v}$ (for a specific axis choice). Both $A_1$ and $B_2$ modes are active in both Raman and FTIR. This directly contradicts Observations 3 and 4.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. **$1,3$-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents (point group $C_{2v}$)**: Similar to option B, this structure has $C_{2v}$ symmetry and is non-centrosymmetric. The predictions for spectroscopic activity are the same as for option B, contradicting the experimental data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. **Monosubstituted benzene (point group $C_{2v}$ or $C_{s}$)**: These structures are non-centrosymmetric. They are ruled out by the same reasoning as options B and C; the rule of mutual exclusion would not hold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nE. **$1,4$-disubstituted benzene with different substituents (commonly $C_{2v}$)**: This structure lacks an inversion center because inverting through the ring's center would swap two non-identical groups. The molecule is non-centrosymmetric and therefore ruled out by the same reasoning as options B, C, and D.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The eigenstates $|\\psi_a\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_b\\rangle$ are linear combinations of the unperturbed states:\n$$\n|\\psi_a\\rangle = c_{1a}|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_{2a}|\\psi_2\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n|\\psi_b\\rangle = c_{1b}|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_{2b}|\\psi_2\\rangle\n$$\nThe transition moments for the observed bands are $M_a = c_{1a}M_1 + c_{2a}M_2$ and $M_b = c_{1b}M_1 + c_{2b}M_2$. Since the combination band is IR-inactive, $M_2 \\approx 0$, which simplifies the moments to $M_a \\approx c_{1a}M_1$ and $M_b \\approx c_{1b}M_1$. The intensity ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{I_a}{I_b} = \\frac{|M_a|^2}{|M_b|^2} \\approx \\frac{c_{1a}^2 |M_1|^2}{c_{1b}^2 |M_1|^2} = \\frac{c_{1a}^2}{c_{1b}^2}\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_{1a}^2$ and $c_{1b}^2$ represent the fraction of the IR-active state $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ in each eigenstate. These can be found from the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. A standard derivation yields:\n$$\nc_{1a}^2 = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{obs} + \\Delta\\nu_{unp}}{2\\Delta\\nu_{obs}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{1b}^2 = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{obs} - \\Delta\\nu_{unp}}{2\\Delta\\nu_{obs}}\n$$\nwhere we have assumed $\\nu_1 > \\nu_2$, so $\\Delta\\nu_{unp} > 0$. This choice is justified because the higher-wavenumber observed band is stronger ($I_a/I_b = 9.0 > 1$), indicating that the higher-energy eigenstate $|\\psi_a\\rangle$ has a larger component of the active state $|\\psi_1\\rangle$. This occurs when the unperturbed active state $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ is closer in energy to $|\\psi_a\\rangle$, which happens if $\\nu_1 > \\nu_2$.\nThe intensity ratio is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{I_a}{I_b} = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{obs} + \\Delta\\nu_{unp}}{\\Delta\\nu_{obs} - \\Delta\\nu_{unp}} \\quad (3)\n$$\nWe can now solve for $\\Delta\\nu_{unp}$ using the given data:\n$$\n9.0 = \\frac{20 + \\Delta\\nu_{unp}}{20 - \\Delta\\nu_{unp}}\n$$\n$$\n9.0(20 - \\Delta\\nu_{unp}) = 20 + \\Delta\\nu_{unp}\n$$\n$$\n180 - 9.0\\,\\Delta\\nu_{unp} = 20 + \\Delta\\nu_{unp}\n$$\n$$\n160 = 10.0\\,\\Delta\\nu_{unp}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{unp} = 16\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, we have a second equation for the unperturbed wavenumbers:\n$$\n\\nu_1 - \\nu_2 = 16\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\quad (4)\n$$\nWe now solve the system of linear equations (1) and (4):\n$$\n\\nu_1 + \\nu_2 = 3198\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_1 - \\nu_2 = 16\n$$\nAdding the two equations gives $2\\nu_1 = 3214$, which yields $\\nu_1 = 1607\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting $\\nu_1$ back into equation (1):\n$1607 + \\nu_2 = 3198 \\implies \\nu_2 = 3198 - 1607 = 1591\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we find the coupling constant $V$ using equation (2):\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{obs}^2 = \\Delta\\nu_{unp}^2 + 4V^2\n$$\n$$\n(20)^2 = (16)^2 + 4V^2\n$$\n$$\n400 = 256 + 4V^2\n$$\n$$\n4V^2 = 400 - 256 = 144\n$$\n$$\nV^2 = 36\n$$\nBy convention, the coupling constant $V$ is taken as the positive root:\n$$\nV = 6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe unperturbed wavenumbers are $\\nu_1 = 1607\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\nu_2 = 1591\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the coupling constant is $V=6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The calculated parameters are consistent with the entire set of observations.\n\nThe final values are:\n$\\nu_1 = 1607\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\nu_2 = 1591\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$V = 6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$",
