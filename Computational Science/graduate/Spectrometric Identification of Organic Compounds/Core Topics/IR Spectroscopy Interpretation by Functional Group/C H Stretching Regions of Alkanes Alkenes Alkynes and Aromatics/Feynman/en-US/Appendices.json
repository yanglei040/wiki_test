            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relationship between the vibrational wavenumbers of a carbon-hydrogen ($\\mathrm{C-H}$) bond and its deuterated analogue, the carbon-deuterium ($\\mathrm{C-D}$) bond, followed by a numerical prediction. The cornerstone of this analysis is the diatomic harmonic oscillator model.\n\nWithin this model, the vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, of a diatomic molecule is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond, which quantifies its stiffness, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two-atom system.\n\nIn infrared (IR) spectroscopy, it is conventional to use the wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is related to the frequency by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Substituting this into the frequency equation gives the expression for the wavenumber:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nApplying this model to the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ and $\\mathrm{C-D}$ bonds, we can write their respective stretching wavenumbers as:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-H}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-D}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{C-D}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-D}}}}\n$$\nThe problem states a crucial assumption: isotopic substitution does not change the local force constant of the bond. This is a standard and highly accurate approximation rooted in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which states that the electronic potential energy surface is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, we can set the force constants to be equal: $k_{\\mathrm{C-H}} = k_{\\mathrm{C-D}} = k$.\n\nWith this assumption, we can derive the analytical expression for the ratio of the two wavenumbers by dividing the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-H}}$ by that for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-D}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C-D}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-D}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-D}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{C-H}}}}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression relating the ratio of the stretching wavenumbers to the square root of the inverse ratio of their reduced masses.\n\nNext, we proceed to the numerical calculation. The reduced mass, $\\mu$, for a system of two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nUsing the provided atomic masses, $m_{\\mathrm{C}} = m_{\\mathrm{^{12}C}} = 12.000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = m_{\\mathrm{^{1}H}} = 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{D}} = m_{\\mathrm{^{2}H}} = 2.014102\\,\\mathrm{u}$, we calculate the reduced masses for the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ and $\\mathrm{C-D}$ systems.

            "solution": "The vibrational motion of a diatomic molecule, or a specific bond treated as such, can be approximated by a simple harmonic oscillator. The classical angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is related to the force constant of the bond, $k$, and the reduced mass of the system, $\\mu$, by:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nIn quantum mechanics, this corresponds to the harmonic vibrational angular frequency, $\\omega_e$.

Since the C-H bond in an alkyne is generally considered stiffer and more harmonic, one might expect $x_{e, \\mathrm{sp}} < x_{e, \\mathrm{sp^3}}$. This would make the correction factor slightly less than $1$, thereby reducing the value of $R$ relative to the one calculated here.\n(ii) Mode coupling, such as Fermi resonance, can shift the observed fundamental $\\tilde{\\nu}_{01}$ from its unperturbed position. If the observed frequencies $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp^{3}}}$ include shifts $\\delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ and $\\delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp^{3}}}$ respectively, the \"true\" ratio of force constants would depend on the unperturbed frequencies. The calculated value of $R$ is thus an effective ratio based on the shifted experimental peaks. For example, if the sp$^{3}$ C-H stretch is pushed to higher frequency by Fermi resonance ($\\delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp^{3}}} > 0$) while the sp C-H stretch is unshifted, the true denominator $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp^{3}}} - \\delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{sp^{3}}}$ would be smaller, leading to a larger \"true\" value of $R$.",
