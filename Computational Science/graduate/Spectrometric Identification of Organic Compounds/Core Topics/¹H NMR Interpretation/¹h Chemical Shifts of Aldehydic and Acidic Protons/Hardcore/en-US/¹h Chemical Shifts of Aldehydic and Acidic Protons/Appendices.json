            "introduction": "When a proton rapidly shuttles between two environments, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy observes a single signal whose chemical shift is a weighted average of the individual states. This exercise provides a direct application of this fast-exchange principle, demonstrating how to work backward from the observed chemical shift of a proton moving between an aldehyde ($sp^{2}$ carbon) and a hemiacetal ($sp^{3}$ carbon) environment. By solving this problem , you will practice quantifying an equilibrium composition from a single NMR observable.",

            "problem": "A sample containing an aromatic aldehyde $\\text{R-CHO}$ and an alcohol $\\mathrm{ROH}$ in deuterated chloroform ($\\mathrm{CDCl}_{3}$) is studied by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The aldehyde undergoes reversible formation of its corresponding hemiacetal $\\text{R-CH(OH)(OR)}$ under the measurement conditions. Focus attention exclusively on the single proton bound to the carbon that is the carbonyl carbon in the aldehyde; this proton is present both in the aldehyde ($\\text{R-CHO}$, an $sp^{2}$ environment) and in the hemiacetal ($\\text{R-CH(OH)(OR)}$, an $sp^{3}$ environment). Assume that chemical exchange between these two microenvironments is fast on the NMR timescale for this particular proton, and that line shape effects are negligible, so a single resonance is observed.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It describes a standard application of dynamic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the populations of species in a chemical equilibrium. All necessary data are provided, and the values are physically realistic. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe core principle governing this problem is the effect of fast chemical exchange on NMR spectra. When a nucleus exchanges between two or more distinct chemical environments (sites) at a rate that is much faster than the difference in their resonance frequencies (expressed in Hz), the NMR spectrometer detects a single, time-averaged signal. The frequency of this observed resonance is the population-weighted average of the frequencies of the individual sites.\n\nLet the two species containing the proton of interest be the aldehyde, $\\text{R-CHO}$, and the hemiacetal, $\\text{R-CH(OH)(OR)}$. We denote their respective mole fractions in the equilibrium mixture as $x_{\\mathrm{ald}}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{hemi}}$. Since these are the only two states for the proton being observed, the sum of their mole fractions must be unity:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{ald}} + x_{\\mathrm{hemi}} = 1$$\n\nLet $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ald}}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{hemi}}$ be the intrinsic resonance frequencies (in Hz) of the proton in the pure aldehyde and pure hemiacetal environments, respectively.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the behavior of labile protons, such as the one in the carboxylic acid group (R-COOH), in a protic deuterated solvent like methanol-$d_{4}$ (CD$_{3}$OD).\n\n1.  **Identification of Labile versus Non-Labile Protons:**\n    The analyte, $p$-formylbenzoic acid, has two key types of protons. The aldehydic proton (-CHO) is attached to a carbon atom. This C-H bond is covalent and not acidic, so this proton is non-labile. It does not exchange with the solvent. The carboxylic acid proton (-COOH) is highly acidic and thus highly labile. It can be readily removed and replaced in an acid-base or exchange process.\n\n2.  **H/D Exchange with the Solvent:**\n    The solvent, methanol-$d_{4}$ (CD$_{3}$OD), is a protic solvent because it possesses an exchangeable deuteron on its oxygen atom. When $p$-formylbenzoic acid is dissolved in MeOD-$d_{4}$, a rapid chemical equilibrium is established between the acidic proton of the solute and the deuterons of the solvent:\n    $$ \\text{R-COO}\\underline{\\mathrm{H}} + \\text{CD}_3\\text{O}\\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{R-COO}\\underline{\\mathrm{D}} + \\text{CD}_3\\text{O}\\underline{\\mathrm{H}} $$\n    Here, R represents the $p$-formylphenyl group. This exchange is often catalyzed by trace acidic or basic impurities, or by the analyte itself.\n\n3.  **Isotopic Dilution:**\n    NMR solvents like MeOD-$d_{4}$ are typically specified with high isotopic purity, e.g., $>99.5\\%$ deuterium. This means the solvent acts as a massive reservoir of deuterium atoms. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the vast excess of deuterons in the solvent drives the equilibrium far to the right. Consequently, the carboxylic acid group is almost completely converted to its deuterated form, R-COOD. Since ¹H NMR spectroscopy can only detect ¹H nuclei, the sites that have become deuterated are rendered \"invisible\" to the experiment. The population of molecules retaining a proton at the acid site (R-COOH) at any given moment becomes vanishingly small. This is the effect of isotopic dilution.\n\n4.  **Exchange Broadening:**\n    The exchange process is dynamic. The few remaining R-COOH protons are rapidly exchanging with the small concentration of residual protons in the solvent (from H$_{2}$O or CD$_{3}$OH impurities). According to the foundational principles, when the rate of exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) is fast compared to the difference in resonance frequency between the exchanging sites ($\\Delta\\omega_)$, the NMR signal broadens significantly. The combination of extreme isotopic dilution (very low signal intensity to begin with) and severe exchange broadening causes the resonance to become so wide and low in amplitude that it merges with the baseline noise and is, therefore, not observed.\n\n5.  **Strategy for Observation:**\n    To observe the acidic $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ proton signal, one must suppress or eliminate the H/D exchange. This can be achieved by:\n    a. **Using an aprotic deuterated solvent:** Solvents like chloroform-$d$ (CDCl$_{3}$), acetone-$d_{6}$ ((CD$_{3}$)$_2$CO), or dimethyl sulfoxide-$d_{6}$ (DMSO-$d_{6}$) do not have exchangeable protons or deuterons. They cannot act as a source for H/D exchange. DMSO-$d_{6}$ is particularly effective because it is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor, which slows down the intermolecular exchange between solute molecules and shifts the labile proton signal significantly downfield, often making it a sharp, easily identifiable peak.\n    b. **Ensuring Anhydrous Conditions:** Even in aprotic solvents, trace amounts of water (H$_{2}$O or D$_{2}$O) can catalyze exchange and broaden the signal. Using a very dry solvent and sample is crucial.\n    c. **Lowering the Temperature:** Chemical exchange is a thermally activated process. Lowering the temperature of the NMR experiment reduces the rate of exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$). If the exchange rate can be slowed to the slow-exchange regime ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\ll \\Delta\\omega$), a distinct, sharp signal for the $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ proton can be resolved.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In MeOD-$d_{4}$, the acidic $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ proton undergoes rapid $\\mathrm{H}/\\mathrm{D}$ exchange with the deuterated solvent, acid/base-catalyzed in the protic medium, such that $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\omega$ and the site is isotopically diluted to $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{D}$; the small residual ¹H population plus fast exchange broaden and attenuate the resonance below detection. To preserve the $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ signal, use very dry, aprotic deuterated solvents that do not supply exchangeable deuterons (e.g., chloroform-$d$ (CDCl$_{3}$), dimethyl sulfoxide-$d_{6}$ (DMSO-$d_{6}$), acetone-$d_{6}$), minimize adventitious acid/base, and, if needed, lower the temperature to reduce $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.**\nThis option provides a perfectly accurate and complete explanation. It correctly identifies rapid H/D exchange, isotopic dilution, and exchange broadening as the combined reasons for the signal's disappearance. The recommended experimental conditions—switching to a dry, aprotic solvent and potentially lowering the temperature—are the standard and correct procedures for observing labile protons.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ signal disappears in MeOD-$d_{4}$ because the solvent’s high dielectric constant shifts it upfield until it coincides with the residual solvent peak; switching to deuterium oxide (D$_{2}$O) prevents this overlap and preserves the $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ resonance, which can be assigned by integration.**\nThis explanation is incorrect. First, a solvent's dielectric constant influences chemical shift but does not cause a signal to disappear. Second, polar, protic solvents like methanol typically shift acidic protons *downfield* due to hydrogen bonding, not upfield. Shifting a signal from $\\delta \\approx 12\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ to overlap with a residual solvent peak near $\\delta=3.31\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is physically implausible. The recommendation is also incorrect; switching to D$_{2}$O, another protic deuterated solvent, would exacerbate the H/D exchange problem, not solve it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The disappearance arises because strong hydrogen bonding to MeOD-$d_{4}$ drives the acidic $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ resonance beyond the standard spectral window; using benzene-$d_{6}$ eliminates hydrogen bonding and restores the signal without any need to control exchange rates or dryness.**\nThis explanation is flawed. Strong hydrogen bonding causes a *downfield shift* of the resonance, but not its disappearance. The signal would still be within the observable range of a modern spectrometer. The primary reason for disappearance is exchange, not the magnitude of the shift. The recommendation is also problematic. While benzene-$d_{6}$ is aprotic, it is a poor solvent for polar acids. Furthermore, in non-H-bonding solvents, carboxylic acids form H-bonded dimers, which still involves exchange. The claim that one does not need to control dryness or exchange rates is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The aldehydic proton saturates under broadband excitation and transfers magnetization away from the $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ site in MeOD-$d_{4}$; therefore, selective excitation or addition of trifluoroacetic acid-$d$ is required to observe the acidic $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ signal at its intrinsic chemical shift.**\nThis invokes saturation transfer or NOE, which are not the primary mechanisms for the complete disappearance of a labile proton signal in a protic deuterated solvent. These effects would typically cause a partial reduction in intensity, not a total vanishing. The fundamental problem is H/D exchange with the solvent bulk. The recommendations are also inappropriate. Selective excitation does not solve the exchange problem, and adding another deuterated acid (trifluoroacetic acid-$d$) is counterproductive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
