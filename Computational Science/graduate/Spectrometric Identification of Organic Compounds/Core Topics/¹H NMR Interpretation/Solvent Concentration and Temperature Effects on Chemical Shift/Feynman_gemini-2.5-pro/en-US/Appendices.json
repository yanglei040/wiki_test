            "problem": "A dilute organic solute is measured by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) at temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in two otherwise identical experiments that differ only in the isotopic composition of the solvent and in the lock procedure. The sample tube can be modeled as an infinitely long cylinder coaxial with the static magnetic field $B_0$. Assume linear, isotropic diamagnetic response of all media and neglect any microscopic chemical environment differences between the two solvents beyond their bulk magnetic susceptibilities.\n\nDefinitions and well-tested facts to use:\n- The volume magnetization $M$ of a linear medium satisfies $M = \\chi H_{\\mathrm{mac}}$, where $\\chi$ is the dimensionless volume magnetic susceptibility and $H_{\\mathrm{mac}}$ is the macroscopic magnetic field.\n- For a long cylinder coaxial with $B_0$, the demagnetizing factor is effectively zero, so $H_{\\mathrm{mac}} \\approx H_0$, where $B_0 = \\mu_0 H_0$ and $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n- The Lorentz-sphere construction for a nucleus embedded in a uniformly magnetized continuum yields a local-field correction $H_{\\mathrm{Lorentz}} = \\frac{1}{3} M$, so the local field is $H_{\\mathrm{loc}} = H_{\\mathrm{mac}} + \\frac{1}{3} M$.\n- The NMR Larmor frequency of nucleus $X$ is $\\nu_X = \\frac{\\gamma_X}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$, where $\\gamma_X$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of $X$ and $B_{\\mathrm{loc}} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{loc}}$.\n\nTwo experiments are performed on the same solute:\n1.

The experimental setup (internal vs. external lock) is a classic illustration of this effect.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary physical laws, experimental parameters, and numerical values to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the local magnetic field $B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ experienced by a nucleus and the externally applied field $B_0$. According to the provided definitions:\n$H_{\\mathrm{loc}} = H_{\\mathrm{mac}} + \\frac{1}{3} M$.\nGiven $H_{\\mathrm{mac}} \\approx H_0$ and $M = \\chi H_{\\mathrm{mac}} \\approx \\chi H_0$:\n$H_{\\mathrm{loc}} \\approx H_0 + \\frac{1}{3} \\chi H_0 = H_0(1 + \\frac{\\chi}{3})$.\nThe local magnetic field is then $B_{\\mathrm{loc}} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{loc}} \\approx \\mu_0 H_0 (1 + \\frac{\\chi}{3}) = B_0(1 + \\frac{\\chi}{3})$.\n\nAn NMR spectrometer's field-frequency lock system adjusts the main magnetic field $B_0$ to keep the resonance frequency of a lock nucleus (here, deuterium) at a constant setpoint value, $\\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}$. The frequency of a nucleus $X$ includes the effect of its intrinsic chemical shielding $\\sigma_X$:\n$\\nu_X = \\frac{\\gamma_X}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc}}(1 - \\sigma_X)$.\n\nLet's analyze the two experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1: Internal Lock**\nThe solute is dissolved in CDCl$_3$, which also serves as the lock solvent. Therefore, the susceptibility of the sample medium and the lock medium are identical: $\\chi_{\\mathrm{sample}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}$. Let the applied field be $B_{0,1}$.\n\nThe deuterium lock frequency is:\n$\\nu_{D,1} = \\frac{\\gamma_D}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc, D, 1}}(1 - \\sigma_D) = \\frac{\\gamma_D}{2\\pi} B_{0,1}(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3})(1 - \\sigma_D)$.\nThe lock circuit enforces $\\nu_{D,1} = \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}$, which determines the required applied field $B_{0,1}$:\n$B_{0,1} = \\frac{2\\pi \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}$.\n\nThe observed frequency of the solute proton (shielding $\\sigma_H$) is:\n$\\nu_{H,1} = \\frac{\\gamma_H}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc, H, 1}}(1 - \\sigma_H) = \\frac{\\gamma_H}{2\\pi} B_{0,1}(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3})(1 - \\sigma_H)$.\nSubstituting the expression for $B_{0,1}$:\n$\\nu_{H,1} = \\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}} \\right) (1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}) = \\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}$.\nIn the case of an internal lock, the susceptibility term $(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3})$ cancels, and the observed proton frequency is independent of the bulk susceptibility. This serves as our reference state.\n\n**Experiment 2: External Lock**\nThe solute is in CHCl$_3$ ($\\chi_{\\mathrm{sample}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}$), while the lock is a coaxial insert of CDCl$_3$ ($\\chi_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}$). Let the applied field be $B_{0,2}$.\n\nThe deuterium lock frequency is determined by its environment:\n$\\nu_{D,2} = \\frac{\\gamma_D}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc, D, 2}}(1 - \\sigma_D) = \\frac{\\gamma_D}{2\\pi} B_{0,2}(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{lock}}}{3})(1 - \\sigma_D) = \\frac{\\gamma_D}{2\\pi} B_{0,2}(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3})(1 - \\sigma_D)$.\nThe lock condition $\\nu_{D,2} = \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}$ sets the applied field $B_{0,2}$:\n$B_{0,2} = \\frac{2\\pi \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}$.\nNote that $B_{0,2} = B_{0,1}$. The external field is adjusted to the same value in both experiments because the lock environment is identical.\n\nThe observed frequency of the solute proton, which is in the sample medium with susceptibility $\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}$, is:\n$\\nu_{H,2} = \\frac{\\gamma_H}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc, H, 2}}(1 - \\sigma_H) = \\frac{\\gamma_H}{2\\pi} B_{0,2}(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3})(1 - \\sigma_H)$.\nSubstituting the expression for $B_{0,2}$:\n$\\nu_{H,2} = \\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}} \\right) (1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}) = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}\\right) \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}$.\n\n**Calculating the Chemical Shift Difference**\nThe difference in reported chemical shift, $\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}}$, is due to the difference in the observed proton frequencies, $\\nu_{H,2} - \\nu_{H,1}$. The chemical shift in ppm is the frequency difference normalized by a reference frequency, multiplied by $10^6$. The appropriate reference frequency is the spectrometer's operating frequency, which is approximately $\\nu_{H,1}$ or $\\nu_{H,2}$.\n$\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} = \\frac{\\nu_{H,2} - \\nu_{H,1}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\times 10^6 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\nu_{H,2}}{\\nu_{H,1}} - 1\\right) \\times 10^6$.\n\nUsing the derived expressions for $\\nu_{H,1}$ and $\\nu_{H,2}$:\n$\\frac{\\nu_{H,2}}{\\nu_{H,1}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}\\right) \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}}{\\frac{\\gamma_H(1 - \\sigma_H)}{\\gamma_D(1 - \\sigma_D)} \\nu_{D, \\mathrm{set}}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}$.\n\nTherefore, the BMS contribution to the shift difference is:\n$\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}} - 1\\right) \\times 10^6$.\nSimplifying the expression:\n$\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} = \\left(\\frac{(1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}}}{3}) - (1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3})}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}}\\right) \\times 10^6 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{D}})}{1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3}} \\times 10^6$.\n\nThis is the final closed-form expression. Now we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}} = -8.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}} = -9.78 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe difference in susceptibilities is:\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{D}} = (-8.58 \\times 10^{-6}) - (-9.78 \\times 10^{-6}) = 1.20 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nThe denominator term is:\n$1 + \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{D}}}{3} = 1 + \\frac{-9.78 \\times 10^{-6}}{3} = 1 - 3.26 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.99999674$.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}}$:\n$\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(1.20 \\times 10^{-6})}{0.99999674} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{0.40 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.99999674} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{0.40}{0.99999674}$.\n$\\Delta \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} \\approx 0.400001304 \\, \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input values are given to three significant figures.\nRounding the result gives $0.400$ ppm. This positive value indicates a downfield shift in experiment 2 relative to experiment 1, which is expected as the sample solvent CHCl$_3$ is less diamagnetic (larger $\\chi$, i.e., less negative) than the lock solvent CDCl$_3$.",

            "problem": "An organic solute $X$ exhibits temperature- and solvent-concentration-dependent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts in a binary solvent mixture, due to 1:1 hydrogen-bond formation with the solvent component $S$: $X + S \\rightleftharpoons XS$. The equilibrium constant $K(T)$ follows the van’t Hoff relation $\\ln K(T) = \\frac{\\Delta S}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H}{R T}$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant, $\\Delta H$ is the standard enthalpy change, and $\\Delta S$ is the standard entropy change. In the limit where the solvent species $S$ is in large excess, the fraction of bound solute is $f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c) = \\frac{K(T)\\,c}{1 + K(T)\\,c}$, with $c$ the molar concentration of $S$. The observed chemical shift is the population-weighted average,\n$$\n\\delta(T,c) = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)\\,\\Delta \\delta,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the chemical shift of free $X$ and $\\Delta \\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the binding-induced shift.\n\nYou measure $\\delta$ for $X$ at two temperatures and the same nominal solvent concentration, preparing two solutions independently so that their concentration uncertainties are uncorrelated. Assume the uncertainties in $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\Delta \\delta$ are negligible compared to temperature and concentration uncertainties, and that uncertainties in temperature and concentration are independent across the two measurements. The following data are obtained:\n- $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} = 7.00\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, $\\Delta \\delta = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$,\n- $\\delta(T_1,c_1) = 7.30\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ at $T_1 = 298.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$ with standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{T_1} = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $c_1 = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ with standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{c_1} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$,\n- $\\delta(T_2,c_2) = 7.18\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ at $T_2 = 318.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$ with standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{T_2} = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $c_2 = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ with standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{c_2} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n\nUsing the definitions and well-tested relations above, proceed as follows:\n1. Starting from the mass action expression for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)$ and the linear averaging for $\\delta(T,c)$, express $K(T_i)$ in terms of the measured $\\delta(T_i,c_i)$, the known $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\Delta \\delta$, and the measured $c_i$, for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n2. Define $y_i = \\ln K(T_i)$ and $x_i = 1/T_i$. Show how $\\Delta H$ can be obtained from the slope of the van’t Hoff plot using the two-point estimator $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and $\\Delta H = -R\\,m$.\n3.

Your derivation must start from the definitions above and the law of propagation of uncertainty for independent variables.\n4. Evaluate your expression numerically using $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ and the data provided, and report the standard uncertainty in $\\Delta H$ in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium (van't Hoff equation, mass action law), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (population-weighted chemical shifts), and standard statistical methods (propagation of uncertainty). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, data, and constants to derive a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, quantitative language.\n\n1. Expression for the equilibrium constant $K(T_i)$\n\nThe observed chemical shift $\\delta(T,c)$ is the population-weighted average of the chemical shifts of the free solute $X$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$, and the bound solute complex $XS$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. The populations are given by the fraction of free solute, $f_{\\mathrm{free}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{b}}$, and the fraction of bound solute, $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n$$\n\\delta(T,c) = f_{\\mathrm{free}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{b}})\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\delta(T,c) = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)\\,(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}) = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)\\,\\Delta \\delta\n$$\nThis matches the equation provided in the problem. We can solve this for the fraction of bound solute, $f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c) = \\frac{\\delta(T,c) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\Delta \\delta}\n$$\nThe problem also provides the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$ based on the equilibrium constant $K(T)$ and solvent concentration $c$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c) = \\frac{K(T)\\,c}{1 + K(T)\\,c}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$ for a given measurement $i$ at temperature $T_i$ and concentration $c_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta(T_i,c_i) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\Delta \\delta} = \\frac{K(T_i)\\,c_i}{1 + K(T_i)\\,c_i}\n$$\nTo solve for $K(T_i)$, let us denote $\\delta_i = \\delta(T_i,c_i)$ for simplicity.\n$$\n(\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})(1 + K(T_i)\\,c_i) = \\Delta \\delta\\,K(T_i)\\,c_i\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + (\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})K(T_i)\\,c_i = \\Delta \\delta\\,K(T_i)\\,c_i\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} = K(T_i)\\,c_i\\,[\\Delta \\delta - (\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})]\n$$\n$$\nK(T_i) = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,[\\Delta \\delta - \\delta_i + \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}]}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta \\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ into the denominator:\n$$\nK(T_i) = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,[(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}) - \\delta_i + \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}]} = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_i)}\n$$\nThis expression provides $K(T_i)$ in terms of the measured chemical shift $\\delta_i$, the known parameters $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ (where $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\Delta \\delta$), and the concentration $c_i$.\n\n2. Enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ from a two-point measurement\n\nThe van’t Hoff relation is given as $\\ln K(T) = \\frac{\\Delta S}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H}{R T}$.\nDefining $y = \\ln K(T)$ and $x = 1/T$, the equation takes the linear form $y = mx + b$, where the slope is $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}$ and the intercept is $b = \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$.\nFor two measurements $(T_1, K_1)$ and $(T_2, K_2)$, we have two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\ln K_i$.\nThe slope $m$ can be estimated using the two-point formula:\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{\\ln K_2 - \\ln K_1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\n$$\nFrom the relation $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}$, we can express the standard enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta H = -R\\,m = -R\\,\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\n3. Derivation of the standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}$\n\nThe standard uncertainty in $\\Delta H$ is obtained by applying the law of propagation of uncertainty for independent variables. The function is $\\Delta H(T_1, T_2, c_1, c_2)$. The uncertainties in $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\Delta \\delta$ are negligible, so the measured shifts $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are treated as exact values for this derivation. The variables with uncertainty are $T_1, T_2, c_1, c_2$.\nThe variance $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_1}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_2}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_1}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_2}^2\n$$\nWe need to calculate the partial derivatives of $\\Delta H = -R\\,\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}$.\nFirst, we find the dependence of $y_i = \\ln K_i$ on $c_i$. Based on Part 1, $K_i$ is inversely proportional to $c_i$: $K_i = A_i/c_i$, where $A_i = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\text{free}}}{\\delta_{\\text{bound}} - \\delta_i}$ is a constant with respect to $c_i$.\nSo, $y_i = \\ln(A_i/c_i) = \\ln(A_i) - \\ln(c_i)$.\nThe partial derivatives of $y_i$ with respect to $c_i$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial c_1} = -\\frac{1}{c_1}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial c_2} = -\\frac{1}{c_2}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $\\Delta H$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial y_1}\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial c_1} = \\left(-R\\,\\frac{-1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{c_1}\\right) = -R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_1(T_1 - T_2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_2} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial y_2}\\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial c_2} = \\left(-R\\,\\frac{1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{c_2}\\right) = R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_2(T_1 - T_2)}\n$$\nFor the derivatives with respect to temperature, we can rewrite $\\Delta H = -R(y_2 - y_1)\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_1 - T_2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_1} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_1}\\left(\\frac{T_1T_2}{T_1-T_2}\\right) = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2(T_1-T_2) - T_1T_2(1)}{(T_1-T_2)^2} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{-T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2} = R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\n$$\nBy symmetry (or direct calculation), swapping indices $1$ and $2$ gives an overall sign change from $(y_2 - y_1) \\to (y_1 - y_2)$, and also changes $T_2^2 \\to T_1^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_2} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_1^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\n$$\nSquaring these partial derivatives and substituting into the variance formula:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = \\left(R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + \\left(-R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_1^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_2}^2 + \\left(-R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_1(T_1 - T_2)}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_1}^2 + \\left(R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_2(T_1 - T_2)}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_2}^2\n$$\nThis can be factored to give the closed-form expression for $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = R^2 \\frac{(y_2-y_1)^2}{(T_1-T_2)^4}(T_2^4\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + T_1^4\\sigma_{T_2}^2) + R^2 \\frac{T_1^2 T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{c_1}^2}{c_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{c_2}^2}{c_2^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}$ is the square root of this expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H} = R\\sqrt{\\frac{(y_2-y_1)^2}{(T_1-T_2)^4}(T_2^4\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + T_1^4\\sigma_{T_2}^2) + \\frac{T_1^2 T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{c_1}^2}{c_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{c_2}^2}{c_2^2}\\right)}\n$$\n\n4.
