            "introduction": "Molecules in solution are rarely static; they often exist as a dynamic equilibrium of multiple conformers.

In solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), the interconversion is fast on the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ chemical shift timescale, so only a single $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ resonance is observed for the carbon $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ bearing substituent $\\mathrm{X}$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a chemical system, an ethane derivative $\\mathrm{X{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}Y}$, that exists as an equilibrium mixture of two conformers (rotamers) undergoing rapid interconversion at a temperature of $298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. The task is to derive and calculate the observed $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ chemical shift of the $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ carbon and to qualitatively predict how this shift would change with an increase in the steric bulk of substituent $\\mathrm{Y}$.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, based on the principle of fast exchange in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. According to this principle, when the rate of exchange between two or more states is much faster than the difference in their resonance frequencies, a single, population-weighted average signal is observed. The chemical shift, $\\delta$, is directly proportional to the resonance frequency. Therefore, the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the weighted average of the chemical shifts of the individual conformers, where the weighting factors are the mole fractions of each conformer.\n\nThe system consists of two states: the anti rotamer and the gauche rotamer. Let their respective mole fractions be $x_{\\mathrm{anti}}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{gauche}}$, and let the intrinsic $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ chemical shifts for the $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ nucleus in these pure conformers be $\\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{gauche}}$. The sum of mole fractions must equal one: $x_{\\mathrm{anti}} + x_{\\mathrm{gauche}} = 1$. The expression for the observed chemical shift is the sum of the products of the mole fraction and the chemical shift for each contributing state:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = x_{\\mathrm{anti}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}} + x_{\\mathrm{gauche}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{gauche}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for a two-state fast-exchange system.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ using the data provided in the problem statement:\n-   Mole fraction of the anti rotamer, $x_{\\mathrm{anti}} = 0.70$\n-   Mole fraction of the gauche rotamer, $x_{\\mathrm{gauche}} = 0.30$\n-   $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ chemical shift of $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ in the anti rotamer, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}} = 34.73$ parts per million (ppm)\n-   $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ chemical shift of $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ in the gauche rotamer, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{gauche}} = 39.08$ ppm\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (0.70)(34.73) + (0.30)(39.08)\n$$\nPerforming the calculations:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 24.311 + 11.724 = 36.035\n$$\nThe problem requests the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx 36.04 \\ \\text{ppm}\n$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to provide a qualitative justification for how increasing the size of substituent $\\mathrm{Y}$ would affect the rotamer populations and the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n\nThe relative populations of the conformers are governed by their relative Gibbs free energies ($\\Delta G$) through the Boltzmann distribution. The primary energetic difference between the anti and gauche conformers arises from steric interactions. In the gauche conformer, the substituents $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ are separated by a dihedral angle of approximately $60^{\\circ}$, leading to steric hindrance (van der Waals repulsion) due to the proximity of their electron clouds. In the anti conformer, these substituents are maximally separated with a dihedral angle of approximately $180^{\\circ}$, minimizing steric repulsion.\n\nIncreasing the steric bulk (van der Waals radius) of substituent $\\mathrm{Y}$ will significantly increase the repulsive steric interactions in the sterically crowded gauche conformer. This destabilizes the gauche conformer, increasing its energy relative to the anti conformer. Consequently, the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx \\Delta G = E_{\\mathrm{gauche}} - E_{\\mathrm{anti}}$ will become larger and more positive.\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations is given by $\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{gauche}}}{x_{\\mathrm{anti}}} \\propto \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T})$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. An increase in $\\Delta E$ will decrease this ratio, meaning the equilibrium will shift to favor the more stable, less sterically hindered anti conformer. Thus, the mole fraction $x_{\\mathrm{anti}}$ will increase (approaching $1$) while $x_{\\mathrm{gauche}}$ will decrease (approaching $0$).\n\nThe effect on the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, follows directly from its nature as a weighted average. The expression is $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = x_{\\mathrm{anti}}\\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}} + x_{\\mathrm{gauche}}\\delta_{\\mathrm{gauche}}$. The given values are $\\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}} = 34.73$ ppm and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{gauche}} = 39.08$ ppm. As the population shifts to increase $x_{\\mathrm{anti}}$ and decrease $x_{\\mathrm{gauche}}$, the observed chemical shift $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ will move closer to the value of the increasingly dominant conformer, which is the anti conformer. Therefore, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ will shift towards the value of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{anti}}$. This means the numerical value of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ will decrease, moving from its current value of $36.04$ ppm towards $34.73$ ppm. This corresponds to an upfield shift (to lower frequency) in the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR spectrum.",
