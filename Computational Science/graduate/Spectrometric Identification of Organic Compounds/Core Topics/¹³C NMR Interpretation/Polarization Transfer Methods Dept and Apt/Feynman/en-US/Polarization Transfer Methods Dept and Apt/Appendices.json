            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Technique**: Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR), abbreviated as DEPT.\n- **Experiments**: Three experiments are performed with final proton flip angles $\\beta = 45^\\circ$ (DEPT-$45$), $\\beta = 90^\\circ$ (DEPT-$90$), and $\\beta = 135^\\circ$ (DEPT-$135$).\n- **Acquisition Conditions**: Broadband $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling is used. INEPT delays are set to $\\tau = 1/(4J_{\\mathrm{CH}})$.\n- **Phase Convention**: Phase cycling is adjusted such that in DEPT-$135$, $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ signals are positive (upward), and $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ signals are negative (downward).\n- **Assumptions**: Standard DEPT interpretation assumptions apply: weak coupling, no severe chemical exchange, equivalent attached protons per carbon, and negligible transfer from multi-bond couplings ($^{2}J$, $^{3}J$) under the chosen $\\tau$.\n- **Objective**: Formulate a deterministic algorithm to assign every $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ peak from a broadband-decoupled spectrum to one of four categories: $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$, or quaternary (C), using only the presence/absence and sign information from the three DEPT spectra.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a standard task in structural elucidation using NMR spectroscopy.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established DEPT NMR experiment. The behavior of carbon signals as a function of the number of attached protons ($n$) and the final proton flip angle ($\\beta$) is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics applied to nuclear spin systems. The stated phase convention for DEPT-$135$ is the most common one used in practice and corresponds to the natural phase behavior of the signals. While the specification of the INEPT delay as $\\tau = 1/(4J_{\\mathrm{CH}})$ is an incomplete description of the full DEPT pulse sequence timing, the problem circumvents any potential ambiguity by explicitly defining the expected signs of the signals in the DEPT-$135$ spectrum. This makes the problem solvable based on the provided outcomes, which are standard and correct. The assumptions listed are also the standard prerequisites for a straightforward interpretation of DEPT spectra.\n- **Well-Posed**: The goal is clearly defined: create a deterministic algorithm for carbon-type assignment. The inputs (the set of peaks and their behavior in three specific spectra) and the desired outputs (assignment to one of four non-overlapping categories) are precisely specified. A unique logical procedure can be constructed from this information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and scientific terms. It does not contain subjective language or speculation.\n\n**Flaw Checklist**:\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: None. The underlying physics and standard outcomes of the DEPT experiment are correctly represented.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: None. The task is to create a logical algorithm, which is inherently formalizable. The topic is central to NMR spectroscopy.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup**: None. The problem provides all necessary information by defining the expected spectral features for each carbon type, which is sufficient to build the required logic.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: None. This is a routine analytical procedure.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: None. The problem is well-structured and leads to a definitive answer.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: None. The problem requires a careful application of logical deduction based on the principles of the DEPT experiment.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: None. The logic can be rigorously verified.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n#### Principle of the DEPT Experiment\nThe DEPT pulse sequence transfers polarization from attached protons ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) to a carbon nucleus ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$). The resulting $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal intensity depends on the number of attached protons, $n$, and the angle, $\\beta$, of the final proton pulse in the sequence. For a $\\mathrm{CH}_n$ group, the edited signal intensity is proportional to a function of $\\beta$. Quaternary carbons (C, $n=0$) have no attached protons and thus show no signal in any DEPT spectrum.\n\nUnder the standard implementation and the phase convention specified in the problem, the theoretical signal properties for each carbon type in the three DEPT experiments are as follows:\n\n| Carbon Type ($n$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$45$ ($\\beta = 45^\\circ$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$90$ ($\\beta = 90^\\circ$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$135$ ($\\beta = 135^\\circ$) |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $\\mathrm{CH}$ ($n=1$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Present, Positive ($+$) |\n| $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ ($n=2$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Absent ($0$) | Present, Negative ($-$) |\n| $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ ($n=3$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Absent ($0$) | Present, Positive ($+$) |\n| Quaternary, C ($n=0$) | Absent ($0$) | Absent ($0$) | Absent ($0$) |\n\nThe broadband-decoupled $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spectrum shows all carbon peaks ($\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$). The task is to use the information in the table above to create a sorting algorithm.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: If a peak appears in DEPT-$90$, assign CH.**\nBased on the table, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons produce a signal in the DEPT-$90$ spectrum. This step correctly and uniquely identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons.\n- **Step 2: Else, if the peak appears in DEPT-$45$ and is positive in DEPT-$135$, assign CH$_3$.**\nThe 'Else' clause restricts this rule to carbons that are not $\\mathrm{CH}$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$, and C). The condition \"appears in DEPT-$45$\" eliminates quaternary carbons (C). We are left considering $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_3$. The condition \"is positive in DEPT-$135$\" selects for $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ and excludes $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ (which is negative). This step correctly identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ carbons.\n- **Step 3: Else, if the peak appears in DEPT-$45$ and is negative in DEPT-$135$, assign CH$_2$.**\nThe 'Else' clause restricts this to carbons not assigned in steps 1 or 2 (i.e., not $\\mathrm{CH}$ or $\\mathrm{CH}_3$). The remaining types are $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and C. The condition \"appears in DEPT-$45$\" eliminates C. The condition \"is negative in DEPT-$135$\" is uniquely characteristic of $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ carbons among the remaining possibilities. This step correctly identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ carbons.\n- **Step 4: Else, if the peak is absent in DEPT-$45$, assign quaternary.**\nThe 'Else' clause implies this rule applies to any peak not assigned as $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, or $\\mathrm{CH}_3$. The only remaining type is quaternary carbon (C). Quaternary carbons are, by definition, absent from all DEPT spectra, including DEPT-$45$. This step correctly identifies all quaternary carbons.\n\nThe algorithm is sequential, with each step handling a mutually exclusive subset of peaks. It correctly and unambiguously assigns all carbon types.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: If a peak appears in DEPT-$90$, it is either CH or CH$_3$;...**\nThis premise is factually incorrect. According to the principles of the experiment, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons appear in the DEPT-$90$ spectrum; $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ carbons give a null signal. The algorithm fails at the first step.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: Use DEPT-$135$ sign alone: positive $\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{CH}$,...**\nThis rule is ambiguous. According to the table, both $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ resonances are positive in the DEPT-$135$ spectrum. Therefore, a positive signal in DEPT-$135$ alone cannot be used to definitively assign a peak as $\\mathrm{CH}$. The algorithm fails to provide a deterministic assignment.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: Assign peaks that are negative in DEPT-$135$ as quaternary.**\nThis is incorrect. A negative signal in DEPT-$135$ is the unique signature of a $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ group. Quaternary carbons (C) are absent from all DEPT spectra. The algorithm fails at the first step.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Set-theoretic classifier:**\nLet us define the sets based on the provided data:\n- $U$: The set of all peaks in the broadband-decoupled spectrum, i.e., all $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3$ peaks.\n- $P = \\{\\text{peaks present in DEPT-45}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks.\n- $Q = \\{\\text{peaks present in DEPT-90}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}\\}$ peaks.\n- $R^{+} = \\{\\text{peaks positive in DEPT-135}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks.\n- $R^{-} = \\{\\text{peaks negative in DEPT-135}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$ peaks.\n\nNow we evaluate the proposed assignments:\n- **$\\mathrm{CH} = Q$**: This assigns $\\mathrm{CH}$ to the set of peaks present in DEPT-$90$. This is correct, as $Q$ contains only $\\mathrm{CH}$ peaks.\n- **$\\mathrm{CH}_3 = (P \\setminus Q)\\cap R^{+}$**: The set $P \\setminus Q$ represents peaks present in DEPT-$45$ but absent in DEPT-$90$. This corresponds to the set of $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks. Intersecting this set with $R^{+}$ (peaks positive in DEPT-$135$, i.e., $\\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$) yields: $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} \\cap \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$. This correctly identifies the set of $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ peaks.\n- **$\\mathrm{CH}_2 = (P \\setminus Q)\\cap R^{-}$**: The set $P \\setminus Q$ is $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$. Intersecting this with $R^{-}$ (peaks negative in DEPT-$135$, i.e., $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$) yields: $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} \\cap \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$. This correctly identifies the set of $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ peaks.\n- **$\\text{quaternary} = \\text{complement of }P\\text{ in the broadband-decoupled }^{13}\\mathrm{C}\\text{ spectrum}$**: The complement of $P$ in the universe of all peaks $U$ is $U \\setminus P$. This is the set of peaks that appear in the broadband-decoupled spectrum but not in the DEPT-$45$ spectrum. From our table, only quaternary carbons (C) fit this description. This correctly identifies the set of quaternary carbon peaks.\n\nThe set of definitions provides a complete and non-overlapping partition of all carbon peaks into the four categories.\n**Verdict:** Correct.",

Your analysis should be grounded in the spin evolution under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian, the dependence of transfer efficiency on $J$ and $\\tau$, and attenuation from relaxation over the evolution and transfer intervals; do not rely on empirical “selection rule tables” without justification.\n\nA. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The weak DEPT-$90^\\circ$ methylene signal arises from incomplete cancellation for an even number of attached protons when ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ deviates from $J_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, compounded by flip-angle imperfection within $\\pm 5^\\circ$ and additional attenuation from the shorter $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2})$ during the evolution periods. The DEPT-$135^\\circ$ phase pattern (upright $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, inverted $\\mathrm{CH_2}$) and the APT phase pattern (upright odd, inverted even) are consistent with these assignments.\n\nB. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$.

Assignment of Carbon Signals**\n\nThe ethanol molecule, $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$, has two protonated carbons: a methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) group and a methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) group.\n\n-   **Chemical Shift**: The carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) is expected to be deshielded and resonate at a higher chemical shift (downfield) compared to the terminal methyl group ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$). Thus, we anticipate $\\delta(\\mathrm{CH_2}) > \\delta(\\mathrm{CH_3})$. This suggests the assignment: $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ carbon, and $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ carbon.\n\n-   **APT (Attached Proton Test)**: This experiment differentiates carbons based on the parity of the number of attached protons. For typical phasing, carbons with an odd number of protons ($\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH_3}$) produce a positive (upright) signal, while carbons with an even number of protons ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{CH_2}$) produce a negative (inverted) signal. The data shows an upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and an inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This confirms the assignment: $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ (odd, $n=3$), and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ (even, $n=2$).\n\n-   **DEPT-135**: This experiment provides more specific multiplicity information. With an editing pulse angle of $\\theta = 135^\\circ$, $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}$ groups yield positive signals, while $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ groups yield negative signals. The observed upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ are perfectly consistent with the assignment of $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ to $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ to $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.\n\n-   **DEPT-45**: With $\\theta=45^\\circ$, all protonated carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH_2}, \\mathrm{CH_3}$) should give positive signals. The observation of two upright signals is consistent with the presence of two protonated carbons.\n\nAll consistent evidence points to the assignment:\n-   $\\mathbf{\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$ corresponds to the **$\\mathrm{CH_3}$** group.\n-   $\\mathbf{\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$ corresponds to the **$\\mathrm{CH_2}$** group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ Spectrum**\n\nThe DEPT experiment edits signals based on the number of attached protons, $n$, through the final proton pulse angle $\\theta$. The signal intensity for a given multiplicity, ignoring relaxation and $J$-mismatch scaling for the moment, has the following ideal dependence on $\\theta$:\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH}) \\propto \\sin(\\theta)$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2\\theta)$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(3\\theta))$\n\nFor an ideal DEPT-$90^\\circ$ experiment, $\\theta=90^\\circ$:\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH}) \\propto \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2\\times90^\\circ) = \\sin(180^\\circ) = 0$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(90^\\circ) + \\sin(270^\\circ)) = \\frac{3}{4}(1 - 1) = 0$\n\nIdeally, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals appear. Since ethanol has no $\\mathrm{CH}$ group, the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ spectrum should be null. However, the data show a weak but non-zero signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group at $\\delta=58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and no signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group. This deviation from ideal behavior requires a physical explanation based on the provided parameters.\n\n-   **Flip-Angle Imperfection**: The problem states a possible systematic error of $\\pm 5^\\circ$ in $\\theta$. Let the actual angle be $\\theta = 90^\\circ + \\epsilon$.\n    -   For the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group, the intensity becomes $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2(90^\\circ + \\epsilon)) = \\sin(180^\\circ + 2\\epsilon) = -\\sin(2\\epsilon)$. For small $\\epsilon$ (in radians), this is approximately $-2\\epsilon$. This is a first-order dependence on the error $\\epsilon$.\n    -   For the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group, the intensity becomes $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\sin(90^\\circ + \\epsilon) + \\sin(3(90^\\circ + \\epsilon)) = \\cos(\\epsilon) + \\sin(270^\\circ + 3\\epsilon) = \\cos(\\epsilon) - \\cos(3\\epsilon)$. Using the Taylor series $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/2$, this becomes approximately $(1-\\epsilon^2/2) - (1-9\\epsilon^2/2) = 4\\epsilon^2$. This is a second-order dependence on the error $\\epsilon$.\n    -   The analysis shows that a small error in the $90^\\circ$ pulse will cause a leakage signal for a $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group that is linearly proportional to the error, while the leakage for a $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group is proportional to the square of the error. Thus, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ groups are much more sensitive to this imperfection than $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ groups. This is perfectly consistent with observing a weak signal for $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ but none for $\\mathrm{CH_3}$. Quantitatively, the ratio of the observed $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ signal in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ ($0.08$) to DEPT-$45^\\circ$ ($0.55$) is $0.08/0.55 \\approx 0.145$. For DEPT-45, the $\\theta$-dependence is $\\sin(2\\times45^\\circ) = 1$. The leakage is $\\sin(2\\epsilon)$. Setting $|\\sin(2\\epsilon)| \\approx 0.145$ gives $2|\\epsilon| \\approx 0.146$ rad, or $|\\epsilon| \\approx 0.073$ rad, which is $\\approx 4.2^\\circ$. This value is well within the stated experimental error of $\\pm 5^\\circ$.\n\n-   **J-Coupling Mismatch**: The evolution delay is $\\tau = 1/(2J_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 1/(2 \\times 135) \\approx 3.7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The actual couplings are ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH_3}}=125\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This mismatch means that the creation of antiphase magnetization is not perfectly efficient. The efficiency is modulated by a factor dependent on $\\sin(\\pi J \\cdot 2\\tau) = \\sin(\\pi J/J_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. This factor scales the overall intensity of the DEPT signal but, in the first-order approximation, does not break the nulling condition at $\\theta=90^\\circ$. However, in a complete description of the spin dynamics, especially in concert with other imperfections like pulse errors, a $J$-mismatch can contribute to imperfect cancellation of magnetization pathways. It is a real experimental factor that influences signal intensities and can compound other errors.\n\n-   **Transverse Relaxation ($T_2$)**: The total time for the DEPT polarization transfer is on the order of $2\\tau$ or more, during which transverse magnetization decays with a time constant $T_2$. Since $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2}) = 80\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is shorter than $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_3})=120\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the signal from the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group will be more attenuated than the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal. This contributes to the observed relative intensities but is not the primary cause of the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ leakage.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The weak DEPT-$90^\\circ$ methylene signal arises from incomplete cancellation for an even number of attached protons when ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ deviates from $J_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, compounded by flip-angle imperfection within $\\pm 5^\\circ$ and additional attenuation from the shorter $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2})$ during the evolution periods. The DEPT-$135^\\circ$ phase pattern (upright $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, inverted $\\mathrm{CH_2}$) and the APT phase pattern (upright odd, inverted even) are consistent with these assignments.**\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.** This option correctly assigns the carbons. Its explanation for the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ leakage correctly identifies flip-angle imperfection as a key cause and notes that it is compounded by other real physical effects ($J$-mismatch and $T_2$ relaxation). The relative contributions are described plausibly. The confirmation from DEPT-135 and APT is also correct. This is the most complete and physically justified explanation. While the statement that $J$-mismatch itself causes incomplete cancellation is a simplification of a more complex effect, its inclusion as a compounding factor alongside the primary cause (flip-angle error) is reasonable in a practical context.\n\n-   **B. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$. The unusual DEPT-$90^\\circ$ signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is due to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect amplifying the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ response.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The assignment of signals is incorrect, contradicting chemical shift principles, APT, and DEPT-135 data. The explanation is also physically unsound. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a relaxation-based phenomenon affecting signal intensity, it does not create signals where a null is predicted by the coherent evolution of the DEPT sequence.\n\n-   **C. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The weak DEPT-$90^\\circ$ signal is entirely explained by $T_1$ differences alone; ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ mismatch and flip-angle errors do not contribute appreciably to DEPT selection or residuals.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The assignment is correct, but the explanation is flawed. $T_1$ relaxation governs the recovery of magnetization between scans and does not influence the coherent spin evolution within a single DEPT sequence, which is what determines the multiplicity selection. Stating that flip-angle errors do not contribute is fundamentally wrong, as this is the primary cause of such leakage.\n\n-   **D. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The residual DEPT-$90^\\circ$ methylene signal must be attributed exclusively to phase-cycling errors; under ideal DEPT, the scalar coupling dependence eliminates any possibility of $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ leakage regardless of ${}^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ dispersion or relaxation.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** While imperfect phase cycling can cause artifacts, attributing the signal *exclusively* to this is an overstatement that incorrectly dismisses other major causes. The claim that no leakage is possible under ideal DEPT regardless of other factors is false, as a miscalibration of the $\\theta$ pulse (a deviation from the ideal value of $90^\\circ$) is a classic and well-understood cause of leakage.\n\n-   **E. The APT phase report must be incorrect because ethanol contains a quaternary carbon near $\\delta \\approx 58\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$; therefore the inverted DEPT-$135^\\circ$ peak at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ corresponds to a quaternary site, not $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** This statement contains multiple factual errors. Ethanol has no quaternary carbon. An inverted DEPT-$135^\\circ$ signal is the characteristic signature of a $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group. Quaternary carbons are not observed in DEPT spectra at all because the experiment relies on polarization transfer from attached protons.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a minimal recycle delay, denoted as $d_1$, for a Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) NMR experiment. This delay must be sufficient to allow both proton ($^1$H) and carbon ($^{13}$C) longitudinal magnetizations to recover to at least $95\\%$ of their thermal equilibrium values, thereby avoiding saturation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the recovery of longitudinal magnetization, $M_z(t)$, from an initial state $M_z(0)$ over a time interval $t$ is the solution to the Bloch equation for spin-lattice relaxation:\n$$M_z(t) = M_0 - (M_0 - M_z(0)) e^{-t/T_1}$$\nwhere $M_0$ is the equilibrium magnetization and $T_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxation time. This can be rewritten as:\n$$M_z(t) = M_0 (1 - e^{-t/T_1}) + M_z(0) e^{-t/T_1}$$\n\nWe will apply this law separately to the proton and carbon nuclei, using the specified conditions for each.
