            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of quaternary carbon signals in an unknown aromatic compound, $X$, from provided ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) spectroscopic data.\n\nFirst, let us perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The unknown compound $X$ contains a benzenoid ring with an alkoxy substituent.\n- Compound $X$ also contains a heteroaromatic ring with a ring nitrogen that is part of the $\\pi$ system.\n- A broadband decoupled ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR spectrum shows $8$ distinct signals in the aromatic region at chemical shifts $\\delta = 162.4$, $157.8$, $149.2$, $137.0$, $129.4$, $124.6$, $117.8$, and $114.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- A DEPT-135 experiment shows positive signals at $\\delta = 129.4$, $124.6$, $117.8$, and $114.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- The DEPT-135 spectrum shows no signals (null signals) at $\\delta = 162.4$, $157.8$, $149.2$, and $137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- The question is to identify the subset of signals corresponding to quaternary aromatic or heteroaromatic carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The use of ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopy to determine carbon multiplicities is a standard and fundamental technique in organic structure elucidation. The chemical shift values provided are realistic for the described chemical environment (aromatic carbons, carbons attached to oxygen in an alkoxy group, and carbons in a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring). The problem is well-posed, as the data provided are sufficient and internally consistent to lead to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem statement is valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the interpretation of DEPT spectra. The DEPT pulse sequence is designed to distinguish carbon signals based on the number of directly attached hydrogen atoms. The DEPT-135 experiment, specifically, provides the following information:\n- Carbons with one attached hydrogen (methine, $\\mathrm{CH}$) produce positive signals.\n- Carbons with two attached hydrogens (methylene, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$) produce negative signals.\n- Carbons with three attached hydrogens (methyl, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$) produce positive signals.\n- Carbons with no attached hydrogens (quaternary, $\\mathrm{C}$) produce no signal (a null result).\n\nThe problem provides data from two experiments: a broadband ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spectrum, which shows all carbon signals, and a DEPT-135 spectrum, which is edited based on the rules above.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data:\n1.  **Broadband ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signals**: $\\delta = 162.4, 157.8, 149.2, 137.0, 129.4, 124.6, 117.8, 114.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. These represent all $8$ unique carbon environments in the aromatic region of the molecule.\n\n2.  **DEPT-135 positive signals**: $\\delta = 129.4, 124.6, 117.8, 114.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. According to the rules of DEPT-135, positive signals correspond to either $\\mathrm{CH}$ or $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ groups. Since these signals are in the aromatic region (typically $\\delta > 100 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$), they must be assigned to $\\mathrm{CH}$ (methine) carbons. $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ carbons in typical organic molecules resonate at much higher fields (lower $\\delta$ values).\n\n3.  **DEPT-135 null signals**: $\\delta = 162.4, 157.8, 149.2, 137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. These signals are present in the broadband spectrum but are absent from the DEPT-135 spectrum. According to the rules, this indicates that these signals arise from carbons with no directly attached hydrogens. Therefore, these are the quaternary carbons.\n\nThe problem statement directs us to use \"first principles of chemical shielding\". These principles explain the *positions* ($\\delta$ values) of the signals. For instance, the very deshielded signals at $\\delta = 162.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta = 157.8 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ are characteristic of aromatic carbons directly bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom (e.g., in an alkoxy group, where C-OR typically appears in the $\\delta = 155-165 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ range). Similarly, the signal at $\\delta = 149.2 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ is typical for a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom in a heteroaromatic ring (e.g., $\\alpha$-carbons in pyridine). While these principles help to understand the structural origin of the shifts, they are not the primary tool for determining the multiplicity (i.e., whether a carbon is quaternary). The definitive information for identifying quaternary carbons is provided by the DEPT-135 experiment.\n\nBased on the direct interpretation of the DEPT-135 data, the set of signals corresponding to quaternary aromatic or heteroaromatic carbons is $\\{\\delta = 162.4, 157.8, 149.2, 137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}\\}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A: $\\delta = 162.4$, $157.8$, $149.2$, and $137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis option lists all the signals that are absent (nulled) in the DEPT-135 spectrum. As per the principles of the DEPT-135 experiment, these signals correspond to quaternary carbons. This option is consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **B: $\\delta = 162.4$ and $149.2 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis option is an incomplete list. It omits the signals at $\\delta = 157.8 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta = 137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, which are also absent in the DEPT-135 spectrum and are therefore also quaternary carbons.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **C: $\\delta = 157.8$, $137.0$, and $129.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis option incorrectly includes the signal at $\\delta = 129.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. This signal is positive in the DEPT-135 spectrum, identifying it as a $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbon, not a quaternary carbon. The list is also incomplete, as it omits the quaternary carbon signals at $\\delta = 162.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta = 149.2 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **D: $\\delta = 162.4$, $157.8$, and $129.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nSimilar to option C, this option incorrectly includes the signal at $\\delta = 129.4 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, which corresponds to a $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbon. It also omits the quaternary carbon signals at $\\delta = 149.2 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta = 137.0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies the complete set of quaternary carbon signals based on the provided spectroscopic data is A.",

We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to establish an affine calibration that maps computed nuclear shielding constants to experimental chemical shifts, determine the calibration parameters via a least-squares fit to a training dataset, and apply the resulting model to predict chemical shifts for a test set.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Calibration Model**\n\nThe relationship between the Larmor frequency $\\nu$ of a nucleus, the external magnetic field $B_0$, the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$, and the dimensionless isotropic shielding constant $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma) $$\nThe chemical shift $\\delta$, expressed in parts per million (ppm), is defined relative to a reference compound (e.g., TMS):\n$$ \\delta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10^6 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ for both the sample and the reference:\n$$ \\delta = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}})}\\right) \\times 10^6 $$\nThe terms $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0$ cancel, yielding:\n$$ \\delta = \\left(\\frac{(1 - \\sigma) - (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10^6 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma}{1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10^6 $$\nSince nuclear shielding constants $\\sigma$ are typically on the order of ppm ($10^{-6}$), the term $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the denominator is very small compared to $1$. Thus, $1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\approx 1$. The theoretical relationship simplifies to:\n$$ \\delta \\approx (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma) \\times 10^6 $$\nIf the shielding values $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are themselves expressed in units of ppm, the relation is ideally $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ppm}} \\approx \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref, ppm}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ppm}}$.\n\nHowever, computed shieldings ($\\sigma^{\\mathrm{calc}}$) from methods like GIAO-DFT are subject to systematic errors from the chosen functional, basis set, and other approximations. To correct for these biases, an empirical affine calibration is employed. We model the predicted experimental chemical shift, $\\delta^{\\mathrm{pred}}$, as a linear function of the computed shielding difference, $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\mathrm{calc}} - \\sigma^{\\mathrm{calc}}$:\n$$ \\delta_i^{\\mathrm{pred}} = m \\cdot (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\mathrm{calc}} - \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}) + c $$\nHere, $m$ is a slope parameter that corrects for scaling errors, and $c$ is an intercept that corrects for a constant offset.

The model is a simple linear regression: $y_i \\approx m x_i + c$.\n\n**Step 2: Least-Squares Determination of Parameters**\n\nThe parameters $m$ and $c$ are determined by minimizing the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the model's predictions and the experimental values for the training set:\n$$ \\mathrm{SSE}(m, c) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\delta_i^{\\mathrm{exp}} - \\delta_i^{\\mathrm{pred}})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2 $$\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives of $\\mathrm{SSE}$ with respect to $m$ and $c$ to zero, which yields the normal equations of the linear least-squares problem:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\mathrm{SSE})}{\\partial m} = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i(y_i - m x_i - c) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\mathrm{SSE})}{\\partial c} = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - m x_i - c) = 0 $$\nThis leads to a system of two linear equations for $m$ and $c$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \\\\\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i & N\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} m \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i y_i \\\\\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe solution to this system gives the well-known formulas for the slope and intercept:\n$$ m = \\frac{N \\sum x_i y_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\n$$ c = \\bar{y} - m \\bar{x}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum x_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum y_i $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Calibration Parameters**\n\nWe use the provided training data and the fixed computed reference shielding $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\mathrm{calc}} = 188.000000$ ppm.
