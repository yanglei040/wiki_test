The convolution of a Gaussian with a rectangular function is not strictly a Gaussian. However, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the convolution of multiple functions will tend toward a Gaussian shape. Given that two of the three PSFs are Gaussian, it is a very good approximation to treat the final effective PSF as a Gaussian with variance $\\sigma_{eff}^2$.\n\nUsing this approximation, we can relate the effective FWHM back to the total variance using the same formula derived for a Gaussian:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff} = 2\\sigma_{eff}\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\sigma_{eff}^2 \\ln(2)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the total variance:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\ln(2) \\left( \\sigma_L^2 + \\sigma_P^2 + \\sigma_R^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual variances in terms of their characteristic parameters ($\\text{FWHM}_L$, $\\text{FWHM}_P$, and $w$):\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{\\text{FWHM}_L^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{\\text{FWHM}_P^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{w^2}{12} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the explicit analytic expression for the effective FWHM squared:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = \\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{12}w^2 = \\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}w^2\n$$\nThe effective FWHM is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff} = \\sqrt{\\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}w^2}\n$$\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe substitute the given values: $\\text{FWHM}_L = 30\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $\\text{FWHM}_P = 12\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, and $w = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = (30)^2 + (12)^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}(10)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 900 + 144 + \\frac{200\\ln(2)}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 1044 + \\frac{200\\ln(2)}{3}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 \\approx 1044 + \\frac{200 \\times 0.69314718}{3} \\approx 1044 + 46.209812\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 \\approx 1090.209812\n$$\nTaking the square root to find the effective FWHM:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff} \\approx \\sqrt{1090.209812} \\approx 33.018325\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $33.02\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.",
