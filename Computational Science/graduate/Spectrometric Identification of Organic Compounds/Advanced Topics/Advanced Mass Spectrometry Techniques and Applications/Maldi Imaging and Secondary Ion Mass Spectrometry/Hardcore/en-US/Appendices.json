Modeling the overall blur in an imaging system as the convolution of individual point-spread functions is a standard and fundamental concept in optics and signal processing. The use of Gaussian functions for laser beams and diffusion-like processes (plume spread) and a rectangular function for pixel sampling are common and valid approximations.

It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\nThe overall point-spread function, $\\text{PSF}_{eff}(x)$, is the convolution of the three contributing functions: the laser profile, $f_L(x)$; the plume spread, $f_P(x)$; and the rectangular pixel function, $f_R(x)$.\n$$\n\\text{PSF}_{eff}(x) = (f_L * f_P * f_R)(x)\n$$\nwhere $*$ denotes the convolution operation.\n\nA fundamental property of convolution, as prompted by the problem statement, is that the variance (the second central moment, $\\mu_2$) of the resulting function is the sum of the variances of the individual functions, assuming they are independent.\n$$\n\\sigma_{eff}^2 = \\sigma_L^2 + \\sigma_P^2 + \\sigma_R^2\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma^2$ is used to denote the variance.

Variance of a Gaussian function from its FWHM**\n\nA Gaussian function centered at $x=0$ is given by $g(x) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. The maximum value is $A$ at $x=0$.

Variance of a Uniform Rectangular function**\n\nThe pixel basis function is a uniform rectangular (top-hat) distribution of width $w=10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. For a uniform distribution defined on the interval $[a, b]$, the variance is $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$. For a function centered at zero on the interval $[-w/2, w/2]$, the width is $b-a = w$.\nThus, the variance of the rectangular pixel function is:\n$$\n\\sigma_R^2 = \\frac{w^2}{12}\n$$\nWith $w = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_R^2 = \\frac{(10\\,\\mu\\text{m})^2}{12} = \\frac{100}{12}\\,(\\mu\\text{m})^2 = \\frac{25}{3}\\,(\\mu\\text{m})^2\n$$\n\n**3.

The convolution of a Gaussian with a rectangular function is not strictly a Gaussian. However, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the convolution of multiple functions will tend toward a Gaussian shape. Given that two of the three PSFs are Gaussian, it is a very good approximation to treat the final effective PSF as a Gaussian with variance $\\sigma_{eff}^2$.\n\nUsing this approximation, we can relate the effective FWHM back to the total variance using the same formula derived for a Gaussian:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff} = 2\\sigma_{eff}\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\sigma_{eff}^2 \\ln(2)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the total variance:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\ln(2) \\left( \\sigma_L^2 + \\sigma_P^2 + \\sigma_R^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual variances in terms of their characteristic parameters ($\\text{FWHM}_L$, $\\text{FWHM}_P$, and $w$):\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = 8 \\ln(2) \\left( \\frac{\\text{FWHM}_L^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{\\text{FWHM}_P^2}{8\\ln(2)} + \\frac{w^2}{12} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the explicit analytic expression for the effective FWHM squared:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff}^2 = \\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{12}w^2 = \\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}w^2\n$$\nThe effective FWHM is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM}_{eff} = \\sqrt{\\text{FWHM}_L^2 + \\text{FWHM}_P^2 + \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{3}w^2}\n$$\n\n**4.

It is a standard problem in applied statistics, free from scientific flaws, ambiguity, or inconsistencies.

We define two events:\n-   $E_A$: ion $A$ is present in the pixel.\n-   $E_B$: ion $B$ is present in the pixel.\n\nThe problem provides the probabilities of these events, which are interpreted as the underlying probabilities for a random pixel to contain each ion:\n-   $P(E_A) = p_A = 0.20$\n-   $P(E_B) = p_B = 0.15$\n\nThe null hypothesis states that these events are independent. Co-localization occurs when both $A$ and $B$ are present in the same pixel, which corresponds to the intersection of the events $E_A$ and $E_B$. Under independence, the probability of co-localization in any single pixel, denoted $p_{AB}$, is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$p_{AB} = P(E_A \\cap E_B) = P(E_A) \\times P(E_B) = p_A \\times p_B$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_{AB} = 0.20 \\times 0.15 = 0.03$$\nThis is the probability of success (i.e., co-localization) in a single Bernoulli trial corresponding to one pixel.\n\nThe analysis is performed over $n = 10,000$ pixels, and each pixel is assumed to be an independent trial. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of co-localized pixels in the entire $n$-pixel mask. As $X$ is the sum of $n$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a success probability of $p_{AB}$, $X$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_{AB})$$\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of $X$ is given by:\n$$P(X = j) = \\binom{n}{j} (p_{AB})^j (1 - p_{AB})^{n-j}$$\nfor $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of observing at least $k = 360$ co-localized pixels. This corresponds to calculating $P(X \\ge 360)$, which is the sum:\n$$P(X \\ge 360) = \\sum_{j=360}^{10000} \\binom{10000}{j} (0.03)^j (1 - 0.03)^{10000-j}$$\nDirect computation of this sum is prohibitive. However, for a binomial distribution with a large number of trials $n$, we can use the normal approximation provided certain conditions are met. The conditions are that $n p_{AB}$ and $n(1 - p_{AB})$ should both be sufficiently large (typically $> 5$).\n\nLet's calculate the mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the binomial distribution $X$:\n$$\\mu = n p_{AB} = 10,000 \\times 0.03 = 300$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = n p_{AB} (1 - p_{AB}) = 10,000 \\times 0.03 \\times (1 - 0.03) = 300 \\times 0.97 = 291$$\nThe standard deviation is:\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{291} \\approx 17.0587$$\nSince $\\mu = 300 > 5$ and $n(1 - p_{AB}) = 9700 > 5$, the normal approximation is well-justified. We approximate the discrete binomial distribution $X$ with a continuous normal distribution $Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, i.e., $Y \\sim N(300, 291)$.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the approximation, we apply a continuity correction. The probability for a discrete variable $P(X \\ge 360)$ is approximated by the area under the normal curve for values of $360 - 0.5$ and greater:\n$$P(X \\ge 360) \\approx P(Y \\ge 359.5)$$\nTo find this probability, we standardize the value $359.5$ by converting it to a Z-score. The Z-score is calculated as:\n$$Z = \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n$$Z = \\frac{359.5 - 300}{\\sqrt{291}} = \\frac{59.5}{\\sqrt{291}} \\approx 3.487900$$\nThe desired probability is thus the probability that a standard normal random variable $Z$ is greater than or equal to this value:\n$$P(X \\ge 360) \\approx P(Z \\ge 3.487900)$$\nThis is a small tail probability of the standard normal distribution. Using standard statistical tables or a computational function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$, we find:\n$$P(Z \\ge 3.487900) = 1 - P(Z < 3.487900) = 1 - \\Phi(3.487900)$$\nThe value of $\\Phi(3.487900)$ is approximately $0.9997564$. Therefore, the probability is:\n$$P(X \\ge 360) \\approx 1 - 0.9997564 = 0.0002436$$\nThis p-value represents the probability that, if the ion distributions were truly independent, random chance would produce an observation of $360$ or more co-localized pixels. The small value suggests that the observed co-localization is statistically significant and likely not due to random chance, thus providing evidence against the null hypothesis of independence.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get $0.0002436$.",
