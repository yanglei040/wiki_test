This practice revisits the core principles of this separation by deriving the relationship between a compound's retention time ($t_R$) and its retention factor ($k'$), a dimensionless measure of its partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases.

            "problem": "A solute is analyzed by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) under isocratic conditions in a reversed-phase column at constant volumetric flow. The mass spectrometric detector is operated in Electrospray Ionization (ESI) mode and records the unretained tracer peak to determine column dead time. The retention behavior follows the linear partitioning regime, and extra-column effects are negligible. The column dead time measured by an unretained species is $t_{0} = 18.75 \\text{ s}$. An independent thermodynamic characterization of the solute under the same mobile phase composition yields a retention factor $k' = 1.04$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of retention in isocratic liquid chromatography—specifically, the time-based definition of the retention factor—derive the expression for the retention time $t_{R}$ in terms of $t_{0}$ and $k'$, compute $t_{R}$ for the solute, and evaluate the first-order sensitivity of $t_{R}$ to small changes in $k'$ at $k' \\approx 1$ by calculating $\\left.\\frac{d t_{R}}{d k'}\\right|_{k' = 1}$.\n\nExpress the retention time in seconds and the sensitivity in seconds per unit change in $k'$.

It provides a complete set of consistent data and definitions to derive and compute the requested quantities based on fundamental principles of chromatography.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, the derivation of the retention time ($t_{R}$) as a function of column dead time ($t_{0}$) and retention factor ($k'$); second, the computation of $t_{R}$ using the provided values; and third, the evaluation of the first-order sensitivity of $t_{R}$ to changes in $k'$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the retention time, $t_{R}$. The problem specifies using the time-based definition of the retention factor, $k'$. The retention factor is defined as the ratio of the time a solute spends in the stationary phase, $t_{s}$, to the time it spends in the mobile phase, $t_{m}$.\n$$k' = \\frac{t_{s}}{t_{m}}$$\nThe total time a solute spends in the column, its retention time $t_{R}$, is the sum of the time spent in the mobile phase and the time spent in the stationary phase.\n$$t_{R} = t_{m} + t_{s}$$\nUnder the given conditions, the time spent by a solute in the mobile phase, $t_{m}$, is equivalent to the time it takes for an unretained species to elute. This is, by definition, the column dead time, $t_{0}$.\n$$t_{m} = t_{0}$$\nWe can now substitute $t_{0}$ for $t_{m}$ in the equations for $t_{R}$ and $k'$.\n$$t_{R} = t_{0} + t_{s}$$\n$$k' = \\frac{t_{s}}{t_{0}}$$\nFrom the second equation, we can express the time spent in the stationary phase, $t_{s}$, in terms of $k'$ and $t_{0}$.\n$$t_{s} = k' t_{0}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $t_{s}$ into the equation for $t_{R}$ gives:\n$$t_{R} = t_{0} + k' t_{0}$$\nFactoring out $t_{0}$, we arrive at the fundamental equation relating retention time, dead time, and retention factor in isocratic chromatography. This is the required expression.\n$$t_{R} = t_{0} (1 + k')$$\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value for $t_{R}$ using the provided data: $t_{0} = 18.75 \\text{ s}$ and $k' = 1.04$. Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$t_{R} = 18.75 \\text{ s} \\times (1 + 1.04)$$\n$$t_{R} = 18.75 \\text{ s} \\times 2.04$$\n$$t_{R} = 38.25 \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The calculated value $38.25$ already has four significant figures.\n\nThird, we evaluate the first-order sensitivity of $t_{R}$ to small changes in $k'$ at $k' \\approx 1$. This sensitivity is given by the derivative of $t_{R}$ with respect to $k'$, evaluated at the specified point. We start with the derived functional form of $t_{R}(k')$.\n$$t_{R}(k') = t_{0} (1 + k') = t_{0} + t_{0} k'$$\nWe then differentiate this expression with respect to $k'$, treating $t_{0}$ as a constant.\n$$\\frac{d t_{R}}{d k'} = \\frac{d}{d k'} (t_{0} + t_{0} k') = 0 + t_{0} = t_{0}$$\nThe sensitivity of retention time with respect to the retention factor is constant and equal to the dead time, $t_{0}$, for all values of $k'$ in the linear regime. The problem asks for this sensitivity to be evaluated at $k' = 1$.\n$$\\left.\\frac{d t_{R}}{d k'}\\right|_{k' = 1} = t_{0}$$\nUsing the given value for the dead time:\n$$\\left.\\frac{d t_{R}}{d k'}\\right|_{k' = 1} = 18.75 \\text{ s}$$\nThe units are seconds per unit change in $k'$, which is dimensionless, so the unit of the sensitivity is seconds. The problem requires rounding this result to four significant figures. The value $18.75$ already has four significant figures.\n\nIn summary, the retention time is $38.25 \\text{ s}$ and the sensitivity of the retention time to the retention factor is $18.75 \\text{ s}$.",

Subsequently, their absolute difference must be determined and its significance in the context of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) must be explained.\n\nFirst, we address the calculation of the monoisotopic mass, $M_{mono}$. By definition, this is the mass of the isotopologue containing only the most abundant stable isotope of each constituent element.

The instrument detects a series of peaks representing the isotopic distribution, or \"isotopic fine structure,\" of the molecule. The most intense peak in this cluster for a typical organic molecule (composed primarily of C, H, N, O) corresponds to the monoisotopic mass, $M_{mono}$, where all atoms are the most abundant stable isotope. In contrast, low-resolution instruments (e.g., some quadrupole analyzers) may not resolve this fine structure and instead measure a single, broader peak whose centroid approximates the average mass, $M_{avg}$.\n\n2.  **Calibration and Identification**: High-resolution LC-MS systems are calibrated using standards with known *exact masses*. Consequently, the measured mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of an analyte corresponds to its exact mass. For compound identification, the experimentally measured exact mass is compared against a calculated *monoisotopic mass* derived from a candidate molecular formula. Using the average mass ($380.874$ Da) to identify a compound whose measured monoisotopic peak is at $m/z \\approx 380.084$ (for the $[M+H]^+$ ion, for instance) would result in a mass error of approximately $0.8$ Da, or $800$ mDa. This error is enormous by the standards of high-resolution mass spectrometry, where mass accuracy is typically required to be below $5$ parts per million (ppm). For a mass of $380$ Da, a $5$ ppm error corresponds to only $0.0019$ Da. Therefore, using the wrong mass concept leads to certain misidentification.\n\n3.  **Significance of Halogenation**: The presence of chlorine in the molecule $\\mathrm{C}_{17}\\mathrm{H}_{19}\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{Cl}$ is the primary reason for the large difference between $M_{mono}$ and $M_{avg}$. Chlorine has two stable isotopes: $^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ (abundance $\\approx 75.77\\%$, mass $\\approx 34.969$ Da) and $^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ (abundance $\\approx 24.23\\%$, mass $\\approx 36.966$ Da). Because $^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ is both heavy and highly abundant, it significantly skews the average atomic weight ($35.453$ Da) to a value much higher than the monoisotopic mass of $^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$. This results in a prominent A+2 peak (the peak for the isotopologue containing one $^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ atom) in the mass spectrum, with an intensity approximately one-third that of the monoisotopic peak (A peak). This characteristic isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom, greatly increasing the confidence in a proposed molecular formula. The large calculated difference, $|\\Delta M| \\approx 0.79$ Da, is a quantitative reflection of this isotopic composition and underscores why precise mass measurements in high-resolution MS must be evaluated against the monoisotopic mass, not the average mass.",

A neutral molecule of mass $M$ acquires a positive charge by adducting $n$ protons ($H^+$). The mass of a single proton is given as $m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$. The total mass of the resulting ion, $m_{ion}$, is therefore the sum of the neutral molecule's mass and the mass of the adducted protons:\n$$m_{ion} = M + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$$\nThe charge of this ion is $n$ elementary charges. In mass spectrometry, the charge is conventionally denoted by the integer $n$. Thus, the mass-to-charge ratio is given by:\n$$ \\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{m_{ion}}{n} = \\frac{M + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} $$\n\nThe problem describes an isotopic envelope with two consecutive peaks. The first peak corresponds to the ion containing only the most abundant isotopes, in this case, primarily $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$. Let us denote the neutral mass of this monoisotopic species as $M_0$. The mass-to-charge ratio for this first peak, $(m/z)_1$, is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_1 = \\frac{M_0 + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} $$\n\nThe second consecutive peak is stated to result from the substitution of one $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom with one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom.

Therefore, the neutral mass of this heavier isotopologue, $M_1$, is:\n$$ M_1 = M_0 + \\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}} $$\nThe mass-to-charge ratio for the ion containing this heavier isotopologue, $(m/z)_2$, is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_2 = \\frac{M_1 + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} = \\frac{(M_0 + \\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}}) + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} $$\n\nThe spacing between these consecutive isotopic peaks, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is the difference between their mass-to-charge ratios:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_2 - \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_1 $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\left( \\frac{M_0 + \\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}} + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{M_0 + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} \\right) $$\nCombining the terms over the common denominator $n$:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\frac{(M_0 + \\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}} + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}) - (M_0 + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}})}{n} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\frac{M_0 + \\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}} + n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}} - M_0 - n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{n} $$\nThe terms $M_0$ and $n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$ cancel out, yielding the final expression for the isotopic spacing as a function of $n$ and $\\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta m_{\\mathrm{C}}}{n} $$\nThis expression demonstrates a fundamental principle of high-resolution mass spectrometry: the spacing between isotopic peaks in the $m/z$ spectrum is inversely proportional to the charge state of the ion.\n\nNext, we use this derived relationship to determine the charge state $n$ from the experimental data.
