This practice bridges the gap between the theoretical concept of an analyte's partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, quantified by the distribution constant $K$, and the final observable measurement—its retention time, $t_R$.

            "problem": "A wall-coated open tubular column is used in Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Consider an isothermal, steady-state separation in which the analyte obeys a linear partition isotherm between the stationary phase and the carrier gas. The distribution constant $K$ is defined by $K = C_{s}/C_{m}$, where $C_{s}$ and $C_{m}$ are the analyte concentrations in the stationary phase and mobile phase, respectively. The capacity factor $k'$ is defined by the ratio of the amount of analyte in the stationary phase to that in the mobile phase under equilibrium within the migrating zone. The column has internal radius $r_{i}$ and a uniform stationary-phase film thickness $d_{f}$. For a cylindrical wall-coated film, the stationary phase volume per unit length and mobile phase volume per unit length are those of a thin annulus and a circle, respectively.\n\nStarting from these definitions and geometric relations, derive an expression for $k'$ in terms of $K$, $r_{i}$, and $d_{f}$, and subsequently derive the relation between the retention time $t_{R}$ and the dead (unretained) time $t_{M}$ under the ideal assumptions of local phase equilibrium, negligible extra-column effects, and negligible compressibility of the carrier gas.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of chromatography, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. All necessary definitions, conditions, and data are provided to derive the required expressions and compute the numerical answer.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part solution: first, the derivation of an expression for the capacity factor $k'$; second, the derivation of the relationship between retention time $t_{R}$ and dead time $t_{M}$; third, the computation of $t_{R}$ for the given parameters; and fourth, a chemical interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Capacity Factor, $k'**$\n\nThe capacity factor, $k'$, is defined as the ratio of the total amount (moles) of analyte in the stationary phase, $n_s$, to the total amount in the mobile phase, $n_m$, within a specific region of the column at equilibrium.\n$$k' = \\frac{n_s}{n_m}$$\nThe amount of analyte in a phase is the product of its concentration and the volume of that phase. Let $V_s$ and $V_m$ be the volumes of the stationary and mobile phases, respectively, within a given length of the column.\n$$n_s = C_s V_s$$\n$$n_m = C_m V_m$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $k'$ yields:\n$$k' = \\frac{C_s V_s}{C_m V_m}$$\nThe problem defines the distribution constant (or partition coefficient) $K$ as the ratio of the analyte concentration in the stationary phase, $C_s$, to that in the mobile phase, $C_m$.\n$$K = \\frac{C_s}{C_m}$$\nUsing this definition, the expression for $k'$ becomes:\n$$k' = K \\left(\\frac{V_s}{V_m}\\right)$$\nThe ratio $V_m/V_s$ is often denoted as the phase ratio, $\\beta$. Thus, $k' = K/\\beta$. We must now determine the volume ratio $V_s/V_m$ from the geometry of the wall-coated open tubular (WCOT) column. For a uniform column of length $L$, the volumes are the product of the cross-sectional area of each phase and the length $L$.\n$$V_s = A_s L$$\n$$V_m = A_m L$$\nThe volume ratio is therefore equivalent to the cross-sectional area ratio:\n$$\\frac{V_s}{V_m} = \\frac{A_s}{A_m}$$\nThe mobile phase occupies the central cylindrical core of the column, which has an internal radius $r_i$. Its cross-sectional area $A_m$ is:\n$$A_m = \\pi r_i^2$$\nThe stationary phase is a thin film of thickness $d_f$ coated on the inner wall. The cross-sectional area of this phase, $A_s$, is that of an annulus with outer radius $r_i$ and inner radius $(r_i - d_f)$.\n$$A_s = \\pi r_i^2 - \\pi(r_i - d_f)^2 = \\pi \\left(r_i^2 - (r_i^2 - 2r_i d_f + d_f^2)\\right) = \\pi(2r_i d_f - d_f^2)$$\nFor a WCOT column, the film thickness $d_f$ is typically much smaller than the internal radius $r_i$ (i.e., $d_f \\ll r_i$). This justifies the designation \"thin film\". Under this condition, the $d_f^2$ term is negligible compared to the $2r_i d_f$ term. The cross-sectional area of the stationary phase can be accurately approximated as:\n$$A_s \\approx 2\\pi r_i d_f$$\nNow, we can compute the area ratio:\n$$\\frac{A_s}{A_m} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi r_i d_f}{\\pi r_i^2} = \\frac{2d_f}{r_i}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $k'$ yields the desired relationship:\n$$k' = K \\left(\\frac{2d_f}{r_i}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Relationship between $t_{R}$ and $t_{M}$**\n\nThe dead time, $t_{M}$, is the time required for an unretained species to travel the full length of the column, $L$. It is determined by the average linear velocity of the mobile phase (carrier gas), $\\bar{u}$.\n$$t_{M} = \\frac{L}{\\bar{u}}$$\nA retained analyte, however, partitions between the mobile and stationary phases. It only moves down the column when it is in the mobile phase. Under the assumption of local equilibrium, the fraction of time an analyte molecule spends in the mobile phase is equal to the fraction of all analyte molecules in the mobile phase at any instant. This fraction, $f_m$, is:\n$$f_m = \\frac{n_m}{n_m + n_s}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $n_m$:\n$$f_m = \\frac{1}{1 + n_s/n_m} = \\frac{1}{1+k'}$$\nThe average velocity of the analyte band, $v_{analyte}$, is the mobile phase velocity $\\bar{u}$ multiplied by the fraction of time the analyte spends in the mobile phase:\n$$v_{analyte} = \\bar{u} \\cdot f_m = \\bar{u} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+k'}\\right)$$\nThe retention time, $t_R$, is the total time required for the analyte band to travel the column length $L$ at this average velocity:\n$$t_R = \\frac{L}{v_{analyte}} = \\frac{L}{\\bar{u} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+k'}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{L}{\\bar{u}}\\right)(1+k')$$\nRecognizing that $t_M = L/\\bar{u}$, we arrive at the fundamental chromatographic equation relating retention time and capacity factor:\n$$t_R = t_M (1+k')$$\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Retention Time, $t_{R}$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nDistribution constant, $K = 150$ (dimensionless)\nInternal radius, $r_i = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\nFilm thickness, $d_f = 0.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\nDead time, $t_M = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the capacity factor $k'$ using the expression derived in Part 1. It is critical that $r_i$ and $d_f$ are in consistent units for the ratio.\n$$k' = K \\left(\\frac{2d_f}{r_i}\\right) = 150 \\left(\\frac{2 \\times (0.25 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{0.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right)$$\n$$k' = 150 \\left(\\frac{0.50 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.25 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = 150 (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.30$$\nThe capacity factor is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we calculate the retention time $t_R$ using the relationship derived in Part 2.\n$$t_R = t_M (1+k') = (2.0\\ \\mathrm{min})(1 + 0.30)$$\n$$t_R = (2.0\\ \\mathrm{min})(1.30) = 2.6\\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to round the final numerical result to four significant figures. While the input data contain only two significant figures, we must follow the specific instruction provided.\n$$t_R = 2.600\\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n\n**Part 4: Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe calculated capacity factor is $k' = 0.30$. A capacity factor less than $1$ signifies that, at equilibrium, the analyte spends more time in the mobile phase than in the stationary phase. In this case, the ratio of time spent in the stationary phase to time spent in the mobile phase is $0.30$. This indicates weak retention of the analyte by the column.\n\nRetention in chromatography is governed by the principle of \"like dissolves like,\" which relates to the intermolecular forces between the analyte and the stationary phase. Weak retention (a small $k'$) implies that the analyte and the stationary phase have dissimilar polarities and thus weak intermolecular interactions. For instance, if a nonpolar stationary phase (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane) is used, the analyte would be a relatively polar compound. Conversely, if a polar stationary phase (e.g., polyethylene glycol) is used, the analyte would be a relatively nonpolar compound. Without knowing the specific nature of the stationary phase, the most precise conclusion is that there is a significant mismatch in polarity between the analyte and the stationary phase material. The analyte is eluted relatively quickly, with a retention time of $2.600\\ \\mathrm{min}$ that is only slightly longer than the dead time of $2.0\\ \\mathrm{min}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between chromatographic resolution $R_s$, the number of theoretical plates $N$, selectivity $\\alpha$, and retention factor $k'$, and then using this relationship to calculate the necessary change in column length to compensate for a decrease in selectivity.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions as requested. The resolution $R_s$ between two chromatographic peaks is defined as the difference in their retention times ($t_{R2}$ and $t_{R1}$) divided by the average of their baseline peak widths ($W_{b2}$ and $W_{b1}$).\n$$R_s = \\frac{t_{R2} - t_{R1}}{\\frac{1}{2}(W_{b1} + W_{b2})}$$\nThe problem states that the two analytes produce Gaussian peaks of comparable dispersion. This allows the approximation $W_{b1} \\approx W_{b2} \\approx W_b$, which simplifies the resolution equation to:\n$$R_s = \\frac{t_{R2} - t_{R1}}{W_b}$$\nFor closely eluting peaks, it is standard practice to use the width of the later, broader peak as the representative width, so we set $W_b = W_{b2}$.\n\nThe number of theoretical plates, $N$, is a measure of column efficiency and is related to the retention time $t_R$ and the peak width at baseline $W_b$ by the plate model:\n$$N = 16 \\left( \\frac{t_R}{W_b} \\right)^2$$\nWe can rearrange this to express the baseline width of the second peak in terms of its retention time $t_{R2}$ and the plate number $N$. We assume $N$ is the same for both closely eluting analytes under the specified identical conditions.\n$$W_{b2} = \\frac{4 t_{R2}}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\n\nThe retention time $t_R$ of an analyte is related to the column dead time $t_M$ (the time for an unretained species to pass through the column) and the analyte's retention factor $k'$ by:\n$$t_R = t_M (1 + k')$$\nApplying this to our two analytes:\n$$t_{R1} = t_M (1 + k_1')$$\n$$t_{R2} = t_M (1 + k_2')$$\n\nThe selectivity parameter, $\\alpha$, quantifies the separation factor between the two analytes and is defined as the ratio of their retention factors, with $\\alpha \\ge 1$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{k_2'}{k_1'}$$\n\nNow we derive the dependence of $R_s$ on $N$, $\\alpha$, and $k'$.\nFirst, we express the difference in retention times using the definitions:\n$$t_{R2} - t_{R1} = t_M(1 + k_2') - t_M(1 + k_1') = t_M(k_2' - k_1')$$\nUsing the definition of selectivity, we express $k_1'$ in terms of $k_2'$ and $\\alpha$: $k_1' = k_2' / \\alpha$.\nSubstituting this into the difference equation:\n$$t_{R2} - t_{R1} = t_M \\left( k_2' - \\frac{k_2'}{\\alpha} \\right) = t_M k_2' \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\right) = t_M k_2' \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha} \\right)$$\nThis is the numerator for the resolution equation.\n\nNext, we formulate the denominator, $W_{b2}$:\n$$W_{b2} = \\frac{4 t_{R2}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{4 t_M (1 + k_2')}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator into the simplified resolution equation, $R_s = (t_{R2} - t_{R1})/W_{b2}$:\n$$R_s = \\frac{t_M k_2' \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha} \\right)}{\\frac{4 t_M (1 + k_2')}{\\sqrt{N}}}$$\nThe dead time $t_M$ cancels out.

This implies that $N = cL$ for some proportionality constant $c$. The ratio of theoretical plates is therefore equal to the ratio of column lengths:\n$$\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{cL_2}{cL_1} = \\frac{L_2}{L_1}$$\nThus, the required ratio of column lengths $L_2/L_1$ to maintain the same resolution is $\\frac{289}{49}$.\nThis ratio is approximately $5.9$, indicating that a nearly six-fold increase in column length (and a corresponding increase in analysis time) is required to offset the small decrease in selectivity from $1.05$ to $1.02$.

            "solution": "Begin from the foundational concepts of chromatography. In ideal partition chromatography, a solute partitions between mobile and stationary phases with fast mass transfer, yielding symmetric peaks when the solute does not interact specifically with chemically active surfaces. When a solute adsorbs to active sites such as silanol groups, the sorption–desorption kinetics become rate-limited and nonideal. This results in a distribution of residence times skewed toward longer times, causing peak tailing. The asymmetry factor $A_s$ is a diagnostic measure, where $A_s=1$ indicates symmetry, $A_s>1$ indicates tailing. If a change in hardware or chemistry removes access to active sites, $A_s$ should approach $1$.\n\nInterpret the data stepwise:\n\n- Test $1$ shows pronounced tailing for benzylamine ($A_s=2.4$) and moderate tailing for $4$-nitrophenol ($A_s=1.8$), while $n$-decane is near symmetric ($A_s=1.05$). This pattern is consistent with specific adsorption affecting polar and especially basic analytes, not nonpolar hydrocarbons. Benzylamine, a basic amine, is known to strongly interact with acidic silanol sites; $4$-nitrophenol, an acidic phenolic compound, can interact with basic or polar sites in the column or inlet; $n$-decane lacks strong specific interactions.\n\n- Test $2$ replaces the liner with a silanized, glass-wool-free deactivated liner. Benzylamine improves markedly to $A_s=1.2$, while $4$-nitrophenol shows only a small change to $A_s=1.7$, and $n$-decane remains nearly unchanged. This selective improvement strongly implicates the inlet as the dominant source of benzylamine tailing. The small change for $4$-nitrophenol suggests that the dominant source of its tailing is not the inlet.\n\n- Test $3$ employs derivatization with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) $+1 \\%$ trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), which masks polar functionalities by replacing acidic $-\\mathrm{OH}$ or basic $-\\mathrm{NH}$ with trimethylsilyl groups. Benzylamine–trimethylsilyl derivative improves slightly to $A_s=1.1$ (from $A_s=1.2$ in Test $2$), whereas $4$-nitrophenol–trimethylsilyl ether improves substantially to $A_s=1.15$ (from $A_s=1.7$ in Test $2$). Derivatization reduces specific adsorption throughout the system, not just in the inlet, so pronounced improvement for $4$-nitrophenol points to adsorption sites along the column path, such as residual silanol activity at the column head or imperfect deactivation. The modest additional improvement for benzylamine suggests the inlet change already addressed the dominant interaction.\n\n- Test $4$ uses cool on-column injection, bypassing the inlet. Benzylamine is near symmetric ($A_s=1.25$), consistent with the silanized-inlet result ($A_s=1.2$), confirming that the inlet is responsible for most benzylamine tailing. $4$-nitrophenol remains tailing ($A_s=1.75$), nearly unchanged from Test $1$ and $2$, indicating the inlet is not the dominant contributor; instead, the column is implicated.\n\nFrom first principles, the selective changes in $A_s$ across hardware and chemical modifications diagnose the locus of active sites: improvements due to inlet deactivation or bypass implicate the inlet; improvements only upon derivatization implicate column-related sites, since masking functional groups reduces adsorption wherever encountered.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It concludes inlet activity dominates benzylamine tailing and column activity dominates $4$-nitrophenol tailing. This matches the observed patterns: benzylamine $A_s$ drops from $2.4$ to $1.2$ with a silanized liner and to $1.25$ with on-column injection, implicating inlet sites; $4$-nitrophenol changes little with inlet modifications but improves markedly after derivatization, implicating column sites. The corrective actions are scientifically justified: silanized, glass-wool-free liners reduce inlet silanol exposure; optimizing splitless purge and inlet temperature reduces residence time on potential active surfaces; routine liner maintenance prevents reintroduction of reactive glass wool or contaminants; trimming $0.3$–$1.0$ $\\mathrm{m}$ from the column head and using a deactivated guard column remove and buffer the most abused region where activity accumulates; oxygen/moisture scrubbing and conditioning minimize formation of active sites; derivatization for polar analytes reduces adsorption. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: It attributes tailing to carrier gas velocity and proposes adjusting to the Van Deemter optimum. However, the data already indicate selective effects from inlet deactivation and derivatization. Changes in linear velocity primarily affect plate height and band broadening symmetrically via $A$, $B$, $C$ terms of the Van Deemter equation, not selective tailing, and would affect $n$-decane similarly. The probe-specific improvements contradict this explanation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It attributes tailing to mass spectrometer ion source contamination. Chromatographic peak shape, including tailing measured as $A_s$, is formed in the GC prior to the mass spectrometer; the MS detects ions generated from the eluting band and does not reshape chromatographic peaks. MS source issues can affect sensitivity or fragmentation patterns, not GC peak asymmetry. The inlet and derivatization experiments demonstrate chromatographic origins. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It attributes tailing to solvent mismatch and recommends changing solvent and injection volume. While solvent effects (expansion, solvent–stationary phase interactions) can influence early focusing and, in extreme cases, cause distortions, the selective response of benzylamine to inlet deactivation and of $4$-nitrophenol to derivatization points to specific adsorption. Additionally, $n$-decane shows near-ideal symmetry across tests, arguing against a general solvent mismatch. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: It asserts the column is solely responsible for all probes. This contradicts benzylamine’s behavior: large improvement with silanized liner and on-column injection implicates the inlet as the dominant source for benzylamine. A column-only corrective action would leave benzylamine tailing unresolved. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most accurate diagnosis and provides appropriate corrective actions consistent with chromatographic first principles and the observed $A_s$ changes.",
