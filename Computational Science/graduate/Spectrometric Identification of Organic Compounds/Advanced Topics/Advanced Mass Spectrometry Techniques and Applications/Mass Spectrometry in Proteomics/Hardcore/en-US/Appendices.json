            "introduction": "A peptide's mass spectrum is not a single line but a cluster of peaks called an isotopic envelope, arising from the natural abundance of heavy isotopes like $^{13}C$. This exercise explores the \"averagine\" model, a powerful statistical approximation that allows us to predict the expected elemental composition and resulting isotopic pattern of a peptide using only its total mass. Mastering this concept is fundamental for interpreting MS1 data, as it underpins algorithms for feature detection, charge state deconvolution, and mass accuracy assessment. ",

            "problem": "Consider Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis of peptides using the averagine model. The averagine model approximates a peptide’s elemental composition by assigning an average count of atoms per a characteristic mass unit. For peptides, take the averagine mass unit to be $M_{\\mathrm{avg}}=111.1254\\ \\mathrm{Da}$ with average composition per unit of $C=4.9384$, $H=7.7583$, $N=1.3577$, $O=1.4773$, and $S=0.0417$. Assume a peptide with neutral monoisotopic mass $M_0=2000\\ \\mathrm{Da}$. Use the following well-tested constants: natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ is $p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}=0.01070$ (as a decimal fraction), the mass difference between $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ is $\\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}=1.003355\\ \\mathrm{Da}$, and the mass of the proton is $m_p=1.007276\\ \\mathrm{Da}$. Consider the $z=2$ charge state.\n\nFrom first principles, justify the averagine approximation to estimate the total number of carbon atoms as a function of $M_0$, derive the expected distribution of the number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms under the binomial-to-Poisson limit for large $n_C$ and small $p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$, and use this to predict the intensity-weighted centroid of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-dominated isotopic envelope at charge $z=2$. Neglect contributions from non-carbon heavy isotopes. Express the final centroid as a mass-to-charge ratio in Thomson (Th), and round your answer to $5$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the intensity-weighted centroid of the isotopic envelope for a peptide of a given mass, observed at a specific charge state. The calculation will proceed in three main steps: first, estimating the total number of carbon atoms in the peptide using the supplied averagine model; second, determining the expected number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ isotopes based on its natural abundance; and third, using this expectation to calculate the centroid of the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) distribution.\n\n**Step 1: Estimation of the Number of Carbon Atoms ($n_C$)**\n\nThe averagine model provides a method to estimate the elemental composition of a typical peptide based solely on its mass. It posits a hypothetical average amino acid residue, \"averagine,\" with a defined mass and elemental formula, derived from large protein sequence databases. This model is justified because, for a sufficiently large peptide, the specific amino acid sequence has less impact on the overall elemental composition than its total mass. The composition tends toward a statistical average.\n\nThe mass of one averagine unit is given as $M_{\\mathrm{avg}} = 111.1254\\ \\mathrm{Da}$. For a peptide with a neutral monoisotopic mass of $M_0 = 2000\\ \\mathrm{Da}$, the approximate number of averagine units, $N_{\\mathrm{units}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{units}} = \\frac{M_0}{M_{\\mathrm{avg}}}$$\nThe averagine composition specifies the average number of atoms of each element per unit. For carbon, this is given as $C_{\\mathrm{avg/unit}} = 4.9384$. Therefore, the total number of carbon atoms, $n_C$, in the peptide can be estimated as:\n$$n_C = N_{\\mathrm{units}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{avg/unit}} = \\frac{M_0}{M_{\\mathrm{avg}}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{avg/unit}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$n_C = \\frac{2000}{111.1254} \\times 4.9384 \\approx 88.87803$$\n\n**Step 2: Expected Number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Atoms**\n\nThe problem asks to consider the distribution of the number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms. Each of the $n_C$ carbon atoms in the peptide has a small probability of being the heavy isotope $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. This scenario is described by a binomial distribution. Let $k$ be the number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms. The probability of having exactly $k$ $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms in a molecule with $n_C$ total carbon atoms is given by the binomial probability mass function $P(k) = \\binom{n_C}{k} (p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}})^k (1-p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}})^{n_C-k}$, where $p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = 0.01070$ is the natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe problem specifies using the binomial-to-Poisson limit. This approximation is justified when the number of trials ($n_C$) is large and the probability of success ($p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$) is small, such that their product $\\lambda = n_C p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$ is a finite constant. Here, $n_C \\approx 89$ is large and $p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.01$ is small. In this limit, the binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$P(k) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\nThe intensity-weighted centroid calculation requires the expected value (mean) of $k$, denoted $E[k]$. For the underlying binomial distribution, the expectation is $E[k] = n_C p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$. For the approximating Poisson distribution, the expectation is $E[k] = \\lambda$. Since $\\lambda = n_C p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$, the expected value is the same under both models.\n$$E[k] = \\lambda = n_C p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = \\left(\\frac{2000}{111.1254} \\times 4.9384\\right) \\times 0.01070 \\approx 0.950995$$\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Calculation of the Centroid Mass-to-Charge Ratio**\n\nThe isotopic envelope consists of a series of peaks in the mass spectrum. We neglect contributions from all heavy isotopes except $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. The first peak (monoisotopic) corresponds to the molecule containing only light isotopes (e.g., $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$), with mass $M_0$. Subsequent peaks correspond to molecules containing $k=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms.\n\nThe mass of an isotopologue with $k$ $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms, $M_k$, is greater than the monoisotopic mass $M_0$ by $k$ times the mass difference between a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and a $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom, $\\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = 1.003355\\ \\mathrm{Da}$:\n$$M_k = M_0 + k \\cdot \\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$$\nIn a mass spectrometer, the detected quantity is the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$. For a peptide of mass $M_k$ that has acquired a charge of $+z$ by binding $z$ protons (mass $m_p = 1.007276\\ \\mathrm{Da}$), the observed $m/z$ is:\n$$(m/z)_k = \\frac{M_k + z \\cdot m_p}{z} = \\frac{(M_0 + k \\cdot \\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) + z \\cdot m_p}{z}$$\nThe intensity-weighted centroid of the isotopic envelope, $(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}}$, is the average of these $(m/z)_k$ values, weighted by their respective relative intensities $I_k \\propto P(k)$:\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} I_k \\cdot (m/z)_k}{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} I_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k) \\cdot (m/z)_k}{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k)}$$\nSince $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k) = 1$, the centroid is simply the expectation value of $(m/z)_k$:\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = E[(m/z)_k] = E\\left[\\frac{M_0 + k \\cdot \\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} + z \\cdot m_p}{z}\\right]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, $E[aX+b] = aE[X]+b$, where $k$ is the random variable and all other terms are constants:\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{M_0 + E[k] \\cdot \\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} + z \\cdot m_p}{z}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[k]$ from Step 2:\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{M_0 + (n_C p_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) \\cdot \\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} + z \\cdot m_p}{z}$$\nNow, we substitute all the numerical values:\n$M_0 = 2000\\ \\mathrm{Da}$\n$z = 2$\n$m_p = 1.007276\\ \\mathrm{Da}$\n$\\Delta m_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = 1.003355\\ \\mathrm{Da}$\n$E[k] = \\lambda \\approx 0.950995$\n\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{2000 + (0.950995) \\cdot (1.003355) + 2 \\cdot (1.007276)}{2}$$\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{2000 + 0.954153 + 2.014552}{2}$$\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} = \\frac{2002.968705}{2} = 1001.4843525$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $5$ significant figures.\n$$(m/z)_{\\text{centroid}} \\approx 1001.5\\ \\mathrm{Th}$$\nThe unit Thomson (Th) is equivalent to Da/e, which is the unit of mass-to-charge ratio.",

It is most easily calculated by finding the probability of the complementary event, i.e., zero interfering precursors being coisolated, $P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0)$, and subtracting it from $1$.\n\nThe probability mass function for a Poisson-distributed random variable $k$ is $P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} = k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}) (\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})^k}{k!}$.\nFor $k=0$, we have:\n$$P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}) (\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})^0}{0!} = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})$$\nsince $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we get:\n$$P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0) = \\exp(-\\lambda w \\tau)$$\nThus, the probability of at least one interfering precursor being coisolated is:\n$$P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} \\geq 1) = 1 - P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda w \\tau)$$\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of the Expected Interference Rate**\n\nThis part requires calculating the expected number of interfering precursors, $E[N_{\\mathrm{int}}]$, using the given parameter values:\n- Intensity $\\lambda = 10$ precursors$\\cdot \\mathrm{m/z}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- Isolation width $w = 0.7$ $\\mathrm{m/z}$\n- Co-elution time $\\tau = 0.20$ $\\mathrm{min}$\n\nUsing the expression derived in Part 1:\n$$E[N_{\\mathrm{int}}] = \\lambda w \\tau$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[N_{\\mathrm{int}}] = (10) \\cdot (0.7) \\cdot (0.20) = 10 \\cdot 0.14 = 1.4$$\nThe expected number of interfering precursors coisolated during a single fragmentation event is $1.4$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Minimum Isolation Width under RTMF**\n\nIn this scenario, a Real-Time Mass Filtering (RTMF) strategy is applied, which reduces the effective interfering-precursor intensity. The new effective intensity is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\alpha \\lambda$$\nwhere $\\alpha = 0.5$ and $\\lambda = 10$.\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.5 \\cdot 10 = 5 \\text{ precursors}\\cdot \\mathrm{m/z}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum isolation width, denoted $w^{\\star}$, that achieves a target maximum interference probability of $p^{\\star} = 0.30$. The co-elution time $\\tau$ remains $0.20$ $\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nWe use the probability expression from Part 1 with the new parameters $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $w^{\\star}$:\n$$P(N_{\\mathrm{int}} \\geq 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} w^{\\star} \\tau)$$\nWe set this probability equal to the target value $p^{\\star}$:\n$$p^{\\star} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} w^{\\star} \\tau)$$\nNow, we must solve this equation for $w^{\\star}$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} w^{\\star} \\tau) = 1 - p^{\\star}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} w^{\\star} \\tau = \\ln(1 - p^{\\star})$$\nIsolating $w^{\\star}$:\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - p^{\\star})}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\tau}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n- $p^{\\star} = 0.30$\n- $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 5$\n- $\\tau = 0.20$\n\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.30)}{(5) \\cdot (0.20)} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.70)}{1.0} = -\\ln(0.70)$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(0.70) \\approx -0.3566749439$$\n$$w^{\\star} \\approx -(-0.3566749439) \\approx 0.3566749439$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final value of $w^{\\star}$ to four significant figures.\n$$w^{\\star} \\approx 0.3567$$\nThe unit for this width is $\\mathrm{m/z}$.",
