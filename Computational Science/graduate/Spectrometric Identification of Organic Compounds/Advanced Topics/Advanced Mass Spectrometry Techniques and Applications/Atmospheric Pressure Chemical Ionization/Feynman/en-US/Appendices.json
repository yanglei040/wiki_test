Total Volumetric Flow Rate at the Exit ($\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{total,exit}}$)**\n\nThe total molar flow rate of gas at the exit, $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}}$, is the sum of the individual component molar flow rates.\n\n$$\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}} = \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{A,gas}} + \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{S,gas}} + \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{N_2}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the analyte's contribution to the total volumetric flow is negligible. This implies $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{A,gas}} \\ll (\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{S,gas}} + \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{N_2}})$, so we can approximate:\n$$\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}} \\approx \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{S,gas}} + \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{N_2}}$$\n\nUsing the ideal gas law at the heater exit conditions ($P_{\\mathrm{exit}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{exit}}$), the total volumetric flow rate is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{exit}} \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{total,exit}} = \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}} R T_{\\mathrm{exit}}$$\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{total,exit}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}} R T_{\\mathrm{exit}}}{P_{\\mathrm{exit}}}$$\n\n**3. Analyte Gas-Phase Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{A,gas}}$)**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{A,gas}}$ and $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{total,exit}}$ into the definition of concentration, we obtain the general expression for the analyte concentration at the exit:\n\n$$C_{\\mathrm{A,gas}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{A,gas}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{total,exit}}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{A,gas}} P_{\\mathrm{exit}}}{\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{total,gas}} R T_{\\mathrm{exit}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the molar flow rates yields the complete symbolic expression:\n\n$$C_{\\mathrm{A,gas}} = \\frac{(f_{\\mathrm{A}} C_{\\mathrm{sol}} F_{\\ell}) P_{\\mathrm{exit}}}{\\left( f_{\\mathrm{S}} \\frac{F_{\\ell} \\rho_{\\mathrm{solv}}}{M_{\\mathrm{solv}}} + \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{amb}} F_{\\mathrm{N_2}}}{R T_{\\mathrm{amb}}} \\right) R T_{\\mathrm{exit}}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

            "introduction": "Once an analyte is ionized, the resulting ions are guided through regions of decreasing pressure into the mass analyzer. This journey can be energetic, and collisions with background gas molecules can induce fragmentation even before mass analysis—a process known as in-source Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID). This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist, designing parameter-sweep experiments to robustly distinguish a true protonated molecule, $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, from an in-source fragment . Understanding how to manipulate instrumental parameters like cone voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$) is a crucial skill for correctly interpreting mass spectra and verifying molecular identity.",

            "problem": "An organic analyte $M$ is analyzed by Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) coupled to Mass Spectrometry (MS) in positive-ion mode. The analyte has a gas-phase proton affinity $PA(M)$ such that $PA(M) - PA(\\mathrm{H_2O}) \\gg 0$, so proton transfer from hydrated hydronium cluster ions $[\\text{H}_{3+n}\\text{O}_{n+1}]^+$ is strongly exothermic. Two major peaks are observed: $m/z$ $300$ and $m/z$ $282$. Based on the neutral exact mass of $M$, peak $m/z$ $300$ is consistent with $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ and peak $m/z$ $282$ is consistent with $[M+\\text{H}-\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]^+$ or a covalent bond cleavage fragment.\n\nAt atmospheric pressure, the corona discharge creates reagent ions whose flux is approximately proportional to the corona current $I_c$, and the protonation rate of $M$ scales with the reagent ion number density. In the heated nebulizer region, desolvation is governed by the vaporizer temperature $T_v$, while post-ionization collisional activation and declustering occur predominantly during ion transport through the interface, where ions experience potential differences such as the cone (or sampling) voltage $V_\\mathrm{cone}$. As ions are accelerated by an electric field, a charge $q$ experiences an energy gain $E_\\mathrm{acc} \\approx q V_\\mathrm{cone}$ between collisions; at atmospheric pressure, frequent collisions convert portions of translational energy into internal energy, enabling unimolecular dissociation when the internal energy exceeds a critical threshold set by the bond dissociation energy $D_0$ of the relevant channel. Fragmentation probabilities therefore increase monotonically with $V_\\mathrm{cone}$, assuming other conditions fixed, while primary ion formation by proton transfer scales with $I_c$ and adequate desolvation at $T_v$.\n\nYou will design parameter-sweep experiments and interpret the outcomes to distinguish a true molecular ion $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ at $m/z$ $300$ from an in-source fragment at $m/z$ $282$ arising after ion formation. Consider the following experimentally observed trends under three independent one-parameter sweeps, each performed while keeping all non-swept parameters fixed:\n\n- Sweep $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ over $20$ $\\mathrm{V}$, $40$ $\\mathrm{V}$, and $80$ $\\mathrm{V}$ with fixed $I_c$ and $T_v$: the intensities $(I_{300}, I_{282})$ change from approximately $(1.00, 0.05)$ at $20$ $\\mathrm{V}$ to $(0.80, 0.30)$ at $40$ $\\mathrm{V}$ to $(0.40, 0.60)$ at $80$ $\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Sweep $I_c$ over $2$ $\\mu\\mathrm{A}$, $5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{A}$, and $10$ $\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ with fixed $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $T_v$: both $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ scale nearly proportionally with $I_c$ such that the ratio $I_{282}/I_{300}$ remains approximately constant across this sweep.\n- Sweep $T_v$ over $350$ $\\mathrm{K}$, $450$ $\\mathrm{K}$, and $550$ $\\mathrm{K}$ with fixed $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $I_c$: both $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ increase at higher $T_v$, but $I_{300}$ saturates by $450$ $\\mathrm{K}$, whereas $I_{282}$ continues to increase modestly from $450$ $\\mathrm{K}$ to $550$ $\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nStarting from the mechanistic bases above—ion-molecule proton transfer in APCI, collisional activation with energy input $qV_\\mathrm{cone}$ and frequent collisions at atmospheric pressure, and unimolecular dissociation thresholds—evaluate which experimental design and interpretation most robustly and specifically distinguish a true molecular ion from an in-source fragment generated after ion formation.\n\nWhich of the following options best isolates and diagnoses in-source Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) and correctly interprets the observations?\n\nA. Perform an energy-resolved survival-yield experiment by sweeping $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ while holding $I_c$ and $T_v$ fixed; interpret an anticorrelation between $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ with an onset threshold in $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ as evidence that $m/z$ $282$ is formed via in-source CID from $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, whereas $m/z$ $300$ is the true molecular ion.\n\nB. Sweep $I_c$ while holding $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $T_v$ fixed; interpret proportional increases of both $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ with $I_c$ and a constant ratio $I_{282}/I_{300}$ as proof that $m/z$ $282$ is a separate analyte rather than an in-source fragment.\n\nC. Sweep $T_v$ while holding $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $I_c$ fixed; interpret a stronger increase of $I_{282}$ than $I_{300}$ with $T_v$ as definitive evidence that $m/z$ $282$ is generated by in-source CID rather than by coelution or pre-ionization thermal chemistry.\n\nD. Sweep $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and add a collision cell experiment at fixed collision energy to compare product-ion spectra; interpret matching product-ion spectra from the collision cell and the in-source fragment pattern as proof that $m/z$ $282$ is a coeluting species rather than an in-source fragment.",
            "solution": "The problem statement itself is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and mass spectrometry, particularly the phenomenon of in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID). The descriptions of the roles of corona current ($I_c$), vaporizer temperature ($T_v$), and cone voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$) are consistent with established physical models of an APCI source. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for a logical deduction. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are identified.\n\nThe central task is to distinguish between a precursor ion and a fragment ion formed after ionization within the mass spectrometer source. The two ions in question are at $m/z$ $300$, postulated to be the protonated molecule $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, and $m/z$ $282$, which could be a fragment formed from $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ or an ion from a different species. The mass difference, $300 - 282 = 18$, is consistent with the loss of a water molecule, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. The formation of a fragment ion via in-source CID follows the general scheme:\n$$ [M+\\text{H}]^+ \\xrightarrow{\\text{collisional activation}} [M+\\text{H}-\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]^+ + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nLet's analyze the effect of each experimental parameter based on the provided mechanistic description.\n\n1.  **Cone Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$)**: This parameter directly controls the kinetic energy gained by ions as they are accelerated through the atmospheric pressure interface. The problem statement correctly notes that this kinetic energy is converted into internal energy through multiple collisions. When this internal energy surpasses the activation energy (related to the bond dissociation energy $D_0$) for a fragmentation pathway, the precursor ion dissociates. Therefore, sweeping $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$ to higher values should monotonically increase the fragmentation efficiency. This will cause the abundance of the precursor ion ($[M+\\text{H}]^+$, $m/z$ $300$) to decrease, while the abundance of the resulting fragment ion ($m/z$ $282$) increases. This relationship is a clear anticorrelation. The experimental data provided for the $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$ sweep perfectly illustrates this: as $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$ increases from $20 \\mathrm{V}$ to $80 \\mathrm{V}$, the relative intensity of $I_{300}$ decreases ($1.00 \\to 0.80 \\to 0.40$) while the relative intensity of $I_{282}$ increases ($0.05 \\to 0.30 \\to 0.60$). This experiment is the most direct and specific probe of a post-ionization, collision-induced fragmentation process.\n\n2.  **Corona Current ($I_c$)**: This parameter controls the flux of primary reagent ions generated by the corona discharge. According to the problem, the rate of protonation of the analyte $M$ is proportional to the reagent ion density, which in turn is proportional to $I_c$. Therefore, increasing $I_c$ increases the rate of formation of the primary ion, $[M+\\text{H}]^+$. If the ion at $m/z$ $282$ is a fragment of $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, its rate of formation will depend on the concentration of its precursor, $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, and the fragmentation efficiency, which is held constant (by fixing $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$). Consequently, the intensities of both the precursor ($I_{300}$) and the fragment ($I_{282}$) should scale proportionally with $I_c$. This implies their ratio, $I_{282}/I_{300}$, should remain approximately constant. The provided data for the $I_c$ sweep confirms this behavior. This observation is consistent with a precursor-product relationship.\n\n3.  **Vaporizer Temperature ($T_v$)**: This parameter primarily governs the efficiency of desolvation and vaporization, i.e., the transfer of the neutral analyte $M$ from the liquid phase to the gas phase where it can be ionized. Increasing $T_v$ generally increases the abundance of gas-phase $M$, leading to a higher signal for $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ until an optimal temperature is reached (where desolvation is complete) or thermal degradation of $M$ begins. The data shows $I_{300}$ increasing and then saturating, consistent with reaching optimal desolvation. The continued modest increase of $I_{282}$ at higher $T_v$ could be due to several factors: increased internal energy of the $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ ions prior to collisional activation, promoting fragmentation; or thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) of the neutral analyte $M$ in the hot source *before* ionization. Because $T_v$ can influence both pre-ionization (thermal) and post-ionization processes, it is a less specific parameter for diagnosing in-source CID compared to $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the $V_{\\mathrm{cone}}$ sweep is the most robust and specific experiment for identifying an in-source CID process.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Perform an energy-resolved survival-yield experiment by sweeping $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ while holding $I_c$ and $T_v$ fixed; interpret an anticorrelation between $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ with an onset threshold in $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ as evidence that $m/z$ $282$ is formed via in-source CID from $[M+\\text{H}]^+$, whereas $m/z$ $300$ is the true molecular ion.**\nThis option correctly identifies the definitive experiment ($V_\\mathrm{cone}$ sweep) and provides the correct interpretation. The experiment isolates the effect of collisional activation energy. The observed anticorrelation between precursor and product ion intensities as a function of collisional energy is the hallmark of a precursor-product relationship in CID. The provided data for the $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ sweep precisely matches this description. This is the correct way to diagnose in-source CID.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Sweep $I_c$ while holding $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $T_v$ fixed; interpret proportional increases of both $I_{300}$ and $I_{282}$ with $I_c$ and a constant ratio $I_{282}/I_{300}$ as proof that $m/z$ $282$ is a separate analyte rather than an in-source fragment.**\nThis interpretation is incorrect. As explained above, if $m/z$ $282$ is a fragment of $m/z$ $300$, a constant fragmentation efficiency (fixed $V_\\mathrm{cone}$) and an increasing precursor population (due to increasing $I_c$) will lead to a proportional increase in both ions, maintaining a constant ratio. The observation described is, in fact, strong evidence *for* a precursor-product relationship, not against it. The conclusion drawn in this option is the opposite of what the data implies.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Sweep $T_v$ while holding $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and $I_c$ fixed; interpret a stronger increase of $I_{282}$ than $I_{300}$ with $T_v$ as definitive evidence that $m/z$ $282$ is generated by in-source CID rather than by coelution or pre-ionization thermal chemistry.**\nThis option draws an overly strong conclusion from an ambiguous experiment. A higher $T_v$ can promote fragmentation by increasing the internal energy of the ions formed, but it can also cause thermal decomposition of the neutral analyte *before* ionization. The experiment cannot, by itself, \"definitively\" distinguish post-ionization CID from \"pre-ionization thermal chemistry\". The $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ sweep is a much cleaner experiment because it specifically targets the post-ionization collisional process.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Sweep $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ and add a collision cell experiment at fixed collision energy to compare product-ion spectra; interpret matching product-ion spectra from the collision cell and the in-source fragment pattern as proof that $m/z$ $282$ is a coeluting species rather than an in-source fragment.**\nThis option describes a valid confirmatory experiment (tandem MS, or MS/MS), but then completely misinterprets the outcome. A tandem MS experiment would involve mass-selecting the precursor ion ($m/z$ $300$), subjecting it to CID in a dedicated collision cell, and analyzing the resulting product ions. If this experiment produces a fragment at $m/z$ $282$, it proves that $m/z$ $300$ is a precursor to $m/z$ $282$. If the in-source fragmentation pattern (from the $V_\\mathrm{cone}$ sweep) matches the product ion spectrum from the collision cell, it *confirms* that the ion at $m/z$ $282$ observed in the full scan spectrum is an in-source fragment of $m/z$ $300$. The option's conclusion that this is \"proof that $m/z$ $282$ is a coeluting species\" is diametrically opposed to the correct interpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most robust experimental design and correct interpretation for specifically diagnosing in-source CID.",

Treat the key step as the proton-transfer and cluster dissociation process\n$$[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+ \\longrightarrow [M+\\text{H}]^+ + \\text{NH}_3,$$\nand model the minimum collisional activation requirement as the threshold center-of-mass energy needed to surmount the sum of the endothermicity of proton transfer (if any) and the binding enthalpy of the ammonium adduct cluster.\n\nUse the following scientifically realistic data:\n- Neutral analyte mass $m_M = 352.0\\ \\text{u}$ and ammonium mass $m_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} = 18.0\\ \\text{u}$, so that $[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+$ has $m_i = m_M + m_{\\mathrm{NH}_4}$.\n- Gas-phase proton affinity $\\mathrm{PA}(M) = 830.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n- Gas-phase proton affinity $\\mathrm{PA}(\\mathrm{NH}_3) = 853.6\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n- Cluster binding enthalpy of the ammonium adduct $E_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 45.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ at $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n- Bath gas is nitrogen with $m_g = 28.0\\ \\text{u}$, assumed stationary in the laboratory frame for a single hard-sphere collision.\n- The ion charge state is $z=+1$.\n- Use the well-tested conversion $1\\ \\text{eV per ion} = 96.485\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from fundamental thermochemical definitions of proton affinity and classical two-body collision kinematics, derive the minimum center-of-mass collisional energy required for de-adduction and then compute the minimum interface potential difference $\\Delta V$ such that a single collision with nitrogen reaches or exceeds this threshold.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum potential difference, $\\Delta V$, needed to accelerate an adduct ion $[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+$ such that a single collision with a stationary nitrogen molecule provides sufficient energy for its dissociation into $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ and $\\text{NH}_3$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This is the threshold energy, $E_{th}$, which corresponds to the endothermicity of the dissociation process:\n$$[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+ \\longrightarrow [M+\\text{H}]^+ + \\text{NH}_3$$\nThe problem states that this threshold energy is the sum of the endothermicity of the associated proton transfer reaction and the binding enthalpy of the cluster. Let us verify this thermochemical model. The overall reaction enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{rxn}$, can be expressed in terms of the heats of formation of the products and reactants. Using the definition of proton affinity, $\\mathrm{PA}(B)$, as the negative of the enthalpy change for the gas-phase protonation reaction $B + H^+ \\to BH^+$, we can write the heat of formation of a protonated species $BH^+$ as $H_f(BH^+) = H_f(B) + H_f(H^+) - \\mathrm{PA}(B)$.\n\nThe structure of the reactant ion $[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+$ is described as an adduct, formed from the neutral analyte $M$ and the ammonium ion $\\text{NH}_4^+$. The binding enthalpy, $E_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, corresponds to the process $[M+\\text{NH}_4]^+ \\to M + \\text{NH}_4^+$. Therefore, the heat of formation of the reactant is $H_f([M+\\text{NH}_4]^+) = H_f(M) + H_f(\\text{NH}_4^+) - E_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. Substituting the expression for $H_f(\\text{NH}_4^+)$ gives $H_f([M+\\text{NH}_4]^+) = H_f(M) + [H_f(\\text{NH}_3) + H_f(H^+) - \\mathrm{PA}(\\text{NH}_3)] - E_{\\mathrm{bind}}$.\n\nThe heats of formation of the products are $H_f([M+\\text{H}]^+) = H_f(M) + H_f(H^+) - \\mathrm{PA}(M)$ and $H_f(\\text{NH}_3)$.\n\nThe overall enthalpy change of the reaction is:\n$$\\Delta H_{rxn} = [H_f([M+\\text{H}]^+) + H_f(\\text{NH}_3)] - H_f([M+\\text{NH}_4]^+)$$\n$$\\Delta H_{rxn} = [H_f(M) + H_f(H^+) - \\mathrm{PA}(M) + H_f(\\text{NH}_3)] - [H_f(M) + H_f(\\text{NH}_3) + H_f(H^+) - \\mathrm{PA}(\\text{NH}_3) - E_{\\mathrm{bind}}]$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling terms yields:\n$$\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\mathrm{PA}(\\text{NH}_3) - \\mathrm{PA}(M) + E_{\\mathrm{bind}}$$\nThis confirms that the reaction endothermicity is indeed the sum of the proton transfer endothermicity, $\\Delta H_{pt} = \\mathrm{PA}(\\text{NH}_3) - \\mathrm{PA}(M)$, and the cluster binding enthalpy, $E_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. This total endothermicity represents the threshold energy, $E_{th}$, required for the reaction.\n\nUsing the provided data:\n$\\mathrm{PA}(\\text{NH}_3) = 853.6\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\mathrm{PA}(M) = 830.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 45.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n\nThe threshold energy on a molar basis is:\n$$E_{th, molar} = (853.6 - 830.0)\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 45.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 23.6\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 45.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 68.6\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\nThis energy must be supplied to a single ion. To convert this molar energy to energy per ion in electron-volts ($\\text{eV}$), we use the given conversion factor $1\\ \\text{eV} = 96.485\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$:\n$$E_{th} = \\frac{68.6\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}}{96.485\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}/\\text{eV}}$$\n\nThis threshold energy $E_{th}$ must be available in the center-of-mass frame of the collision between the ion and the bath gas molecule. The ion, with mass $m_i$, is accelerated through a potential difference $\\Delta V$, acquiring a kinetic energy in the laboratory frame, $E_{lab}$, given by $E_{lab} = z e \\Delta V$. Since the charge state is $z=+1$, $E_{lab}$ in units of $\\mathrm{eV}$ is numerically equal to $\\Delta V$ in units of volts.\n$$E_{lab} (\\mathrm{eV}) = \\Delta V (\\mathrm{V})$$\nThe ion then collides with a stationary nitrogen molecule of mass $m_g$. For a collision between a projectile of mass $m_i$ and kinetic energy $E_{lab}$ with a stationary target of mass $m_g$, the energy available in the center-of-mass frame, $E_{com}$, is:\n$$E_{com} = E_{lab} \\left( \\frac{m_g}{m_i + m_g} \\right)$$\nThe minimum condition for the reaction to occur is that the center-of-mass energy equals the threshold energy: $E_{com} = E_{th}$.\n$$E_{th} = E_{lab, min} \\left( \\frac{m_g}{m_i + m_g} \\right) = \\Delta V_{min} \\left( \\frac{m_g}{m_i + m_g} \\right)$$\nSolving for the minimum potential difference, $\\Delta V_{min}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{min} = E_{th} \\left( \\frac{m_i + m_g}{m_g} \\right)$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values. The mass of the ion is the sum of the analyte mass and the ammonium mass:\n$m_i = m_M + m_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} = 352.0\\ \\text{u} + 18.0\\ \\text{u} = 370.0\\ \\text{u}$.\nThe mass of the bath gas is $m_g = 28.0\\ \\text{u}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta V_{min}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{min} = \\left( \\frac{68.6}{96.485} \\right) \\left( \\frac{370.0 + 28.0}{28.0} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta V_{min} = \\left( \\frac{68.6}{96.485} \\right) \\left( \\frac{398.0}{28.0} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta V_{min} \\approx (0.710991) \\times (14.214286)$$\n$$\\Delta V_{min} \\approx 10.10636\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested gives $10.11\\ \\mathrm{V}$.",
