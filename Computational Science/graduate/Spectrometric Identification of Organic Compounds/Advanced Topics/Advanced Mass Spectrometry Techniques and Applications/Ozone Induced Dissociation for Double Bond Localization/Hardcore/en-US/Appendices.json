The process is defined by the reaction $R_{1}\\text{-}CH=CH\\text{-}R_{2}^{+} \\xrightarrow{O_{3}} R_{1}\\text{-}CHO + R_{2}\\text{-}CHOO^{+}$. The mass of a chemical species is calculated as the sum of the monoisotopic masses of its constituent atoms. The mass of an electron is considered negligible, so the mass of an ion is equivalent to the mass of its corresponding neutral radical.\n\nFirst, we determine the elemental composition of the aldehyde fragment, $R_{1}\\text{-}CHO$.\nThe problem states that $R_{1}$ is a substituent moiety with an elemental composition defined by the atom counts $n_{\\text{C}}(R_{1})$ for carbon, $n_{\\text{H}}(R_{1})$ for hydrogen, and $n_{\\text{O}}(R_{1})$ for oxygen. The formation of the aldehyde fragment $R_{1}\\text{-}CHO$ from the precursor involves the moiety $R_{1}$ and one of the original vinyl groups, $CH$, which combines with one oxygen atom from the ozone molecule. Therefore, the total number of atoms of each element in this fragment is the sum of the atoms in $R_{1}$ and the atoms in the $-CHO$ group.\nThe $-CHO$ group contributes one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and one oxygen atom.\nThus, the elemental composition of the fragment $R_{1}\\text{-}CHO$ is:\nNumber of Carbon atoms: $n_{\\text{C, frag1}} = n_{\\text{C}}(R_{1}) + 1$\nNumber of Hydrogen atoms: $n_{\\text{H, frag1}} = n_{\\text{H}}(R_{1}) + 1$\nNumber of Oxygen atoms: $n_{\\text{O, frag1}} = n_{\\text{O}}(R_{1}) + 1$\n\nThe monoisotopic mass of the aldehyde fragment, denoted as $m(R_{1}\\text{-}CHO)$, is the sum of the masses of its constituent atoms.

            "solution": "The problem describes a system in which a precursor ion cleaves into two product channels. The relative abundance of the products, measured by the intensity ratio $I_A/I_B$, is governed by a quasi-equilibrium distribution of the final states. The foundational basis for this is the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the probability of a state to its energy.\n\nLet the two competing product states be the formation of the charged fragment $A$ (denoted state $S_A$) and the formation of the charged fragment $B$ (denoted state $S_B$). The molar energies of these two states are $E_A$ and $E_B$, respectively. The problem specifies that the system can be treated as a canonical ensemble at an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The probability $P_i$ of the system being in a state $S_i$ with molar energy $E_i$ and degeneracy $g_i$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nP_i \\propto g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the ideal gas constant. The measured intensity $I_i$ of a fragment ion is proportional to the probability of its formation. Therefore, the ratio of intensities for fragments $A$ and $B$ is equal to the ratio of their formation probabilities:\n$$\n\\frac{I_A}{I_B} = \\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\frac{g_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)}{g_B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{I_A}{I_B} = \\frac{g_A}{g_B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A - E_B}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right) = \\frac{g_A}{g_B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta E = E_A - E_B$ is the difference in molar energy between the two final states.\n\nThe next step is to relate this energy difference $\\Delta E$ to the given proton affinities, $\\mathrm{PA}_A$ and $\\mathrm{PA}_B$. The proton affinity ($\\mathrm{PA}$) is defined as the negative of the molar enthalpy change for the gas-phase protonation reaction. A higher $\\mathrm{PA}$ implies a more stable (lower energy) protonated species.\nLet the neutral fragments be denoted by $F_A$ and $F_B$. The two product states, $S_A$ and $S_B$, correspond to the fragment pairs $\\{F_A H^+, F_B\\}$ and $\\{F_A, F_B H^+\\}$, respectively. Assuming the energy $E$ of a state can be approximated by its enthalpy $H$, the energy difference $\\Delta E = E_A - E_B$ can be related to the proton affinities. By definition, $\\mathrm{PA}(F) = -\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{protonation}} = H(F) + H(H^+) - H(F H^+)$. A higher PA means a lower enthalpy for the protonated species. The energy difference between the two states is therefore simply the difference in their stability, which is directly related to the difference in proton affinities:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_A - E_B = -(\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B) = \\mathrm{PA}_B - \\mathrm{PA}_A\n$$\nThis confirms the relationship between the energy difference of the product channels and the proton affinity difference of the fragments.\n\nSubstituting this result for $\\Delta E$ into the intensity ratio equation gives the desired quantitative criterion:\n$$\n\\frac{I_A}{I_B} = \\frac{g_A}{g_B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-(\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B)}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right) = \\frac{g_A}{g_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is a form of the \"kinetic method\" equation used in mass spectrometry to determine thermochemical data.\n\nTo solve for the effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we rearrange this equation. First, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_A}{I_B}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{g_A}{g_B}\\right) + \\frac{\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nIsolating the term containing $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B}{RT_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_A}{I_B}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{g_A}{g_B}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_A/I_B}{g_A/g_B}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_A g_B}{I_B g_A}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B}{R \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_A g_B}{I_B g_A}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe givens are:\n$\\mathrm{PA}_A = 945 \\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$\n$\\mathrm{PA}_B = 920 \\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$\n$I_A/I_B = 7.1$\n$g_A = 1$\n$g_B = 1$\n$R = 8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nThe difference in proton affinities must be in units consistent with $R$, so we convert from $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ to $\\mathrm{J/mol}$:\n$\\mathrm{PA}_A - \\mathrm{PA}_B = (945 - 920) \\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol} = 25 \\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol} = 25000 \\ \\mathrm{J/mol}$.\nThe ratio of degeneracies is $g_A/g_B = 1/1 = 1$. The intensity ratio is $I_A/I_B = 7.1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{25000 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{ (8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{7.1 \\times 1}{1 \\times 1}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{25000}{8.314462618 \\times \\ln(7.1)} \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\ln(7.1) \\approx 1.9600949$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{25000}{8.314462618 \\times 1.9600949} \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{25000}{16.29745} \\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 1533.9836 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 1534 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThis value represents the effective internal temperature of the ion population at the moment of charge partitioning, assuming the system follows the canonical ensemble statistics as postulated.",

Ozone can add by two competing pathways: $1,2$-addition localized to a single double bond (leading to the usual primary ozonide and subsequent diagnostic cleavage) and $1,4$-addition across the conjugated system (leading to an allylic ozonide or peroxyallylic intermediate whose subsequent decomposition is known to generate non-diagnostic allylic/allyloxyl fragments rather than the canonical $+16$ Th pair).\n\nAssume the following well-tested kinetic framework and parameters:\n- Under a fixed ozone number density (pseudo-first-order regime), branching between parallel channels is governed by the ratio of their rate constants, $k_{1,2}$ and $k_{1,4}$.\n- The temperature dependence of each channel follows the Arrhenius law, $k = A \\exp\\!\\left(-E_{\\mathrm{a}}/(RT)\\right)$, where $R$ is the gas constant.\n- For the conjugated diene ion under study at $T = 300$ K, the effective Arrhenius parameters are:\n  - $1,2$-addition: $A_{1,2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{x}$ (arbitrary but identical units for both channels; only ratios matter), $E_{\\mathrm{a},1,2} = 6.0$ $\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n  - $1,4$-addition: $A_{1,4} = 2.0 \\times 10^{x}$, $E_{\\mathrm{a},1,4} = 7.5$ $\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- Take $R = 1.987$ $\\mathrm{cal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nBased only on these fundamentals and parameters, and the mechanistic distinction that $1,2$-addition produces the canonical pair of OzID fragments separated by $16$ Th whereas $1,4$-addition produces predominantly non-paired, non-diagnostic allylic products, which statement best captures both the kinetic likelihood of $1,4$-addition and its impact on the observed OzID diagnostic pattern?\n\nA. At $T = 300$ K, $1,4$-addition captures a minority but significant fraction (on the order of $15\\%$) of ozone additions due to a modestly higher pre-exponential factor offset by a higher activation barrier, thereby siphoning intensity from the canonical $+16$ Th pair and introducing additional non-paired allylic fragments that partially obscure double-bond localization.\n\nB.
