High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a cornerstone of this process, providing highly accurate mass measurements that can be used to determine an elemental composition. This first practice  walks you through this fundamental workflow, demonstrating how to use the precise mass-to-charge ratios of multiple adducts and cluster ions observed in a DESI experiment to deduce the unique molecular formula of an analyte, reinforcing the principles of mass accuracy and isotopic analysis.",

            "problem": "A Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) experiment on an unknown organic compound desorbed from a polymer surface yields a high-resolution positive-ion spectrum. Three monoisotopic peaks are confidently assigned based on tandem mass spectrometry and source conditions: $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ at $m/z = 183.06519$, $[M+\\text{Na}]^+$ at $m/z = 205.04713$, and the cluster $[2M+\\text{H}]^+$ at $m/z = 365.12310$. The instrument mass accuracy is $\\pm 2$ parts per million (ppm) for $m/z$ above $100$. The unknown neutral molecule $M$ is an even-electron organic compound composed solely of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Assume singly charged ions for all three peaks and neglect other adducts.\n\nUse only the following fundamental definitions and constants:\n- In electrospray ionization, $m/z = m_{\\text{ion}}/z$ with $z$ the integer charge and $m_{\\text{ion}}$ the monoisotopic ion mass.\n- For the adducts, $m([M+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(M) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$, $m([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) = m(M) + m(\\mathrm{Na}^{+})$, and $m([2M+\\text{H}]^{+}) = 2\\,m(M) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$.\n- Monoisotopic atomic masses: $m(\\mathrm{C}) = 12.000000$, $m(\\mathrm{H}) = 1.007825$, $m(\\mathrm{N}) = 14.003074$, $m(\\mathrm{O}) = 15.994915$.\n- Adduct ion masses: $m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = 1.007276$, $m(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) = 22.989218$.\n\nStarting from these facts and definitions, determine the unique integer composition $\\mathrm{C}_{c}\\mathrm{H}_{h}\\mathrm{N}_{n}\\mathrm{O}_{o}$ of $M$ consistent with the observed $m/z$ values, charge states, and mass accuracy. Justify your assignment by checking internal consistency among the three peaks and by enforcing physically meaningful constraints such as the parity implication of the nitrogen rule on the neutral nominal mass and a nonnegative integer double-bond equivalent (unsaturation) value. Express your final answer as a single row matrix $$\\begin{pmatrix}c & h & n & o\\end{pmatrix}$$. No rounding is required; report exact integer values. The final answer must contain no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the unique integer composition, denoted as $\\mathrm{C}_{c}\\mathrm{H}_{h}\\mathrm{N}_{n}\\mathrm{O}_{o}$, of an unknown neutral organic molecule $M$. The determination must be consistent with high-resolution mass spectrometry data and fundamental chemical principles.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- Three monoisotopic peaks observed in a positive-ion ESI-MS spectrum: $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ at $m/z = 183.06519$, $[M+\\text{Na}]^+$ at $m/z = 205.04713$, and $[2M+\\text{H}]^+$ at $m/z = 365.12310$.\n- The charge state for all ions is $z = 1$.\n- Instrument mass accuracy is $\\pm 2$ parts per million (ppm) for $m/z > 100$.\n- The molecule $M$ is composed only of C, H, N, and O atoms.\n- Definitions for ion masses: $m([M+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(M) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$, $m([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) = m(M) + m(\\mathrm{Na}^{+})$, and $m([2M+\\text{H}]^{+}) = 2\\,m(M) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$.\n- Monoisotopic masses: $m(\\mathrm{C}) = 12.000000$, $m(\\mathrm{H}) = 1.007825$, $m(\\mathrm{N}) = 14.003074$, $m(\\mathrm{O}) = 15.994915$.\n- Adduct ion masses: $m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = 1.007276$, $m(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) = 22.989218$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. Preliminary checks show that the three measured $m/z$ values yield highly concordant masses for the neutral molecule $M$, confirming the data's integrity. The problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first step is to determine the experimental mass of the neutral molecule, $m(M)_{\\text{exp}}$, from each of the three observed ion peaks. Since the charge $z$ is given as $1$, the measured $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the ion's mass in Daltons.\n\n1.  From the $[M+\\text{H}]^+$ ion at $m/z = 183.06519$:\n    $m(M) = m([M+\\text{H}]^{+}) - m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = 183.06519 - 1.007276 = 182.057914 \\text{ Da}$.\n\n2.  From the $[M+\\text{Na}]^+$ ion at $m/z = 205.04713$:\n    $m(M) = m([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) - m(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}) = 205.04713 - 22.989218 = 182.057912 \\text{ Da}$.\n\n3.  From the $[2M+\\text{H}]^+$ ion at $m/z = 365.12310$:\n    $m(M) = \\frac{m([2M+\\text{H}]^{+}) - m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})}{2} = \\frac{365.12310 - 1.007276}{2} = \\frac{364.115824}{2} = 182.057912 \\text{ Da}$.\n\nThe three calculations yield extremely consistent values for the mass of $M$. We take the average of these values as the most reliable experimental mass:\n$m(M)_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{182.057914 + 182.057912 + 182.057912}{3} \\approx 182.057913 \\text{ Da}$.\n\nThe task is now to find a set of non-negative integers $(c, h, n, o)$ such that the calculated theoretical mass, $m(M)_{\\text{calc}}$, for the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{c}\\mathrm{H}_{h}\\mathrm{N}_{n}\\mathrm{O}_{o}$ matches $m(M)_{\\text{exp}}$ within the instrument's mass accuracy.\n$m(M)_{\\text{calc}} = c \\cdot m(\\mathrm{C}) + h \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H}) + n \\cdot m(\\mathrm{N}) + o \\cdot m(\\mathrm{O})$\n\nWe apply several constraints to narrow the search for the correct formula:\n- **Composition**: The formula can only contain C, H, N, and O atoms.\n- **Nitrogen Rule**: The nominal mass of $M$ is $\\lfloor 182.057913 \\rfloor = 182$, which is an even number. For a C, H, N, O compound, this implies that the number of nitrogen atoms, $n$, must be an even integer ($0, 2, 4, \\dots$).\n- **Double Bond Equivalent (DBE)**: The DBE (or degree of unsaturation) must be a non-negative integer. The formula for DBE is:\n$$ \\text{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 $$\nFor DBE to be an integer, $(h-n)$ must be an even number. As $n$ must be even, it follows that $h$ must also be an even integer.\n\nA systematic search for integer combinations of $(c, h, n, o)$ that satisfy these constraints and yield a mass close to $182.057913$ Da leads to a single viable candidate formula: $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$.\n\nWe must now rigorously verify this proposed formula.\n1.  **Mass Calculation**: Calculate the theoretical monoisotopic mass for $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$.\n    $m(\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}) = 9 \\times 12.000000 + 10 \\times 1.007825 + 0 \\times 14.003074 + 4 \\times 15.994915$\n    $m(\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}) = 108.000000 + 10.078250 + 0 + 63.979660 = 182.057910 \\text{ Da}$.\n\n2.  **Mass Error Analysis**: Compare the calculated mass with the experimental mass to ensure it falls within the $\\pm 2$ ppm tolerance for all measured peaks.\n    The calculated neutral mass is $m(M)_{\\text{calc}} = 182.057910$ Da.\n    - For $[M+\\text{H}]^{+}$, the calculated $m/z$ is $182.057910 + 1.007276 = 183.065186$.\n      The measured $m/z$ is $183.06519$.\n      The mass error is $|183.065186 - 183.06519| = 0.000004$ Da.\n      The error in ppm is $\\frac{0.000004}{183.06519} \\times 10^6 \\approx 0.022$ ppm. This is well within $\\pm 2$ ppm.\n    - For $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$, the calculated $m/z$ is $182.057910 + 22.989218 = 205.047128$.\n      The measured $m/z$ is $205.04713$.\n      The mass error is $|205.047128 - 205.04713| = 0.000002$ Da.\n      The error in ppm is $\\frac{0.000002}{205.04713} \\times 10^6 \\approx 0.010$ ppm. This is well within $\\pm 2$ ppm.\n    - For $[2M+\\text{H}]^{+}$, the calculated $m/z$ is $2 \\times 182.057910 + 1.007276 = 365.123096$.\n      The measured $m/z$ is $365.12310$.\n      The mass error is $|365.123096 - 365.12310| = 0.000004$ Da.\n      The error in ppm is $\\frac{0.000004}{365.12310} \\times 10^6 \\approx 0.011$ ppm. This is well within $\\pm 2$ ppm.\n    The formula $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$ is consistent with all three experimental measurements to a very high degree of accuracy.\n\n3.  **Constraint Verification**: Check the formula against the chemical rules.\n    - Formula: $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$. The integers are $c=9, h=10, n=0, o=4$.\n    - Nitrogen Rule: $n=0$, which is an even number. This is consistent.\n    - Hydrogen atoms: $h=10$, which is an even number. This is consistent.\n    - Double Bond Equivalent: $\\text{DBE} = 9 - \\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{0}{2} + 1 = 9 - 5 + 0 + 1 = 5$. A DBE of $5$ is a non-negative integer, indicating a chemically reasonable degree of unsaturation (e.g., a substituted benzene ring).\n\nThe formula $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$ uniquely satisfies all the experimental data and chemical constraints. The integer composition $(c, h, n, o)$ is therefore $(9, 10, 0, 4)$.",

The analysis may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the ionization behavior of three analytes ($A$, $B$, $N$) under two different solvent additive conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Spray Solvent with $0.1\\%$ Formic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the $pH$ of the microdroplets.\nGiven: $K_a \\approx 1.8\\times 10^{-4}$ for formic acid, and its concentration $C_{\\mathrm{FA}} \\approx 0.025\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe proton concentration is given by $[\\mathrm{H}^+] \\approx \\sqrt{K_a C_{\\mathrm{FA}}}$.\n$$[\\mathrm{H}^+] \\approx \\sqrt{(1.8\\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.025)} = \\sqrt{4.5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 2.12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe $pH$ is then:\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^+]) \\approx -\\log_{10}(2.12 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 2.67$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the state of each analyte at this $pH$:\n-   **Amine $A$ (conjugate acid $pK_a=7.5$)**: The relevant equilibrium is $A\\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + \\mathrm{H}^+$. Since the $pH$ of $2.67$ is much lower than the $pK_a$ of $7.5$, the equilibrium is strongly shifted to the left. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the conjugate acid:\n    $$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right)$$\n    $$2.67 = 7.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right)$$\n    $$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) = 2.67 - 7.5 = -4.83$$\n    $$\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = 10^{-4.83} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n    This indicates that the amine is almost completely protonated (over $99.99\\%$). This is \"near-quantitative protonation\", leading to a strong signal for $[A+\\text{H}]^+$ in positive-ion mode.\n\n-   **Carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$)**: The equilibrium is $B\\mathrm{H} \\rightleftharpoons B^- + \\mathrm{H}^+$. Since the $pH$ of $2.67$ is lower than the $pK_a$ of $4.5$, the equilibrium is shifted to the left (protonated, neutral form).\n    $$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right)$$\n    $$2.67 = 4.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right)$$\n    $$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) = 2.67 - 4.5 = -1.83$$\n    $$\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]} = 10^{-1.83} \\approx 0.0148$$\n    Only about $1.5\\%$ of the carboxylic acid is deprotonated. The signal for the deprotonated ion, $[B-\\text{H}]^-$, would be strongly suppressed in negative-ion mode.\n\n**Condition 2: Spray Solvent with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ Ammonium Acetate**\n\nThe $pH$ is given as $pH \\approx 6.9$.\n\n-   **Amine $A$ (conjugate acid $pK_a=7.5$)**: At $pH = 6.9$, which is below the $pK_a$:\n    $$6.9 = 7.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) \\implies \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) = -0.6$$\n    $$\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = 10^{-0.6} \\approx 0.25$$\n    The fraction protonated is $\\frac{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}{[A]+[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.25} = 0.8$, or $80\\%$. Protonation is significant but less complete than with formic acid.\n\n-   **Carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$)**: At $pH = 6.9$, which is above the $pK_a$:\n    $$6.9 = 4.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) \\implies \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) = 2.4$$\n    $$\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]} = 10^{2.4} \\approx 251$$\n    The carboxylic acid is almost completely deprotonated (approx. $99.6\\%$), leading to a strong $[B-\\text{H}]^-$ signal.\n\n-   **Polyether $N$**:\n    -   In positive-ion mode, we compare the formation of $[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+$ and $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$. The relative abundance of these adducts is proportional to the product of the binding constant and the cation concentration.\n    -   For sodium adduct: $K_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^+] = (5.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n    -   For ammonium adduct: $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4}[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+] = (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 10$.\n    -   Ratio of adducts: $\\frac{[[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+]}{[[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+]} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4}[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+]}{K_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^+]} = \\frac{10}{2.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = 400$.\n    -   The ammonium adduct is overwhelmingly favored ($400$ times more abundant) because the much higher concentration of $\\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ more than compensates for its lower binding constant.\n    -   In negative-ion mode, the additive is ammonium acetate, providing a source of acetate ions ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}^-$). The problem statements allow for the formation of $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ adducts. Thus, their appearance is expected under this condition.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under $0.1\\%$ formic acid in positive-ion mode, $A$ exhibits near-quantitative protonation, increasing $[A+\\text{H}]^+$, whereas in negative-ion mode $B$ shows suppressed $[B-\\text{H}]^-$ due to low $pH$.**\n- Our calculation showed that at $pH \\approx 2.67$, amine $A$ ($pK_a=7.5$) is $>99.99\\%$ protonated, which is \"near-quantitative\". This enhances the $[A+\\text{H}]^+$ signal.\n- Our calculation also showed that at this low $pH$, carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$) is only $\\approx 1.5\\%$ deprotonated, meaning the $[B-\\text{H}]^-$ signal is suppressed.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ammonium acetate in positive-ion mode, $N$ forms predominantly $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ rather than $[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+$ despite $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} < K_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.**\n- It is given that $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}) < K_{\\mathrm{Na}} (5.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})$.\n- Our calculation of the adduct ratio, $\\frac{[[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+]}{[[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+]} = 400$, confirms that the $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ adduct is predominant. The huge excess in ammonium concentration ($[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ vs. $[\\mathrm{Na}^+] = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) is the decisive factor.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In negative-ion mode with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ammonium acetate, $B$ is more deprotonated than with $0.1\\%$ formic acid, and acetate adducts $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ may appear for $N$.**\n- With ammonium acetate ($pH \\approx 6.9$), analyte $B$ is $\\approx 99.6\\%$ deprotonated. With formic acid ($pH \\approx 2.67$), it is only $\\approx 1.5\\%$ deprotonated. Thus, $B$ is indeed more deprotonated with ammonium acetate.\n- The solvent contains a high concentration of acetate ions, and the problem statements allow for the formation of $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ adducts. It is therefore entirely reasonable that they may appear.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Adding $0.1\\%$ formic acid leads to enhanced acetate adducts $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ in negative mode.**\n- To form acetate adducts, acetate ions ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}^-$) must be present. The additive is formic acid ($\\mathrm{HCOOH}$), which does not contain any acetate. This statement is chemically impossible under the given conditions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In positive-ion mode, ammonium acetate reduces $[A+\\text{H}]^+$ because ammonium ions outcompete protons for charge, driving $A$ to the neutral form; thus $[A+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ replaces $[A+\\text{H}]^+$.**\n- The reasoning provided is flawed. The fraction of protonated amine, $[A\\mathrm{H}^+]$, is lower with ammonium acetate ($80\\%$) than with formic acid ($>99.9\\%$), but this is because the $pH$ is higher ($6.9$ vs. $2.67$). Ammonium ions do not \"outcompete protons for charge\" to deprotonate $A\\mathrm{H}^+$. The $pK_a$ of $\\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ is $\\approx 9.25$, while the $pK_a$ for $A\\mathrm{H}^+$ is $7.5$. This means $A$ is a stronger base than $\\mathrm{NH}_3$, so the reaction $A + \\mathrm{NH}_4^+ \\rightleftharpoons A\\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{NH}_3$ favors the products. The explanation is incorrect.\n- The species $[A+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ suggests an adduct between a neutral amine $A$ and an ammonium ion, which is not a standard or plausible ion observed for amines under these conditions. Protonation to $[A+\\text{H}]^+$ is the dominant process.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "Beyond qualitative identification, a crucial application of DESI-MS is quantitative analysis, which answers the question 'how much is present?'. To evaluate the performance of any quantitative method, we must determine its sensitivity and detection limits. This final practice  provides a hands-on calculation of the Limit of Detection (LOD), a key figure of merit, by applying the concepts of instrument calibration and signal-to-noise ratio in a typical DESI scenario.",

            "problem": "A Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) experiment is performed to identify a surface-bound organic compound by mass spectrometry under steady-state conditions. The detector outputs a peak height proportional to the analyte ion current, and the baseline noise is characterized by its Root Mean Square (RMS) amplitude measured over a blank region. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) is defined as $S/N = H/\\sigma_{n}$, where $H$ is the measured peak height and $\\sigma_{n}$ is the baseline RMS noise. The limit of detection criterion is set by the requirement $S/N = 3$.\n\nA calibration is performed by depositing a uniform standard of the same analyte with known areal molar concentration $C_{\\text{cal}}$ on an inert substrate, and measuring the resulting peak height $H_{\\text{cal}}$ under identical acquisition conditions. Assume a linear response between peak height and areal molar concentration over the relevant range. In a subsequent analytical measurement on a sample spot, a peak height $H_{\\text{obs}}$ is observed, and the baseline RMS noise $\\sigma_{n}$ is measured from a contemporaneous blank.\n\nGiven the following data:\n- Calibration areal concentration $C_{\\text{cal}} = 25.0$ $\\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$ and corresponding calibrated peak height $H_{\\text{cal}} = 820$ (arbitrary units).\n- Observed sample peak height $H_{\\text{obs}} = 410$ (arbitrary units).\n- Baseline RMS noise $\\sigma_{n} = 85$ (arbitrary units).\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the assumption of linear response, derive the minimum areal molar concentration $C_{\\text{LOD}}$ required to meet the limit of detection under these conditions, taking the limit criterion $S/N = 3$. Express your final numerical answer in $\\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$, and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The concepts of linear response, signal-to-noise ratio, and limit of detection are standard in analytical chemistry.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the assumption of a linear response between the measured peak height, $H$, and the analyte's areal molar concentration, $C$. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$H = kC$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality, often referred to as the response factor or sensitivity of the instrument for the analyte under the specified conditions.\n\nThe problem provides calibration data, which allows for the determination of this response factor, $k$. We are given the calibration concentration, $C_{\\text{cal}} = 25.0 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$, and the corresponding measured peak height, $H_{\\text{cal}} = 820$ (in arbitrary units). Substituting these values into the linear response equation yields:\n$$H_{\\text{cal}} = k C_{\\text{cal}}$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the response factor $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{H_{\\text{cal}}}{C_{\\text{cal}}} = \\frac{820}{25.0} \\ \\frac{\\text{arbitrary units}}{\\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}}$$\n\nNext, we address the limit of detection (LOD). The LOD is defined as the minimum concentration of analyte that can be reliably detected above the background noise. The problem specifies the criterion for detection as a signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) of $3$. The $S/N$ is defined as:\n$$S/N = \\frac{H}{\\sigma_{n}}$$\nwhere $H$ is the peak height and $\\sigma_{n}$ is the baseline RMS noise.\n\nAt the limit of detection, the concentration is $C_{\\text{LOD}}$ and the corresponding peak height is $H_{\\text{LOD}}$. The $S/N$ ratio at this point must meet the specified criterion:\n$$\\frac{H_{\\text{LOD}}}{\\sigma_{n}} = 3$$\nThis allows us to determine the minimum detectable peak height, $H_{\\text{LOD}}$, in terms of the baseline noise, $\\sigma_{n}$. We are given $\\sigma_{n} = 85$ (in arbitrary units).\n$$H_{\\text{LOD}} = 3 \\sigma_{n} = 3 \\times 85 = 255 \\ \\text{(arbitrary units)}$$\n\nNow, we can relate this minimum detectable signal, $H_{\\text{LOD}}$, back to the minimum detectable concentration, $C_{\\text{LOD}}$, using the linear response equation:\n$$H_{\\text{LOD}} = k C_{\\text{LOD}}$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{LOD}}$ gives:\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} = \\frac{H_{\\text{LOD}}}{k}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $H_{\\text{LOD}}$ and $k$ that we previously derived:\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} = \\frac{3 \\sigma_{n}}{\\left( \\frac{H_{\\text{cal}}}{C_{\\text{cal}}} \\right)} = C_{\\text{cal}} \\left( \\frac{3 \\sigma_{n}}{H_{\\text{cal}}} \\right)$$\nThis final expression relates the limit of detection concentration to the calibration parameters and the measured noise. The observed sample peak height, $H_{\\text{obs}} = 410$, is not required for the calculation of the LOD, which is a characteristic of the analytical method itself, not a specific sample.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the equation for $C_{\\text{LOD}}$:\n$C_{\\text{cal}} = 25.0 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$\n$\\sigma_{n} = 85$\n$H_{\\text{cal}} = 820$\n\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} = 25.0 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}} \\times \\frac{3 \\times 85}{820}$$\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} = 25.0 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}} \\times \\frac{255}{820}$$\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} \\approx 7.77439024 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$C_{\\text{LOD}} \\approx 7.774 \\ \\mathrm{pmol/mm^{2}}$$",
