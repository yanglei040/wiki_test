            "problem": "An organic compound is studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine structural geometry using Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs). Consider a single heteronuclear two-spin system composed of one proton and one carbon ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$–$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) connected by a single covalent bond. In an isotropic solution, the scalar (isotropic) coupling between these spins yields a doublet splitting of the proton resonance of $140.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. When the same sample is placed in a weakly aligning medium under identical magnetic field and temperature, the observed aligned splitting of the proton resonance increases to $152.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. Using a derivation from the fundamental spin Hamiltonian of two coupled spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ nuclei, show how the aligned splitting arises from additive contributions of the isotropic scalar coupling and the residual dipolar coupling, and compute the RDC magnitude.

Express the RDC magnitude in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ and round your numerical result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to relate the observed heteronuclear doublet splitting in a weakly aligned solution to the underlying spin interactions, and then use this relation to compute the Residual Dipolar Coupling (RDC). We begin with the fundamental two-spin Hamiltonian for a heteronuclear pair of spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ nuclei, labeled $I$ (proton) and $S$ (carbon). The total Hamiltonian is written as\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\;=\\; \\mathcal{H}_{Z} \\;+\\; \\mathcal{H}_{J} \\;+\\; \\mathcal{H}_{D},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{Z}$ is the Zeeman interaction with the static magnetic field, $\\mathcal{H}_{J}$ is the isotropic scalar coupling, and $\\mathcal{H}_{D}$ is the dipolar coupling. The Zeeman term is\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{Z} \\;=\\; -\\hbar \\omega_{I} I_{z} \\;-\\; \\hbar \\omega_{S} S_{z},\n$$\nwith $\\omega_{I}$ and $\\omega_{S}$ the Larmor angular frequencies of the $I$ and $S$ spins, respectively, and $I_{z}$, $S_{z}$ the $z$-components of the spin angular momentum operators. The isotropic scalar coupling Hamiltonian is\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{J} \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\hbar J \\,\\mathbf{I}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\hbar J \\left(I_{x}S_{x} + I_{y}S_{y} + I_{z}S_{z}\\right),\n$$\nwith $J$ the scalar coupling constant in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. The magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between the two spins is described by\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{D}^{\\mathrm{full}} \\;=\\; -\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\gamma_{I}\\gamma_{S}\\hbar^{2}}{r^{3}} \\left[\\mathbf{I}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\;-\\; 3(\\mathbf{I}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\mathbf{S}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\right],\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{0}$ is the vacuum permeability, $\\gamma_{I}$ and $\\gamma_{S}$ are the gyromagnetic ratios, $r$ is the internuclear distance, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector along the internuclear axis. In an isotropic liquid, rapid molecular tumbling averages $\\mathcal{H}_{D}^{\\mathrm{full}}$ to zero. In a weakly aligning medium, a small fraction of the dipolar interaction survives time averaging and gives a residual term. Under the high-field secular approximation (where only $z$-component terms that commute with $\\mathcal{H}_{Z}$ survive to first order in perturbation theory), both $\\mathcal{H}_{J}$ and the residual part of $\\mathcal{H}_{D}^{\\mathrm{full}}$ contribute to an effective $I_{z}S_{z}$ term. We therefore write an effective first-order Hamiltonian for line positions as\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\;=\\; -\\hbar \\omega_{I} I_{z} \\;-\\; \\hbar \\omega_{S} S_{z} \\;+\\; 2\\pi \\hbar \\left(J + D\\right) I_{z} S_{z},\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the residual dipolar coupling constant in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ that encapsulates ensemble averaging over the alignment tensor via $\\langle P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\\rangle$, with $P_{2}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(3x^{2}-1)$ the second Legendre polynomial and $\\theta$ the angle between the internuclear vector and the principal axis of alignment.\n\nTo obtain the observed splitting of the $I$-spin resonance, we analyze the energies in the Zeeman product basis $\\{|m_{I},m_{S}\\rangle\\}$ with $m_{I},m_{S}\\in\\{+\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\}$. The expectation value of $I_{z}S_{z}$ in these basis states is $m_{I}m_{S}$. The energy of a state $|m_{I},m_{S}\\rangle$ under $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is\n$$\nE(m_{I},m_{S}) \\;=\\; -\\hbar \\omega_{I} m_{I} \\;-\\; \\hbar \\omega_{S} m_{S} \\;+\\; 2\\pi \\hbar (J + D)\\, m_{I} m_{S}.\n$$\nTransitions observed on the $I$-spin correspond to flipping $m_{I}$ from $-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ to $+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ while keeping $m_{S}$ fixed.

The calculation of $D$ as a difference implicitly adopts this convention.\n\nTherefore, the RDC magnitude is $12.00\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ when expressed with four significant figures.",

            "solution": "The solution is presented in two parts as requested: the derivation of the governing expression followed by its application to compute the numerical value.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Residual Dipolar Coupling Expression**\n\nThe interaction between two nuclear spins, such as a carbon ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) and a hydrogen ($^1\\mathrm{H}$), includes a through-space dipolar coupling. In the high-field approximation (the \"secular\" approximation), the energy contribution from this interaction, which manifests as a splitting in the NMR spectrum, is given by the dipolar coupling, $D(\\theta)$. For a fixed internuclear vector $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ making an angle $\\theta$ with the external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$, this coupling is:\n$$D(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} D_{\\max} (3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$$\nwhere $D_{\\max}$ is the maximum dipolar coupling constant, which depends on the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei and the inverse cube of the internuclear distance $r_{\\mathrm{CH}}$.\n\nIn an isotropic solution, molecules tumble rapidly and randomly, causing the orientational term $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$ to average to zero over time. Consequently, the dipolar coupling is averaged out and is not observed.\nIn a weakly aligning medium, the molecular tumbling is slightly anisotropic. This results in a non-zero ensemble average of the orientational term, leading to an observable, or \"residual,\" dipolar coupling, $D_{\\mathrm{RDC}}$.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{RDC}} = \\langle D(\\theta) \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} D_{\\max} (3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right\\rangle$$\nSince $D_{\\max}$ is a constant for a rigid bond, we can write:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{RDC}} = \\frac{1}{2} D_{\\max} \\langle 3\\cos^2\\theta - 1 \\rangle$$\n\nTo relate this to the molecular orientation, let us define a molecule-fixed Cartesian coordinate system $(x_m, y_m, z_m)$. Let the unit vector along the C-H bond be $\\mathbf{v}$ with components $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ in this frame. The laboratory frame $(x_l, y_l, z_l)$ is defined with the external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$ along the $z_l$ axis. Let $\\alpha_i$ be the angle between the molecular axis $i \\in \\{x_m, y_m, z_m\\}$ and the laboratory $z_l$-axis. The cosine of the angle $\\theta$ between the bond vector $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is the projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto the $z_l$-axis:\n$$\\cos\\theta = v_x \\cos\\alpha_x + v_y \\cos\\alpha_y + v_z \\cos\\alpha_z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} v_i \\cos\\alpha_i$$\nHere we drop the subscript $m$ for clarity. Squaring this expression gives:\n$$\\cos^2\\theta = \\left(\\sum_i v_i \\cos\\alpha_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j v_j \\cos\\alpha_j\\right) = \\sum_{i,j} v_i v_j \\cos\\alpha_i \\cos\\alpha_j$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{RDC}}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{RDC}} = \\frac{1}{2} D_{\\max} \\left\\langle 3 \\sum_{i,j} v_i v_j \\cos\\alpha_i \\cos\\alpha_j - 1 \\right\\rangle$$\nSince $\\mathbf{v}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude is $1$, so $|\\mathbf{v}|^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 = 1$.
