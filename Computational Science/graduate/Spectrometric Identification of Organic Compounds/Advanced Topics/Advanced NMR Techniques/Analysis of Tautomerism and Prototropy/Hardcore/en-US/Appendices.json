It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical kinetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), defined as the ratio of the rate constant for the reaction with the light isotope (H) to that with the heavy isotope (D), denoted as $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$. We are also asked to infer the role of hydrogen transfer in the rate-determining step.\n\nThe problem states that the observed exchange of magnetization between the keto and enol sites follows first-order kinetics. For any first-order process, the relationship between the rate constant, $k$, and the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is given by:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThis relationship applies to both the protio (H) and deuterio (D) isotopologues. The problem states that the NMR exchange experiments measure the half-lives for site-to-site magnetization transfer. For a symmetric two-site exchange, as specified in the problem ($p_{keto} = p_{enol} = 0.5$), the measured first-order rate constant of exchange, $k_{ex}$, is equal to the microscopic chemical rate constant of the tautomerization reaction.\n\nThus, we can write the chemical rate constants for the protio ($k_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and deuterio ($k_{\\mathrmD}$) systems in terms of their measured half-lives, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}$ and $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}$$\nThe primary kinetic isotope effect is the ratio of these rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)}$$\nThe $\\ln(2)$ term cancels, yielding a simple inverse relationship between the KIE and the half-lives:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nThis result is logically consistent: a faster reaction (larger $k$) corresponds to a shorter half-life.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}} = 4.81 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}} = 2.89 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the KIE:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{2.89 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{4.81 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{0.289}{0.0481} \\approx 6.008316$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input data.\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\approx 6.01$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. A primary kinetic isotope effect is observed when a covalent bond to the isotopically substituted atom is broken or formed in the rate-determining step (RDS) of a reaction. The effect arises primarily from the difference in zero-point vibrational energies (ZPEs) of the bonds involving the lighter and heavier isotopes. The ZPE of a C-H (or O-H) bond is higher than that of the corresponding C-D (or O-D) bond. Consequently, more energy is required to break the bond to deuterium, leading to a slower reaction rate ($k_{\\mathrm{D}}  k_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and a KIE value, $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$, greater than $1$.\n\nFor the cleavage of a C-H versus a C-D bond at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the semiclassical model predicts a maximum KIE of approximately $7$ to $8$. The calculated value of $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}} \\approx 6.01$ is a large, significant primary KIE. Such a large value is strong evidence that the bond to the transferring hydrogen (or deuterium) is being broken in the rate-determining step of the tautomerization reaction under these catalytic conditions. If the transfer were not involved in the RDS, a much smaller secondary KIE (typically in the range of $0.9$ to $1.2$) would be expected. Therefore, we infer that the proton transfer is indeed part of the rate-determining step.",

The exchange is dominated by general acid catalysis with approximately first-order dependence on $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$, and the deuterated acid produces hydrogen/deuterium ($\\mathrm{H}/\\mathrm{D}$) labeling at the exchangeable $\\mathrm{OH}$ site, causing integral decay artifacts. To suppress artifacts, remove acidic impurities and surfaces by using acid-free solvent (freshly distilled, stored over neutral drying agents), passivated or Teflon-lined tubes, and include a small stoichiometric excess of a hindered base (e.g., $2,6$-di-tert-butylpyridine or triethylamine) to neutralize trace acid; optionally lower $T$ to reduce $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n\nB.

The exchange is first-order with respect to the acid concentration.\n*   The data for the H/D exchange rate, $k_{\\mathrm{HD}}$, also shows a first-order dependence on $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$: doubling the acid concentration from $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to $2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ doubles $k_{\\mathrm{HD}}$ from $0.10\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ to $0.20\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n*   The neutralization experiment, where adding an equimolar amount of base (triethylamine) to the acidified solution reduces $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ from $38.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ back to $2.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (close to the baseline of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), strongly supports the acid-catalysis hypothesis.\n*   The surface control experiment, where using a Teflon insert reduces the baseline rate from $2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, correctly implies that the active surface of the glass NMR tube (containing acidic silanol groups, $\\mathrm{Si-OH}$) contributes to the baseline catalysis.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the most consistent mechanistic interpretation of the keto-enol tautomerism kinetics and an appropriate control strategy. The analysis will proceed by integrating the provided kinetic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Catalytic Mechanism**\nThe overall rate of exchange, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, is a sum of contributions from different pathways:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{\\mathrm{uncat}} + k_{\\mathrm{acid}}[\\text{Acid}]^n + k_{\\mathrm{base}}[\\text{Base}]^m + k_{\\mathrm{surface}}$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{uncat}}$ is the uncatalyzed rate, and the other terms represent contributions from acid, base, and surface catalysis, respectively.\n\n*   **Effect of Acid:** The addition of $\\mathrm{DCl}$ causes a dramatic increase in $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. As calculated during validation, the rate increase is directly proportional to the concentration of $\\mathrm{DCl}$ (first-order kinetics, $n=1$). This is the hallmark of **general acid catalysis**. A plausible mechanism involves protonation of the keto carbonyl by the acid catalyst, forming a cationic intermediate, which then loses a proton from the $\\alpha$-carbon to a base (e.g., solvent, $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$) to form the enol.\n*   **Effect of Base:** The neutralization experiment with triethylamine, a base, quenches the fast, acid-catalyzed exchange. The rate drops from $38.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $2.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, nearly returning to the baseline rate of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This confirms that the added acid is the primary driver of the fast exchange and that the system is not dominated by base catalysis. If it were base-catalyzed, adding acid would have suppressed the rate, which is the opposite of what was observed.\n*   **Effect of Surface:** The use of a Teflon insert reduces the baseline rate from $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Teflon is chemically inert, while the surface of a standard glass NMR tube contains silanol ($\\mathrm{Si-OH}$) groups. These groups are weakly acidic and can catalyze prototropic exchange. This experiment demonstrates that surface catalysis from the glass tube contributes approximately $1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to the baseline exchange rate.\n*   **Baseline Rate:** The baseline rate of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ can be attributed to contributions from the glass surface ($k_{\\mathrm{surface}} \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and from trace acidic impurities commonly found in $\\mathrm{CDCl}_3$ (e.g., DCl or HCl from solvent degradation), which would account for the remaining $k_{rem} \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of H/D Isotopic Exchange**\nThe enolic proton, being acidic, is exchangeable. The addition of a deuterated acid, $\\mathrm{DCl}$, provides a source of deuterons ($\\mathrm{D}^+$). The acid-catalyzed tautomerism mechanism provides a pathway for the enolic proton to be replaced by a deuteron: $\\text{Enol-OH} \\xrightleftharpoons[\\text{catalyst}] \\text{Enol-OD}$. This isotopic substitution causes the observable proton NMR signal for the $\\mathrm{OH}$ group to decrease in intensity over time, as it is replaced by an OD group (deuterium is not observed in a standard $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment). The rate of this process, $k_{\\mathrm{HD}}$, is shown to be first-order in $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$, which is consistent with the same acid-catalyzed mechanism responsible for the tautomerization itself. This decay of the integral is an 'artifact' if one is trying to measure the stable concentration of the enol tautomer.\n\n**3. Synthesis of a Control Strategy**\nTo suppress unintended catalysis and exchange artifacts, one must address all identified sources of catalysis.\n*   **Acid Catalysis Suppression:** Trace acids in the solvent and from external contamination must be removed or neutralized. This can be achieved by using freshly purified (e.g., distilled) solvent that has been passed through a column of neutral alumina or by storing it over a neutral drying agent. A highly effective method is to add a small amount of a non-nucleophilic, hindered base (a \"proton sponge\" like 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine or, as demonstrated in the problem, triethylamine) to scavenge any acidic species.\n*   **Surface Catalysis Suppression:** The catalytic contribution from the glass tube surface must be eliminated. This is achieved by using an NMR tube with a passivated internal surface or, as shown in the problem, by using an inert polymer insert made of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).\n*   **Kinetic Slowing:** All chemical reaction rates, including exchange, are temperature-dependent as described by the Arrhenius equation. Lowering the sample temperature, $T$, will decrease $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. If the exchange is causing undesirable line broadening at room temperature ($298\\,\\mathrm{K}$), cooling the sample can shift the system from the intermediate or fast exchange regime to the slow exchange regime on the NMR timescale, resulting in sharp, well-resolved signals for each tautomer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The experimental data point overwhelmingly to a system where keto-enol exchange is subject to general acid catalysis from added acid, trace impurities, and active surfaces. An effective control strategy must address all these factors.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The exchange is dominated by general acid catalysis with approximately first-order dependence on $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$, and the deuterated acid produces hydrogen/deuterium ($\\mathrm{H}/\\mathrm{D}$) labeling at the exchangeable $\\mathrm{OH}$ site, causing integral decay artifacts. To suppress artifacts, remove acidic impurities and surfaces by using acid-free solvent (freshly distilled, stored over neutral drying agents), passivated or Teflon-lined tubes, and include a small stoichiometric excess of a hindered base (e.g., $2,6$-di-tert-butylpyridine or triethylamine) to neutralize trace acid; optionally lower $T$ to reduce $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.**\n*   This option correctly identifies the dominant mechanism as general acid catalysis with first-order dependence on $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$. It correctly explains the H/D labeling and integral decay as a consequence. The proposed control strategies—using purified solvent, passivated tubes, adding a base scavenger, and lowering the temperature—are all scientifically sound and directly supported by the provided experimental data and fundamental principles.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The exchange is purely base catalyzed; addition of $\\mathrm{DCl}$ reduces $[\\mathrm{B}]$ via a common-ion effect, which slows exchange. Therefore, artifacts are suppressed by adding a stronger acid to fix $[\\mathrm{B}]$ at a low value and running at a higher $T$ to sharpen peaks.**\n*   This option claims base catalysis. This is directly contradicted by the observation that adding acid ($\\mathrm{DCl}$) *accelerates* the exchange rate by an order of magnitude. The proposed control of adding more acid is counterproductive. Furthermore, increasing temperature would increase $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, leading to more, not less, line broadening (unless already in the fast-exchange limit, which is not the goal here).\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The exchange is uncatalyzed and controlled by solvent viscosity. The observed rate changes reflect viscosity differences between the solutions as small volumes of additives are introduced. Artifacts are suppressed by increasing solvent viscosity (e.g., switching to $\\mathrm{d}_6$-dimethyl sulfoxide) without additional controls for acid or base.**\n*   This option is inconsistent with the data. The addition of millimolar concentrations of solutes does not change the bulk solvent viscosity enough to cause a nearly $20$-fold increase in rate (from $2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $38.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). The clear dependence on acid concentration and the effect of neutralization prove the process is chemically catalyzed, not diffusion-controlled. Ignoring acid/base controls is contrary to all evidence.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The exchange exhibits identical orders in acid and base (symmetrical general acid-base catalysis). Because $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$ doubles and $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ nearly doubles, the system is balanced; artifacts are best suppressed by adding equimolar acid and base as a buffer to stabilize ionic strength, with no need for tube passivation or solvent purification.**\n*   This option misinterprets the kinetic data. The rate contribution from the acid, $\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, doubles when $[\\mathrm{DCl}]$ doubles, indicating first-order kinetics in acid, not that the total rate \"nearly doubles\". There is no data to support any claim about the order in base. The claim that there is \"no need for tube passivation or solvent purification\" is directly falsified by the control experiment with the Teflon insert and the existence of a non-zero baseline rate that is reduced by adding base.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
