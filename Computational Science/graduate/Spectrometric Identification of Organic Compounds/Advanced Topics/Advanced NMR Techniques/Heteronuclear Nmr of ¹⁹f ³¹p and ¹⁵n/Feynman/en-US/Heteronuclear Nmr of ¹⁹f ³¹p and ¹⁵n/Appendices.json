            "introduction": "The foundation of all nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy lies in the Larmor frequency, the specific frequency at which a nucleus precesses in a magnetic field. This practice takes you back to the first principles of physics to connect a nucleus's fundamental properties—its gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$—to its observable resonance frequency. By deriving this relationship and applying it to calculate the frequencies for $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$, $^{31}\\mathrm{P}$, and $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ in a high-field spectrometer, you will gain a concrete appreciation for why different nuclei are observed in vastly different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
