            "problem": "A monosubstituted cyclohexane in an idealized chair conformation is analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). To rationalize vicinal three-bond proton–proton coupling constants, use the Karplus relation for a proton–proton vicinal coupling: $J(\\theta)=A\\cos^{2}\\theta+B\\cos\\theta+C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are empirical parameters, $J$ is in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, and $\\theta$ is the dihedral angle in degrees for the H–C–C–H torsion. Assume an idealized cyclohexane chair at room temperature with negligible conformational averaging for the specific vicinal pairs considered. For adjacent carbons in the ring, take the dihedral angle for an axial–axial vicinal pair to be $\\theta_{ax,ax}=180^{\\circ}$ and for an axial–equatorial vicinal pair to be $\\theta_{ax,eq}=60^{\\circ}$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and stereochemistry, is well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific fact.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep analysis involving both conceptual explanation and numerical calculation. The solution is structured as follows: first, an explanation of the origin of the specified dihedral angles in a chair cyclohexane; second, a rationale for the Karplus relation; third, the calculation of vicinal coupling constants and their ratio; and finally, an explanation of how coupling constants and the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) are used for stereochemical assignment.\n\n**1. Origin of Dihedral Angles in an Idealized Chair Cyclohexane**\n\nThe chair conformation is the most stable arrangement of a cyclohexane ring. In this conformation, the carbon atoms form a puckered ring, and the attached hydrogen atoms occupy two distinct types of positions: axial ($ax$) and equatorial ($eq$). Axial bonds are approximately perpendicular to the mean plane of the ring, alternating above and below it, while equatorial bonds point outwards from the periphery of the ring, roughly within the mean plane.\n\nTo visualize the vicinal three-bond H–C–C–H dihedral angle, $\\theta$, we use a Newman projection looking down a C–C bond of the ring.\n\n- **Axial–Axial ($ax,ax$) Vicinal Protons**: Consider two vicinal protons, one on carbon $C_1$ and one on $C_2$, both in axial positions ($H_{1,ax}$ and $H_{2,ax}$). Sighting down the $C_1–C_2$ bond, the $C_1–H_{1,ax}$ bond and the $C_2–H_{2,ax}$ bond are seen to be anti-periplanar. This means they are in the same plane but point in opposite directions. The dihedral angle between them is thus $\\theta_{ax,ax} = 180^{\\circ}$. This anti-periplanar arrangement is a key feature of the chair conformation.\n\n- **Axial–Equatorial ($ax,eq$) Vicinal Protons**: Consider an axial proton on $C_1$ ($H_{1,ax}$) and an equatorial proton on $C_2$ ($H_{2,eq}$). In a Newman projection along the $C_1–C_2$ bond, the $C_1–H_{1,ax}$ bond and the $C_2–H_{2,eq}$ bond are in a gauche relationship. In an idealized, perfectly staggered chair conformation, this dihedral angle is $\\theta_{ax,eq} = 60^{\\circ}$. By symmetry, the same angle, $60^{\\circ}$, applies to an equatorial-axial pair ($H_{1,eq}$, $H_{2,ax}$) and an equatorial-equatorial pair ($H_{1,eq}$, $H_{2,eq}$).\n\n**2. Rationale for the Karplus Relation**\n\nThe three-bond proton-proton coupling, $^{3}J_{HH}$, also known as vicinal coupling, is a through-bond scalar interaction. The magnetic influence of one proton nucleus is transmitted to a neighboring proton nucleus via the intervening bonding electrons along the H–C–C–H path. The magnitude of this coupling, $J$, is critically dependent on the overlap between the molecular orbitals that constitute this pathway.\n\nThe degree of orbital overlap is, in turn, a function of the dihedral angle, $\\theta$, between the two C–H bonds. Quantum mechanical calculations first performed by Martin Karplus showed that the coupling is maximized when the C–H bonds are coplanar, corresponding to syn-periplanar ($\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$) and anti-periplanar ($\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$) arrangements, where orbital overlap is most effective. The coupling is minimized when the C–H bonds are orthogonal ($\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$), as the orbital overlap along the coupling pathway is nearly zero.\n\nThe Karplus relation, $J(\\theta)=A\\cos^{2}\\theta+B\\cos\\theta+C$, is an empirical formula that models this behavior.\n- The dominant term, $A\\cos^{2}\\theta$, captures the primary dependence. Since $\\cos^{2}(0^{\\circ}) = 1$ and $\\cos^{2}(180^{\\circ}) = 1$, this term correctly predicts large couplings for coplanar protons. Since $\\cos^{2}(90^{\\circ}) = 0$, it predicts a minimal coupling for orthogonal protons.\n- The terms $B\\cos\\theta$ and $C$ are empirical corrections that account for factors such as electronegativity of substituents, C–C bond length, and H–C–C bond angles, which cause deviations from the simple $\\cos^{2}\\theta$ dependence. This refined equation provides a robust tool for relating experimentally measured coupling constants to molecular geometry.\n\n**3. Calculation of $^{3}J_{ax,ax}$, $^{3}J_{ax,eq}$, and the Ratio $R$**\n\nWe are given the Karplus equation and a set of parameters:\n- Equation: $J(\\theta)=A\\cos^{2}\\theta+B\\cos\\theta+C$\n- Parameters: $A=9.5$, $B=-0.5$, $C=0.5$\n- Angles: $\\theta_{ax,ax}=180^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{ax,eq}=60^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, we compute the axial-axial coupling constant, $^{3}J_{ax,ax}$:\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,ax} = J(180^{\\circ}) = A\\cos^{2}(180^{\\circ}) + B\\cos(180^{\\circ}) + C $$\nUsing $\\cos(180^{\\circ}) = -1$, we have:\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,ax} = (9.5)(-1)^{2} + (-0.5)(-1) + 0.5 $$\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,ax} = 9.5 \\times 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 $$\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,ax} = 10.5 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} $$\n\nNext, we compute the axial-equatorial coupling constant, $^{3}J_{ax,eq}$:\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,eq} = J(60^{\\circ}) = A\\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) + B\\cos(60^{\\circ}) + C $$\nUsing $\\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 0.5$, we have:\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,eq} = (9.5)(0.5)^{2} + (-0.5)(0.5) + 0.5 $$\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,eq} = 9.5 \\times 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.5 $$\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,eq} = 2.375 - 0.25 + 0.5 $$\n$$ ^{3}J_{ax,eq} = 2.625 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{{}^{3}J_{ax,ax}}{{}^{3}J_{ax,eq}} = \\frac{10.5}{2.625} $$\n$$ R = 4 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $R = 4.000$.\n\n**4. Stereochemical Assignment using $J$-Coupling and NOE**\n\nThe calculated values show that $^{3}J_{ax,ax}$ (a \"large\" coupling, typically $8-13 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$) is significantly greater than $^{3}J_{ax,eq}$ (a \"small\" coupling, typically $2-5 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$). This difference is a powerful tool for determining the stereochemistry of protons, and thus substituents, on a cyclohexane ring.\n\n- **Using $J$-Coupling**: Consider the methine proton ($H_X$) on the carbon atom bearing a substituent.\n    - If the substituent is in the more stable **equatorial** position, $H_X$ must be **axial**. This axial proton has two vicinal axial neighbors (one on each adjacent carbon), leading to two large $^{3}J_{ax,ax}$ couplings in its NMR signal. The signal for $H_X$ will therefore be a broad multiplet with a large overall width, characterized by at least one large coupling constant ($ 8 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$).\n    - If the substituent is in the less stable **axial** position, $H_X$ must be **equatorial**. This equatorial proton has no vicinal axial-axial relationships; all its vicinal couplings ($^{3}J_{eq,ax}$ and $^{3}J_{eq,eq}$) are small. The signal for $H_X$ will be a narrow multiplet with only small coupling constants.\n    - Thus, measuring the coupling constants for $H_X$ allows for unambiguous determination of its axial or equatorial nature, which in turn defines the stereochemistry of the substituent.\n\n- **Using the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE)**: The NOE is a through-space phenomenon, detecting nuclei that are close to each other (typically $ 5$ Å), irrespective of bonding. This provides complementary information to through-bond $J$-coupling.\n    - In a chair conformation, axial groups at positions $1$, $3$, and $5$ (the \"1,3-diaxial\" relationship) are spatially close to one another on the same face of the ring.\n    - If a substituent (with protons) is **axial**, an NOE experiment will reveal spatial proximity (a \"cross-peak\" in a 2D NOESY spectrum) between its protons and the axial protons at the $3$ and $5$ positions.\n    - If a substituent is **equatorial**, it is distant from the axial protons at positions $3$ and $5$. It is instead close to the vicinal protons (both axial and equatorial) on the adjacent carbons. An NOE experiment would show correlations to these adjacent protons but critically, no correlation to the 1,3-diaxial protons.\n\nBy combining the information from $J$-coupling (which reveals dihedral angles) and NOE (which reveals spatial proximity), a chemist can unequivocally assign the stereochemistry of a substituted cyclohexane. For example, the observation of a large coupling constant for the methine proton $H_X$ indicates it is axial, placing the substituent in the equatorial position. This assignment can be definitively confirmed if NOE experiments show no correlations between the substituent and the 1,3-diaxial protons.",

Report the numerical value of $ \\sigma_{A}/\\sigma_{B} $ and round your answer to three significant figures. Express the final answer as a pure number (dimensionless).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the proportional dependence of the cross-relaxation rate constant, $\\sigma$, on the internuclear distance $r$ and the rotational correlation time $\\tau_c$, followed by the calculation of the ratio of these rates for two different proton pairs, A and B.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The problem provides specific data ($r_{A} = 2.5$ Å, $r_{B} = 3.5$ Å, $\\tau_{c} = 0.5$ ns) and a theoretical framework (dipolar relaxation, isotropic tumbling, extreme narrowing condition $\\omega_{0} \\tau_{c} \\ll 1$). While the descriptive phrase \"Larmor frequency is sufficiently high\" might seem contradictory to the extreme narrowing condition for the given $\\tau_c$ in a practical setting, the problem explicitly states that the condition $\\omega_{0} \\tau_{c} \\ll 1$ holds. This is interpreted as a directive to use the mathematical model associated with this limit, a common pedagogical approach. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation, is well-posed, and objective. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a phenomenon that arises from dipolar cross-relaxation between nuclear spins. The initial rate of NOE build-up between two spins is directly proportional to the cross-relaxation rate constant, $\\sigma$. For a homonuclear two-spin system, such as two protons, the Solomon equations provide the expression for $\\sigma$ as the difference between the double-quantum ($W_2$) and zero-quantum ($W_0$) transition probabilities:\n$$ \\sigma = W_2 - W_0 $$\nThese transition probabilities are caused by the fluctuating magnetic fields from the dipolar interaction. Their rates depend on the spectral density function, $J(\\omega)$, evaluated at specific frequencies. For two identical spins with Larmor frequency $\\omega_0$, the expressions are:\n$$ W_0 = \\frac{1}{10} K^2 J(0) $$\n$$ W_2 = \\frac{3}{5} K^2 J(2\\omega_0) $$\nThe term $K^2$ quantifies the strength of the static dipolar interaction and is given by:\n$$ K^2 = \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\right) \\frac{\\gamma^2 \\hbar}{r^3} \\right)^2 $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, and $r$ is the internuclear distance. From this expression, we see the crucial dependence of the relaxation parameters on distance:\n$$ K^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{r^6} $$\nThis is consistent with the problem's statement that the dipolar Hamiltonian scales as $r^{-3}$, as rate constants are proportional to the square of the interaction energy matrix elements.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $W_0$ and $W_2$ into the equation for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{3}{5} K^2 J(2\\omega_0) - \\frac{1}{10} K^2 J(0) = K^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} J(2\\omega_0) - \\frac{1}{10} J(0) \\right) $$\nThe problem states that the molecule undergoes isotropic tumbling and that the extreme narrowing condition, $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\ll 1$, is met. For isotropic motion, the spectral density function takes the form:\n$$ J(\\omega) = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{\\tau_c}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_c)^2} $$\nIn the extreme narrowing limit, the term $(\\omega\\tau_c)^2$ is negligible compared to $1$ for all relevant frequencies (i.e., $\\omega = 0$ and $\\omega = 2\\omega_0$). The denominator thus becomes approximately $1$, simplifying the spectral density function to:\n$$ J(\\omega) \\approx \\frac{2}{5} \\tau_c $$\nThis simplified form is independent of frequency and directly proportional to the rotational correlation time $\\tau_c$, as asserted in the problem statement. We now substitute this approximation back into the expression for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma \\approx K^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c\\right) - \\frac{1}{10} \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c\\right) \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common terms to simplify:\n$$ \\sigma \\approx K^2 \\tau_c \\left( \\frac{6}{25} - \\frac{2}{50} \\right) = K^2 \\tau_c \\left( \\frac{6}{25} - \\frac{1}{25} \\right) = \\frac{5}{25} K^2 \\tau_c = \\frac{1}{5} K^2 \\tau_c $$\nNow, we reintroduce the distance dependence from $K^2 \\propto r^{-6}$. This yields the proportional dependence of $\\sigma$ on both $\\tau_c$ and $r$:\n$$ \\sigma \\propto \\frac{\\tau_c}{r^6} $$\nThis completes the derivation. The cross-relaxation rate is directly proportional to the rotational correlation time and inversely proportional to the sixth power of the internuclear distance.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio of the cross-relaxation rates, $\\sigma_A / \\sigma_B$, for the two proton pairs A and B. Based on the derived proportionality, we can write:\n$$ \\sigma_A = C \\frac{\\tau_c}{r_A^6} $$\n$$ \\sigma_B = C \\frac{\\tau_c}{r_B^6} $$\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, combines all physical constants and is the same for both proton pairs. The rotational correlation time, $\\tau_c$, describes the tumbling of the entire rigid molecule and is thus also the same for both pairs. Taking the ratio of $\\sigma_A$ to $\\sigma_B$ cancels these common factors:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B} = \\frac{C \\frac{\\tau_c}{r_A^6}}{C \\frac{\\tau_c}{r_B^6}} = \\frac{r_B^6}{r_A^6} = \\left(\\frac{r_B}{r_A}\\right)^6 $$\nThe problem provides the distances $r_{A} = 2.5$ Å and $r_{B} = 3.5$ Å. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B} = \\left(\\frac{3.5}{2.5}\\right)^6 $$\nThe ratio of the distances is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$ \\frac{3.5}{2.5} = \\frac{35}{25} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\nWe then compute the sixth power of this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B} = (1.4)^6 = 7.529536 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B} \\approx 7.53 $$",

Using foundational relationships, construct mathematically defined restraints and assess whether a proposed stereochemical model (distances and dihedral angles) is consistent with the data.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Under the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), the cross-relaxation rate $\\sigma_{ij}$ between two spins $i$ and $j$ is proportional to $r_{ij}^{-6}$, where $r_{ij}$ is the interproton distance.

This validation is performed by converting the two types of experimental data—Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) intensities and vicinal scalar ($^{3}J$) coupling constants—into geometric restraints, specifically on interproton distances and backbone dihedral angles. The proposed model is deemed consistent if and only if all its distances and angles satisfy these derived restraints.\n\nThe validation algorithm is implemented by systematically checking each restraint as follows:\n\n**1. NOE-Derived Distance Restraints**\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect is a phenomenon where the spin polarization of one nucleus is transferred to another nearby nucleus through space. The efficiency of this transfer, and thus the intensity of the corresponding cross-peak ($I_{ij}$) in a NOESY spectrum, is strongly dependent on the distance ($r_{ij}$) between the two nuclei ($i$ and $j$). For short experimental mixing times, this relationship is approximated as being proportional to $r_{ij}^{-6}$.\n\nBy using a calibration pair of protons with a known, fixed distance ($r_{\\text{cal}}$) and a measured NOE intensity ($I_{\\text{cal}}$), we can estimate other unknown distances using the ratiometric formula:\n$$r_{ij} = r_{\\text{cal}} \\left(\\frac{I_{\\text{cal}}}{I_{ij}}\\right)^{1/6}$$\nThis calculated distance, $r_{ij}$, is an estimate and is subject to experimental uncertainty. The problem defines three distinct scenarios for creating distance restraints from the NOE data:\n\n*   **Observed NOE Peak:** For any pair of protons ($i,j$) with a measured, non-zero intensity $I_{ij}$, the estimated distance is $r_{ij}$. A restraint is an acceptable range defined by a symmetric tolerance, $\\Delta r$. The model's distance, $d_{\\text{model}, ij}$, must satisfy the inclusive inequality:\n    $$r_{ij} - \\Delta r \\le d_{\\text{model}, ij} \\le r_{ij} + \\Delta r$$\n    This rule also applies to the calibrant pair itself. Since for the calibrant, $I_{ij} = I_{\\text{cal}}$, the formula correctly yields $r_{ij} = r_{\\text{cal}}$, and its restraint becomes $[r_{\\text{cal}} - \\Delta r, r_{\\text{cal}} + \\Delta r]$, consistent with the explicit instruction in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Missing NOE Peak:** If an NOE cross-peak between a pair of protons is not observed, it does not mean the distance is infinite. It implies that the intensity is below the experimental detection threshold, $I_{\\min}$. This information provides an upper bound on the allowed distance, but no lower bound. The maximum allowed distance, $r_{ij}^{\\max}$, is calculated by substituting $I_{\\min}$ into the distance formula:\n    $$r_{ij}^{\\max} = r_{\\text{cal}} \\left(\\frac{I_{\\text{cal}}}{I_{\\min}}\\right)^{1/6}$$\n    The model's distance must satisfy:\n    $$d_{\\text{model}, ij} \\le r_{ij}^{\\max}$$\n\n**2. Karplus-Derived Dihedral Angle Restraints**\n\nThe magnitude of the three-bond scalar coupling constant, $^{3}J$, between two nuclei is dependent on the dihedral angle ($\\phi$) along the bond path connecting them. This relationship is described by the empirical Karplus equation:\n$$^{3}J(\\phi) = A \\cos^{2}\\phi + B \\cos\\phi + C$$\nThe parameters $A$, $B$, and $C$ depend on the specific type of chemical fragment. All angular inputs and calculations must use consistent units; the model's angles are provided in degrees and must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric functions in the Karplus equation.\n\nFor each measured coupling, ${}^{3}J_{\\text{meas},k}$, associated with a specific dihedral angle $\\phi_k$, we can check for consistency. Using the model's proposed dihedral angle, $\\phi_{\\text{model},k}$, we calculate the expected coupling constant, $^{3}J_{\\text{calc},k}$. The model is consistent with this measurement if the absolute difference between the calculated and measured couplings is within a specified tolerance, $\\Delta J_k$:\n$$\\left| \\,^{3}J_{\\text{calc},k} - {}^{3}J_{\\text{meas},k} \\, \\right| \\le \\Delta J_k$$\n\n**3. Overall Model Consistency**\n\nA candidate stereochemical model is declared consistent only if every single distance and dihedral angle restraint derived from the experimental data is satisfied simultaneously. The failure of even one restraint is sufficient to invalidate the entire model. The algorithm will therefore iterate through all restraints, and if any check fails, the model is immediately classified as inconsistent. If all checks pass, the model is consistent.",
