            "introduction": "Every two-dimensional NMR experiment begins with a fundamental choice: how to sample the signal in the time domain to create the desired frequency-domain spectrum. This process is governed by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which dictates the relationship between the sampling rate and the range of frequencies that can be observed without distortion. This first practice invites you to derive this crucial relationship for the indirect dimension, connecting the sampling increment, or dwell time ($\\Delta t_1$), to the alias-free spectral width ($SW_1$), providing a foundational understanding for setting up any 2D NMR experiment .",

            "problem": "In two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the indirect evolution time dimension, denoted $t_1$, is sampled at discrete increments called the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$. The discrete sampling of the time-domain free induction decay (FID) along $t_1$ produces a frequency-domain axis $f_1$ after Fourier transformation. The width of the frequency-domain axis attainable without aliasing is commonly called the spectral width in the indirect dimension and is denoted $SW_1$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$).\n\nStarting only from the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem and the standard properties of Fourier transformation of discretely sampled time-domain signals, derive the relationship among the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$, the sampling rate $f_s$ along $t_1$, and the alias-free spectral width $SW_1$ in the indirect dimension, assuming quadrature detection yields a baseband representation centered at $f_1 = 0$ (so that observed frequencies span symmetrically about zero). Then, using your derived relationship, compute the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$ required to achieve $SW_1 = 5000$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer for $\\Delta t_1$ in $\\mathrm{s}$. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relationship between the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$, the sampling rate $f_s$, and the spectral width $SW_1$ in the indirect dimension of a two-dimensional NMR experiment, followed by a calculation of $\\Delta t_1$ for a given $SW_1$. The derivation must start from the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and the properties of Fourier transforms for discretely sampled data, under the condition of quadrature detection.\n\nLet us begin by stating the problem's underlying principles.\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is a fundamental principle in digital signal processing. For a band-limited real-valued signal, the theorem states that to reconstruct the original signal perfectly from its discrete samples, the sampling rate $f_s$ must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency component, $f_{max}$, present in the signal. This is often written as $f_s  2 f_{max}$. The frequency $f_N = f_s/2$ is known as the Nyquist frequency. If the sampling rate does not meet this criterion, a phenomenon known as aliasing occurs, where high-frequency components of the signal erroneously appear as lower frequencies in the sampled spectrum.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of quadrature detection. This technique involves sampling two components of the signal, one in-phase and one in quadrature (i.e., with a $90^\\circ$ phase shift). This produces a complex signal of the form $s(t) = s_I(t) + i s_Q(t)$. The primary advantage of processing a complex signal is the ability to distinguish between positive and negative frequencies relative to a carrier frequency. The problem states that the experiment yields a baseband representation centered at $f_1 = 0$. This means the carrier frequency has been mixed down to $0$ Hz, and the observed frequencies can be both positive and negative.\n\nFor a complex signal, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem is modified. A complex signal with frequencies limited to the range $[-B/2, B/2]$ has a total bandwidth of $B$. The theorem states that such a signal can be perfectly reconstructed if the complex sampling rate $f_s$ is greater than or equal to the bandwidth $B$. That is, $f_s \\ge B$.\n\nIn the context of NMR spectroscopy, the spectral width, $SW_1$, represents the total frequency range that is to be observed without aliasing. The problem states that the frequencies span symmetrically about zero, so the frequency range of interest is from $-SW_1/2$ to $+SW_1/2$. The total bandwidth of this signal is therefore $(SW_1/2) - (-SW_1/2) = SW_1$.\n\nApplying the Nyquist-Shannon theorem for complex signals, the minimum sampling rate $f_s$ required to avoid aliasing across the spectral width $SW_1$ is given by the equality:\n$$f_s = SW_1$$\n\nThe signal in the indirect time dimension, $t_1$, is sampled at discrete increments. The duration of this increment is the dwell time, $\\Delta t_1$. The sampling rate, $f_s$, is defined as the number of samples taken per unit time. Therefore, the sampling rate is the reciprocal of the dwell time:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1}$$\n\nBy substituting this expression for $f_s$ into the relationship derived from the sampling theorem, we obtain the direct relationship between the spectral width $SW_1$ and the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$:\n$$SW_1 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship required by the first part of the problem. This equation shows that the spectral width is inversely proportional to the dwell time in the indirect dimension.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the calculation of the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$ needed to achieve a spectral width of $SW_1 = 5000$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$. We can rearrange the derived equation to solve for $\\Delta t_1$:\n$$\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{SW_1}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $SW_1$:\n$$\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{5000 \\text{ Hz}}$$\nSince the unit Hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$) is equivalent to inverse seconds ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), the resulting unit for $\\Delta t_1$ will be seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{5000} \\text{ s}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value:\n$$\\Delta t_1 = 0.0002 \\text{ s}$$\n\nTo express this in standard scientific notation as required for the final answer format, this is:\n$$\\Delta t_1 = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}$$\nThis is the required dwell time in the indirect dimension to achieve an alias-free spectral width of $5000$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$ using quadrature detection.",

            "introduction": "Having established how spectral width is defined by the sampling rate, a critical question arises: what happens to signals whose frequencies fall outside this chosen window? In digital signal processing, these signals don't simply disappear; they are \"folded\" back into the spectrum through a phenomenon called aliasing. This exercise  provides a practical application of this concept, challenging you to calculate the apparent position of an aliased peak, a vital skill for correctly interpreting complex spectra and identifying potential artifacts.",

The corresponding spectral widths are $\\,\\mathrm{SW}_1 = 1/\\Delta t_1\\,$ and $\\,\\mathrm{SW}_2 = 1/\\Delta t_2\\,$, respectively.

The corresponding spectral widths are\n$$\n\\mathrm{SW}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1}, \\qquad \\mathrm{SW}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_2}.\n$$\nBy the sampling theorem, the discretely sampled time-domain signal produces, upon discrete Fourier transformation, a frequency-domain spectrum that is periodic with period $\\,\\mathrm{SW}\\,$ in the corresponding dimension. For complex quadrature detection (obtained by recording sine and cosine components), the baseband extends from $-\\mathrm{SW}/2$ to $+\\mathrm{SW}/2$ about the chosen carrier (transmitter) frequency, and out-of-window components are translated back into the displayed window by an integer multiple of $\\,\\mathrm{SW}\\,$ without mirror reflection. In contrast, with real sampling, mirror images would appear about the Nyquist frequency, but in standard two-dimensional experiments phase-sensitive acquisition (e.g., States or States-Time Proportional Phase Incrementation) produces complex data so that aliasing is translational folding.\n\nThus, in each dimension $F_k$ with spectral width $\\,\\mathrm{SW}_k\\,$ and a displayed window $\\,[f_{\\min,k},\\,f_{\\max,k})\\,$ of width $\\,\\mathrm{SW}_k\\,$, any true frequency $\\,f_{\\text{true},k}\\,$ maps to an apparent in-window frequency $\\,f_{\\text{app},k}\\,$ given conceptually by modular reduction:\n$$\nf_{\\text{app},k} \\;=\\; f_{\\min,k} \\;+\\; \\bigl[(f_{\\text{true},k} - f_{\\min,k}) \\bmod \\mathrm{SW}_k \\bigr],\n$$\nwhere $\\,x \\bmod \\mathrm{SW}\\,$ denotes the unique value in $[0,\\,\\mathrm{SW})$ congruent to $\\,x\\,$ modulo $\\,\\mathrm{SW}\\,$.

Analysis of a Single INEPT Transfer**\n\nThe problem specifies that evolution occurs only under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{J} = 2\\pi J_{HN} I_{z} S_{z}$ during the evolution delays. A standard INEPT transfer block involves a spin-echo of the form $(\\text{pulse}) - \\Delta - \\pi - \\Delta - (\\text{pulse})$, which allows for evolution under scalar coupling for a total duration of $2\\Delta$ while refocusing chemical shifts. We analyze the evolution of magnetization through such a block using the product operator formalism.\n\n- **Initial State**: The system starts at thermal equilibrium, with magnetization aligned along the $z$-axis: $\\sigma_0 = I_z$.\n- **First Pulse**: A non-selective $(\\pi/2)_x$ pulse applied to the $I$ spins rotates the magnetization to the transverse plane:\n$$I_z \\xrightarrow{(\\pi/2)_x(I)} -I_y$$\nThe state of the system is now $\\sigma_1 = -I_y$.\n\n- **J-Coupling Evolution**: The transverse magnetization $-I_y$ evolves under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{J}$ for a total period of $T = 2\\Delta$.
