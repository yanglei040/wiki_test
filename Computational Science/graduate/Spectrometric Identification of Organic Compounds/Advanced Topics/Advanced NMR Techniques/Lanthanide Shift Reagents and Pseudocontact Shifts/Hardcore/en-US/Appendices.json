The exchange between $\\mathrm{S}$ and $\\mathrm{SL}$ is fast on the NMR timescale, and the observed chemical shifts are population-weighted. The binding equilibrium is described by the law of mass action with the binding constant $K_{b}$ defined as $K_{b} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{SL}]}{[\\mathrm{S}][\\mathrm{L}]}$.

Increasing the fraction of complexed substrate $f$ by adding more LSR enhances the separation between NMR resonances by magnifying the pseudocontact shifts, which can resolve signal overlap. However, this beneficial effect is counteracted by significant paramagnetically induced line broadening, which degrades resolution by obscuring fine structure (e.g., spin-spin couplings) and can cause signals to merge if the broadening becomes comparable to the increased shift separation.",

The value of $\\delta_{\\text{PCS}}$ at a specific nuclear position is given by the McConnell-Robertson equation, which relates the shift to the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, $\\chi$, and the geometric position of the nucleus relative to the principal axes of this tensor. For a nucleus located at a position described by the spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ in the principal axis system of the $\\chi$ tensor, the PCS is generally expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{PCS}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi r^3} \\left[ \\left( \\chi_{zz} - \\frac{\\chi_{xx} + \\chi_{yy}}{2} \\right) (3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) + \\frac{3}{2} (\\chi_{xx} - \\chi_{yy}) \\sin^2\\theta \\cos(2\\phi) \\right]\n$$\n\nThis can be written more compactly by defining the axial ($\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{ax}}$) and rhombic ($\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{rh}}$) anisotropies of the susceptibility tensor:\n$$\n\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{ax}} = \\chi_{zz} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_{xx} + \\chi_{yy})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{rh}} = \\chi_{xx} - \\chi_{yy}\n$$\nThe equation for the PCS then becomes:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{PCS}} = K_{geom} \\cdot f(\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{ax}}, \\Delta\\chi_{\\text{rh}})\n$$\nwhere $K_{geom}$ represents the geometric terms involving $r$, $\\theta$, and $\\phi$, and $f$ is a linear function of the susceptibility anisotropies. The problem states that the nucleus of interest is at a fixed position, so all geometric factors, and thus $K_{geom}$, are constant with respect to temperature.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the temperature dependence of the susceptibility anisotropies. The problem specifies that the lanthanide shift reagent exhibits \"purely Curie behavior.\" Curie's law for paramagnetism states that the magnetic susceptibility, $\\chi$, is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, $T$.\n$$\n\\chi \\propto \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThis idealized behavior implies that each principal component of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, $\\chi_{ii}$ (for $i = x, y, z$), follows this inverse relationship with temperature, as long as the electronic ground state is the only significantly populated state and its properties do not change with temperature.\n$$\n\\chi_{xx}(T) = \\frac{C_{xx}}{T}, \\quad \\chi_{yy}(T) = \\frac{C_{yy}}{T}, \\quad \\chi_{zz}(T) = \\frac{C_{zz}}{T}\n$$\nwhere $C_{xx}$, $C_{yy}$, and $C_{zz}$ are the Curie constants along the principal axes, which are independent of temperature.\n\nSubstituting these dependencies into the expressions for the axial and rhombic anisotropies:\n$$\n\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{ax}}(T) = \\frac{C_{zz}}{T} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{C_{xx}}{T} + \\frac{C_{yy}}{T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( C_{zz} - \\frac{C_{xx} + C_{yy}}{2} \\right) \\propto \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{rh}}(T) = \\frac{C_{xx}}{T} - \\frac{C_{yy}}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} (C_{xx} - C_{yy}) \\propto \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nSince $\\delta_{\\text{PCS}}$ is a linear combination of $\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{ax}}$ and $\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{rh}}$, and both of these terms are proportional to $1/T$, the pseudocontact shift itself must be inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{PCS}} \\propto \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThis relationship can be expressed as $\\delta_{\\text{PCS}}(T) = \\frac{A}{T}$, where $A$ is a constant that incorporates all geometric factors and the temperature-independent parts of the susceptibility.

The magnitude of a PCS induced by a typical lanthanide shift reagent on a proton can range from a fraction of a part-per-million (ppm) to over $10\\,\\text{ppm}$.

The change in the chemical shift would be $\\Delta\\delta = 0.286\\,\\text{ppm}$. Modern high-field NMR spectrometers exhibit digital resolution on the order of $10^{-3}\\,\\text{ppm}$ or better. Therefore, a change of $0.286\\,\\text{ppm}$ is very large and easily and accurately measurable.

This provides the physical justification for the model $\\Delta\\delta_i \\approx S r_i^{-3}$.\n\nWe are tasked with performing a least-squares fit of the model $\\Delta\\delta_i = S x_i$, where the response variable is $y_i = \\Delta\\delta_i$ and the predictor variable is $x_i = r_i^{-3}$. This is a linear regression constrained to pass through the origin. The sum of squared residuals to be minimized is $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - S x_i)^2$. Setting the derivative with respect to $S$ to zero, $\\frac{dE}{dS}=0$, gives the solution for the best-fit slope $S$:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} $$\n\nThe given data are:\nDistances $r_i$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$: $r_1=3.0$, $r_2=4.0$, $r_3=5.0$, $r_4=6.0$, $r_5=8.0$, $r_6=10.0$.\nShifts $\\Delta\\delta_i$ in ppm: $y_1=3.383333333$, $y_2=1.38625$, $y_3=0.73$, $y_4=0.401666667$, $y_5=0.18378125$, $y_6=0.085$.\nThe number of data points is $n=6$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the values of the predictor variable $x_i = r_i^{-3}$:\n$x_1 = (3.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{27} \\approx 0.037037037$\n$x_2 = (4.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{64} = 0.015625$\n$x_3 = (5.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{125} = 0.008$\n$x_4 = (6.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{216} \\approx 0.004629630$\n$x_5 = (8.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{512} = 0.001953125$\n$x_6 = (10.0)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$\n\nNext, we compute the required sums, $\\sum x_i y_i$ and $\\sum x_i^2$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i y_i = (0.037037037)(3.383333333) + (0.015625)(1.38625) + (0.008)(0.73) + (0.004629630)(0.401666667) + (0.001953125)(0.18378125) + (0.001)(0.085)$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i y_i \\approx 0.125308642 + 0.021660156 + 0.00584 + 0.001859568 + 0.000358948 + 0.000085 = 0.155112314$\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i^2 = (0.037037037)^2 + (0.015625)^2 + (0.008)^2 + (0.004629630)^2 + (0.001953125)^2 + (0.001)^2$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i^2 \\approx 0.001371742 + 0.000244141 + 0.000064 + 0.000021433 + 0.000003815 + 0.000001 = 0.001706131$\n\nUsing these sums, we calculate the proportionality constant $S$:\n$$ S = \\frac{0.155112314}{0.001706131} \\approx 90.914610 $$\n\nNow we compute the residuals, $e_i = y_i - S x_i$:\n$e_1 = 3.383333333 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{27}) \\approx 3.383333333 - 3.367207778 = 0.016125555$\n$e_2 = 1.38625 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{64}) \\approx 1.38625 - 1.420540781 = -0.034290781$\n$e_3 = 0.73 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{125}) \\approx 0.73 - 0.727316880 = 0.002683120$\n$e_4 = 0.401666667 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{216}) \\approx 0.401666667 - 0.420900972 = -0.019234305$\n$e_5 = 0.18378125 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{512}) \\approx 0.18378125 - 0.177567598 = 0.006213652$\n$e_6 = 0.085 - (90.914610)(\\frac{1}{1000}) \\approx 0.085 - 0.090914610 = -0.005914610$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the squared residuals, $\\sum e_i^2$:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} e_i^2 \\approx (0.016125555)^2 + (-0.034290781)^2 + (0.002683120)^2 + (-0.019234305)^2 + (0.006213652)^2 + (-0.005914610)^2$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} e_i^2 \\approx 0.000260034 + 0.001175859 + 0.00000720 + 0.000369959 + 0.000038610 + 0.000034983 = 0.001886645$\n\nFinally, we compute the root-mean-square (RMS) residual:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}(0.001886645)} \\approx \\sqrt{0.000314441} \\approx 0.017732486\\,\\mathrm{ppm} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $0.017732486...$.
