A solution will be provided.\n\nThe interaction of a nuclear spin with a static magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian. For a magnetic field oriented along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{k}$, the Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\gamma \\hbar \\hat{I}_z B_0\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\hat{I}_z$ is the spin angular momentum operator along the $z$-axis.\n\nFor a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ nucleus, such as a proton, the spin angular momentum is quantized. The magnetic spin quantum number, $m_I$, can take two values: $m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-up, denoted by $\\alpha$) and $m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-down, denoted by $\\beta$). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_{m_I} = -\\gamma \\hbar m_I B_0\n$$\nSince the proton has a positive gyromagnetic ratio ($\\gamma > 0$), the energy level for the spin-up state ($m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$) is lower than the energy level for the spin-down state ($m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe lower energy level, $E_{\\alpha}$, corresponds to $m_I=+\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nThe upper energy level, $E_{\\beta}$, corresponds to $m_I=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nE_{\\beta} = +\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nThe energy difference between these two levels is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\\right) = \\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nAt thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$, the populations of the two energy levels, $N_{\\alpha}$ and $N_{\\beta}$, are governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.Substituting the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the spin polarization $P$ as:\n$$\nP = \\frac{N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}}\n$$\nTo express $P$ in terms of the energy difference, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $N_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1 - (N_{\\beta}/N_{\\alpha})}{1 + (N_{\\beta}/N_{\\alpha})}\n$$\nSubstituting the Boltzmann ratio into this expression gives:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression can be identified with the hyperbolic tangent function, $\\tanh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x)}$.

Since $x$ is on the order of $10^{-5}$, the cubic term is on the order of $10^{-14}$, which is negligible. Thus, $P \\approx x$.\n$$\nP \\approx 3.2013203 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nP \\approx 3.201 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the decimal $0.00003201$.\n\nThe implication of this result for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in solid-state NMR is profound. The NMR signal is generated by the net magnetization of the sample, which is directly proportional to the population difference between the spin states, $N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta}$. This difference is related to the polarization by $N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta} = P \\cdot (N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}) = P \\cdot N_{total}$. The calculated polarization $P$ is extremely small (approximately $32$ parts per million). This means that at room temperature, even in a strong magnetic field, the population excess in the lower energy state is minuscule. Since the SNR is proportional to this small population difference, the intrinsic sensitivity of NMR is very low. This low sensitivity is a fundamental challenge in NMR spectroscopy and is the primary reason why signal averaging over many scans is often necessary to achieve an adequate SNR.",

Under magic-angle spinning (MAS), CSA produces spinning sidebands at integer multiples of the rotor frequency. You aim to suppress observable sidebands below the noise floor while maintaining a target spectral resolution of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for the isotropic peak.\n\nStarting from the fundamental description that MAS induces a periodic modulation of the resonance frequency at the rotor frequency, and treating the time-dependent frequency as a frequency-modulated signal whose Fourier series has amplitudes governed by Bessel functions of the first kind, derive the minimum spinning speed required such that the first-order spinning sideband amplitude is below the noise floor.

The Larmor frequency, $\\nu_L$, of the ¹³C nucleus in the given static magnetic field, $B_0$, is calculated using the provided gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\nu_L = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\right) B_0\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\nu_L = (10.705 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\times (18.8\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 201.254 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 201.254\\,\\mathrm{MHz}\n$$\n\nThe chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) is given as a span, $\\Omega_{\\text{ppm}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. To work in frequency units, we convert this span to Hertz:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Omega_{\\text{Hz}} = \\Omega_{\\text{ppm}} \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\nu_L = 80 \\times 10^{-6} \\times (201.254 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 16100.32\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe problem states that the effective single-orientation modulation amplitude under MAS, $\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}$, is half the CSA span in frequency units:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\Omega_{\\text{Hz}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16100.32\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 8050.16\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\nUnder MAS, the time-dependent resonance frequency is modulated periodically at the rotor frequency $\\nu_R$. This is a classic frequency modulation (FM) scenario. The signal $S(t)$ can be expressed as a sum over sidebands, where the amplitude of the $n$-th sideband (at frequency $\\nu_{iso} + n\\nu_R$) is given by the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_n(\\beta)$. The argument $\\beta$ is the modulation index, defined as the ratio of the frequency modulation amplitude to the modulation frequency:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}}{\\nu_R}\n$$\nThe isotropic peak corresponds to $n=0$ and has an amplitude proportional to $|J_0(\\beta)|$. The first-order spinning sidebands correspond to $n=\\pm 1$ and have amplitudes proportional to $|J_1(\\beta)|$.\n\nWe now evaluate the two constraints independently.\n\nConstraint 1: Sideband Amplitude Threshold\nThe relative amplitude of the first-order sideband with respect to the isotropic peak must be below the noise floor threshold of $0.10$.\n$$\n\\frac{|J_1(\\beta)|}{|J_0(\\beta)|} \\leq 0.10\n$$\nThe problem suggests using the small-modulation approximation. This is justified when the spinning speed $\\nu_R$ is much larger than the modulation amplitude $\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}$, which makes the modulation index $\\beta$ small. For small $\\beta$:\n$$\nJ_0(\\beta) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\beta^2}{4} \\approx 1\n$$\n$$\nJ_1(\\beta) \\approx \\frac{\\beta}{2}\n$$\nThe approximation is valid as long as the resulting $\\beta$ is small (e.g., $\\beta \\ll 1$). The condition on the relative amplitude simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\beta/2|}{1} \\approx \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\leq 0.10\n$$\nThis implies that the modulation index must satisfy $\\beta \\leq 0.20$. Substituting the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}}{\\nu_R} \\leq 0.20\n$$\nThis inequality sets a lower bound on the rotor frequency, which we denote $\\nu_{R,1}$:\n$$\n\\nu_R \\geq \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}}{0.20} \\equiv \\nu_{R,1}\n$$\nSubstituting the value for $\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{mod}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{R,1} = \\frac{8050.16\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{0.20} = 40250.8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe modulation index at this frequency is $\\beta = 0.20$, which is sufficiently small to justify the use of the approximation.\n\nConstraint 2: Spectral Resolution\nThe second constraint is that the nearest sideband must be separated from the isotropic line by at least one resolution unit. The spinning sidebands appear at frequencies $\\nu_{iso} \\pm n\\nu_R$ for integer $n$. The nearest sidebands are for $n=\\pm 1$, and their frequency separation from the isotropic peak is simply the rotor frequency, $\\nu_R$.\nThe target spectral resolution is given as $\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{res, ppm}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.

Therefore, the minimum required frequency is the maximum of these two values:\n$$\n\\nu_{R, \\text{min}} = \\max(\\nu_{R,1}, \\nu_{R,2}) = \\max(40250.8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}, 100.627\\,\\mathrm{Hz})\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{R, \\text{min}} = 40250.8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe amplitude constraint is clearly the limiting factor. The problem asks for the result in units of $\\mathrm{kHz}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\nu_{R, \\text{min}} = 40.2508\\,\\mathrm{kHz} \\approx 40.3\\,\\mathrm{kHz}\n$$",

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the spin Hamiltonian for a heteronuclear two-spin system ($I = {}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, $S = {}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) in a strong external magnetic field $B_0$. We are concerned with the interaction terms that affect the lineshape of the $I$ spin. The relevant terms in the Hamiltonian are the scalar coupling, $\\mathcal{H}_J$, and the dipolar coupling, $\\mathcal{H}_D$.\n\n1.  **Scalar Coupling ($\\mathcal{H}_J$)**: The scalar or $J$-coupling interaction is described by the Hamiltonian term:\n    $$ \\mathcal{H}_J = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} \\mathbf{I} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} $$\n    In the high-field approximation, only the secular part is considered:\n    $$ \\mathcal{H}_J^{(sec)} = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z $$\n    This interaction is isotropic, meaning it is independent of the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external magnetic field $B_0$. The value of $J_{\\mathrm{IS}}$ is given as $140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. In the absence of other effects, this term splits the ¹³C resonance into a doublet with a separation of $J_{\\mathrm{IS}}$, corresponding to the two spin states ($m_S = +1/2$ and $m_S = -1/2$) of the coupled proton.\n\n2.  **Dipolar Coupling ($\\mathcal{H}_D$)**: The direct dipole-dipole interaction is anisotropic; its magnitude depends on the orientation of the internuclear vector $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{IS}}$ with respect to $B_0$. The secular Hamiltonian is:\n    $$ \\mathcal{H}_D^{(sec)} = -\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\gamma_I \\gamma_S \\hbar}{r_{\\mathrm{IS}}^3} (3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) I_z S_z $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{IS}}$ and $B_0$. For a powdered sample, $\\theta$ takes on all possible values, leading to a very broad powder pattern, typically many kilohertz wide, which would completely obscure the small $J$-coupling.\n\nNow, we consider the effects of the experimental conditions.\n\nA. **Effect of Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS)**: MAS involves rapidly spinning the sample at the magic angle, $\\theta_m = \\arccos(1/\\sqrt{3}) \\approx 54.7^\\circ$. This technique averages the spatial part of anisotropic interactions.\n-   The term $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$ in the dipolar Hamiltonian is averaged to zero by MAS. Thus, MAS effectively removes a large part of the heteronuclear dipolar broadening.\n-   The scalar coupling Hamiltonian, $\\mathcal{H}_J^{(sec)} = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z$, has no spatial dependence. It is isotropic. **Therefore, MAS has no effect on the scalar $J$-coupling.** If MAS were the only technique applied (and $\\nu_r$ was fast enough to average the dipolar coupling), a doublet with splitting $J$ would be observed.\n\nB. **Effect of High-Power ¹H Decoupling**: The problem states that high-power, continuous ¹H decoupling is applied during ¹³C acquisition. This involves applying a strong radio-frequency (RF) field to the ¹H (S) spins.\n-   The strong RF field forces the $S$ spins to precess rapidly about the RF field axis, effectively scrambling their spin states ($+1/2$ and $-1/2$) on a timescale much shorter than the inverse of the coupling strengths.\n-   From the perspective of the $I$ spin (¹³C), the $z$-component of the $S$ spin averages to zero: $\\langle S_z \\rangle \\to 0$.\n-   Let's examine the effect of this averaging on the coupling Hamiltonians:\n    -   Dipolar Coupling: $\\mathcal{H}_D^{(sec)} \\propto I_z S_z$. Since $\\langle S_z \\rangle \\to 0$, this entire interaction is averaged to zero. This is the primary purpose of decoupling: to remove the large dipolar splittings.\n    -   Scalar Coupling: $\\mathcal{H}_J^{(sec)} = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z$. Since this interaction is also proportional to $S_z$, it is **also averaged to zero** by the decoupling field.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe simultaneous application of MAS and high-power ¹H decoupling has the following consequences:\n-   MAS averages the anisotropic part of the dipolar coupling.\n-   High-power decoupling averages to zero all interactions proportional to $S_z$, which includes **both** the residual dipolar coupling and the isotropic scalar $J$-coupling.\nAs a result, the ¹³C nucleus is effectively \"decoupled\" from the proton, and its signal collapses from a potential multiplet to a singlet. No $J$-splitting will be resolved.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A resolved doublet with splitting approximately equal to $J$ will be observed, because scalar $J$ is isotropic and MAS does not average it; ¹H decoupling removes only dipolar couplings.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that $J$-coupling is isotropic and not averaged by MAS. However, its central claim that \"¹H decoupling removes only dipolar couplings\" is false. Standard high-power decoupling schemes average the $S_z$ operator, which removes any interaction of the form $C \\cdot I_z S_z$, irrespective of whether the coefficient $C$ is isotropic (like $2\\pi J$) or anisotropic (like the dipolar term). Therefore, the $J$-coupling is also removed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. No resolved $J$-splitting will be observed; the ¹³C lines appear as singlets because continuous ¹H decoupling averages the heteronuclear $J$ interaction to near zero on the ¹³C channel, leaving at most minor residual broadening $\\ll J$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the outcome. It correctly identifies that continuous ¹H decoupling is the mechanism responsible for averaging the $J$-coupling to zero. As a consequence, the multiplet structure collapses, and the ¹³C signal is observed as a singlet. The mention of potential minor residual broadening is a physically correct acknowledgement of the non-ideality of real-world experiments.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. A partially resolved multiplet will appear with an apparent splitting scaled by $\\nu_r/J$, because MAS rotor modulation scales isotropic interactions; the effective spacing is about $0.071\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect on multiple points. First, MAS averages *anisotropic* interactions, not *isotropic* ones like $J$-coupling. Second, the scaling factor it proposes, $\\nu_r/J$, is baseless in this context. Third, the numerical value $0.071\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ does not seem to derive from the given parameters in any logical way ($10000/140 \\approx 71.4$; $140/10000 = 0.014$).

The $J$-splitting will be redistributed into spinning sidebands separated by $\\nu_r$, so it is not seen at the centerband but appears as multiplet structure on the sidebands.**\nThis statement describes the behavior of *anisotropic* interactions under MAS when the spinning speed is comparable to or smaller than the interaction strength. Since $J$-coupling is isotropic, it is not modulated by sample rotation and therefore does not produce spinning sidebands. Furthermore, even if one considered the very small anisotropic component of the $J$-tensor, the overwhelming effect of high-power decoupling would average the entire interaction to zero anyway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
