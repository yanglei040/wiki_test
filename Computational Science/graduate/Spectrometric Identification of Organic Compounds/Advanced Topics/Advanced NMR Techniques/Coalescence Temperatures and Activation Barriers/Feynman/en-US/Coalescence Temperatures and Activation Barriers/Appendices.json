The provided data and equipment specifications are sufficient for the task.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The chemical system, the spectroscopic parameters, and the available equipment are all standard and realistic. The temperature range is well within the capabilities of standard VT-NMR equipment.\n6.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, tautological, or ill-posed. It requires a substantive application of DNMR principles to evaluate complex experimental choices.\n\n### Verdict on Problem Validity\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It presents a realistic and well-defined scenario in experimental chemical physics.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the theoretical basis for a DNMR experiment and then evaluating each proposed plan against these principles.\n\n**1. Fundamental Relationships**\n\nThe coalescence temperature, $T_c$, is the temperature at which two exchanging signals merge into a single broad peak. For two uncoupled sites of equal population (as is the case for the two N-methyl groups), the rate constant at coalescence, $k_c$, is related to the frequency separation of the signals in the slow-exchange limit, $\\Delta \\nu$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$), by the equation:\n$$ k_c = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta \\nu}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu$ is directly proportional to the spectrometer's operating frequency, $\\nu_0$ (in $\\mathrm{MHz}$), and the chemical shift separation, $\\Delta \\delta$ (in $\\mathrm{ppm}$):\n$$ \\Delta \\nu (\\mathrm{Hz}) = \\Delta \\delta (\\mathrm{ppm}) \\times \\nu_0 (\\mathrm{MHz}) $$\nThis shows that $\\Delta \\nu$, and consequently $k_c$ and $T_c$, are dependent on the magnetic field strength of the spectrometer.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the rate constant $k$ is described by the Eyring equation:\n$$ k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} / RT} $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. We can use the given estimate of $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} \\approx 62\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to predict $T_c$ for each available spectrometer.\n\n**2. Estimation of Coalescence Temperature ($T_c$)**\n\nLet's estimate $T_c$ for the highest field spectrometer to see where it falls within the accessible temperature range.\n- Spectrometer: $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$\n- $\\Delta \\delta = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $\\Delta \\nu = (0.20 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (800 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 160\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $k_c = \\frac{\\pi (160\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 355.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nSetting $k = k_c$ in the Eyring equation (assuming transmission coefficient $\\kappa=1$):\n$$ 355.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) T_c}{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}} e^{-62000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} / (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}\\,mol^{-1}} T_c)} $$\nSolving this transcendental equation for $T_c$ numerically yields $T_c \\approx 315\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The uncertainty in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ($\\pm 3\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) translates to a range for the predicted $T_c$ of approximately $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $330\\,\\mathrm{K}$. All potential $T_c$ values are well within the instrument's VT range of $[270, 360]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**3. Principles of a Good Experimental Plan**\nA robust plan to determine $T_c$ and acquire data for further analysis should include:\n- **Optimal Instrument Choice**: A higher field (e.g., $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) is generally preferable as it maximizes $\\Delta \\nu$. This leads to a higher, more accurately measurable $T_c$ and provides greater spectral dispersion, which improves the precision of subsequent line-shape analysis.\n- **Accurate Temperature Control and Measurement**: The probe temperature must be accurately calibrated using a standard (e.g., methanol or ethylene glycol). The manufacturer-specified stability ($\\pm 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$) ensures temperature constancy during an experiment but does not guarantee absolute accuracy. Inaccurate temperature values are a major source of error in determining activation parameters.\n- **Stable Magnetic Field**: A deuterated solvent (e.g., the specified $\\mathrm{CD_{2}Cl_{2}}$) must be used to provide a deuterium signal for the field-frequency lock system, ensuring field stability over the course of the multi-temperature experiment.\n- **Thermal Equilibration**: Sufficient time must be allowed for the sample to reach thermal equilibrium at each new temperature setpoint before data acquisition.\n- **Efficient Sampling Strategy**: An adaptive temperature grid is most efficient. One starts with coarse steps far from $T_c$ to establish the baseline and then switches to fine steps (e.g., $1-2\\,\\mathrm{K}$) in the region of coalescence to pinpoint $T_c$ accurately.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Estimate $T_c \\approx 315\\,\\mathrm{K}$ by directly comparing $\\Delta \\delta$ in $\\mathrm{ppm}$ to the exchange rate. Collect spectra only from $300$ to $330\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments. Temperature calibration is unnecessary if the VT unit is specified to $\\pm 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n- The reasoning \"comparing $\\Delta \\delta$ in $\\mathrm{ppm}$ to the exchange rate\" is physically nonsensical. One is a dimensionless ratio, the other has units of inverse time ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n- The temperature increment of $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is too large to locate $T_c$ with the required $\\pm 2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ precision.\n- The claim that temperature calibration is unnecessary is a serious experimental error. Stability does not equal accuracy. This would compromise any subsequent Eyring analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR at $150\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ (on the $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ magnet) to exploit larger chemical-shift dispersion in $\\mathrm{ppm}$. Collect spectra from $250$ to $360\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments with $32$ scans per temperature, without deuterated solvent or temperature calibration, assuming that coalescence broadening will be obvious.**\n- Using $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR is a poor choice. Despite a potentially larger $\\Delta\\delta$, the low natural abundance ($~1.1\\%$) and smaller magnetogyric ratio of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ lead to vastly lower sensitivity compared to $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$. A VT experiment would be prohibitively time-consuming.\n- The instruction to proceed \"without deuterated solvent\" is a fatal flaw. A stable field-frequency lock is essential for any modern NMR experiment, especially one involving signal averaging and precise frequency measurements over time.\n- The proposed lower temperature of $250\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is outside the specified operating range of the VT unit ($[270, 360]\\,\\mathrm{K}$).\n- A $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ temperature increment is far too coarse.\n- Forgoing temperature calibration is poor practice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ to maximize absolute frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. Predict $T_c$ by converting the slow-exchange $\\Delta \\delta$ to $\\Delta \\nu$ and combining the exchange-rate criterion with the temperature dependence of $k$ from kinetic theory. Bracket with $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps from $285$ to $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, then $2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps from $300$ to $312\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and finally $1\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps over $304$–$308\\,\\mathrm{K}$ once broadening starts. Use a deuterated solvent for a stable lock, calibrate the VT probe (e.g., methanol or ethylene glycol standard), allow equilibration at each $T$ until the reported and actual temperatures agree, and record $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ for subsequent analysis.**\n- This plan correctly identifies the advantage of using the highest-field spectrometer ($800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) to maximize $\\Delta \\nu$.\n- It employs a sound theoretical approach to estimate $T_c$ as a guide.\n- The proposed adaptive temperature sampling strategy (coarse steps far from $T_c$, fine steps near $T_c$) is efficient and will allow determination of $T_c$ to the required precision. The specified temperature windows are a reasonable starting point based on the estimated $T_c$.\n- It explicitly includes all elements of good experimental practice: using a deuterated solvent for a lock, performing temperature calibration, allowing for thermal equilibration, and recording the key data ($\\Delta \\nu$).\nThis plan is scientifically rigorous, thorough, and well-designed to meet the objectives.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Assume the spectrometer field does not influence $T_c$. Collect spectra from $270$ to $360\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments without refining near the onset of broadening, because coalescence can be identified visually from the merged peak shape.**\n- The assumption that the spectrometer field does not influence $T_c$ is fundamentally false. As derived earlier, $T_c$ is a function of $\\Delta \\nu$, which is directly proportional to the field strength.\n- The $400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ instrument provides the smallest $\\Delta \\nu$, making line-shape analysis less precise.\n- A $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ sampling interval is too coarse for the stated goal. A purely visual identification of coalescence is not sufficiently quantitative for a precision of $\\pm 2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ or for rigorous kinetic analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

For a base-catalyzed process, this observed rate constant depends on the base concentration $[B]$ according to the relation $k_{\\text{obs}} = k_m [B]^m$, where $k_m$ is the true rate constant of order $(m+1)$ and $m$ is the reaction order with respect to the base.\n\nAt coalescence, the observed rate constant reaches a specific value $k_c$, which is determined by the frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu_0$. For a two-site, equally populated exchange,\n$$k_c = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nSince $\\Delta \\nu_0$ for Compound X is fixed at $120\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $k_c$ is a constant for all three experiments.\n\nAccording to Transition State Theory, the temperature dependence of the rate constant $k_m$ is given by the Eyring-Polanyi equation (assuming a transmission coefficient $\\kappa=1$):\n$$k_m(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nSubstituting $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger - T \\Delta S^\\ddagger$:\n$$k_m(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger - T\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nAt the coalescence temperature $T_c$, we have $k_c = k_m(T_c) [B]^m$.\n$$k_c = \\left[ \\frac{k_B T_c}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_c}\\right) \\right] [B]^m$$\nSince $k_c$ is constant, we can take the natural logarithm and compare two different conditions (denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$):\n$$\\ln(k_c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\ln(T_{c1}) + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_{c1}} + m\\ln([B_1])$$\n$$\\ln(k_c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\ln(T_{c2}) + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_{c2}} + m\\ln([B_2])$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$0 = \\ln(T_{c1}) - \\ln(T_{c2}) - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{c2}}\\right) + m\\left(\\ln([B_1]) - \\ln([B_2])\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for $m$:\n$$m \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{[B_2]}{[B_1]}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{c1}}{T_{c2}}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{c2}}\\right)$$\nWe are given $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 30\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 30000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R} = \\frac{30000}{8.314} \\approx 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nLet's use the first two data points:\n- Point 1: $T_{c1} = 259\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_1] = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- Point 2: $T_{c2} = 238\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_2] = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$$m \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.100}{0.050}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{259}{238}\\right) - 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(\\frac{1}{259\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{238\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$$\n$$m \\ln(2) = \\ln(1.0882) - 3608.4 \\times (0.003861 - 0.004202)\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.0845 - 3608.4 \\times (-0.000341)$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.0845 + 1.2307 = 1.3152$$\n$$m = \\frac{1.3152}{0.693} \\approx 1.898$$\n\nLet's use the second and third data points for confirmation:\n- Point 2: $T_{c2} = 238\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_2] = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- Point 3: $T_{c3} = 215\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_3] = 0.200\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$$m \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.200}{0.100}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{238}{215}\\right) - 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(\\frac{1}{238\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{215\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$$\n$$m \\ln(2) = \\ln(1.1070) - 3608.4 \\times (0.004202 - 0.004651)\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.1017 - 3608.4 \\times (-0.000449)$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.1017 + 1.6202 = 1.7219$$\n$$m = \\frac{1.7219}{0.693} \\approx 2.485$$\n\nThe calculated values for $m$ are $\\approx 1.90$ and $\\approx 2.49$. The average is $\\approx 2.2$. Given potential experimental uncertainties in the data, it is reasonable to infer that the reaction order $m$ with respect to the base is $2$. This is consistent with a mechanism where two molecules of base are involved in the rate-determining step of proton transfer. The observation that $T_c$ decreases as $[B]$ increases is also consistent with a base-catalyzed reaction as explained before.\n\n### Analysis of Compound Y: Molecularity and Rate Law\nCompound Y undergoes an intramolecular conformational exchange. By definition, an intramolecular process involves only a single molecule. The rate of such a process is not dependent on the concentration of other species in the solution, such as the added base $[B]$. The rate law is first-order: $\\text{rate} = k[\\text{Y}]$.\nThe rate constant $k$ is a function of temperature only:\n$$k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nAt coalescence, $k(T_c) = k_c$, where $k_c$ is a constant determined by $\\Delta \\nu_0 = 80\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $k$ does not depend on $[B]$, the temperature $T_c$ required to achieve the rate $k_c$ is also independent of $[B]$. This perfectly rationalizes the experimental observation that $T_c$ remains constant at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ even when the base concentration is varied.\n\n### Calculation of $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for Compound Y\nThe free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, is related to the activation enthalpy, $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$, and activation entropy, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger - T \\Delta S^\\ddagger$$\nFor Compound Y at its coalescence temperature $T_c = 302\\,\\mathrm{K}$, we use the provided thermodynamic data:\n- $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 65\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\Delta S^\\ddagger = -20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = T_c = 302\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - (302\\,\\mathrm{K} \\times -20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})$$\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - (-6040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} + 6040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 71040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nConverting back to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 71.04\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThus, the free energy of activation for Compound Y at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. Compound X exhibits an intermolecular proton exchange with overall second-order dependence on base concentration ($m \\approx 2$), consistent with the decrease of $T_c$ upon increasing $[B]$; Compound Y exhibits intramolecular first-order conformational exchange with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$, and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - This option correctly states that Compound X has an approximate second-order dependence on base ($m \\approx 2$), which is consistent with our calculations. It correctly rationalizes the $T_c$ trend. It correctly identifies Compound Y as an intramolecular first-order process with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$. It correctly calculates $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for Compound Y as $\\approx 71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Every part of this statement is consistent with our analysis.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Compound X is first-order intramolecular (no base dependence), while Compound Y is second-order in base; for Compound Y, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $59\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of both Compound X and Compound Y is incorrect, directly contradicting the experimental data ($T_c$ changes for X and is constant for Y). The calculated value for $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is also incorrect. A value of $59\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ would arise from incorrectly using a positive $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ in the calculation ($65 - 302 \\times (20/1000) = 58.96$).\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Both Compound X and Compound Y are first-order intramolecular processes with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$; for Compound Y, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ equals $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 65\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of Compound X is incorrect; its $T_c$ clearly depends on $[B]$. The statement that $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger$ is incorrect because it implies $\\Delta S^\\ddagger = 0$, whereas it is given as $-20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Both Compound X and Compound Y are second-order in base; $T_c$ increases with $[B]$ due to reduced Larmor separation, and for Compound Y $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $77\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of Compound Y is incorrect; its $T_c$ is independent of $[B]$. The statement that $T_c$ *increases* with $[B]$ for Compound X is the opposite of the data given. The reasoning (`reduced Larmor separation`) is also false; the problem states $\\Delta\\nu_0$ (the frequency separation, related to Larmor frequencies) is fixed. The value for $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

All terminology is standard and the physical scenario is realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A linewidth of this magnitude is much larger than the separation of $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, making a merger into a single peak physically expected. The problem is internally consistent. The qualifier \"low-field separation\" for $\\Delta \\nu_0$ is slightly imprecise but is reasonably interpreted as the separation in Hertz at the given field $B_0$, which is standard practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a classic scenario in dynamic NMR. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n## **Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks first whether an increase in the transverse relaxation rate, $R_2$, can by itself cause an apparent coalescence, and second, to identify valid experimental methods for distinguishing such an effect from broadening caused by chemical exchange, quantified by the rate constant $k$.\n\n### **Part 1: Apparent Coalescence due to $R_2$**\n\nThe resolution of two spectral lines depends on the ratio of their separation to their widths. For two uncoupled sites with no exchange ($k=0$), the spectrum is the sum of two independent Lorentzian lines. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) in Hertz for a single Lorentzian line is related to the transverse relaxation rate $R_2$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) by:\n$$ \\mathrm{FWHM} = \\frac{R_2}{\\pi} $$\nTwo peaks are generally considered resolved if their separation, $\\Delta\\nu$, is significantly greater than their FWHM.\n\nAt $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, we are given $R_2 \\approx 8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\Delta \\nu_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe intrinsic FWHM is $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{298} = 8/\\pi \\approx 2.55\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $\\Delta \\nu_0 > \\mathrm{FWHM}_{298}$, the lines are well resolved, as stated.\n\nAt $T = 340\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the intrinsic transverse relaxation rate increases to $R_2 \\approx 60\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, while the separation remains $\\Delta \\nu_0 \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe intrinsic FWHM, in the absence of any exchange, would be $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{340} = 60/\\pi \\approx 19.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nIn this scenario, the width of each individual resonance ($\\approx 19.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) is substantially larger than their separation ($10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$). The sum of two such broad, overlapping Lorentzian functions will appear as a single, broad unresolved peak. This phenomenon is an \"apparent\" coalescence driven purely by the increase in the intrinsic linewidth, not by the kinetic process of exchange.\n\nTherefore, an increase in $R_2$ alone **can** produce an apparent coalescence of two lines, even when the exchange rate $k$ is negligible. This addresses the first part of the question.\n\n### **Part 2: Evaluation of Diagnostic Methods**\n\nWe must now evaluate each proposed method for its ability to distinguish between line broadening caused by an increase in $k$ versus an increase in $R_2$.\n\n**A. Increase the static magnetic field from $B_0$ to approximately $2B_0$...**\nThe chemical shift separation in Hertz, $\\Delta \\nu$, is directly proportional to the static magnetic field strength, $B_0$. Thus, doubling the field to $2B_0$ will double the separation to $2\\Delta \\nu_0$. The chemical exchange rate, $k$, is a kinetic parameter that is independent of $B_0$. The condition for coalescence due to exchange is approximately $k \\approx \\pi \\Delta \\nu / \\sqrt{2}$. If the observed coalescence at field $B_0$ is due to exchange (i.e., $k$ has become large enough to satisfy this condition), then by increasing the field to $2B_0$, the required rate for coalescence also doubles. Since $k$ itself does not change, the system moves away from the coalescence regime and back towards the slow-exchange regime. Consequently, the single merged peak should split back into two distinct (albeit broadened) peaks.\nConversely, if the apparent coalescence is due to a large intrinsic $R_2$, the linewidth (FWHM $\\propto R_2$) is largely independent of $B_0$ (assuming negligible chemical shift anisotropy, as stated). Increasing the separation to $2\\Delta \\nu_0$ may or may not be sufficient to resolve the peaks, depending on the severity of the $R_2$ broadening. However, the failure of the peak to re-resolve upon a significant increase in $\\Delta \\nu$ is a strong indication that broadening is dominated by a mechanism other than exchange, i.e., relaxation. The logic presented in the option is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Measure Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) transverse relaxation dispersion...**\nThe CPMG experiment measures an effective transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,eff}$. This rate is the sum of the intrinsic relaxation rate, $R_2$, and a contribution from chemical exchange, $R_{ex}$.\n$$ R_{2,eff} = R_2 + R_{ex} $$\nThe exchange contribution, $R_{ex}$, arises from dephasing as spins move between sites of different frequencies. The series of $180^\\circ$ pulses in the CPMG sequence refocuses this dephasing. The efficiency of this refocusing depends on the pulsing rate, $\\nu_{CPMG} = 1/(2\\tau_{cp})$, where $\\tau_{cp}$ is the delay between pulses. When the pulsing rate is high (short $\\tau_{cp}$), the exchange process is effectively interrupted, and its contribution $R_{ex}$ is attenuated. In the limit $\\nu_{CPMG} \\to \\infty$, $R_{ex} \\to 0$ and $R_{2,eff} \\to R_2$. Intrinsic relaxation mechanisms (like dipole-dipole) are largely independent of $\\nu_{CPMG}$. Therefore, measuring $R_{2,eff}$ as a function of the echo spacing (a \"relaxation dispersion\" experiment) allows for the separation of these effects. A significant decrease in $R_{2,eff}$ at shorter echo spacings is a definitive sign of an exchange contribution. A flat profile indicates the absence of exchange-driven broadening. This is a powerful and standard method for quantifying exchange.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Turn heteronuclear decoupling on and off...**\nHeteronuclear decoupling is a technique that irradiates a nucleus (e.g., $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$) to remove its scalar ($J$) coupling to the observed nucleus (here, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$). This process does not affect the homonuclear chemical exchange rate, $k$, between two proton sites. If a proton's linewidth is broadened by coupling to a rapidly relaxing quadrupolar nucleus (e.g., $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$), which is known as scalar relaxation of the second kind, then heteronuclear decoupling will indeed sharpen the proton line by removing this contribution to $R_2$. The logic presented in the option is flawed: \"if decoupling reduces coalescence, it proves exchange is present\". This is incorrect. Reducing coalescence via decoupling would indicate that a component of $R_2$ was due to heteronuclear coupling. It says nothing about the presence or absence of exchange, $k$. \"if it does not, the broadening must be due to $R_2$\". This is also a false dichotomy. The broadening could be from exchange ($k$) or from other $R_2$ mechanisms (e.g., dipole-dipole) not affected by heteronuclear decoupling. This method is not a valid diagnostic for this specific problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Perform two-dimensional Exchange Spectroscopy (EXSY)...**\nTwo-dimensional EXSY is an experiment designed specifically to detect and quantify chemical exchange. In an EXSY spectrum, exchange between two sites, A and B, is manifested as off-diagonal peaks, or \"cross-peaks,\" at the frequency coordinates $(\\nu_A, \\nu_B)$ and $(\\nu_B, \\nu_A)$. These cross-peaks are a direct result of magnetization transfer from one site to the other during a defined \"mixing time,\" $\\tau_m$. The existence of such cross-peaks is an unambiguous proof of site interconversion (i.e., $k > 0$). Their intensity can be analyzed to determine the value of $k$. Conversely, if no exchange is occurring ($k=0$), no cross-peaks will appear, regardless of the line broadening from $R_2$. Therefore, EXSY provides a tool to detect exchange that is independent of line-broadening phenomena.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Assume any temperature-induced increase in linewidth reflects increased exchange rate k...**\nThis option proposes an analytical approach, not an experimental diagnostic. The approach is to assume that the observed increase in linewidth is due entirely to the exchange rate $k$. This premise is directly contradicted by the problem statement, which provides independent CPMG measurements showing a substantial increase in the intrinsic relaxation rate $R_2$ from $\\approx 8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $\\approx 60\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon heating. To ignore this known, significant contribution to broadening and attribute all changes to $k$ is fundamentally incorrect. Such an analysis would lead to a grossly inaccurate estimation of the exchange parameters and the activation energy. This method fails to separate the effects of $R_2$ and $k$; rather, it conflates them under a faulty assumption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
