This interaction results in scattered photons whose energies, and thus wavelengths, are shifted by amounts corresponding to the molecule's quantized vibrational energies. This first exercise  provides direct practice in calculating the absolute wavelengths of the lower-energy Stokes and higher-energy anti-Stokes lines, translating the abstract concept of energy exchange into the concrete observables of a Raman spectrum.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the wavelengths of Stokes and anti-Stokes scattered photons in a Raman spectroscopy experiment. The derivation shall proceed from the fundamental principle of energy conservation during the inelastic scattering process.\n\nRaman scattering is an inelastic phenomenon where a photon interacts with a molecule, resulting in a change in the molecule's rovibrational energy state and a corresponding change in the scattered photon's energy. The total energy of the system (photon + molecule) is conserved. Let $E_{inc}$ be the energy of the incident photon, $E_{sc}$ be the energy of the scattered photon, and $E_{i,mol}$ and $E_{f,mol}$ be the initial and final vibrational energies of the molecule, respectively. The conservation of energy is expressed as:\n$$E_{inc} + E_{i,mol} = E_{sc} + E_{f,mol}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the scattered photon's energy in terms of the incident photon's energy and the change in the molecule's energy, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol}$:\n$$E_{sc} = E_{inc} - \\Delta E_{mol}$$\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by the equation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation yields:\n$$hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{sc} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\Delta E_{mol}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{sc} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\frac{\\Delta E_{mol}}{hc}$$\nThe problem models the molecular vibration as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The allowed energy transitions for Raman scattering are typically $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$. The energy difference between adjacent vibrational levels is quantized and given by $\\Delta E_{vib} = h\\nu_{vib} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$, where $\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$ is the wavenumber of the molecular vibration.\n\nThere are two cases for inelastic scattering:\n\n1.  **Stokes Scattering**: The molecule is initially in a lower energy state (typically the ground vibrational state, $v=0$) and is excited to a higher energy state ($v=1$) by the interaction. The molecule absorbs energy from the incident photon.\n    In this case, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol} = +hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$. The scattered photon, denoted with subscript $S$ for Stokes, has lower energy.\n    The wavenumber of the Stokes-scattered photon, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{S}$, is:\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{S} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}}{hc}$$\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{S} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$$\n\n2.  **Anti-Stokes Scattering**: The molecule is initially in an excited vibrational state (e.g., $v=1$) and is de-excited to a lower energy state ($v=0$). The molecule transfers its excess vibrational energy to the scattered photon.\n    In this case, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol} = -hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$. The scattered photon, denoted with subscript $aS$ for anti-Stokes, has higher energy.\n    The wavenumber of the anti-Stokes-scattered photon, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS}$, is:\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\frac{(-hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib})}{hc}$$\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in units of $\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ in units of $\\text{nm}$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{10^7}{\\lambda} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}}$$\nUsing this relationship, we can express the wavelengths of the scattered photons.\nThe Stokes wavelength, $\\lambda_S$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{S} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{S}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}}$$\nThe anti-Stokes wavelength, $\\lambda_{aS}$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{aS} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nThe incident laser has a wavelength $\\lambda_{inc} = 532\\,\\text{nm}$. The corresponding wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc}$ is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} = \\frac{10^7}{532}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx 18796.99248\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nThe vibrational wavenumber of the molecule is given as $\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib} = 1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavenumbers of the scattered photons:\nFor Stokes scattering:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{S} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib} = \\left(\\frac{10^7}{532} - 1600\\right)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx 17196.99248\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nFor anti-Stokes scattering:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib} = \\left(\\frac{10^7}{532} + 1600\\right)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx 20396.99248\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we convert these wavenumbers back to wavelengths in nm:\nThe Stokes wavelength is:\n$$\\lambda_{S} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{S}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\frac{10^7}{532} - 1600}\\,\\text{nm} \\approx 581.496016\\,\\text{nm}$$\nThe anti-Stokes wavelength is:\n$$\\lambda_{aS} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\frac{10^7}{532} + 1600}\\,\\text{nm} \\approx 490.268292\\,\\text{nm}$$\n\nFinally, we round the results to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\\lambda_{S} \\approx 581.5\\,\\text{nm}$$\n$$\\lambda_{aS} \\approx 490.3\\,\\text{nm}$$\nThese are the wavelengths for the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattered photons, respectively.",

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of Raman spectroscopy and group theory to the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Raman Activity and the Mutual Exclusion Rule**\n\nThe molecule is stated to belong to the $C_{2h}$ point group, which includes a center of inversion symmetry element, $i$. Such molecules are termed centrosymmetric. For centrosymmetric molecules, the mutual exclusion rule applies: vibrational modes that are Raman active are infrared (IR) inactive, and vice-versa.\n\nIn group theory, Raman activity is associated with normal modes that transform as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$). These functions are symmetric with respect to inversion and are thus assigned a 'g' (from German *gerade*, meaning even) subscript. IR activity is associated with normal modes that transform as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). These coordinates are antisymmetric with respect to inversion and are assigned a 'u' (from German *ungerade*, meaning odd) subscript.\n\nThe character table for the $C_{2h}$ point group confirms this:\n| $C_{2h}$ | $E$ | $C_2(z)$ | $i$ | $\\sigma_h(xy)$ | Linear, Rotations | Quadratic |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_g$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $R_z$ | $x^2, y^2, z^2, xy$ |\n| $B_g$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $R_x, R_y$ | $xz, yz$ |\n| $A_u$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $z$ | |\n| $B_u$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $x, y$ | |\n\nFrom the 'Quadratic' column, the Raman active irreducible representations are $A_g$ and $B_g$. Vibrations with $A_u$ or $B_u$ symmetry are Raman inactive. Since two Raman bands are observed at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the corresponding vibrations must have either $A_g$ or $B_g$ symmetry.\n\n**2. Depolarization Ratio and Symmetry**\n\nFor an isotropic sample (liquid solution) under nonresonant conditions with linearly polarized incident light, the depolarization ratio, $\\rho = I_{\\perp} / I_{\\parallel}$, provides information about the symmetry of the vibration. The value of $\\rho$ is determined by the invariants of the derived polarizability tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}'$. Specifically, the value depends on whether the trace of this tensor (related to the mean polarizability derivative, $\\bar{\\alpha}'$) is zero or non-zero.\n\n-   **Totally Symmetric Vibrations:** For a vibration to be totally symmetric, its character under all symmetry operations of the group is $+1$. In the $C_{2h}$ point group, this corresponds to the $A_g$ irreducible representation. For such vibrations, the mean polarizability derivative, $\\bar{\\alpha}'$, can be non-zero. This leads to a depolarization ratio in the range $0 \\le \\rho < 3/4$. A Raman band with $\\rho < 0.75$ is called a **polarized** band.\n\n-   **Non-Totally Symmetric Vibrations:** For any non-totally symmetric vibration, group theory dictates that the mean polarizability derivative must be zero ($\\bar{\\alpha}' = 0$). In the $C_{2h}$ group, $B_g$ modes are Raman active but not totally symmetric. For these vibrations, the depolarization ratio has a fixed theoretical value:\n    $$ \\rho = \\frac{3(\\gamma')^2}{45(0)^2 + 4(\\gamma')^2} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\n    where $\\gamma'$ is the anisotropy of the derived polarizability tensor. A Raman band with $\\rho = 0.75$ is called a **depolarized** band.\n\n**3. Assignment of Symmetries based on Experimental Data**\n\nWe can now assign symmetries to the observed bands by comparing their measured depolarization ratios to these theoretical values.\n\n-   **Band at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:** The measured depolarization ratio is $\\rho_{1000} = 0.15$. Since $0.15 < 0.75$, this is a polarized band. This indicates that the vibration is totally symmetric. Therefore, the vibration at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ must have $A_g$ symmetry.\n\n-   **Band at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:** The measured depolarization ratio is $\\rho_{1200} = 0.85$. This value is very close to the theoretical value of $0.75$ for a depolarized band. The problem states that the \"optical setup has not been polarization-calibrated,\" which commonly leads to experimental values slightly deviating from the theoretical limits. A measured value of $0.85$ is thus entirely consistent with a depolarized band, especially when the alternative is a polarized band for which $\\rho$ must be strictly less than $0.75$. Therefore, it is most plausible to assign the vibration at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ as a non-totally symmetric Raman active mode, which corresponds to $B_g$ symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nThe vibration at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is of $A_g$ symmetry.\nThe vibration at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is of $B_g$ symmetry.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $A_g$ and $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $B_g$.**\nThis assignment is consistent with our derivation. A polarized band ($\\rho_{1000} = 0.15$) is assigned to the totally symmetric $A_g$ mode, and a depolarized band ($\\rho_{1200} \\approx 0.75$) is assigned to the non-totally symmetric $B_g$ mode.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $B_g$ and $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $A_g$.**\nThis assignment is inconsistent. It assigns the polarized band at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ ($\\rho=0.15$) to the $B_g$ symmetry (which requires $\\rho=0.75$). It also assigns the depolarized band at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ ($\\rho=0.85$) to the $A_g$ symmetry (which requires $\\rho < 0.75$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both bands are $A_u$.**\nBased on the mutual exclusion rule and the character table for $C_{2h}$, modes of $A_u$ symmetry are Raman inactive. Since Raman bands were observed, this assignment is impossible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $B_u$ and $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $A_u$.**\nSimilar to option C, modes of $A_u$ and $B_u$ symmetry are Raman inactive in the $C_{2h}$ point group. This assignment is physically impossible for observed Raman bands.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both bands are $B_g$.**\nThis assignment implies both bands should be depolarized, with $\\rho = 0.75$. While this is consistent for the $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band ($\\rho=0.85$), it is severely inconsistent for the $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band, which is strongly polarized ($\\rho=0.15$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in comparing the positions of the Raman-scattered signals to the rejection band of the notch filter.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Definitions of Raman Scattering**:\n    Let the incident laser light have a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$. Let the sample have a vibrational mode with a characteristic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. In Raman spectroscopy, the quantity of interest is the Raman shift, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$, defined as the difference between the incident and scattered wavenumbers: $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{scattered}}$. By convention, the wavenumber of the vibrational mode itself is used to label the Raman shift.\n\n2.  **Rayleigh Scattering**:\n    This is an elastic process where the scattered light has the same energy and wavenumber as the incident light, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{scattered}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0$. The Raman shift is therefore $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = 0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The notch filter is centered at this position to reject the intense, unshifted laser light.\n\n3.  **Stokes Scattering**:\n    This is an inelastic process where the incident photon transfers energy to the sample, creating a quantum of vibrational energy. The sample transitions from a lower energy state (e.g., vibrational ground state $v=0$) to a higher energy state (e.g., first excited state $v=1$). The scattered photon emerges with lower energy and a lower wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. This corresponds to a positive Raman shift:\n    $$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}) = +\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} $$\n    The Stokes signal appears on the low-energy (low-wavenumber, long-wavelength) side of the Rayleigh line.\n\n4.  **Anti-Stokes Scattering**:\n    This is an inelastic process where the sample, already in a vibrationally excited state (e.g., $v=1$), transfers its energy to the incident photon upon scattering. The sample transitions to a lower energy state (e.g., $v=0$). The scattered photon emerges with higher energy and a higher wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. This corresponds to a negative Raman shift:\n    $$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}) = -\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} $$\n    The anti-Stokes signal appears on the high-energy (high-wavenumber, short-wavelength) side of the Rayleigh line. The existence of an anti-Stokes signal depends on a non-zero thermal population of the excited vibrational state, which is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. At $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, low-wavenumber modes like the one specified have a significant population in the excited state, making the anti-Stokes signal observable in principle.\n\n5.  **Application to the Specific Problem**:\n    - The Raman-active lattice mode is given at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - The Stokes line will therefore appear at a Raman shift of $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = +120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - The anti-Stokes line will appear at a Raman shift of $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = -120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n6.  **Analysis of the Notch Filter Constraint**:\n    - The filter's stopband \"fully rejects all light within a wavenumber shift of $\\pm 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ relative to the excitation line\".\n    - This means any light corresponding to a Raman shift $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$ in the interval $[-200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, +200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}]$ is blocked from reaching the detector.\n    - Let's check the position of the Stokes line: $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = +120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Since $-200 < 120 < +200$, the Stokes line falls within the filter's rejection band. It will be blocked.\n    - Let's check the position of the anti-Stokes line: $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = -120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Since $-200 < -120 < +200$, the anti-Stokes line also falls within the filter's rejection band. It will also be blocked.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    Under the specified optical filtering conditions, neither the Stokes nor the anti-Stokes signal corresponding to the $120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ lattice mode can pass through the notch filter to the detector. Therefore, the mode is not observable.\n\n**A. Observable on both Stokes and anti-Stokes sides.**\nThis would be true only if the magnitude of the Raman shift, $|\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}|$, was greater than the filter's cut-off of $200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. For the given mode, $|\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}| = 120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is less than $200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Both signals fall within the rejection band.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Observable only on the Stokes side.**\nThis would require the Stokes line to be outside the rejection band and the anti-Stokes line to be inside it, or for the anti-Stokes signal to be non-existent. The Stokes shift is $+120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is within the $[-200, +200]\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ rejection band. The Stokes line is blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Observable only on the anti-Stokes side.**\nThis would require the anti-Stokes line to be outside the rejection band and the Stokes line to be inside it. The anti-Stokes shift is $-120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is within the $[-200, +200]\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ rejection band. The anti-Stokes line is blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Not observable on either side due to the notch filter stopband.**\nAs derived above, the Stokes signal at a shift of $+120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and the anti-Stokes signal at a shift of $-120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ both lie within the filter's spectral rejection window of $\\pm 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Consequently, both signals are blocked by the filter and will not be detected. This conclusion is fully consistent with the first principles of Raman spectroscopy and the instrument's specified constraints.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
