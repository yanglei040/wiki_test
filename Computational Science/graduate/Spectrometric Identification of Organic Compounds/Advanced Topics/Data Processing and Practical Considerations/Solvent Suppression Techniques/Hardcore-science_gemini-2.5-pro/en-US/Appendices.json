            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a transmitter amplitude scaling factor, $s$, to correctly achieve a desired flip angle, $\\theta_{\\text{des}}$, for a frequency-selective pulse in an NMR experiment. The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of spin dynamics in the rotating frame, as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we analyze the calibration experiment. An on-resonance nutation experiment using a continuous radiofrequency field of constant amplitude, which we will denote as $B_{1,\\text{current}}$, is performed. The problem states that the transverse signal response varies as $\\sin(\\gamma B_{1} t)$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $t$ is the pulse duration. The observed fundamental period of this oscillation, $T_{\\text{obs}}$, corresponds to the time required for the flip angle, $\\theta(t) = \\gamma B_{1,\\text{current}} t$, to advance by a full cycle of $2\\pi$ radians. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\gamma B_{1,\\text{current}} T_{\\text{obs}} = 2\\pi $$\nFrom this, we can express the current RF field amplitude in terms of the measured period $T_{\\text{obs}}$ and the constant $\\gamma$. This constitutes the inference of the current effective $B_{1}$ amplitude:\n$$ B_{1,\\text{current}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma T_{\\text{obs}}} $$\nNext, we consider the frequency-selective shaped pulse. This pulse has a duration $t_{p}$, a peak amplitude $B_{1,\\max}$, and a shape area factor $\\kappa$. The flip angle it produces is given by the formula $\\theta = \\gamma \\kappa B_{1,\\max} t_{p}$. The problem setup implies that the power setting used for the calibration experiment is the same as the one intended for the shaped pulse, meaning the peak amplitude of the shaped pulse is equal to the amplitude of the calibration field, i.e., $B_{1,\\max} = B_{1,\\text{current}}$. We can therefore calculate the actual flip angle, $\\theta_{\\text{act}}$, that this pulse would produce with the current uncorrected settings. We substitute the expression for $B_{1,\\text{current}}$ into the formula for the shaped pulse flip angle:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\gamma \\kappa B_{1, \\text{current}} t_p = \\gamma \\kappa \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma T_{\\text{obs}}} \\right) t_p $$\nThe gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ cancels, simplifying the expression for the actual flip angle:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\kappa t_p}{T_{\\text{obs}}} $$\nUsing the given values $t_p = 20.0 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $T_{\\text{obs}} = 6.80 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\kappa = 0.40$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\frac{2\\pi (0.40)(20.0)}{6.80} \\approx 7.39198 \\,\\text{radians} $$\nThe desired flip angle is $\\theta_{\\text{des}} = \\pi/2$ radians.

For the solute pool (site 's'), the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{z,s}}{dt} = -R_{1,s}(M_{z,s} - M_{0,s}) - k_s M_{z,s} + k_w M_{z,w} $$\nwhere $M_{z,s}$ and $M_{z,w}$ are the instantaneous longitudinal magnetizations of the solute and water, respectively. $M_{0,s}$ is the equilibrium magnetization of the solute. $R_{1,s} = 1/T_1$ is the intrinsic longitudinal relaxation rate of the solute. $k_s$ is the rate constant for exchange from solute to water, and $k_w$ is the rate constant for exchange from water to solute.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the forward exchange rate constant from solute to water is denoted by $k$. Thus, we have $k_s = k$.\n\nThe rate constant $k_w$ is related to $k_s$ by the principle of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium:\n$$ k_s M_{0,s} = k_w M_{0,w} \\implies k_w = k_s \\frac{M_{0,s}}{M_{0,w}} = k \\frac{M_{0,s}}{M_{0,w}} $$\nSubstituting these into the Bloch-McConnell equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{z,s}}{dt} = -R_{1,s}(M_{z,s} - M_{0,s}) - k M_{z,s} + \\left(k \\frac{M_{0,s}}{M_{0,w}}\\right) M_{z,w} $$\nThe problem requires us to analyze the system at steady state, which means $\\frac{dM_{z,s}}{dt} = 0$. The magnetizations are then the steady-state magnetizations, $M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$ and $M_{z,w}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$.\n$$ 0 = -R_{1,s}(M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - M_{0,s}) - k M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} + \\left(k \\frac{M_{0,s}}{M_{0,w}}\\right) M_{z,w}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} $$\nWe now apply the crucial assumption that the water resonance is continuously and completely saturated, meaning its longitudinal magnetization is maintained at zero: $M_{z,w}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = 0$. The equation simplifies significantly:\n$$ 0 = -R_{1,s}(M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - M_{0,s}) - k M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} + 0 $$\nThe task is to find the expression for the fractional magnetization $M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}/M_{0,s}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$:\n$$ R_{1,s}(M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - M_{0,s}) + k M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = 0 $$\n$$ R_{1,s} M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - R_{1,s} M_{0,s} + k M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = 0 $$\n$$ (R_{1,s} + k) M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = R_{1,s} M_{0,s} $$\nDividing both sides by $M_{0,s}$ and by $(R_{1,s} + k)$ yields the desired expression for the steady-state solute longitudinal magnetization fraction:\n$$ \\frac{M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}}{M_{0,s}} = \\frac{R_{1,s}}{R_{1,s} + k} $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   $k = 20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $T_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the intrinsic relaxation rate of the solute, $R_{1,s}$:\n$$ R_{1,s} = \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values of $R_{1,s}$ and $k$ into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}}{M_{0,s}} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.0}{21.0} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{1.0}{21.0} \\approx 0.0476190476... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.04762$.\n\n### Discussion on pH Adjustment\nThe attenuation of the solute signal is caused by saturation transfer from the saturated water protons to the solute protons via chemical exchange. The extent of this attenuation is governed by the relative magnitudes of the exchange rate constant, $k$, and the solute's intrinsic relaxation rate, $R_{1,s}$, as shown by the derived expression $\\frac{M_{z,s}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}}{M_{0,s}} = \\frac{R_{1,s}}{R_{1,s} + k}$. To mitigate attenuation, i.e., to make this fraction approach $1$, the exchange rate $k$ must be minimized relative to $R_{1,s}$.\n\nFor many labile protons (e.g., in hydroxyl, amine, or amide groups), the proton exchange process is subject to both acid and base catalysis. The overall exchange rate constant $k$ can be modeled as a function of hydronium $[\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+]$ and hydroxide $[\\text{OH}^-]$ concentrations:\n$$ k = k_0 + k_a[\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+] + k_b[\\text{OH}^-] $$\nwhere $k_0$ is the rate constant for the uncatalyzed (spontaneous) exchange pathway, and $k_a$ and $k_b$ are the rate constants for the acid-catalyzed and base-catalyzed pathways, respectively. Because $[\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+]$ is high at low pH and $[\\text{OH}^-]$ is high at high pH, this relationship implies that the exchange rate $k$ exhibits a U-shaped dependence on pH. The rate is minimal at a specific pH value, typically in the neutral or slightly acidic range (e.g., pH $4$ to $7$), where the contributions from both acid and base catalysis are minimized.\n\nTherefore, by adjusting the pH of the sample to this region of minimum exchange rate, one can effectively reduce the value of $k$. A smaller $k$ leads to less efficient saturation transfer from water, causing the fraction $\\frac{R_{1,s}}{R_{1,s} + k}$ to increase. This mitigates the signal attenuation, resulting in a stronger, more easily detectable signal for the labile solute proton in the solvent-suppressed NMR spectrum.",
