The aim is to maximize the detectability of the Si–H stretch while minimizing spectral artifacts and interferences. Three generic sample preparation modes are available: neat (film), potassium bromide (KBr) pellet, and solution. The choice must account for the following foundational considerations: the Beer–Lambert law, volatility and retention of analyte during measurement, solvent transparency in the target wavenumber region, and chemical compatibility with sampling media (including window materials and salts). The silane is moisture-sensitive and can undergo hydrolysis to produce silicon–oxygen (Si–O) functionalities. Windows and salts have distinct hygroscopic properties, and different solvents display characteristic absorption bands; path length and concentration determine absorbance according to the Beer–Lambert law and thus impact signal saturation and dynamic range.\n\nWhich of the following preparation and measurement conditions most appropriately enhances the detectability of the Si–H stretch of the volatile $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ while suppressing artifacts and interferences?\n\nA.

Solvents have characteristic absorption bands.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of analytical chemistry, specifically infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The properties attributed to the analyte (a tertiary silane being volatile and moisture-sensitive) are chemically accurate. The wavenumber range for the Si–H stretch is correct. The principles of sample preparation (neat films, KBr pellets, solution cells), the properties of common IR window materials (KBr, $\\text{CaF}_2$, NaCl) and solvents ($\\text{CCl}_4$, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CN}$, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$), and the Beer–Lambert law are all standard, factual concepts in spectroscopy. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the \"most appropriate\" set of conditions from a given list of choices. It provides sufficient, relevant information about the analyte's physical and chemical properties to perform a rigorous comparative analysis of the options. A single best answer can be determined by applying established spectroscopic and chemical principles.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. The criteria for success (maximize detectability, suppress artifacts) are objective and directly related to the quality of an IR spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe optimal experimental design must address three primary characteristics of the analyte, $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$: its volatility, its moisture sensitivity, and its spectroscopic properties.\n\n1.  **Volatility**: The analyte is a volatile liquid. This property strongly disfavors methods that involve open systems or long preparation times during which the sample can evaporate.\n    -   A neat film on an open plate will evaporate quickly, leading to a non-reproducible and decreasing signal.\n    -   Preparing a KBr pellet requires grinding a sample with KBr powder and pressing the mixture into a disc. A volatile liquid would evaporate almost completely during this process, resulting in little to no analyte in the final pellet.\n    -   The correct method for a volatile liquid is to use a sealed sample holder, such as a sealed liquid cell, to contain the vapor and maintain a constant concentration.\n\n2.  **Moisture Sensitivity**: The silane $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ reacts with water ($H_2O$), likely via hydrolysis, to form species containing Si–O bonds (e.g., silanols, $R_3\\text{SiOH}$, and siloxanes, $(R_3\\text{Si})_2\\text{O}$). This reaction would consume the analyte, diminishing the target Si–H band, and introduce new, interfering bands (e.g., a broad O–H stretch from the silanol around $3200$–$3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and strong Si–O stretches around $1000$–$1100\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). Therefore, exposure to atmospheric moisture must be rigorously avoided.\n    -   Any procedure conducted in \"ambient laboratory air\" is unacceptable. The spectrometer and sample compartment should be purged with a dry, inert gas (e.g., $\\text{N}_2$ or Ar) to displace water vapor and $\\text{CO}_2$.\n    -   Window materials must be chosen carefully. Salts like potassium bromide (KBr) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are hygroscopic, meaning they readily absorb atmospheric moisture, which would then be available to react with the sample. Non-hygroscopic materials, such as calcium fluoride ($\\text{CaF}_2$) or zinc selenide (ZnSe), are strongly preferred.\n    -   Solvents must be aprotic and rigorously dried before use. Protic solvents like methanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$) would react directly with the silane.\n\n3.  **Spectroscopic Considerations**: The goal is to clearly detect the Si–H stretch at $2100$–$2200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   The chosen solvent must be transparent in this region.\n    -   According to the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon c l$, where $A$ is absorbance, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $c$ is the concentration, and $l$ is the path length. The parameters $c$ and $l$ must be chosen to yield an absorbance in the optimal range (typically $A \\approx 0.1$–$1.0$) to maximize signal-to-noise without saturating the detector.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Press the $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ into a potassium bromide (KBr) pellet and record the mid-IR spectrum in ambient laboratory air without purging.**\nThis method is flawed for several reasons. First, the analyte is volatile and would evaporate during the grinding and pressing of the pellet. Second, KBr is hygroscopic and the preparation is done in ambient air, guaranteeing the presence of water, which will hydrolyze the silane. Third, recording without purging introduces interfering absorptions from atmospheric $H_2O$ and $CO_2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Record a neat film of $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ between hygroscopic KBr windows in an open, unsealed configuration at room temperature.**\nThis method is also deeply flawed. The \"open, unsealed configuration\" will allow the volatile silane to evaporate rapidly. The use of \"hygroscopic KBr windows\" in an open system will introduce moisture, leading to sample decomposition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prepare a sealed short-path liquid cell with calcium fluoride ($\\text{CaF}_{2}$) windows of path length $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, dissolve $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ in carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_{4}$) to $c \\approx 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, and purge the instrument and sample compartment with dry nitrogen before acquisition.**\nThis option systematically addresses all of the challenges.\n-   **Volatility**: A \"sealed short-path liquid cell\" prevents evaporation of the volatile analyte.\n-   **Moisture Sensitivity**: \"$\\text{CaF}_{2}$ windows\" are non-hygroscopic. Carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_{4}$) is an aprotic (non-reactive) solvent. Purging with \"dry nitrogen\" removes atmospheric moisture.\n-   **Spectroscopic Clarity**: $\\text{CCl}_{4}$ is a standard IR solvent with excellent transparency in the $2100$–$2200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region.\n-   **Beer-Lambert Law**: A path length of $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and concentration of $c \\approx 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$ are standard parameters that are highly likely to produce a well-defined peak with an absorbance in the optimal range.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Prepare a $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ path length solution cell in ambient air using acetonitrile ($\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CN}$) as solvent at $c \\approx 0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$.**\nThis method has multiple serious flaws. Preparation \"in ambient air\" will introduce moisture and lead to hydrolysis. Acetonitrile ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CN}$) has a $C\\equiv N$ stretching vibration near $2250\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is close to the region of interest and could cause interference. Most critically, the combination of a very long path length ($l = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and a high concentration ($c \\approx 0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$) will almost certainly lead to total absorption (saturation) of the Si–H band, making its useful observation impossible. The product $c \\cdot l$ is $50$ times greater than in option C.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Dissolve $R_{3}\\mathrm{SiH}$ in methanol ($\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{OH}$) and record the spectrum on sodium chloride (NaCl) windows open to ambient air, using a path length $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\nThis is the worst option. Methanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$) is a protic solvent that will react with and destroy the silane ($R_3SiH + CH_3OH \\rightarrow R_3SiOCH_3 + H_2$). NaCl windows are hygroscopic, and the \"open to ambient air\" setup ensures the presence of water, which will also cause hydrolysis. The analyte will not survive the sample preparation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be sound. It presents a realistic analytical chemistry challenge that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe central issue is the ambiguity of an Infrared (IR) absorption near $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This spectral region is known to contain stretching vibrations for both the silicon-hydrogen bond ($\\text{Si–H}$) and the internal carbon-carbon triple bond ($\\text{C≡C}$). The observation that the band is weak and that there is no absorption near $3300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ (the $\\equiv\\text{C–H}$ stretching region) correctly rules out a terminal alkyne but leaves the ambiguity between $\\text{Si–H}$ and an internal $\\text{C≡C}$ unresolved. A robust workflow must employ chemically definitive and mutually corroborative techniques to distinguish these two possibilities.\n\nThe fundamental principles for differentiating these two functionalities are:\n1.  **Mass-Dependence of Vibrational Frequency**: The harmonic oscillator model relates the vibrational wavenumber ($\\tilde{\\nu}$) to the bond force constant ($k$) and the reduced mass ($\\mu$) of the two atoms in the bond:\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\n    where $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$. Isotopic substitution, such as replacing hydrogen ($^{1}\\text{H}$) with deuterium ($^{2}\\text{D}$), significantly alters $\\mu$ without appreciably changing $k$. This leads to a predictable and large shift in $\\tilde{\\nu}$. For a $\\text{Si–H}$ bond, substituting $\\text{H}$ with $\\text{D}$ to form $\\text{Si–D}$ changes the reduced mass. Using atomic masses $m_{\\text{Si}} \\approx 28.085\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m_{\\text{H}} \\approx 1.008\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m_{\\text{D}} \\approx 2.014\\,\\mathrm{u}$:\n    $$\\mu_{\\text{Si-H}} = \\frac{(28.085)(1.008)}{28.085 + 1.008} \\approx 0.9731\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n    $$\\mu_{\\text{Si-D}} = \\frac{(28.085)(2.014)}{28.085 + 2.014} \\approx 1.8794\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n    The expected wavenumber for the $\\text{Si–D}$ stretch is:\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Si-D}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Si-H}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{Si-H}}}{\\mu_{\\text{Si-D}}}} = (2115\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\sqrt{\\frac{0.9731}{1.8794}} \\approx (2115\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(0.7196) \\approx 1522\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n    Observing the disappearance of the $2115\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band and the appearance of a new band near $1522\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ upon deuteration is definitive proof of a $\\text{Si–H}$ bond. A $\\text{C≡C}$ bond would be unaffected by this process.\n\n2.  **Vibrational Selection Rules**: IR spectroscopy is sensitive to vibrations that cause a change in the net molecular dipole moment. Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to vibrations that cause a change in the molecular polarizability.\n    *   The $\\text{Si–H}$ bond is polar. Its stretching vibration causes a significant change in dipole moment, typically leading to a moderate-to-strong IR absorption. The change in polarizability is less pronounced, resulting in a weak-to-medium Raman signal.\n    *   The $\\text{C≡C}$ bond is highly polarizable due to its $\\pi$-electron system. Its stretching causes a large change in polarizability, leading to a characteristically strong Raman signal. For an internal alkyne, if it is symmetrically substituted, the change in dipole moment is zero, and the band is IR-inactive. If it is unsymmetrically substituted, the change is small, resulting in a weak IR band, as observed. Thus, a band that is weak in the IR and strong in the Raman is a hallmark of a $\\text{C≡C}$ stretch.\n\n3.  **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**: NMR provides direct structural information about the connectivity of atoms.\n    *   **$^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR**: A proton directly attached to a silicon atom ($\\text{Si–H}$) typically resonates in the region $\\delta \\approx 3.5 - 6.0\\,\\text{ppm}$. The key diagnostic feature is spin-spin coupling to the magnetically active $^{29}\\text{Si}$ isotope ($I = 1/2$, natural abundance $\\approx 4.7\\%$). This coupling ($^{1}J_{\\text{Si-H}}$) produces characteristic \"satellite\" peaks flanking the main resonance. The observation of these satellites is unambiguous proof of a $\\text{Si–H}$ bond.\n    *   **$^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR**: The sp-hybridized carbons of an alkyne typically resonate in the region $\\delta \\approx 65 - 90\\,\\text{ppm}$. The presence of signals in this region would confirm a $\\text{C≡C}$ bond, while their absence would be strong evidence against it.\n\nA robust workflow will integrate these independent lines of evidence.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n**A. Use deuterium isotopic substitution targeted at Si–H (e.g., catalytic exchange with $D_2$ to form Si–D), predict and test the wavenumber shift via the harmonic oscillator relation, then corroborate by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: in Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR), identify a Si–H resonance with $^{29}\\text{Si}$ satellite coupling, and in Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR), check for the presence or absence of sp-carbon signals typical of alkynes. Complement the IR with Raman spectroscopy to assess band intensity patterns consistent with C$\\equiv$C versus Si–H.**\nThis option presents the most comprehensive and scientifically rigorous workflow.\n1.  It correctly proposes isotopic substitution, the gold standard for vibrational band assignment, and grounds it in the fundamental harmonic oscillator model.\n2.  It proposes corroboration with NMR spectroscopy, a completely independent technique. Both $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR (looking for $\\text{Si–H}$ with $^{29}\\text{Si}$ satellites) and $^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR (looking for alkyne carbons) are proposed, providing both positive evidence for one structure and negative evidence for the other. This is exceptionally thorough.\n3.  It includes complementing the IR data with Raman spectroscopy to check for the expected intensity differences based on selection rules.\nThis multi-pronged approach leaves no room for ambiguity.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. Rely solely on the IR pattern: assign the $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band to Si–H because no band appears near $3300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, then confirm the presence of silicon by High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) without further spectroscopic corroboration.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The reasoning that the absence of a band at $3300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ implicates $\\text{Si–H}$ is a logical error; it only rules out a terminal alkyne, not the internal alkyne that is the source of the ambiguity. Furthermore, confirming the presence of silicon via HRMS does not prove that the $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band is due to a $\\text{Si–H}$ vibration, as the molecule could contain both a silicon atom and a $\\text{C≡C}$ bond (e.g., a silylalkyne). This workflow is inconclusive.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Record Silicon-29 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{29}\\text{Si}$ NMR) only; if silicon is detected, infer the $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band is Si–H, and if silicon is not detected, infer the band is C$\\equiv$C, without any isotopic substitution or vibrational corroboration.**\nThis option is also based on a logical fallacy. The problem states the sample is an \"organosilicon sample,\" so the detection of silicon is expected and provides little new information. As with option B, the presence of silicon does not assign the specific vibration at $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ to a $\\text{Si–H}$ bond. Relying on a single, insufficient piece of evidence is not a robust scientific method.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compare IR and Raman intensities: if the $2115\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ band is strong in Raman and weak in IR, assign it to C$\\equiv$C; if strong in IR and weak in Raman, assign it to Si–H. Do not perform isotopic substitution or NMR; base the conclusion only on relative intensities between IR and Raman.**\nThis option proposes a valid and widely used technique. The comparison of IR and Raman intensities based on their respective selection rules is a powerful diagnostic. However, the problem asks for the *most robust* workflow that includes corroborative evidence. By explicitly stating \"Do not perform isotopic substitution or NMR,\" this option deliberately excludes more definitive techniques. While this method is good, it is not as conclusive as isotopic substitution or direct structural confirmation by NMR. The workflow in Option A, which includes Raman comparison *in addition* to other methods, is demonstrably superior and more robust.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A outlines a workflow that is comprehensive, defensible, and grounded in multiple, independent, fundamental principles of spectroscopy. It is the only option that robustly resolves the ambiguity.",

The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the secular equation $\\det(\\mathbf{K} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nk+k'-\\lambda & -k' \\\\\n-k' & k+k'-\\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$(k+k'-\\lambda)^2 - (-k')^2 = 0$$\n$$(k+k'-\\lambda)^2 = (k')^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives two solutions for $\\lambda$:\n$$k+k'-\\lambda = k' \\implies \\lambda_1 = k$$\n$$k+k'-\\lambda = -k' \\implies \\lambda_2 = k+2k'$$\n\nThese eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are the effective force constants of the two normal modes of vibration. Let's call them $k_{eff,1}$ and $k_{eff,2}$.\nThe first normal mode has an effective force constant $k_{eff,1} = k$. This corresponds to the symmetric stretch where $x_1 = x_2$, so the coupling term $\\frac{1}{2}k'(x_1-x_2)^2$ is zero and the oscillators vibrate as if uncoupled.\nThe second normal mode has an effective force constant $k_{eff,2} = k+2k'$. This corresponds to the asymmetric stretch where $x_1 = -x_2$.\n\nThe wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ of a harmonic oscillator is related to its effective force constant $k_{eff}$ and reduced mass $\\mu$ by:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{\\mu}}$$\nThe monomer wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ corresponds to the uncoupled oscillator, so:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\nThe two normal modes of the dimer will have wavenumbers:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,1}}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,2}}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k+2k'}{\\mu}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the dimer exhibits two bands separated by $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$. Based on our model, one band is at $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ and the other is shifted. The splitting $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$ is the difference between these two wavenumbers. Since $k' > 0$, we have $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 > \\tilde{\\nu}_1$.\n$$\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_1 = \\tilde{\\nu}_2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_0$$\nSo, $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k+2k'}{\\mu}}$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 = \\frac{k+2k'}{(2\\pi c)^2 \\mu}$$\nWe can also square the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ to find an expression for $k$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0^2 = \\frac{k}{(2\\pi c)^2 \\mu} \\implies k = \\mu (2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}_0)^2$$\nNow, rearrange the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ to solve for $k'$:\n$$k+2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - k$$\nSubstitute the expression for $k$:\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - \\mu (2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}_0)^2$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 [(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_0^2]$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 [2\\tilde{\\nu}_0 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} + (\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2]$$\n$$k' = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (2\\tilde{\\nu}_0 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} + (\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2) = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} \\left(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}\\right)$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass $\\mu$ of the $\\mathrm{Si}$–$\\mathrm{H}$ oscillator.\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Si}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{Si}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(28.0855\\,\\mathrm{u}) (1.00784\\,\\mathrm{u})}{28.0855\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.00784\\,\\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{28.30619384}{29.09334}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 0.972942155\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nConverting to kilograms:\n$$\\mu = 0.972942155\\,\\mathrm{u} \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{u} \\approx 1.61580103 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the derived expression for $k'$. All values are used in cgs units ($\\mathrm{cm}$, $\\mathrm{g}$, $\\mathrm{s}$) or SI ($\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{s}$) as appropriate. The formula uses $\\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\mathrm{kg}$, resulting in $k'$ in units of $\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n- $\\mu = 1.61580103 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} = 2130\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nCalculate the term in parentheses:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = 2130\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + \\frac{1}{2}(14.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = 2130\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 7.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 2137.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nNow compute $k'$:\n$$k' = (1.61580103 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (2\\pi \\times 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2 \\times (14.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (2137.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$$\n$$k' \\approx (1.61580103 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (3.54818833 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}) \\times (29918\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$$\n$$k' \\approx 1.715136\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$\n$$k' \\approx 1.715136\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nThe input data for the splitting, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, has three significant figures. Therefore, the final result should be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$$k' \\approx 1.72\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$",
