            "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative analysis of the line broadening mechanisms for an electronic transition of a molecule in a solid-state matrix. The analysis will proceed in three stages: first, determining the total transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$ from the observed spectral linewidth; second, determining the longitudinal or population relaxation time $T_{1}$ from photophysical data; and third, using these two quantities to dissect the contributions to line broadening and calculate the pure dephasing rate $1/T_{2}^{*}$.\n\n**Part 1: Transverse Relaxation Time ($T_{2}$) from Linewidth**\n\nThe problem states that the absorption band has a homogeneously broadened Lorentzian lineshape. This lineshape is the frequency-domain representation of a process that decays exponentially in the time domain. Specifically, for a two-level electronic system, the optical coherence, which represents the phase relationship between the ground and excited states, decays exponentially with a time constant $T_{2}$, the transverse relaxation time. The time evolution of this coherence can be written as $P(t) \\propto \\exp(-i\\omega_{0}t) \\exp(-t/T_{2})$ for time $t \\ge 0$, where $\\omega_{0}$ is the resonant angular frequency of the transition.\n\nAccording to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem and linear response theory, the absorption lineshape, $I(\\omega)$, is proportional to the real part of the Fourier transform of the time-dependent dipole-dipole correlation function, which for this system follows the decay of the coherence. We compute this Fourier transform:\n$$ I(\\omega) \\propto \\text{Re} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-i\\omega_{0}t - t/T_{2}) \\exp(i\\omega t) dt $$\nLet $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega - \\omega_{0}$. The integral becomes:\n$$ I(\\omega) \\propto \\text{Re} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\Delta\\omega t - t/T_{2}) dt = \\text{Re} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(1/T_{2} - i\\Delta\\omega)t) dt $$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$ I(\\omega) \\propto \\text{Re} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(1/T_{2} - i\\Delta\\omega)t)}{-(1/T_{2} - i\\Delta\\omega)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\text{Re} \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-(1/T_{2} - i\\Delta\\omega)} \\right) = \\text{Re} \\left( \\frac{1}{1/T_{2} - i\\Delta\\omega} \\right) $$\nTo take the real part, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n$$ I(\\omega) \\propto \\text{Re} \\left( \\frac{1/T_{2} + i\\Delta\\omega}{(1/T_{2})^2 + (\\Delta\\omega)^2} \\right) = \\frac{1/T_{2}}{(\\omega - \\omega_{0})^2 + (1/T_{2})^2} $$\nThis is the standard Lorentzian lineshape function. The maximum intensity occurs at the resonant frequency, $\\omega = \\omega_{0}$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is the difference between the two angular frequencies, $\\omega_{1/2}$, at which the intensity is half its maximum value. This occurs when the denominator is twice its value at the peak, i.e., $(\\omega_{1/2} - \\omega_{0})^2 + (1/T_{2})^2 = 2(1/T_{2})^2$.\nThis gives $(\\omega_{1/2} - \\omega_{0})^2 = (1/T_{2})^2$, or $|\\omega_{1/2} - \\omega_{0}| = 1/T_{2}$.\nThe FWHM in angular frequency units ($\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is thus $\\Delta\\omega_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 2/T_{2}$.\nConverting to ordinary frequency units (Hz), $\\Delta\\nu = \\Delta\\omega / (2\\pi)$, so the FWHM is $\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 1/(\\pi T_{2})$.\nThe problem provides the FWHM in wavenumber units ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$. The relationship is $\\Delta\\nu = c \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\nTherefore, the relationship between the FWHM in wavenumbers and $T_{2}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi c T_{2}} $$\nFrom this, we can express the total dephasing rate, $1/T_{2}$, as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}} = \\pi c \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} $$\nUsing the given values $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}} = \\pi \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\approx 1.8836515 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nAnd the transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$ is:\n$$ T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\pi c \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.8836515 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 5.3088 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**Part 2: Population Relaxation Time ($T_{1}$)**\n\nThe population relaxation time $T_{1}$ is the lifetime of the excited state population. It is the inverse of the total decay rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The total decay rate is the sum of the radiative decay rate, $k_{r}$, and the non-radiative decay rate, $k_{nr}$:\n$$ T_{1} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{r} + k_{nr}} $$\nThe fluorescence quantum yield, $\\phi_{F}$, is defined as the fraction of excited molecules that decay through the radiative channel. Mathematically:\n$$ \\phi_{F} = \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r} + k_{nr}} = \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\nFrom this, we can find the total decay rate $k_{\\mathrm{tot}} = k_{r} / \\phi_{F}$.\nUsing the given values $\\phi_{F} = 0.36$ and $k_{r} = 1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.36} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 3.3333 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe population relaxation time $T_{1}$ is then:\n$$ T_{1} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{0.36}{1.20 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**Part 3: Pure Dephasing Rate ($1/T_{2}^{*}$)**\n\nThe total dephasing rate, $1/T_{2}$, is the sum of the rates of all processes that destroy the optical coherence. These processes are categorized into two types: population relaxation ($T_{1}$ processes) and pure dephasing ($T_{2}^{*}$ processes).\nPopulation relaxation, which involves a change in the electronic state of the molecule (e.g., fluorescence, internal conversion), necessarily destroys coherence. The rate at which population decay contributes to coherence decay is $1/(2T_{1})$. The factor of $2$ arises because coherence (proportional to an off-diagonal element of the density matrix) decays at half the rate of population (proportional to a diagonal element).\nPure dephasing events, described by the time constant $T_{2}^{*}$, are elastic scattering processes that randomize the phase of the electronic wavefunction without causing a change in population. Examples include fluctuations in the local environment due to phonon scattering.\nThe rates from these independent processes add up:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}} = \\frac{1}{2T_{1}} + \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} $$\nThe pure dephasing rate constant, $1/T_{2}^{*}$, is therefore the part of the total dephasing rate not accounted for by population decay:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{2T_{1}} $$\nFirst, we assess if lifetime broadening alone ($1/(2T_1)$) can account for the observed linewidth ($1/T_2$).\nThe rate contribution from population decay is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2T_{1}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{2} = \\frac{3.3333 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2} = 1.6666... \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nComparing this to the total observed dephasing rate:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}} \\approx 1.8837 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2T_{1}} \\approx 0.0167 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nClearly, the rate due to population decay is much smaller than the total observed dephasing rate. Therefore, lifetime broadening alone cannot account for the observed linewidth, and a significant pure dephasing contribution must be present.\nWe now calculate this pure dephasing rate constant:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = (1.8836515 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) - (1.66666... \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = (1.8836515 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) - (0.0166666... \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = 1.8669848... \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} \\approx 1.87 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis result confirms that in this system, even at cryogenic temperatures, the dominant line broadening mechanism is pure dephasing, which is almost two orders of magnitude faster than broadening due to the excited-state lifetime.",

The distribution of molecular velocities along the line of sight leads to a distribution of Doppler-shifted absorption frequencies.

The derivation starts from the fundamental principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, specifically the behavior of transverse magnetization as described by the Bloch equations and its relationship to the observed spectral lineshape via the Fourier transform.\n\nIn an NMR experiment, the decay of the transverse magnetization, $M_{xy}$, is governed by the time constant $T_{2}^*$. Assuming an exponential decay, the time-domain signal, or Free Induction Decay (FID), is proportional to $\\exp(-t/T_{2}^*)$. The problem states that the observed lineshapes are Lorentzian. A Lorentzian lineshape in the frequency domain is the Fourier transform of an exponential decay in the time domain.

Inhomogeneous broadening, characterized by the time constant $T_{2}^{\\prime}$.

The problem assumes a short echo time and negligible diffusion, which ensures the efficacy of this separation.\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}} = \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{homo}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi T_{2}} $$\nNow we can solve for the inhomogeneous linewidth, $\\Delta \\nu_{\\text{inhomo}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{inhomo}} = \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{total}} - \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{homo}} = \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{FID}} - \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}} $$\nThe quantity we seek is $T_{2}^{\\prime}$, which is related to the inhomogeneous linewidth by:\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{inhomo}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi T_{2}^{\\prime}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta \\nu_{\\text{inhomo}}$, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{FID}} - \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi T_{2}^{\\prime}} $$\nSolving for $T_{2}^{\\prime}$ yields the desired symbolic expression:\n$$ T_{2}^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{\\pi (\\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{FID}} - \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}})} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the dephasing time due solely to static magnetic field inhomogeneity in terms of the measured linewidths.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $T_{2}^{\\prime}$ using the provided data:\n$\\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{FID}} = 7.843~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}} = 1.925~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the inhomogeneous contribution to the linewidth:\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_{\\text{inhomo}} = \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{FID}} - \\Delta \\nu_{\\mathrm{echo}} = 7.843~\\mathrm{Hz} - 1.925~\\mathrm{Hz} = 5.918~\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nNow, we calculate $T_{2}^{\\prime}$:\n$$ T_{2}^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{\\pi (5.918~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})} \\approx \\frac{1}{18.5919~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.053787~\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in milliseconds (ms) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ T_{2}^{\\prime} \\approx 0.053787~\\mathrm{s} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mathrm{ms}}{1~\\mathrm{s}} = 53.787~\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ T_{2}^{\\prime} = 53.79~\\mathrm{ms} $$",
