The value $\\tilde{\\phi}_{6} - 2\\pi = 3.003 - 2\\pi \\approx 3.003 - 6.283 = -3.28~\\mathrm{rad}$ is very close to this expectation. Thus, we choose $k_{6}=-1$.\n$\\phi_{6} = \\tilde{\\phi}_{6} + 2\\pi k_{6} = 3.003 - 2\\pi$.\n\nThe unwrapped data set $(\\omega_{i}, \\phi_{i})$ is:\n- $(\\omega_{1}, \\phi_{1}) = (500, -0.21)$\n- $(\\omega_{2}, \\phi_{2}) = (1000, -0.87)$\n- $(\\omega_{3}, \\phi_{3}) = (1500, -1.42)$\n- $(\\omega_{4}, \\phi_{4}) = (2000, -2.06)$\n- $(\\omega_{5}, \\phi_{5}) = (2500, -2.63)$\n- $(\\omega_{6}, \\phi_{6}) = (3000, 3.003 - 2\\pi)$\n\n**Step 2: Weighted Linear Regression**\nWe need to fit the model $\\phi = \\phi_{0} + \\phi_{1}\\omega$ to the unwrapped data. Since the standard uncertainty on each phase measurement is identical ($0.05~\\mathrm{rad}$), the weighted least-squares regression simplifies to an unweighted linear regression. The estimates for $\\phi_{0}$ and $\\phi_{1}$ are those that minimize the sum of squared residuals.\n\nThe formulas for the slope ($\\phi_{1}$) and intercept ($\\phi_{0}$) are:\n$$\n\\phi_{1} = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\omega_{i})(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\phi_{i})}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\omega_{i}^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\omega_{i})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{0} = \\bar{\\phi} - \\phi_{1} \\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\phi_{i} - \\phi_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\omega_{i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N=6$. We compute the necessary sums:\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\omega_{i} = 500+1000+1500+2000+2500+3000 = 10500$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\omega_{i}^2 = 500^2+1000^2+1500^2+2000^2+2500^2+3000^2 = 250000(1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2+6^2) = 250000(91) = 22750000$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\phi_{i} = -0.21 - 0.87 - 1.42 - 2.06 - 2.63 + (3.003 - 2\\pi) = -4.187 - 2\\pi$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} (\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) = 500(-0.21) + 1000(-0.87) + 1500(-1.42) + 2000(-2.06) + 2500(-2.63) + 3000(3.003 - 2\\pi)$\n   $= -105 - 870 - 2130 - 4120 - 6575 + 9009 - 6000\\pi = -4791 - 6000\\pi$\n\nNow, we substitute these sums into the formulas.\nThe denominator for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$N \\sum \\omega_{i}^2 - (\\sum \\omega_{i})^2 = 6(22750000) - (10500)^2 = 136500000 - 110250000 = 26250000$$\nThe numerator for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$N \\sum(\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) - (\\sum \\omega_{i})(\\sum \\phi_{i}) = 6(-4791 - 6000\\pi) - (10500)(-4.187 - 2\\pi)$$\n$$= -28746 - 36000\\pi - (-43963.5 - 21000\\pi) = 15217.5 - 15000\\pi$$\nSo, the estimate for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$\\phi_{1} = \\frac{15217.5 - 15000\\pi}{26250000} \\approx \\frac{15217.5 - 15000(3.14159265)}{26250000} \\approx \\frac{-31906.3898}{26250000} \\approx -0.0012154815~\\mathrm{s}$$\nNext, we calculate the estimate for $\\phi_{0}$. We have $\\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{10500}{6} = 1750~\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\bar{\\phi} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6}$.\n$$\\phi_{0} = \\bar{\\phi} - \\phi_{1} \\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6} - (-0.0012154815)(1750)$$\n$$\\phi_{0} \\approx \\frac{-4.187 - 6.2831853}{6} + 2.1270926 = \\frac{-10.4701853}{6} + 2.1270926$$\n$$\\phi_{0} \\approx -1.74503088 + 2.1270926 \\approx 0.3820617~\\mathrm{rad}$$\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\nThe problem requires the final numerical values for $\\phi_{0}$ and $\\phi_{1}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\phi_{0} \\approx 0.382062~\\mathrm{rad}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.3821$.\n$\\phi_{1} \\approx -0.0012154815~\\mathrm{s}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $-0.001215$.\n\nThe estimated parameters are $\\phi_{0} = 0.3821~\\mathrm{rad}$ and $\\phi_{1} = -0.001215~\\mathrm{s}$.",
