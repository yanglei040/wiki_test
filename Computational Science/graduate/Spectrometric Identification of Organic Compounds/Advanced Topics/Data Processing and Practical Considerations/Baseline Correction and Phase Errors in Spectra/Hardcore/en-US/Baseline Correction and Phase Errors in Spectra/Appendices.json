In phase-sensitive techniques like FT-NMR, an ideal absorption peak is a real, symmetric Lorentzian function, while its corresponding dispersion signal is an imaginary, antisymmetric function. This exercise guides you through the essential algebra of demonstrating how an instrumental phase error causes these two components to mix, corrupting the pure absorption lineshape. By working through this derivation and applying it to calculate a phase error from peak-center data, you will build a foundational understanding of how phasing problems manifest in your spectra .",

Let $\\phi_{1} = \\tilde{\\phi}_{1} = -0.21$.\n\n- For $i=2$: $\\omega_{2} = 1000~\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\tilde{\\phi}_{2} = -0.87~\\mathrm{rad}$. The phase difference from the first point is $\\tilde{\\phi}_{2} - \\phi_{1} = -0.66~\\mathrm{rad}$. This is a reasonable change for a frequency step of $500~\\mathrm{rad/s}$. We set $k_{2}=0$, so $\\phi_{2} = \\tilde{\\phi}_{2} = -0.87$.\n\n- For $i=3$: $\\omega_{3} = 1500~\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\tilde{\\phi}_{3} = -1.42~\\mathrm{rad}$. The phase difference is $\\tilde{\\phi}_{3} - \\phi_{2} = -0.55~\\mathrm{rad}$. This is similar to the previous step, so we set $k_{3}=0$, giving $\\phi_{3} = -1.42$.\n\n- For $i=4$: $\\omega_{4} = 2000~\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\tilde{\\phi}_{4} = -2.06~\\mathrm{rad}$. The difference is $\\tilde{\\phi}_{4} - \\phi_{3} = -0.64~\\mathrm{rad}$. We set $k_{4}=0$, giving $\\phi_{4} = -2.06$.\n\n- For $i=5$: $\\omega_{5} = 2500~\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\tilde{\\phi}_{5} = -2.63~\\mathrm{rad}$. The difference is $\\tilde{\\phi}_{5} - \\phi_{4} = -0.57~\\mathrm{rad}$. We set $k_{5}=0$, giving $\\phi_{5} = -2.63$.\n\n- For $i=6$: $\\omega_{6} = 3000~\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\tilde{\\phi}_{6} = 3.003~\\mathrm{rad}$. The difference from the previous measured phase is $\\tilde{\\phi}_{6} - \\phi_{5} = 3.003 - (-2.63) = 5.633~\\mathrm{rad}$. This is a significant jump and is inconsistent with the previous differences, which are all approximately $-0.6~\\mathrm{rad}$. This indicates a phase wrap has occurred. The jump of $5.633~\\mathrm{rad}$ is close to $2\\pi \\approx 6.283~\\mathrm{rad}$. To restore linearity, we must subtract an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. The expected phase $\\phi_{6}$ should be near $\\phi_{5} + (\\phi_{5}-\\phi_{4}) \\approx -2.63 - 0.57 = -3.20~\\mathrm{rad}$. The value $\\tilde{\\phi}_{6} - 2\\pi = 3.003 - 2\\pi \\approx 3.003 - 6.283 = -3.28~\\mathrm{rad}$ is very close to this expectation. Thus, we choose $k_{6}=-1$.\n$\\phi_{6} = \\tilde{\\phi}_{6} + 2\\pi k_{6} = 3.003 - 2\\pi$.\n\nThe unwrapped data set $(\\omega_{i}, \\phi_{i})$ is:\n- $(\\omega_{1}, \\phi_{1}) = (500, -0.21)$\n- $(\\omega_{2}, \\phi_{2}) = (1000, -0.87)$\n- $(\\omega_{3}, \\phi_{3}) = (1500, -1.42)$\n- $(\\omega_{4}, \\phi_{4}) = (2000, -2.06)$\n- $(\\omega_{5}, \\phi_{5}) = (2500, -2.63)$\n- $(\\omega_{6}, \\phi_{6}) = (3000, 3.003 - 2\\pi)$\n\n**Step 2: Weighted Linear Regression**\nWe need to fit the model $\\phi = \\phi_{0} + \\phi_{1}\\omega$ to the unwrapped data. Since the standard uncertainty on each phase measurement is identical ($0.05~\\mathrm{rad}$), the weighted least-squares regression simplifies to an unweighted linear regression. The estimates for $\\phi_{0}$ and $\\phi_{1}$ are those that minimize the sum of squared residuals.\n\nThe formulas for the slope ($\\phi_{1}$) and intercept ($\\phi_{0}$) are:\n$$\n\\phi_{1} = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\omega_{i})(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\phi_{i})}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\omega_{i}^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\omega_{i})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{0} = \\bar{\\phi} - \\phi_{1} \\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\phi_{i} - \\phi_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\omega_{i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N=6$. We compute the necessary sums:\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\omega_{i} = 500+1000+1500+2000+2500+3000 = 10500$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\omega_{i}^2 = 500^2+1000^2+1500^2+2000^2+2500^2+3000^2 = 250000(1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2+6^2) = 250000(91) = 22750000$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\phi_{i} = -0.21 - 0.87 - 1.42 - 2.06 - 2.63 + (3.003 - 2\\pi) = -4.187 - 2\\pi$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} (\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) = 500(-0.21) + 1000(-0.87) + 1500(-1.42) + 2000(-2.06) + 2500(-2.63) + 3000(3.003 - 2\\pi)$\n   $= -105 - 870 - 2130 - 4120 - 6575 + 9009 - 6000\\pi = -4791 - 6000\\pi$\n\nNow, we substitute these sums into the formulas.\nThe denominator for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$\nN \\sum \\omega_{i}^2 - (\\sum \\omega_{i})^2 = 6(22750000) - (10500)^2 = 136500000 - 110250000 = 26250000\n$$\nThe numerator for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$\nN \\sum(\\omega_{i} \\phi_{i}) - (\\sum \\omega_{i})(\\sum \\phi_{i}) = 6(-4791 - 6000\\pi) - (10500)(-4.187 - 2\\pi)\n$$\n$$\n= -28746 - 36000\\pi - (-43963.5 - 21000\\pi) = 15217.5 - 15000\\pi\n$$\nSo, the estimate for $\\phi_{1}$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_{1} = \\frac{15217.5 - 15000\\pi}{26250000} \\approx \\frac{15217.5 - 15000(3.14159265)}{26250000} \\approx \\frac{-31906.3898}{26250000} \\approx -0.0012154815~\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the estimate for $\\phi_{0}$.\n$\\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{10500}{6} = 1750~\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n$\\bar{\\phi} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6}$.\n$$\n\\phi_{0} = \\bar{\\phi} - \\phi_{1} \\bar{\\omega} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6} - \\left( \\frac{15217.5 - 15000\\pi}{26250000} \\right) (1750)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{0} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6} - \\frac{15217.5 - 15000\\pi}{15000} = \\frac{-4.187 - 2\\pi}{6} - (1.0145 - \\pi)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{0} = -0.697833... - \\frac{\\pi}{3} - 1.0145 + \\pi = -1.712333... + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{0} \\approx -1.712333... + \\frac{2(3.14159265)}{3} \\approx -1.712333... + 2.094395... \\approx 0.382062~\\mathrm{rad}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\nThe problem requires the final numerical values for $\\phi_{0}$ and $\\phi_{1}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\phi_{0} \\approx 0.382062~\\mathrm{rad}$.
