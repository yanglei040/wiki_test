It is free from ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\nNo invalidating flaws are present. The problem is a rigorous, self-contained exercise in quantum chemistry.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the HOMO-LUMO Energy Gap\n\nThe one-electron Schrödinger equation in the LCAO-MO approximation is $\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi$. Within the Hückel framework, the secular equations for a linear chain of $M$ carbon atoms can be written in matrix form as $(H - ES)C = 0$. Given the assumption $S_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (i.e., $S$ is the identity matrix $I$), this simplifies to $(H - EI)C = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, the secular determinant must be zero: $\\det(H-EI)=0$.\n\nFor a linear chain of $M$ atoms, the Hückel Hamiltonian matrix is an $M \\times M$ tridiagonal matrix:\n$$\nH = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha  \\beta  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\beta  \\alpha  \\beta  \\dots  0 \\\\\n0  \\beta  \\alpha  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  0  0  \\dots  \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe secular determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(H-EI) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha - E  \\beta  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\beta  \\alpha - E  \\beta  \\dots  0 \\\\\n0  \\beta  \\alpha - E  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  0  0  \\dots  \\alpha - E\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nTo find the energy eigenvalues $E$, we solve this determinant. It is standard to simplify by dividing each row by $\\beta$ and letting $x = \\frac{\\alpha - E}{\\beta}$. The equation becomes a determinant of a matrix with $x$ on the diagonal, $1$ on the super- and sub-diagonals, and $0$ elsewhere. The analytical solution for the eigenvalues of this matrix is well-known. This procedure yields the allowed one-electron energy levels, indexed by a quantum number $k=1, 2, \\dots, M$:\n$$\nE_k = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{M+1}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\beta  0$ and the term $\\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{M+1}\\right)$ is a decreasing function for $k \\in [1, M]$, the energy $E_k$ increases as $k$ increases. Thus, the orbitals are ordered in energy as $E_1  E_2  \\dots  E_M$.\n\nThe problem specifies a neutral polyene with $M=2N$ conjugated carbon atoms and $M=2N$ $\\pi$-electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion principle and the Aufbau principle, these $2N$ electrons will fill the molecular orbitals starting from the lowest energy level, with two electrons per orbital (one spin up, one spin down). The $2N$ electrons will therefore occupy the $N$ lowest-energy orbitals, corresponding to $k = 1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the highest-energy orbital that contains electrons. In this case, it is the orbital with quantum number $k=N$. Its energy is:\n$$\nE_{HOMO} = E_N = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{N\\pi}{M+1}\\right)\n$$\nThe Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is the lowest-energy orbital that does not contain electrons. This is the orbital with quantum number $k=N+1$. Its energy is:\n$$\nE_{LUMO} = E_{N+1} = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{(N+1)\\pi}{M+1}\\right)\n$$\nThe HOMO-LUMO energy gap, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between these two energy levels:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{LUMO} - E_{HOMO} = \\left[\\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{(N+1)\\pi}{M+1}\\right)\\right] - \\left[\\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{N\\pi}{M+1}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = 2\\beta \\left[ \\cos\\left(\\frac{(N+1)\\pi}{M+1}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{N\\pi}{M+1}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric sum-to-product identity $\\cos(A) - \\cos(B) = -2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$.\nLet $A = \\frac{(N+1)\\pi}{M+1}$ and $B = \\frac{N\\pi}{M+1}$.\nThen $\\frac{A+B}{2} = \\frac{(2N+1)\\pi}{2(M+1)}$ and $\\frac{A-B}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2(M+1)}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 2\\beta \\left[ -2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2N+1)\\pi}{2(M+1)}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(M+1)}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = -4\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2N+1)\\pi}{2(M+1)}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(M+1)}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute $M=2N$ as given in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Delta E = -4\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2N+1)\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the first sine term simplifies to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = -4\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta E = -4\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a positive quantity expressed in terms of $|\\beta|$. Given that $\\beta0$, we can write $\\beta = -|\\beta|$.\n$$\n\\Delta E = -4(-|\\beta|) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = 4|\\beta| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(2N+1)}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final, exact analytical expression for the HOMO-LUMO gap. For any integer $N \\ge 1$, the argument of the sine function is in the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so its value is positive. As $|\\beta|$ is also positive, the entire expression for $\\Delta E$ is positive, satisfying all conditions of the problem.",

            "introduction": "While HMO theory provides the fundamental \"why,\" practicing chemists often rely on powerful empirical tools for rapid and accurate spectral prediction. The Woodward-Fieser rules are a classic example, translating the theoretical effects of conjugation and substitution into a simple, additive system. This practice provides a hands-on opportunity to apply these rules, demonstrating how structural features like alkyl groups (auxochromes) and exocyclic bonds incrementally shift the absorption maximum ($\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) of a diene chromophore .",

            "problem": "In ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, the wavelength of maximum absorption, denoted $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, for a conjugated $\\pi$-electron chromophore arises from a $\\pi \\to \\pi^{*}$ electronic transition whose energy gap is inversely related to the absorption wavelength through the relation $E = h \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$. Conjugation and electron-donating substituents (auxochromes) increase $\\pi$-electron delocalization and polarizability, thereby stabilizing the excited $\\pi^{*}$ state relative to the ground $\\pi$ state, which reduces the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap and bathochromically shifts $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ to longer wavelengths. Empirical, well-tested additivity rules (Woodward–Fieser rules) quantify these effects for conjugated dienes, assigning a base value and incremental shifts for structural features such as alkyl substituents and exocyclic double bonds.\n\nConsider an acyclic conjugated diene whose chromophore has a base $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ of $214$ nm. Relative to the parent chromophore, the molecule contains one alkyl substituent that acts as an auxochrome and one exocyclic double bond. For predictive purposes, the alkyl substituent contributes an increment of $+5$ nm and the exocyclic double bond contributes an increment of $+5$ nm to $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nCompute the predicted $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ by adding the appropriate increments to the base value, and provide a concise physical justification based on the role of chromophores, auxochromes, and conjugation in determining the HOMO–LUMO gap and the resulting bathochromic shift. Express your final answer in nanometers (nm) and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular spectroscopy and quantum chemistry, specifically concerning the application of the empirical Woodward–Fieser rules for predicting the wavelength of maximum absorption ($\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) in conjugated systems. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data (a base value and specific increments) for a unique solution, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe prediction of $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ in ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy for conjugated organic molecules is based on the energy required for a $\\pi \\to \\pi^{*}$ electronic transition. The energy of this transition, $\\Delta E$, corresponds to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the $\\pi$-electron system. This energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the absorbed light, as described by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\text{photon}} = h \\nu = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\nu$ is the frequency of the light. Consequently, a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap, $\\Delta E$, results in absorption at a longer wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe central part of the molecule responsible for this absorption is the **chromophore**, which in this case is the conjugated diene system. Structural modifications to the chromophore alter the energies of the molecular orbitals. **Auxochromes** are substituents, such as alkyl groups, that when attached to a chromophore, shift the $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe effects of **conjugation**, auxochromes, and specific structural features like exocyclic double bonds can be explained by their influence on the $\\pi$-electron system.\n1.  **Conjugation and Electron Delocalization**: The extended system of alternating single and double bonds allows the $\\pi$ electrons to be delocalized over a larger region of the molecule. This delocalization stabilizes the molecule by lowering the energy of both the occupied $\\pi$ molecular orbitals (including the HOMO) and the unoccupied $\\pi^{*}$ molecular orbitals (including the LUMO).\n2.  **Stabilization of the Excited State**: The stabilization effect is more pronounced for the excited state ($\\pi^{*}$) than for the ground state ($\\pi$). An alkyl substituent, acting as an electron-donating group through hyperconjugation, increases the electron density in the $\\pi$-system. Similarly, an exocyclic double bond extends the conjugated system. Both features enhance electron delocalization. The increased delocalization provides greater stabilization to the more diffuse $\\pi^{*}$ (LUMO) orbital compared to the $\\pi$ (HOMO) orbital.\n3.  **Bathochromic Shift**: Because the LUMO is stabilized more than the HOMO, the energy gap $\\Delta E_{\\text{HOMO-LUMO}}$ decreases. According to the relation $\\lambda \\propto 1/\\Delta E$, a smaller energy gap requires a photon of lower energy, and thus longer wavelength, to induce the transition. This phenomenon is known as a bathochromic shift (or red shift), where $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ is shifted to a longer wavelength.\n\nThe Woodward–Fieser rules provide an empirical, additive model to quantify these shifts. The predicted $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ is calculated by summing a base value for a parent chromophore with specific increments for various substituents and structural features.\n\nFor the given acyclic conjugated diene:\nThe base value for the chromophore is $\\lambda_{\\text{base}} = 214 \\text{ nm}$.\nThe increment for one alkyl substituent is $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{alkyl}} = 5 \\text{ nm}$.\nThe increment for one exocyclic double bond is $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{exo}} = 5 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nThe predicted wavelength of maximum absorption, $\\lambda_{\\text{max, predicted}}$, is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max, predicted}} = \\lambda_{\\text{base}} + \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{alkyl}} + \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{exo}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max, predicted}} = 214 \\text{ nm} + 5 \\text{ nm} + 5 \\text{ nm} = 224 \\text{ nm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $224$. To represent this with four significant figures, we express it as $224.0$.",
