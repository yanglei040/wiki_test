            "solution": "The problem is first assessed for validity. All provided information is scientifically sound and self-consistent. The problem uses the standard harmonic oscillator model to describe vibrational modes in the context of the Franck-Condon principle, a cornerstone of molecular spectroscopy. The definition of the dimensionless normal coordinate $q$, the reorganization energy $\\lambda$, and the physical constants and relations are all standard and correct. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It is therefore deemed a valid scientific problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a derivation of the reorganization energy $\\lambda$ from first principles, and second, its numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Reorganization Energy $\\lambda$**\n\nThe potential energy $V$ of a quantum harmonic oscillator with mass-weighted normal coordinate $Q$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ is given by $V(Q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 Q^2$. The problem defines a dimensionless normal coordinate $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\hbar}}Q$. We can express the potential energy in terms of this dimensionless coordinate. From the definition of $q$, we have $Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega}}q$. Substituting this into the potential energy expression gives:\n$$V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega}}q \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega} \\right) q^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega q^2$$\nThis expression gives the potential energy as a function of the dimensionless coordinate $q$. The term $\\hbar\\omega$ is the energy of a single vibrational quantum for this mode.\n\nThe problem specifies two electronic states, ground ($g$) and excited ($e$), modeled by harmonic potentials of identical frequency $\\omega$ but with displaced minima.\nThe ground-state potential, $V_g$, has its minimum at $q=0$. Its functional form is:\n$$V_g(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega q^2$$\nThe excited-state potential, $V_e$, has its minimum at $q=\\Delta q$. Its functional form is:\n$$V_e(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (q - \\Delta q)^2$$\nNote that any constant energy offset representing the electronic energy gap is irrelevant for the calculation of the reorganization energy, as $\\lambda$ is defined as an energy difference on the excited-state potential energy surface.\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is defined as the energy released when the system, having undergone a vertical electronic transition to the excited state at the ground state's equilibrium geometry ($q=0$), relaxes to the equilibrium geometry of the excited state ($q=\\Delta q$). Mathematically, this is the difference in the excited state's potential energy between these two points:\n$$\\lambda = V_e(q=0) - V_e(q=\\Delta q)$$\n\nWe calculate the two terms:\nThe potential energy at the initial point of relaxation ($q=0$ on the excited-state surface) is:\n$$V_e(q=0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (0 - \\Delta q)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2$$\nThe potential energy at the final, relaxed point ($q=\\Delta q$ on the excited-state surface) is:\n$$V_e(q=\\Delta q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q - \\Delta q)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (0)^2 = 0$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$ yields the derived formula:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2 - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $\\lambda$**\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n- The spectroscopic wavenumber of the vibrational mode: $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- The dimensionless displacement: $\\Delta q = 1.4$.\n\nThe energy of a vibrational quantum, $\\hbar\\omega$, is directly related to its spectroscopic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by the relation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$. Therefore, the term $\\hbar\\omega$ in our derived expression for $\\lambda$ corresponds to the energy equivalent of the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nTo compute the reorganization energy as a wavenumber, denoted $\\tilde{\\lambda}$, we can adapt our derived formula. Since $\\lambda = E$, we have $\\lambda = hc\\tilde{\\lambda}$. Thus:\n$$hc\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}(hc\\tilde{\\nu})(\\Delta q)^2$$\nDividing by $hc$, we obtain the reorganization energy in units of wavenumber:\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{\\nu}(\\Delta q)^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}(1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(1.4)^2 = (750\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(1.96) = 1470\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. The exact result is $1470$. To explicitly indicate four significant figures, we write this as $1.470 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the reorganization energy in units of electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). We can use the provided conversion factor: $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 8065.544\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\lambda}}{\\text{conversion factor}} = \\frac{1470\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{8065.544\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}/\\mathrm{eV}}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 0.1822605\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 0.1823\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe final numerical results, in the requested order (first $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, then $\\mathrm{eV}$) and rounded to four significant figures, are $1.470 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $0.1823\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.",

            "problem": "An absorption spectrum of an organic carbonyl chromophore exhibits a vibronic progression dominated by a single normal mode corresponding to the $\\text{C=O}$ stretch.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The provided physical parameters are realistic for a carbonyl chromophore. The question asks for a qualitative comparison between a displaced harmonic oscillator model and a displaced Morse oscillator model for describing a vibronic progression, which is a standard problem in molecular spectroscopy. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks how introducing Morse anharmonicity in the excited electronic state alters two key features of the vibronic absorption spectrum originating from the ground vibrational state $| v=0 \\rangle_g$: (1) the spacing between adjacent spectral bands and (2) the intensity distribution (envelope) of these bands. The comparison is made relative to a purely harmonic model for the excited state.\n\n**1. Analysis of Vibronic Band Spacing**\n\nThe energy of the vibronic transitions is given by the difference in energy between the final and initial states. The transition originates from the $v=0$ vibrational level of the ground electronic state, $E_g^0$. The final states are the $v'$ vibrational levels of the excited electronic state, $E_e^{v'}$. The energy of an observed band corresponding to the $v=0 \\rightarrow v'$ transition is $h\\nu = T_{00} + G(v')$, where $T_{00}$ is the energy of the $0-0$ transition and $G(v')$ is the vibrational term energy in the excited state, measured relative to the $v'=0$ level. The spacing between successive vibronic bands, corresponding to transitions to $v'$ and $v'+1$, is therefore $\\Delta E = G(v'+1) - G(v')$.\n\n*   **Harmonic Oscillator Model (Reference Case):** In the reference harmonic model, the excited-state vibrational term energies are given by $G(v') = \\omega_e' (v' + 1/2)$, where we use wavenumber units as is conventional ($\\omega_e'$ instead of $\\tilde{\\nu}_e'$ for simplicity). The spacing between adjacent levels is constant:\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = G(v'+1) - G(v') = \\omega_e'(v'+1 + 1/2) - \\omega_e'(v' + 1/2) = \\omega_e' $$\n    In the harmonic model, the spacing between successive vibronic bands is constant and equal to the vibrational frequency $\\omega_e'$ of the excited state (given as $\\omega_g = 1700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for the reference case).\n\n*   **Morse Oscillator Model:** For a Morse potential, the vibrational term energies are given by an expression that includes an anharmonicity correction:\n    $$ G(v') = \\omega_e'(v' + 1/2) - \\omega_e'x_e'(v' + 1/2)^2 $$\n    where $\\omega_e'$ is the harmonic frequency component and $x_e'$ is the anharmonicity constant. The problem gives $\\omega_e' = 1500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $x_e' = 0.02$. The spacing between adjacent levels is:\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = G(v'+1) - G(v') $$\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = \\left[ \\omega_e'(v'+1 + 1/2) - \\omega_e'x_e'(v'+1 + 1/2)^2 \\right] - \\left[ \\omega_e'(v' + 1/2) - \\omega_e'x_e'(v' + 1/2)^2 \\right] $$\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = \\omega_e' - \\omega_e'x_e' \\left[ (v' + 3/2)^2 - (v' + 1/2)^2 \\right] $$\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = \\omega_e' - \\omega_e'x_e' [ (v'^2 + 3v' + 9/4) - (v'^2 + v' + 1/4) ] $$\n    $$ \\Delta G(v') = \\omega_e' - \\omega_e'x_e' (2v' + 2) = \\omega_e'[1 - 2x_e'(v'+1)] $$\n    Since $x_e' = 0.02 > 0$, the term $2x_e'(v'+1)$ increases with increasing quantum number $v'$. Therefore, the spacing $\\Delta G(v')$ between successive vibrational levels **decreases** as $v'$ increases. The vibronic bands in the spectrum become closer together at higher energy.\n\nFurthermore, a Morse potential has a finite dissociation energy $D_e'$. It can only support a finite number of bound vibrational states. As the energy approaches $D_e'$, the spacing between levels approaches zero. Consequently, the vibronic progression must terminate, or merge into a continuum, as the dissociation limit is approached. This is in contrast to the harmonic oscillator, which has an infinite number of equally spaced levels.\n\n**2. Analysis of Intensity Distribution**\n\nThe intensity of a vibronic transition $v=0 \\to v'$ is proportional to the Franck-Condon Factor (FCF), defined as the square of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions:\n$$ \\mathrm{FCF}_{0,v'} = \\left| \\int \\psi_{v'}^{e*}(Q) \\psi_{v=0}^g(Q) \\,dQ \\right|^2 $$\nThe ground state vibrational wavefunction $\\psi_{v=0}^g(Q)$ is a Gaussian function, symmetric and centered at the equilibrium coordinate $Q_e^g$ (corresponding to bond length $r_e^g$). The excited state equilibrium coordinate is displaced to $Q_e^e$ (corresponding to $r_e' = r_e^g + \\Delta r$). The vertical transition, according to the Franck-Condon principle, projects the ground state wavefunction onto the potential energy surface of the excited state.\n\n*   **Harmonic Oscillator Model (Reference Case):** The excited state wavefunctions $\\psi_{v'}^e(Q)$ are also symmetric (products of Hermite polynomials and a Gaussian function), centered at $Q_e^e$. The FCF is maximal for the $v'$ level whose wavefunction has the largest amplitude in the region of $Q_e^g$. For large $v'$, the probability density $|\\psi_{v'}^e(Q)|^2$ has its largest lobes near the classical turning points, which are symmetric about $Q_e^e$.\n\n*   **Morse Oscillator Model:** The Morse potential is asymmetric. For a given displacement from equilibrium, the potential is steeper for compression ($r  r_e'$) than for extension ($r > r_e'$). This asymmetry profoundly affects the shape of the vibrational wavefunctions $\\psi_{v'}^e(Q)$. For any $v' > 0$, the wavefunction is no longer symmetric. The particle spends more time in the region where the potential is flatter (the outer part of the well, $r > r_e'$). Consequently, the probability density $|\\psi_{v'}^e(Q)|^2$ becomes skewed, with its amplitude increasingly concentrated towards the outer classical turning point as $v'$ increases.\n\nThe overlap integral is evaluated with the ground state wavefunction $\\psi_{v=0}^g$, which is tightly localized around $Q_e^g$. Since the excited state is displaced such that $Q_e^e > Q_e^g$, the region of significant overlap is on the inner side of the excited-state potential well (i.e., near the inner turning point for a given $v'$). Because the Morse wavefunctions shift their amplitude away from this inner region and towards the outer turning point, their overlap with $\\psi_{v=0}^g$ is reduced compared to the overlap with symmetric harmonic wavefunctions of a similar energy. This effect becomes more pronounced for higher $v'$. As a result, the FCFs for the Morse potential will decrease more rapidly with increasing $v'$ than they would in the harmonic case. This causes the overall intensity envelope of the vibronic progression to shift towards **lower** values of $v'$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The spacing between successive vibronic bands decreases as $v'$ increases, and the intensity envelope shifts to lower $v'$ relative to the harmonic displaced case because the anharmonic excited-state wavefunctions are asymmetric and increasingly localized toward the outer classical turning point, reducing overlaps at large $v'$; the progression is additionally truncated as the dissociation limit is approached.**\n-   *Spacing decreases*: Correct, as derived from the Morse energy level formula.\n-   *Intensity envelope shifts to lower $v'$*: Correct. The asymmetry of Morse wavefunctions reduces overlap with the ground state wavefunction, which is localized at a smaller internuclear distance.\n-   *Reason for intensity shift*: Correct. The skewing of the wavefunction probability density toward the outer turning point reduces overlap in the Franck-Condon region on the inner wall of the potential.\n-   *Progression is truncated*: Correct. The Morse potential has a dissociation limit and a finite number of bound states.\nThis option accurately describes all physical consequences of introducing Morse anharmonicity. Thus, option A is **Correct**.\n\n**B. The spacing between successive vibronic bands increases as $v'$ increases, and the intensity envelope shifts to higher $v'$ relative to the harmonic displaced case because the extended outer tail of the excited-state wavefunctions improves overlap at large $v'$; the progression can extend indefinitely.**\n-   *Spacing increases*: Incorrect. For a typical molecular potential represented by a Morse oscillator, the spacing decreases.\n-   *Intensity shifts to higher $v'$*: Incorrect. The shift is to lower $v'$. The reasoning is also flawed; the overlap region is not at the \"extended outer tail\".\n-   *Progression extends indefinitely*: Incorrect. The Morse potential leads to dissociation and truncation of the progression.\nThus, option B is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Anharmonicity in the excited-state potential does not affect Franck-Condon factors for a fixed $\\Delta r$; only Duschinsky rotation can modify intensities, and the peak spacing remains exactly constant across $v'$.**\n-   *Anharmonicity doesn't affect FCFs*: Incorrect. The shape of the potential determines the wavefunctions, which in turn determine the FCFs.\n-   *Only Duschinsky rotation modifies intensities*: Incorrect. The potential shape is a fundamental factor. The problem explicitly states to neglect Duschinsky rotation.\n-   *Peak spacing remains constant*: Incorrect. This is only true for a harmonic potential.\nThus, option C is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Introducing Morse anharmonicity preserves constant peak spacing but redistributes intensity strictly according to the same displacement parameter as in the harmonic case, because Franck-Condon factors depend only on geometry and not on the potential shape or anharmonicity.**\n-   *Preserves constant peak spacing*: Incorrect. This is the primary feature that anharmonicity changes.\n-   *FCFs depend only on geometry*: Incorrect. FCFs are integrals of wavefunctions. Wavefunctions are solutions to the Schrödinger equation, which explicitly includes the potential energy function $V(r)$. Therefore, FCFs are fundamentally dependent on the shape of the potential.\nThus, option D is **Incorrect**.",

For an emission transition from the ground vibrational level ($v'=0$) of an excited electronic state to a vibrational level $v$ of the ground electronic state, the FCF is given by $FCF_v = |\\langle \\psi'_{v'=0} | \\psi''_{v''=v} \\rangle|^2$.

The sum of all FCFs is normalized to unity: $\\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} FCF_v = 1$.\n\n2.  **Vibronic Line Positions**: The energy of a photon emitted in a $v'=0 \\to v''=v$ transition is determined by the electronic energy gap of the zero-phonon line ($0-0$ transition), $E_{00}$, and the vibrational energy quantum, $\\hbar\\omega$:\n    $$\n    E_v = E_{00} - v \\hbar \\omega\n    $$\n    where $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the vibrational quantum number in the ground electronic state.\n\n3.  **Spectral Broadening**: Each discrete vibronic transition is broadened into a continuous line shape. The problem specifies a Gaussian function, $G(E; E_v, \\sigma)$, centered at the transition energy $E_v$ with a standard deviation $\\sigma$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian is related to $\\sigma$ by:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln{2}} \\cdot \\sigma\n    $$\n    The problem requires that the integrated area of each Gaussian line be equal to its relative intensity. Therefore, we use the normalized Gaussian probability density function, scaled by the appropriate intensity weight:\n    $$\n    G(E; E_v, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(E-E_v)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Total Spectrum Construction**: The total emission spectrum, $I_{\\text{total}}(E)$, is the incoherent sum of contributions from both conformers (indexed by $i=1, 2$), weighted by their respective population fractions, $p_i$. The spectrum for each conformer is a sum over all its vibronic transitions.\n    $$\n    I_{\\text{total}}(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_i \\left( \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} FCF_v^{(i)} \\cdot G\\left(E; E_v^{(i)}, \\sigma\\right) \\right)\n    $$\n    where $FCF_v^{(i)}$ and $E_v^{(i)}$ are calculated using the conformer-specific parameters $S_i$ and $E_{00}^{(i)}$.\n\n5.  **Energy-Wavelength Conversion**: The sampling points are given in wavelengths $\\lambda$ (in $\\mathrm{nm}$), which must be converted to energy $E$ (in $\\mathrm{eV}$) for the calculation:\n    $$\n    E \\, (\\mathrm{eV}) = \\frac{hc}{e\\lambda} = \\frac{1239.84197386209 \\, \\mathrm{eV \\cdot nm}}{\\lambda \\, (\\mathrm{nm})}\n    $$\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Define the fixed physical constant for energy-wavelength conversion, $hc/e = 1239.84197386209 \\, \\mathrm{eV \\cdot nm}$, and the fixed system parameters: $S_1 = 0.6$, $S_2 = 1.2$, $p_1 = 0.7$, and $p_2 = 0.3$.\n\n2.  **Truncation of Vibrational Series**: The infinite sum over $v$ is truncated at a sufficiently large value, $v_{max}$. The terms $FCF_v$ decay rapidly for $v > S$. For the maximum Huang-Rhys factor in this problem, $S=1.2$, the intensity progression diminishes substantially for $v > 5$. A conservative choice of $v_{max}=15$ ensures that the cumulative omitted intensity is negligible (less than $10^{-9}$).\n\n3.  **Iteration over Test Cases**: For each test case provided:\n    a. Unpack the parameters: $E_{00}^{(1)}$, $E_{00}^{(2)}$, $\\hbar \\omega$, $\\mathrm{FWHM}$, and the list of sampling wavelengths $\\lambda_{\\text{sample}}$.\n    b. Convert $\\lambda_{\\text{sample}}$ to an array of sampling energies $E_{\\text{sample}}$.\n    c. Calculate the Gaussian standard deviation $\\sigma$ from the given $\\mathrm{FWHM}$.\n    d. Initialize an array for the total intensity at the sampling energies, $I_{\\text{total}}$, to zeros.\n    e. For each conformer ($i=1,2$):\n        i. Create an array of vibrational quantum numbers $v$ from $0$ to $v_{max}$.\n        ii. Calculate the array of vibronic line positions $E_v^{(i)} = E_{00}^{(i)} - v \\hbar \\omega$.\n        iii. Calculate the array of Franck-Condon factors $FCF_v^{(i)} = \\frac{(S_i)^v e^{-S_i}}{v!}$.\n        iv. Using NumPy broadcasting for efficiency, compute the Gaussian contribution of each vibronic line at each sampling energy and multiply by the corresponding scaled intensity weight $p_i \\cdot FCF_v^{(i)}$.\n        v. Sum the contributions from all vibronic lines for the current conformer and add them to the $I_{\\text{total}}$ array.\n    f. After processing both conformers, round the values in $I_{\\text{total}}$ to six decimal places.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The list of rounded intensities for each test case is collected. The final output is a single string representing a list of these lists, with no spaces, conforming to the specified format `[[...],[...],[...]]`.\n\nThis principled approach ensures a physically accurate and computationally efficient simulation of the vibronic emission spectrum as specified.",
