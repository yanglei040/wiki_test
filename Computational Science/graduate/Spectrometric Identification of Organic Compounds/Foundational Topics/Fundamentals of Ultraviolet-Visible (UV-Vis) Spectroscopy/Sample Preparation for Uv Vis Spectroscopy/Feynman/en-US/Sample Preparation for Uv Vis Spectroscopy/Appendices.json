            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of analytical chemistry, namely the Beer-Lambert law and the principle of conservation of mass during dilution. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are consistent and physically realistic. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution requires a two-step process for each standard. First, the Beer-Lambert law is used to determine the required final concentration ($C_{\\text{final}}$) of the dye in the standard to achieve a target absorbance ($A$). Second, the dilution equation ($C_1V_1 = C_2V_2$) is used to calculate the volume of the stock solution ($V_{\\text{stock}}$) needed to prepare the final volume ($V_{\\text{final}}$) of the standard at that concentration.\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law is given by:\n$$A = \\epsilon l C$$\nwhere $A$ is the absorbance (dimensionless), $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity in $\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$, $l$ is the path length of the cuvette in $\\mathrm{cm}$, and $C$ is the molar concentration of the absorbing species in $\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFrom this law, we can solve for the required final concentration, $C_{\\text{final}}$, for each standard:\n$$C_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\n\nThe dilution process is governed by the conservation of the amount of solute (moles). The moles of solute taken from the stock solution must equal the moles of solute in the final diluted standard. This is expressed by the dilution equation:\n$$C_{\\text{stock}} V_{\\text{stock}} = C_{\\text{final}} V_{\\text{final}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{stock}}$ and $V_{\\text{stock}}$ are the concentration and volume of the stock solution, and $C_{\\text{final}}$ and $V_{\\text{final}}$ are the concentration and volume of the final standard.\n\nWe can solve for the required volume of the stock solution, $V_{\\text{stock}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{stock}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{final}} V_{\\text{final}}}{C_{\\text{stock}}}$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $C_{\\text{final}}$ from the Beer-Lambert law into the dilution equation, we derive a single comprehensive formula for $V_{\\text{stock}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{stock}} = \\left( \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l} \\right) \\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{C_{\\text{stock}}} = \\frac{A \\cdot V_{\\text{final}}}{\\epsilon \\cdot l \\cdot C_{\\text{stock}}}$$\n\nBefore calculation, we must ensure all units are consistent.

To obtain the final volume in $\\mathrm{mL}$, as requested, we will use $V_{\\text{final}}$ in $\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V_{\\text{stock}} = \\frac{A \\cdot (10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL})}{(2.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\cdot (1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\cdot (1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M})}$$\nThe denominator simplifies to:\n$$(2.5 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (1.00) \\cdot (1.00 \\times 10^{-2}) = 25$$\nThe units in the denominator cancel out: $\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,cm^{-1} \\cdot cm \\cdot M = 1}$.\nThus, the relationship between the stock volume and absorbance is:\n$$V_{\\text{stock}} (\\mathrm{mL}) = \\frac{A \\cdot 10.00}{25} = 0.400 \\cdot A$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the specific volume of stock solution required for each of the three standards.

In order to minimize spectral interference from the neutral phenol and exploit the stronger absorption of the phenolate at $280$ nm, the sample should be adjusted so that at least $0.97$ of the total analytical concentration is present as the phenolate. The compound has acid dissociation constant $pK_{a} = 10.0$.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is central to this problem, is derived directly from the definition of the acid dissociation constant. The premise that a phenolate anion absorbs more strongly at a higher wavelength (bathochromic shift) than its corresponding neutral phenol is a well-established phenomenon. The given $pK_{a}$ of $10.0$ is a typical value for a phenol. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and constraints provided for a unique solution. The language is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires deriving the relationship for the buffer $pH$ from first principles.\n\nLet the aromatic phenolic analyte be represented as a generic Brønsted–Lowry acid, $HA$. Its dissociation in water is described by the equilibrium:\n$$HA + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + H_3O^{+}$$\nwhere $A^{-}$ is the conjugate base (the phenolate anion).\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, is defined by the law of mass action. Assuming activity coefficients are unity, we can use molar concentrations:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[A^{-}][H_3O^{+}]}{[HA]}$$\n\nTo derive the required relationship, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}][H_3O^{+}]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$, we can separate the terms:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right) + \\log_{10}([H_3O^{+}])$$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by $-1$:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right) - \\log_{10}([H_3O^{+}])$$\n\nThe problem specifies using the definitions $pH = -\\log_{10}([H_3O^{+}])$ and $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Substituting these definitions into the equation yields:\n$$pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right) + pH$$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for $pH$ gives the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is the relationship needed to determine the buffer $pH$:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we compute the two required values.\n\nThe mole fraction of the phenolate, $\\alpha_{A^{-}}$, is defined as the concentration of the phenolate divided by the total analytical concentration of the analyte, $C_{T} = [HA] + [A^{-}]$.\n$$\\alpha_{A^{-}} = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$$\nThe problem specifies that this fraction must be $0.97$.\n$$\\alpha_{A^{-}} = 0.97$$\nSince the total concentration is conserved, the mole fraction of the acidic form, $\\alpha_{HA}$, must be:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = 1 - \\alpha_{A^{-}} = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$$\nThe required concentration ratio, $[A^{-}] / [HA]$, can now be calculated from the mole fractions:\n$$\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A^{-}} \\cdot C_{T}}{\\alpha_{HA} \\cdot C_{T}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A^{-}}}{\\alpha_{HA}}$$\n$$\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{0.97}{0.03} \\approx 32.333\\dots$$\nRounding this ratio to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 32.3$$\n\nNow, we use this ratio and the given $pK_{a}$ in the derived Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the required buffer $pH$:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\n$$pH = 10.0 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.97}{0.03}\\right)$$\n$$pH = 10.0 + \\log_{10}(32.333...)$$\n$$pH = 10.0 + 1.50965...$$\n$$pH = 11.50965...$$\nRounding the final $pH$ value to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$pH = 11.5$$\n\nThus, the buffer must be adjusted to a $pH$ of $11.5$ to ensure that $97\\%$ of the analyte is in the phenolate form, which corresponds to a conjugate base to conjugate acid ratio of $32.3$.",

Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the combined standard uncertainty, $u_c$, of the original sample concentration, $c$. The model relating $c$ to the measured quantities is given by the combination of the calibration model and the dilution equation.\n\nFirst, the concentration of the diluted solution, which we denote as $c_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is determined from the linear calibration model $A = a + b c_{\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{A - a}{b}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the measured absorbance, and $a$ and $b$ are the intercept and slope from the calibration, respectively.\n\nSecond, the concentration of the original, undiluted sample, $c$, is related to $c_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ by the dilution factor:\n$$\nc = c_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_t}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $V_t$ is the volume of the original sample transferred (aliquot) and $V_f$ is the final volume after dilution.\n\nCombining these two expressions gives the full model for the original sample concentration $c$ as a function of the five input quantities $A$, $a$, $b$, $V_f$, and $V_t$:\n$$\nc = c(A, a, b, V_f, V_t) = \\left(\\frac{A - a}{b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_t}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo find the combined standard uncertainty $u_c$, we apply the general law of propagation of uncertainty for a function $y = f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N)$:\n$$\nu_y^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\right)^2 u_{x_i}^2 + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} \\mathrm{cov}(x_i, x_j)\n$$\nIn this case, the function is $c$ and the variables are $A$, $a$, $b$, $V_f$, and $V_t$.
