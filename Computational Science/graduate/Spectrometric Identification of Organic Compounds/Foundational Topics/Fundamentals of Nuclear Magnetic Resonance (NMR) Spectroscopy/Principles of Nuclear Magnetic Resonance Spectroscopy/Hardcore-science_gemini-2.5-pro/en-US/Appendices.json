However, the underlying physical phenomenon is a frequency offset ($\\Delta\\nu$) that is directly proportional to the spectrometer's magnetic field strength. This exercise provides essential practice in converting between the practical ppm scale and the fundamental frequency scale in Hertz, reinforcing your understanding of why higher field instruments provide greater spectral dispersion and resolution.

            "problem": "In proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for organic structure identification, the chemical shift scale is reported in parts per million relative to a reference such as tetramethylsilane (TMS). Consider a proton resonance appearing at a chemical shift of $\\delta = 7.26\\,\\text{ppm}$ relative to TMS. A $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spectrum is acquired at two different magnet fields such that the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ observation frequencies are $\\nu_{0} = 400.0\\,\\text{MHz}$ and $\\nu_{0} = 600.0\\,\\text{MHz}$, respectively.\n\nUsing only the core definition that chemical shift is the dimensionless fractional frequency difference between a resonance and the reference, scaled by a factor of $10^{6}$ to yield parts per million, determine the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ (in $\\text{Hz}$) of the $\\delta = 7.26\\,\\text{ppm}$ resonance relative to TMS for each spectrometer. Then, briefly justify how the offset scales with the observation frequency and reconcile this with the conventional chemical shift axis convention used in NMR plots.\n\nReport your two numerical offsets for $\\nu_{0} = 400.0\\,\\text{MHz}$ and $\\nu_{0} = 600.0\\,\\text{MHz}$, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, well-posed with all necessary data, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe chemical shift, $\\delta$, is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the frequency difference between the signal of a sample proton ($\\nu$) and a reference proton ($\\nu_{\\text{ref}}$) to the operating frequency of the spectrometer ($\\nu_0$), scaled by a factor of $10^6$. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThe quantity $\\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}$ is the absolute frequency offset, denoted as $\\Delta \\nu$. The units of $\\delta$ are parts per million (ppm). The frequencies $\\nu$, $\\nu_{\\text{ref}}$, and $\\nu_0$ must have consistent units. Conventionally, $\\Delta \\nu$ is given in Hertz ($\\text{Hz}$) and $\\nu_0$ is given in Megahertz ($\\text{MHz}$).\n\nTo find the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\text{Hz}$, we rearrange the definition:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = \\delta \\times \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nTo ensure correct unit conversion, let $\\nu_0$ be expressed in $\\text{Hz}$. Since $1\\,\\text{MHz} = 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}$, the spectrometer frequency in $\\text{Hz}$ is $\\nu_0 \\text{ [MHz]} \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz/MHz}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\Delta \\nu$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu \\text{ [Hz]} = \\delta \\text{ [ppm]} \\times (\\nu_0 \\text{ [MHz]} \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz/MHz}) \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nThe factors of $10^6$ and $10^{-6}$ cancel, yielding a direct relationship:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu \\text{ [Hz]} = \\delta \\text{ [ppm]} \\times \\nu_0 \\text{ [MHz]}\n$$\nWe are given a chemical shift $\\delta = 7.26\\,\\text{ppm}$ and two spectrometer frequencies.\n\nCase 1: Spectrometer with $\\nu_{0,1} = 400.0\\,\\text{MHz}$\nThe frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu_1$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu_1 = 7.26 \\times 400.0 = 2904.0\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to the requested four significant figures, the offset is $2904\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\nCase 2: Spectrometer with $\\nu_{0,2} = 600.0\\,\\text{MHz}$\nThe frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu_2$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu_2 = 7.26 \\times 600.0 = 4356.0\\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to the requested four significant figures, the offset is $4356\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\nThe sign convention specifies $\\Delta \\nu \\equiv \\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}$ as positive for resonances at higher frequency than the reference. Since the given chemical shift $\\delta = 7.26$ is positive, our calculated frequency offsets are correctly positive, indicating that the proton resonance is downfield (at a higher frequency) from the TMS reference.\n\nJustification of scaling and reconciliation with the $\\delta$ axis:\nThe relationship $\\Delta \\nu = \\delta \\times \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6}$ demonstrates that for a nucleus with a constant chemical shift $\\delta$, the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ is directly proportional to the spectrometer's observation frequency $\\nu_0$. This physical phenomenon is fundamental to NMR. The observed frequency shift arises from the shielding of the nucleus by its local electronic environment, which slightly modifies the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus. This modification is proportional to the strength of the external applied magnetic field, $B_0$. Since the spectrometer's operating frequency is also directly proportional to the magnetic field strength ($\\nu_0 \\propto B_0$, from the Larmor equation), the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ is consequently proportional to $\\nu_0$. Thus, operating at a higher field (and higher $\\nu_0$) increases the frequency separation in $\\text{Hz}$ between different resonances, leading to better spectral dispersion and resolution.\n\nThe conventional chemical shift axis in ppm ($\\delta$) is designed to be independent of the magnetic field strength. By defining $\\delta$ as the ratio of the frequency offset to the spectrometer frequency, $\\delta = (\\Delta \\nu / \\nu_0) \\times 10^6$, the dependence on $\\nu_0$ is canceled out. As shown, since $\\Delta \\nu$ is proportional to $\\nu_0$, the ratio $\\Delta \\nu / \\nu_0$ remains constant for a given proton across spectrometers of different field strengths. This normalization allows for the creation of standardized libraries of chemical shifts and enables direct comparison of spectra acquired on different instruments. The use of the $\\delta$ scale renders spectral data independent of the specific hardware used for its acquisition.",

            "introduction": "A proton's chemical shift is not an intrinsic, immutable property; it is exquisitely sensitive to its immediate chemical environment. This sensitivity is a powerful tool for probing molecular structure and intermolecular interactions. This thought experiment explores how changing the solvent can dramatically alter a proton's resonance position by affecting its electronic shielding, specifically through the formation of hydrogen bonds. By predicting the effect of switching from a non-polar solvent to a polar, hydrogen-bond-accepting solvent, you will strengthen your ability to connect spectral changes to underlying chemical principles.

A sample of pyrrole is dissolved in deuterated chloroform ($\\mathrm{CDCl_3}$), and its proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR) spectrum is recorded. Subsequently, the chemist prepares a new sample by dissolving pyrrole in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide ($\\mathrm{DMSO-d_6}$) and records another $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, consider that $\\mathrm{CDCl_3}$ is a relatively non-polar solvent and a poor hydrogen bond acceptor.

            "solution": "We analyze how the chemical shift of an $\\mathrm{N-H}$ proton depends on its electronic shielding and how this shielding is affected by solvent-induced hydrogen bonding.\n\nFirst, the resonance frequency of a proton in NMR is given by\n$$\n\\nu=\\frac{\\gamma B_{0}}{2\\pi}(1-\\sigma),\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $B_{0}$ is the external magnetic field, and $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant at the nucleus.

In a poor hydrogen bond accepting, relatively non-polar solvent such as $\\mathrm{CDCl_{3}}$, the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ proton of pyrrole experiences less hydrogen bonding, leading to relatively greater local electron density and larger $\\sigma$ (more shielding). In a strong hydrogen bond accepting, highly polar aprotic solvent such as $\\mathrm{DMSO-d_{6}}$, the oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ proton of pyrrole. Hydrogen bonding withdraws electron density from the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ bond and from the vicinity of the proton, decreasing $\\sigma$ (deshielding). By the relation above, decreased $\\sigma$ yields increased $\\nu$ and thus an increased $\\delta$, i.e., a downfield shift.\n\nConsidering the answer choices:\n- A downfield shift (higher ppm) follows directly from hydrogen-bond-induced deshielding in $\\mathrm{DMSO-d_{6}}$ compared to $\\mathrm{CDCl_{3}}$.\n- An upfield shift is inconsistent with the effect of stronger hydrogen bonding.\n- No significant change is unlikely because the difference in hydrogen bonding strength between $\\mathrm{CDCl_{3}}$ and $\\mathrm{DMSO-d_{6}}$ is substantial.\n- Disappearance of the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ peak would require rapid exchange or chemical transformation; $\\mathrm{DMSO-d_{6}}$ is not strongly acidic or basic and does not inherently remove the $\\mathrm{N-H}$ signal.\n- A change from singlet to triplet would require resolved scalar coupling; $\\mathrm{N-H}$ protons typically undergo exchange that broadens or simplifies coupling, and hydrogen bonding changes position more than multiplicity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely change is a significant downfield shift when moving from $\\mathrm{CDCl_{3}}$ to $\\mathrm{DMSO-d_{6}}$.",

            "problem": "A sample of an organic compound is analyzed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR). The compound has three distinct proton environments in the undeuterated (all-protium) structure: an aromatic system with $n_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=4$ equivalent protons, a methyl group with $n_{\\mathrm{Me}}=3$ protons, and a benzylic methylene with $n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=2$ protons. During synthesis, selective deuteration of the benzylic methylene occurs: each benzylic site is independently deuterated with per-site probability $p$, and no deuteration occurs at the aromatic or methyl positions. Assume uniform excitation and relaxation so that the integrated area of each $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal is directly proportional to the ensemble-averaged number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei contributing to that signal. Deuterium ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$) does not contribute to the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR integral. The $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum, normalized so that the aromatic signal integrates to $I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=4.00$, shows $I_{\\mathrm{Me}}=3.00$ for the methyl signal and $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$ for the benzylic methylene signal.\n\nBased on fundamental definitions of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signal integration as proportional to the number of resonant $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spins and treating the sample as an ensemble with independent per-site deuteration, which option correctly explains how deuteration at the benzylic positions reduces the observed $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integrals, determines $p$, and specifies how to adjust the total proton count per molecule to recover the underlying all-protium count?\n\nA. The expected $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count for a site with $n$ equivalent positions under independent per-site deuteration is $n(1-p)$. For the benzylic methylene with $n=2$, the observed $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$ implies $2(1-p)=1.20$, so $p=0.40$. The adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count per molecule is obtained by adding back the expected number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei replaced by deuterium at the methylene, which is $2p=0.80$, to the observed total $4.00+3.00+1.20=8.20$, giving $9.00$.\n\nB. Deuteration reduces all $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integrals uniformly by the same factor $(1-p)$ across the spectrum; thus $p$ is found by dividing the observed methylene integral by the sum of all integrals to get $p=1-(1.20/9.20)$, and the adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count is the observed total $9.20$ divided by $(1-p)$.\n\nC.

Because deuterium ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$) is spin-$1$, its quadrupolar relaxation partially contributes to the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integral near the methylene frequency, so the observed $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$ must be corrected by subtracting a deuterium contribution estimated as $p$, yielding $p=0.20$, and the adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count is $9.20+(p)=9.40$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n\nThe core principles for solving this problem are derived from the fundamentals of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and basic probability theory.\n$1$. The integrated signal area in a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum is directly proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that signal. The problem states this and provides data to establish a normalization factor. For the aromatic protons, $n_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=4$ and the integral $I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=4.00$. For the methyl protons, which are not deuterated, $n_{\\mathrm{Me}}=3$ and the integral $I_{\\mathrm{Me}}=3.00$. This confirms that the normalization constant is $1$, so the integral values are numerically equal to the ensemble-averaged number of protons.\n\n$2$. The benzylic methylene group has $n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=2$ equivalent proton sites in the all-protium molecule. Each site is independently deuterated with a per-site probability $p$. The probability that a site remains as a proton ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) is therefore $(1-p)$.\n\n$3$. According to the principle of linearity of expectation, the expected number of protons, $\\langle N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle$, at a site with $n$ equivalent positions is the sum of the probabilities of each position being a proton. Thus, for the methylene group, the expected number of protons is $\\langle N_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} \\rangle = (1-p) + (1-p) = 2(1-p)$. More generally, for $n$ such sites, the expected count is $n(1-p)$.\n\n$4$. The observed integral $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$ is equal to this expected number of protons:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = 2(1-p) = 1.20$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$1-p = \\frac{1.20}{2} = 0.60$$\n$$p = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\nThe per-site probability of deuteration is $p=0.40$.\n\n$5$. To recover the total proton count of the underlying all-protium structure, one must add the \"missing\" protons back to the total observed integral. The number of missing protons is the expected number of deuterons at the deuterated site. This can be calculated in two ways:\n(a) The difference between the original number of protons and the observed average number: $n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} - I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = 2 - 1.20 = 0.80$.\n(b) The original number of sites multiplied by the probability of deuteration: $n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} \\times p = 2 \\times 0.40 = 0.80$.\nThe sum of the integrals for the *explicitly mentioned signals* is $I_{total, obs} = I_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + I_{\\mathrm{Me}} + I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = 4.00 + 3.00 + 1.20 = 8.20$.\nThe original count for these three environments is $n_{total} = n_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + n_{\\mathrm{Me}} + n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9$.\nThe correct adjustment is $I_{total, obs} + 2p = 8.20 + 0.80 = 9.00$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. This option correctly states the statistical model for the effect of deuteration on the integral, where the expected number of protons is $n(1-p)$. It uses this model with the provided data ($I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$, $n=2$) to correctly calculate the per-site deuteration probability as $p=0.40$. It then correctly determines the adjustment required to recover the all-protium count by adding back the expected number of deuterated sites ($2p = 0.80$) to the total observed integral ($4.00+3.00+1.20=8.20$), yielding the correct original proton count of $9.00$. The physical reasoning and calculations are all correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Deuteration reduces all $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integrals uniformly by the same factor $(1-p)$ across the spectrum; thus $p$ is found by dividing the observed methylene integral by the sum of all integrals to get $p=1-(1.20/9.20)$, and the adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count is the observed total $9.20$ divided by $(1-p)$.\nThis is incorrect. The problem states deuteration is selective to the benzylic methylene position. The integrals for the aromatic and methyl groups are not reduced, as confirmed by comparing their integral values to their proton counts ($I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}/n_{\\mathrm{Ar}} = 4/4=1$; $I_{\\mathrm{Me}}/n_{\\mathrm{Me}} = 3/3=1$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Selective monodeuteration at the methylene guarantees exactly one deuterium per molecule at that position when deuteration occurs, so the expected $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count there is $2-f$, where $f$ is the fraction of molecules with one deuterium. With $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$, $f=0.80$. The adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count is obtained by adding $f$ to the observed total to account for the removed $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, giving $9.20+0.80=10.00$.\nThis is incorrect. It misrepresents the deuteration process. \"Independent per-site deuteration\" implies a binomial distribution of $0$, $1$, or $2$ deuterons, not a guaranteed \"monodeuteration\" event. The proposed model and the value of $f$ are inconsistent with the problem description.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Because deuterium ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$) is spin-$1$, its quadrupolar relaxation partially contributes to the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integral near the methylene frequency, so the observed $I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=1.20$ must be corrected by subtracting a deuterium contribution estimated as $p$, yielding $p=0.20$, and the adjusted total $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ count is $9.20+(p)=9.40$.\nThis is incorrect. This statement contradicts fundamental principles of NMR. The resonance frequency of $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ is vastly different from $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, and its signal does not contribute to the integral of a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum. The problem statement itself confirms this.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
