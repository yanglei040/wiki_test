            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution based on fundamental principles of nuclear magnetism.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the Larmor frequency equation from fundamental principles, and second, the calculation of specific Larmor frequencies for protium (${}^{1}\\text{H}$) and carbon-13 (${}^{13}\\text{C}$) nuclei in a given magnetic field.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Larmor Frequency**\n\nWe begin by considering a nucleus with a non-zero spin, which possesses a a magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ and a spin angular momentum $\\vec{L}$. As stated in the problem, these two vector quantities are directly proportional, related by the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{L}\n$$\nWhen this magnetic dipole is placed in an external static magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{0}$, it experiences a torque, $\\vec{\\tau}$, given by the cross product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field vector:\n$$\n\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nAccording to classical mechanics, the torque exerted on a body is equal to the time rate of change of its angular momentum:\n$$\n\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions for the torque, we obtain the equation of motion for the angular momentum vector in the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{L}$ into this equation of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = (\\gamma \\vec{L}) \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nSince the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ is a scalar quantity, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}_{0})\n$$\nThis differential equation describes the motion of the angular momentum vector $\\vec{L}$. The vector derivative $d\\vec{L}/dt$ is perpendicular to both $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{B}_{0}$, which implies that the magnitude of $\\vec{L}$ and its component along $\\vec{B}_{0}$ are constant. The vector $\\vec{L}$ therefore rotates, or precesses, around the axis defined by the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{0}$.\n\nTo find the frequency of this precession, we compare this equation to the general equation for a vector $\\vec{A}$ precessing with an angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{A}}{dt} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{A}\n$$\nTo match this form, we use the anti-commutative property of the cross product, $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = -(\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a})$, on our equation of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = -\\gamma (\\vec{B}_{0} \\times \\vec{L})\n$$\nBy direct comparison with the general precession equation, we can identify the angular velocity vector of precession, $\\vec{\\omega}_{0}$, as:\n$$\n\\vec{\\omega}_{0} = -\\gamma \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nThis vector is known as the Larmor frequency vector. The magnitude of the angular precession frequency, $\\omega_{0}$, is the magnitude of this vector.

            "solution": "The problem will be addressed in two parts as per the instructions. First, the conventional expression for chemical shift $ \\delta $ in parts per million (ppm) will be derived from the provided fundamental relations. Second, the value of $ \\delta $ will be computed for the specific case given.\n\nThe validation steps confirm that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All provided relations and data are consistent with the established principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Chemical Shift Expression\n\nThe resonance frequency $ \\nu $ of a nucleus in an NMR experiment is given by the Larmor equation:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{loc}} $$\nwhere $ \\gamma $ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $ B_{\\mathrm{loc}} $ is the local magnetic field experienced by the nucleus.\n\nIn a molecule, the nucleus is shielded from the externally applied magnetic field $ B_{0} $ by the surrounding electron cloud. This diamagnetic shielding is quantified by the shielding constant $ \\sigma $. The local field is thus:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{loc}} = (1 - \\sigma) B_{0} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the Larmor equation gives the resonance frequency for a specific nucleus:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (1 - \\sigma) B_{0} $$\n\nLet us denote the resonance frequency and shielding constant for a sample nucleus as $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} $ and $ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}} $, respectively.\n$$ \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}) B_{0} $$\n\nSimilarly, for a reference nucleus (e.g., from tetramethylsilane, TMS), we have:\n$$ \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}) B_{0} $$\n\nThe chemical shift, $ \\delta $, is defined as a dimensionless measure of the resonance frequency offset of the sample relative to the reference. The absolute frequency offset, $ \\Delta\\nu $, is the difference between the sample and reference frequencies:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}) B_{0} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}) B_{0} \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\frac{\\gamma B_{0}}{2\\pi} \\left( (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}) - (1 - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\frac{\\gamma B_{0}}{2\\pi} (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}) $$\n\nThis frequency offset $ \\Delta\\nu $ is directly proportional to the applied magnetic field $ B_{0} $. To create a field-independent (and thus instrument-independent) measure, the offset is normalized by dividing it by a reference frequency. The standard convention is to use the spectrometer's operating frequency, $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}} $, for this normalization. The spectrometer frequency is the frequency corresponding to the reference compound, so $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} $.\n\nThe dimensionless chemical shift $ \\delta $ is therefore:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}}} $$\n\nSince shielding constants $ \\sigma $ are very small (typically in the range of $ 10^{-6} $), the resulting $ \\delta $ value is also very small. For convenience, it is multiplied by $ 10^6 $ and reported in units of parts per million (ppm).\n\nThus, the conventional expression used by spectroscopists is:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{ppm}} = \\left( \\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}}} \\right) \\times 10^6 $$\nwhere $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} $, $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} $, and $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}} $ are all expressed in the same units (typically $ \\mathrm{Hz} $ or $ \\mathrm{MHz} $).\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Chemical Shift\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Resonance frequency of the sample, $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} = 500.100\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $\n- Spectrometer frequency, $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{spectrometer}} = 500.000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $\n- The reference (TMS) resonance is taken to be at the spectrometer frequency, so $ \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 500.000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $.\n\nFirst, we calculate the frequency offset $ \\Delta\\nu $:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{\\mathrm{sample}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 500.100\\,\\mathrm{MHz} - 500.000\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $$\nThe subtraction of two numbers with three decimal places results in a number with three decimal places. The value $ 0.100\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $ therefore has three significant figures.\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $ \\delta $ in ppm:\n$$ \\delta = \\left( \\frac{0.100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}}{500.000\\,\\mathrm{MHz}} \\right) \\times 10^6 $$\nThe units of $ \\mathrm{MHz} $ cancel out, yielding a dimensionless ratio as required.\n$$ \\delta = \\left( \\frac{0.100}{500.000} \\right) \\times 10^6 $$\n$$ \\delta = 0.000200 \\times 10^6 $$\n$$ \\delta = 200 $$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The numerator, $ 0.100 $, has three significant figures. The denominator, $ 500.000 $, has six significant figures. The result of the division and multiplication should be reported with the least number of significant figures from the values used in the calculation, which is three.\n\nThe calculated value is $ 200 $. To express this value with three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $ 2.00 \\times 10^2 $.",

The total spin Hamiltonian for the system includes the Zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field $B_0$ and the scalar coupling between the spins. Under the high-field condition ($\\Delta\\nu \\gg J$), we can use a first-order perturbation approach where we only consider the secular part of the coupling Hamiltonian.\n\nThe scalar coupling Hamiltonian is given by $\\hat{H}_{J} = h J \\hat{\\mathbf{I}} \\cdot (\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_1 + \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_2)$. The high-field secular approximation retains only the terms that commute with the main Zeeman Hamiltonian, which is dominated by the $z$-components of the spin operators. Thus, the effective coupling Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{J,\\text{secular}} \\approx h J \\hat{I}_z (\\hat{S}_{1z} + \\hat{S}_{2z}) = h J \\hat{I}_z \\hat{S}_{z,\\text{total}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{S}_{z,\\text{total}} = \\hat{S}_{1z} + \\hat{S}_{2z}$ is the operator for the total $z$-component of the spin angular momentum of the two neighboring nuclei.\n\nThe energy of the system for a given spin state is determined by the main Zeeman Hamiltonian and the first-order energy correction from the coupling Hamiltonian. The energy correction $\\Delta E_J$ for a state $|m_I, m_{S_1}, m_{S_2}\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $\\hat{H}_{J,\\text{secular}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_J = \\langle m_I, m_{S_1}, m_{S_2} | h J \\hat{I}_z (\\hat{S}_{1z} + \\hat{S}_{2z}) | m_I, m_{S_1}, m_{S_2} \\rangle = h J m_I (m_{S_1} + m_{S_2})\n$$\nHere, $m_I$ is the magnetic quantum number of the observed spin $I$ ($m_I = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$), and $m_{S_1}$, $m_{S_2}$ are the magnetic quantum numbers of the neighboring spins $S_1$ and $S_2$ (each $\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$). Let $m_{S,\\text{total}} = m_{S_1} + m_{S_2}$.\n\nThe energy of an NMR transition for the observed nucleus $I$ corresponds to a change in its spin state ($\\Delta m_I = \\pm 1$) while the spin states of the neighboring nuclei remain unchanged ($\\Delta m_{S,\\text{total}} = 0$). The energy of the absorbed photon for the $\\Delta m_I = +1$ transition (from $m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$ to $m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$) is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = (E_{Z}(m_I=+\\tfrac{1}{2}) + \\Delta E_J(m_I=+\\tfrac{1}{2})) - (E_{Z}(m_I=-\\tfrac{1}{2}) + \\Delta E_J(m_I=-\\tfrac{1}{2}))\n$$\nThe Zeeman energy difference is $E_{Z}(+\\frac{1}{2}) - E_{Z}(-\\frac{1}{2}) = h\\nu_I$, where $\\nu_I$ is the Larmor frequency of the uncoupled nucleus $I$. The difference in the coupling energy correction is:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\Delta E_J) = h J (+\\tfrac{1}{2}) m_{S,\\text{total}} - h J (-\\tfrac{1}{2}) m_{S,\\text{total}} = h J m_{S,\\text{total}}\n$$\nSo, the total transition energy is $\\Delta E = h\\nu_I + h J m_{S,\\text{total}}$. The transition frequency $\\nu_{\\text{trans}}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\nu_I + J m_{S,\\text{total}}\n$$\n\nTo find the observed multiplet structure, we must consider all possible values of $m_{S,\\text{total}}$ for the two equivalent neighboring spins $S_1$ and $S_2$.\nThe possible spin combinations for the two neighbors are:\n1.  Both spins up: $|\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\rangle$. Here, $m_{S_1}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ and $m_{S_2}=+\\frac{1}{2}$, so $m_{S,\\text{total}} = +\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = +1$.\n2.  One spin up, one down: $|\\alpha_1\\beta_2\\rangle$ and $|\\beta_1\\alpha_2\\rangle$. Since the nuclei are equivalent, these states are degenerate. For both, $m_{S,\\text{total}} = +\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\n3.  Both spins down: $|\\beta_1\\beta_2\\rangle$. Here, $m_{S_1}=-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $m_{S_2}=-\\frac{1}{2}$, so $m_{S,\\text{total}} = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = -1$.\n\nThe set of possible values for $m_{S,\\text{total}}$ is $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$. Substituting these values into the expression for the transition frequency gives the set of frequencies for the multiplet:\n-   For $m_{S,\\text{total}} = +1$: $\\nu_1 = \\nu_I + J$.\n-   For $m_{S,\\text{total}} = 0$: $\\nu_2 = \\nu_I$.\n-   For $m_{S,\\text{total}} = -1$: $\\nu_3 = \\nu_I - J$.\n\nThe set of transition frequencies relative to the uncoupled resonance $\\nu_I$ is found by calculating $\\nu_{\\text{trans}} - \\nu_I = J m_{S,\\text{total}}$. This gives the set of frequencies $\\{-J, 0, +J\\}$.\n\nThe multiplicity of the pattern is the number of distinct lines, which is $3$. This pattern is called a triplet.\n\nThe relative intensities of the lines are proportional to the number of ways each value of $m_{S,\\text{total}}$ can be realized, which is the statistical weight or degeneracy of each state.\n-   $m_{S,\\text{total}} = +1$ (state $|\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\rangle$): Degeneracy = $1$.\n-   $m_{S,\\text{total}} = 0$ (states $|\\alpha_1\\beta_2\\rangle, |\\beta_1\\alpha_2\\rangle$): Degeneracy = $2$.\n-   $m_{S,\\text{total}} = -1$ (state $|\\beta_1\\beta_2\\rangle$): Degeneracy = $1$.\nTherefore, the relative intensities of the lines at frequencies $\\nu_I - J$, $\\nu_I$, and $\\nu_I + J$ are in the ratio $1:2:1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the overall frequency spread, defined as the difference between the outermost lines. The outermost lines are at frequencies $\\nu_I + J$ and $\\nu_I - J$.\n$$\n\\text{Spread} = (\\nu_I + J) - (\\nu_I - J) = 2J\n$$\nGiven the value of the coupling constant $J = 7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the spread is:\n$$\n\\text{Spread} = 2 \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 14\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
