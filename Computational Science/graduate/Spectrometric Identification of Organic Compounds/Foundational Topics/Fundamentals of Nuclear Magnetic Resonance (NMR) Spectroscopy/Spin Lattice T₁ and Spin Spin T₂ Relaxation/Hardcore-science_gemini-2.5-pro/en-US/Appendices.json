Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires two sets of calculations for each of the five resonances: the spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_1$, and the minimal recycle delay, $\\tau$, for $95\\%$ recovery.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Spin-Lattice Relaxation Times, $T_1$**\n\nThe spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_1$, is by definition the inverse of the longitudinal relaxation rate, $R_1$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ T_1 = \\frac{1}{R_1} $$\nFor each resonance, we calculate the corresponding $T_1$ value.\n\n- Resonance $\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{1}{1.25\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n- Resonance $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{1}{0.70\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.42857\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n- Resonance $\\mathrm{C}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,\\mathrm{C}}} = \\frac{1}{0.18\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 5.55555\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n- Resonance $\\mathrm{D}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{1}{2.40\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.41666\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n- Resonance $\\mathrm{E}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\mathrm{E}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,\\mathrm{E}}} = \\frac{1}{0.95\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.05263\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Minimal Recycle Delays, $\\tau$**\n\nThe recovery of the longitudinal component of magnetization, $M_z$, after it has been perturbed from its thermal equilibrium value, $M_0$, is described by the Bloch equation. The solution for this first-order process is:\n$$ M_z(t) = M_0 + (M_z(0) - M_0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right) $$\nwhere $M_z(t)$ is the magnetization at time $t$ and $M_z(0)$ is the magnetization at the beginning of the recovery period (i.e., at $t=0$).\n\nThe experimental protocol involves repeated perfect $90^{\\circ}$ pulses separated by a recycle delay, $\\tau$. A perfect $90^{\\circ}$ pulse applied to the system at equilibrium rotates the entire $M_z$ vector into the transverse ($xy$) plane. Immediately after the pulse, the longitudinal magnetization is zero, i.e., $M_z(0) = 0$.\n\nThe magnetization then recovers during the recycle delay $\\tau$. Setting $t=\\tau$ and $M_z(0)=0$ in the recovery equation gives the magnetization just before the next pulse:\n$$ M_z(\\tau) = M_0 + (0 - M_0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T_1}\\right) = M_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T_1}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe problem requires that the magnetization recovers to $95\\%$ of its thermal equilibrium value, $M_0$, prior to the next pulse. This condition is expressed as:\n$$ M_z(\\tau) = 0.95 \\times M_0 $$\nEquating the two expressions for $M_z(\\tau)$:\n$$ M_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T_1}\\right)\\right) = 0.95 \\times M_0 $$\nAssuming $M_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $M_0$:\n$$ 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T_1}\\right) = 0.95 $$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $\\tau$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T_1}\\right) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{\\tau}{T_1} = \\ln(0.05) $$\nFinally, solving for the recycle delay $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = -T_1 \\ln(0.05) = T_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right) = T_1 \\ln(20) $$\nThe numerical value of the constant is $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.995732$.

This added dephasing leads to an increase in the transverse relaxation rate, $R_2 = 1/T_2$. The total observed rate can be expressed as $R_2 = R_2^0 + R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, where $R_2^0$ is the intrinsic relaxation rate (in the absence of exchange) and $R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is the contribution from chemical exchange.\n\nThe Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence applies a train of $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulses at regular intervals. A key parameter is the time between successive $180^\\circ$ pulses, $2\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}}$. The frequency of refocusing is given by $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} = 1/(2\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}})$. The effect of these pulses is to refocus dephasing due to static inhomogeneities and, crucially, also to modulate the dephasing caused by chemical exchange.\n\n-   When the refocusing frequency is high ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$), the $180^\\circ$ pulses are applied so rapidly that a nucleus has little chance to jump from one site to another during the $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}}$ delay. In this limit, the effects of exchange are effectively averaged out, and the measured effective relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$, approaches the intrinsic rate, $R_2^0$.\n-   When the refocusing frequency is low ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$), a nucleus can exchange many times between pulses. The exchange process contributes fully to relaxation, and $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ approaches the value it would have in a simple spin-echo experiment, which is $R_2^0 + R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n\nBy measuring $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ as a function of $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$, one obtains a relaxation dispersion curve. The shape of this curve is governed by the Bloch-McConnell equations under a CPMG field. Analytical solutions (e.g., the Carver-Richards equation) show that the dispersion profile is a function of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, the populations of the two sites ($p_A, p_B$), and the frequency difference $\\Delta\\omega$. The magnitude of the exchange contribution, $\\Delta R_2 = R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\to 0) - R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\to \\infty)$, is proportional to $p_A p_B (\\Delta\\omega)^2$.\n\nA significant challenge in analyzing a single dispersion curve is that different combinations of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\\Delta\\omega$ can produce similar-looking curves, leading to a strong correlation between these parameters in a nonlinear least-squares fit. To obtain a robust and unique solution, one must introduce an additional constraint. This is achieved by exploiting the field dependence of $\\Delta\\omega$. The exchange rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is a kinetic parameter that is independent of the static magnetic field strength, $B_0$. However, the chemical shift difference in units of Hz is directly proportional to $B_0$. Consequently, the angular frequency difference, $\\Delta\\omega$, is also proportional to $B_0$.\n\nBy acquiring CPMG dispersion data at two or more different $B_0$ fields and performing a simultaneous (global) fit where $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is a shared parameter and $\\Delta\\omega$ is constrained to scale linearly with $B_0$, the ambiguity is resolved. This provides a highly robust and accurate determination of both $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\\Delta\\omega$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Acquire $^1$H CPMG relaxation dispersion at two static magnetic fields...**\nThis option proposes a comprehensive and methodologically sound experiment.\n-   **Multi-Field Measurement**: Using two fields ($600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ and $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) is the critical step to break the correlation between $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\\Delta\\omega$.\n-   **CPMG Frequency Range**: Varying $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}}$ from $0.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ results in $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ from $50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $2500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is an appropriate range to probe exchange processes on the millisecond timescale.\n-   **Constant $T_{\\mathrm{relax}}$**: Keeping the total relaxation delay constant is crucial for minimizing artifacts from $T_1$ relaxation, ensuring that the measured decay rate is purely due to transverse relaxation.\n-   **Technical Controls**: It correctly specifies the use of Meiboom-Gill phase cycling to compensate for pulse imperfections, calibrated pulses for quantitative accuracy, and isolation of the spin system to prevent $J$-coupling evolution from corrupting the data. These are all hallmarks of a carefully designed, robust experiment.\n-   **Analysis**: A simultaneous fit to a proper theoretical model is the correct way to analyze the multi-field data.\nThis design is the gold standard for quantitatively characterizing two-site exchange in the intermediate regime.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Perform inversion–recovery to measure $R_1 = 1/T_1$ at a single field while varying temperature...**\nThis option proposes a $T_1$ measurement. Chemical exchange on the timescale relevant to line broadening ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\sim \\Delta\\omega$) primarily affects the transverse relaxation rate, $R_2$. While exchange processes can contribute to $R_1$, this is typically a much smaller effect and occurs under different conditions (e.g., motions on the timescale of the Larmor frequency, $\\sim 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$). The problem statement explicitly says that $T_1$ is essentially constant, making a $T_1$-based experiment futile for probing the phenomenon of interest. This approach misidentifies the relevant relaxation parameter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. At a single field, run $^1$H CPMG with $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}} < 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ only...**\nThis option proposes a severely limited CPMG experiment.\n-   **Single Field**: As established, a single-field experiment is not robust due to the potential ambiguity between $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\\Delta\\omega$.\n-   **Limited $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ Range**: Using only $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} > 1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ means sampling only the high-frequency portion of the dispersion curve. The experiment would miss the characteristic drop in $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ that occurs around $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\sim k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, making the determination of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ impossible if it is less than $\\sim 1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. A full dispersion profile, covering both the slow and fast pulsing regimes, is necessary.\n-   **Varying $T_{\\mathrm{relax}}$**: This is not the standard way to acquire a dispersion curve. For each point on the dispersion curve (i.e., for each $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ value), one measures the decay of signal intensity as a function of total time to extract one $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ value. The standard protocol for the dispersion experiment itself is to keep the total CPMG period ($T_{\\mathrm{relax}}$) constant while varying $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cp}}$.\nThis experimental design is fundamentally flawed and would not yield the desired quantitative data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use continuous-wave saturation... to perform chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)...**\nCEST is another valid NMR technique for studying chemical exchange. It is most powerful for systems with a low-population minor state and in the slow exchange regime ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\ll |\\Delta\\omega|$). The problem describes temperature-dependent broadening, which often signifies intermediate exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx |\\Delta\\omega|$), a regime where CPMG is particularly well-suited. While CEST could potentially work, the prompt specifically directs the reasoning towards \"how a pulsed echo train modulates dephasing,\" which points directly to CPMG. Most importantly, relative to the multi-field CPMG approach in option A, a single-field CEST experiment can also suffer from ambiguities and artifacts (e.g., separating direct saturation from exchange transfer). Option A describes a more universally robust and rigorous protocol for the general two-site exchange problem, especially for breaking the parameter correlation, and directly aligns with the physics preamble of the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A describes the most rigorous, comprehensive, and robust experimental design to achieve the stated scientific goal.",
