The given physical model and parameters are standard in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nThe first step is to compute the Fourier transform of the free induction decay (FID) signal, $s(t)$, to obtain the frequency-domain spectrum, $S(\\nu)$. The FID is given as:\n$$s(t) = s_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_2^\\ast}\\right) \\cos\\!\\left(2\\pi \\nu_0 t\\right) u(t)$$\nwhere $s_0$ is a real constant, $T_2^\\ast$ is the effective transverse relaxation time, $\\nu_0$ is the resonance frequency, and $u(t)$ is the unit step function. The one-sided Fourier transform is defined as:\n$$S(\\nu) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} s(t) \\exp\\!\\left(-i 2\\pi \\nu t\\right)\\, dt$$\nTo facilitate the integration, we express the cosine term using Euler's formula, $\\cos(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(ix) + \\exp(-ix))$:\n$$s(t) = s_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_2^\\ast}\\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\exp(i 2\\pi \\nu_0 t) + \\exp(-i 2\\pi \\nu_0 t) \\right]$$\nSubstituting this into the Fourier transform integral, and since $u(t)$ restricts the integral to $t \\ge 0$, we have:\n$$S(\\nu) = \\frac{s_0}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_2^\\ast} + i 2\\pi \\nu_0 t\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_2^\\ast} - i 2\\pi \\nu_0 t\\right) \\right] \\exp(-i 2\\pi \\nu t)\\, dt$$\nWe can separate this into two integrals by combining the exponents:\n$$S(\\nu) = \\frac{s_0}{2} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left(-t\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast} - i 2\\pi (\\nu_0 - \\nu)\\right)\\right) dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left(-t\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast} + i 2\\pi (\\nu_0 + \\nu)\\right)\\right) dt \\right]$$\nEach integral is of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at) dt = \\frac{1}{a}$, provided $\\mathrm{Re}(a)  0$.

For typical NMR experiments, the detected frequency $\\nu$ is close to the resonance frequency $\\nu_0$, and both are positive and large. The second term, centered at $\\nu = -\\nu_0$, is far from the region of interest and its contribution to the lineshape around $\\nu_0$ is negligible.

The maximum amplitude of the line, $A_{\\max}$, occurs at the resonance frequency $\\nu = \\nu_0$:\n$$A_{\\max} = A(\\nu_0) = \\frac{s_0}{2} \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}\\right)^2} = \\frac{s_0 T_2^\\ast}{2}$$\nWe find the frequencies $\\nu$ for which the amplitude is half of its maximum value, i.e., $A(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{\\max}$.\n$$\\frac{s_0}{2} \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}\\right)^2 + 4\\pi^2 (\\nu - \\nu_0)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{s_0 T_2^\\ast}{2} \\right) = \\frac{s_0 T_2^\\ast}{4}$$\nCanceling terms and rearranging, we get:\n$$\\frac{2}{T_2^\\ast} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}\\right)^2 + 4\\pi^2 (\\nu - \\nu_0)^2} = T_2^\\ast$$\n$$2 = (T_2^\\ast)^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2^\\ast}\\right)^2 + 4\\pi^2 (\\nu - \\nu_0)^2 \\right]$$\n$$2 = 1 + 4\\pi^2 (T_2^\\ast)^2 (\\nu - \\nu_0)^2$$\n$$1 = 4\\pi^2 (T_2^\\ast)^2 (\\nu - \\nu_0)^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\\pm 1 = 2\\pi T_2^\\ast (\\nu - \\nu_0)$$\nThe two frequencies corresponding to the half-maximum points, $\\nu_{1/2,\\pm}$, are:\n$$\\nu_{1/2,\\pm} = \\nu_0 \\pm \\frac{1}{2\\pi T_2^\\ast}$$\nThe FWHM is the difference between these two frequencies:\n$$\\Delta \\nu_{1/2} = \\nu_{1/2,+} - \\nu_{1/2,-} = \\left(\\nu_0 + \\frac{1}{2\\pi T_2^\\ast}\\right) - \\left(\\nu_0 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi T_2^\\ast}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\pi T_2^\\ast}$$\nThis is the analytical relationship between the FWHM and $T_2^\\ast$.\n\nNow we compute the numerical FWHM values before and after shimming.\nBefore shimming: $T_{2,\\mathrm{before}}^\\ast = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\\Delta \\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{before}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi (5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{20}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nAfter shimming: $T_{2,\\mathrm{after}}^\\ast = 200\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 2 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\\Delta \\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{after}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi (2 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{5}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nFinally, we assess the resolution gain. The criterion for two lines being \"just resolved\" is that their separation equals the FWHM. Thus, the minimal resolvable separation $\\Delta \\nu_{\\min}$ is equal to the FWHM, $\\Delta \\nu_{1/2}$.\n$$\\Delta \\nu_{\\min, \\mathrm{before}} = \\Delta \\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{before}} = \\frac{20}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta \\nu_{\\min, \\mathrm{after}} = \\Delta \\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{after}} = \\frac{5}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe resolution gain factor $G$ is defined as the ratio of these minimal separations:\n$$G = \\frac{\\Delta \\nu_{\\min, \\mathrm{before}}}{\\Delta \\nu_{\\min, \\mathrm{after}}} = \\frac{20/\\pi}{5/\\pi} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4$$\nThe resolution gain factor is $4$, which is a dimensionless number.

Spectral Width ($\\text{SW}$)**\n\nIn digital signal processing, a time-domain signal is sampled at a constant rate, $f_s$. The time interval between successive samples is the dwell time, $\\Delta t$. The sampling rate is therefore the reciprocal of the dwell time:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$$\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to avoid aliasing (the misidentification of frequencies), the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component present in the signal. In modern NMR spectroscopy, quadrature detection is employed. This technique samples two orthogonal components of the precessing magnetization, which allows for the discrimination of positive and negative frequencies relative to the transmitter's reference frequency. For a system with quadrature detection, the spectral width ($\\text{SW}$) that can be observed without aliasing is equal to the sampling rate.\nTherefore, the spectral width is given by:\n$$\\text{SW} = f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$$\n\n**2. Digital Resolution ($\\delta f$)**\n\nThe FID is sampled for a total duration known as the acquisition time, $T_{acq}$. This duration is the product of the number of sampled points, $N$, and the time interval between them, $\\Delta t$:\n$$T_{acq} = N \\cdot \\Delta t$$\nThe transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain is accomplished via a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), typically implemented as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. A fundamental property of the Fourier transform is that the resolution in the frequency domain is inversely proportional to the total observation time in the time domain. The minimum frequency difference that can be distinguished, known as the digital resolution ($\\delta f$), is the spacing between adjacent points in the resulting frequency spectrum. This spacing is given by the reciprocal of the total acquisition time.\nTherefore, the digital resolution is:\n$$\\delta f = \\frac{1}{T_{acq}} = \\frac{1}{N \\Delta t}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculations**\n\nWe are given the specific instrumental parameters:\n- Dwell time: $\\Delta t = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 120 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Number of points: $N = 16384$\n\nFirst, we calculate the spectral width in $\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$\\text{SW} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{120 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 8333.\\overline{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the digital resolution in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. We can do this by first finding the acquisition time:\n$$T_{acq} = N \\Delta t = 16384 \\times (120 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1.96608\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThen, the digital resolution is:\n$$\\delta f = \\frac{1}{T_{acq}} = \\frac{1}{1.96608\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.508626\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\n**4. Figure-of-Merit ($R$)**\n\nThe problem defines a dimensionless figure-of-merit, $R$, to assess whether the sampling configuration is sufficient to resolve a scalar coupling, $J$. The definition is:\n$$R = \\frac{J}{\\delta f}$$\nThis ratio quantifies how many digital points span the frequency separation of the coupling.

            "problem": "In pulsed Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used for spectrometric identification of organic compounds, a transmitter at frequency $f_0$ applies a shaped $90^{\\circ}$ pulse whose frequency-domain excitation profile $E(f)$ is ideally uniform over a rectangular band of full width $B_{\\mathrm{exc}}$ centered at $f_0$, and zero elsewhere. Immediately after the pulse, the sample’s free induction decay (FID) is acquired using complex quadrature detection with dwell time $\\Delta t$ and sampling rate $f_s = 1/\\Delta t$.

The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Aliasing Map $f_{\\mathrm{alias}}(\\Delta f, f_s)$\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the effect of time-domain sampling on the frequency-domain representation of a signal. We begin with the continuous-time signal and follow its transformation into a digital spectrum.\n\n1.  **Continuous-Time Signal and its Spectrum:**\n    In the rotating frame of reference defined by the transmitter frequency $f_0$, a single resonance with a true frequency offset $\\Delta f$ generates a free induction decay (FID) signal $s(t)$. For the purpose of identifying its frequency, we can model this signal as a complex exponential, ignoring amplitude and relaxation effects:\n    $$s(t) = A \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\Delta f t)$$\n    The continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of this signal, denoted $S(f)$, gives its spectrum. The Fourier transform of a complex exponential is a Dirac delta function:\n    $$S(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\} = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\Delta f t) \\exp(-i 2 \\pi f t) \\,dt = A \\, \\delta(f - \\Delta f)$$\n    This shows that the original, un-sampled signal has a single spectral line at the frequency $f = \\Delta f$.\n\n2.  **Sampling in the Time Domain:**\n    The continuous FID signal $s(t)$ is sampled at discrete time points $t=n\\Delta t$, where $n$ is an integer and $\\Delta t = 1/f_s$ is the dwell time. As given in the problem, this sampling process can be mathematically represented as the product of the continuous signal $s(t)$ and a Dirac comb function, $\\text{III}_{\\Delta t}(t)$:\n    $$s_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(t) = s(t) \\cdot \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(t - n \\Delta t)$$\n\n3.  **Spectrum of the Sampled Signal via Convolution Theorem:**\n    The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their individual Fourier transforms. We need the Fourier transform of the Dirac comb:\n    $$\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(t - n \\Delta t)\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta\\left(f - \\frac{k}{\\Delta t}\\right) = f_s \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(f - k f_s)$$\n    The spectrum of the sampled signal, $S_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(f)$, is therefore the convolution of the original spectrum $S(f)$ with the spectrum of the Dirac comb:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(f) = S(f) * \\left(f_s \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(f - k f_s)\\right)$$\n    Substituting $S(f) = A \\, \\delta(f - \\Delta f)$ and using the sifting property of convolution, $g(f) * \\delta(f - f_0) = g(f-f_0)$, we get:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(f) = \\left(A \\, \\delta(f - \\Delta f)\\right) * \\left(f_s \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(f - k f_s)\\right)$$\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(f) = A f_s \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(f - \\Delta f) * \\delta(f - k f_s)$$\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{sampled}}(f) = A f_s \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(f - (\\Delta f + k f_s))$$\n    This result is fundamental: the spectrum of the sampled signal is not a single line but an infinite series of replicas of the original spectral line, shifted by all integer multiples ($k$) of the sampling frequency $f_s$.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Aliased Frequency:**\n    The digital spectrometer observes the spectrum over a finite baseband interval, specified as $[-f_s/2, f_s/2)$. Aliasing occurs when a signal's true frequency lies outside this band, but one of its spectral replicas ($k \\neq 0$) falls inside it. The observed frequency, $f_{\\text{alias}}$, is the frequency of the unique replica that lies within this baseband.\n    We must find the unique integer, let's call it $k_0$, for which the frequency $\\Delta f - k_0 f_s$ falls into the baseband. We use the form $\\Delta f - k f_s$ to define the aliased frequency, which is equivalent to the previous sum by letting $k \\to -k$. The condition is:\n    $$-\\frac{f_s}{2} \\le \\Delta f - k_0 f_s  \\frac{f_s}{2}$$\n    To find the specific integer $k_0$, we solve this inequality for $k_0$. Dividing by $f_s$ gives:\n    $$-\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} - k_0  \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate $k_0$:\n    $$\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} - \\frac{1}{2}  k_0 \\le \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    For any real value of $\\Delta f/f_s$, this interval of length $1$ contains exactly one integer $k_0$. This integer can be found using the floor function. The unique integer $k$ in an interval $(x-1, x]$ is given by $\\lceil x \\rceil$, and the unique integer in $[x, x+1)$ is $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n    Our interval is of the form $(y-1, y]$ with $y = \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$. So the integer $k_0$ is given by $\\lceil y \\rceil$ only if the interval was $(y-1, y]$. Let's use a more direct expression. The integer $k_0$ that satisfies $y-1  k_0 \\le y$ is $k_0 = \\lfloor y \\rfloor$ if $y$ is not an integer, and $k_0=y$ if $y$ is an integer. Let's test the function $k_0 = \\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor$.\n    If $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer, then $\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = k_0$, which satisfies $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} - 1  k_0  \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$. This is consistent with our inequality.\n    If $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer, say $m$, then $k_0 = \\lfloor m \\rfloor = m$, and the condition $k_0 \\le \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2}$ becomes $m \\le m$, which is true.\n    Thus, the integer is correctly given by:\n    $$k_0 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n    The aliased frequency is the original frequency shifted by this integer multiple of $f_s$:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{alias}}(\\Delta f, f_s) = \\Delta f - k_0 f_s$$\n    Substituting the expression for $k_0$, we obtain the explicit closed-form mapping:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{alias}}(\\Delta f, f_s) = \\Delta f - f_s \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n    This function correctly maps any real frequency $\\Delta f$ to a unique value in the interval $[-f_s/2, f_s/2)$.\n\n### Part 2: Application to the Specific Case\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Sampling rate: $f_s = 2000 \\text{ Hz}$\n-   Excitation bandwidth: $B_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 6000 \\text{ Hz}$\n-   True frequency offset: $\\Delta f = +1850 \\text{ Hz}$\n\nFirst, we confirm the condition that the resonance is excited. The excitation band is $[f_0 - 3000 \\text{ Hz}, f_0 + 3000 \\text{ Hz}]$, which corresponds to an offset range of $[-3000, 3000]$ Hz. Since $|\\Delta f| = 1850 \\text{ Hz}  3000 \\text{ Hz}$, the resonance is indeed within the excitation band.\n\nNext, we calculate the aliased frequency using the derived mapping. The baseband spectral width is $[-f_s/2, f_s/2) = [-1000 \\text{ Hz}, 1000 \\text{ Hz})$. Since the true offset $\\Delta f = 1850 \\text{ Hz}$ is outside this interval, the observed peak will be aliased.\n\nWe apply the formula for $f_{\\mathrm{alias}}$:\n1.  Calculate the ratio of the offset frequency to the sampling frequency:\n    $$\\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} = \\frac{1850}{2000} = 0.925$$\n2.  Determine the integer multiple $k_0$:\n    $$k_0 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 0.925 + 0.5 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.425 \\rfloor = 1$$\n3.  Calculate the aliased frequency:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{alias}} = \\Delta f - k_0 \\cdot f_s = 1850 - 1 \\cdot 2000 = -150 \\text{ Hz}$$\n\nThe predicted aliased position for the resonance is $-150$ Hz. This value lies within the digital spectral width of $[-1000, 1000)$ Hz, as expected.",
