            "problem": "In proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of organic compounds, deuterated solvents are used to provide a stable deuterium lock signal and to suppress the solvent proton background. Consider a solvent whose molecules originally contain $n$ chemically equivalent $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ sites that would contribute to a single integrated $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ resonance in a fully protiated solvent. Suppose the solvent is isotopically enriched in deuterium such that each originally protiated site is independently replaced by $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ with probability $p$, and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ exchange with solute or other proton sources is negligible on the NMR timescale. Assume that the integrated $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal intensity is proportional to the total number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei present in the sample volume.\n\nStarting from first principles of probability and the linear proportionality of NMR integrated intensity to the number of resonant nuclei, derive an expression for the expected attenuation factor $A(p)$ of the solvent $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal intensity relative to the fully protiated case, in terms of $p$. Then evaluate the residual $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ fraction for $p = 0.995$.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer as a decimal and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the expected attenuation factor, $A(p)$, of a solvent's $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signal, followed by a numerical evaluation for a given isotopic enrichment level. The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of solvent molecules in the NMR sample. Let $n$ be the number of chemically equivalent proton sites on each solvent molecule. In the fully protiated reference case, every one of the $n$ sites on each of the $N$ molecules is a protium nucleus ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$). The total number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei in this fully protiated sample, denoted as $N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{prot}}$, is given by the product:\n$$ N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{prot}} = n \\cdot N $$\nThe problem states that the integrated $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal intensity is linearly proportional to the total number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei. Let this intensity for the protiated solvent be $I_{\\text{prot}}$. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ I_{\\text{prot}} = c \\cdot N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{prot}} = c \\cdot n \\cdot N $$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that encapsulates instrumental factors and is assumed to be constant for a given experiment.\n\nNext, we consider the isotopically enriched solvent. For any given site on a solvent molecule, the probability that it is a deuterium nucleus ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$) is given as $p$. Since a site must be either $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ or $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$, the process is a Bernoulli trial. The probability that a site remains a protium nucleus ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) is therefore $1-p$. The problem states that these replacements are independent events.\n\nFor a single solvent molecule with $n$ such sites, the number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei is a random variable. The expected number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei on one molecule, $E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{molecule}}]$, is the product of the number of trials ($n$) and the probability of success (the site being $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$), which is a fundamental property of the binomial distribution:\n$$ E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{molecule}}] = n \\cdot (1-p) $$\nDue to the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei in the entire sample containing $N$ molecules, denoted $E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{deut}}]$, is $N$ times the expected number per molecule:\n$$ E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{deut}}] = N \\cdot E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{molecule}}] = N \\cdot n \\cdot (1-p) $$\nThe expected signal intensity for this deuterated solvent, $I_{\\text{deut}}$, is proportional to this expected total number of nuclei, with the same proportionality constant $c$:\n$$ I_{\\text{deut}} = c \\cdot E[N_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}, \\text{deut}}] = c \\cdot N \\cdot n \\cdot (1-p) $$\nThe attenuation factor, $A(p)$, is defined as the ratio of the expected signal intensity of the deuterated solvent to the signal intensity of the fully protiated solvent:\n$$ A(p) = \\frac{I_{\\text{deut}}}{I_{\\text{prot}}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $I_{\\text{deut}}$ and $I_{\\text{prot}}$ yields:\n$$ A(p) = \\frac{c \\cdot N \\cdot n \\cdot (1-p)}{c \\cdot N \\cdot n} $$\nThe constant $c$, the number of molecules $N$, and the number of sites per molecule $n$ are present in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out. This leaves a simple expression for the attenuation factor that depends only on the probability of deuterium substitution, $p$:\n$$ A(p) = 1-p $$\nThis expression represents the residual fraction of protons and, by direct proportionality, the residual fraction of the NMR signal intensity.\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this \"residual $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ fraction\" for a solvent where the deuterium enrichment is $p = 0.995$. We substitute this value into our derived expression for $A(p)$:\n$$ A(0.995) = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005 $$\nThe problem specifies that the final numerical answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The number $0.005$ has one significant figure (the leading zeros are not significant). To express this value with three significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros.\n$$ 0.00500 $$\nThis is the expected residual fraction of the solvent's $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal intensity.",

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires addressing the three tasks specified: derivation of the frequency drift, calculation of its numerical value, and justification of the deuterium lock mechanism.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Frequency Drift Expression**\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing NMR is the Larmor equation, which relates the precessional frequency $f$ of a nucleus to the external static magnetic field strength $B_0$:\n$$f = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant characteristic of the specific nucleus. For the proton ($^1\\mathrm{H}$), the equation is:\n$$f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\pi} B_0$$\nTo find the relationship between a small change in the magnetic field, $\\Delta B_0$, and the resulting change in frequency, $\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}$, we can treat these as differentials and differentiate the Larmor equation with respect to $B_0$:\n$$\\frac{df_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{dB_0} = \\frac{\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\pi}$$\nFor small, finite changes, we can use the approximation $df_{^1\\mathrm{H}} \\approx \\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}$ and $dB_0 \\approx \\Delta B_0$:\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\Delta B_0$$\nThis is the expression for the frequency drift $\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}$ in terms of the field drift $\\Delta B_0$. To relate the fractional drifts, we divide this expression by the original Larmor equation:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}/2\\pi) \\Delta B_0}{(\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}/2\\pi) B_0} = \\frac{\\Delta B_0}{B_0}$$\nThis shows that the fractional change in frequency is equal to the fractional change in the magnetic field. Rearranging this gives the expression for the absolute frequency drift:\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta B_0}{B_0} \\right)$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of Frequency Drift**\n\nWe are given the initial proton frequency and the fractional drift rate of the magnetic field.\n-   Proton frequency: $f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 600 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   Fractional field drift per hour: $\\frac{\\Delta B_0}{B_0} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{ppm/hour} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n\nUsing the derived expression, the frequency drift per hour is:\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = (600 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times (0.1 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = (6.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = 6.00 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{8-7}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 6.0 \\times 10^1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe rate of this drift is $60\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ per hour. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the open-loop proton frequency drift is $60.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz/hour}$.\n\n**Part 3: Justification of the Deuterium Field-Frequency Lock**\n\nThe deuterium ($^2\\mathrm{H}$) lock system stabilizes the spectrometer's operating frequency by compensating for the drift in the main magnetic field, $B_0$. The justification from first principles is as follows:\n\n1.  **Proportionality of Frequencies:** Both the proton ($^1\\mathrm{H}$) and the deuterium ($^2\\mathrm{H}$) nuclei resonate in the *same* magnetic field $B_0$. Their respective Larmor frequencies are given by:\n    $$f_{^1\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\pi} B_0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{^2\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{^2\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\pi} B_0$$\n    The ratio of these two frequencies is a constant determined only by their fundamental gyromagnetic ratios:\n    $$\\frac{f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{f_{^2\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}}{\\gamma_{^2\\mathrm{H}}} = \\text{constant}$$\n    This implies that any drift in $B_0$ will cause a proportional drift in *both* $f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}$ and $f_{^2\\mathrm{H}}$. Stabilizing one frequency against a reference inherently stabilizes the other.\n\n2.  **Feedback Control Mechanism:** The lock system is a high-gain servo feedback loop.\n    -   **Monitoring:** The spectrometer continuously measures the resonance frequency of the deuterium nuclei present in the deuterated solvent, $f_{^2\\mathrm{H},\\text{measured}}$.\n    -   **Error Signal:** This measured frequency is compared to an extremely stable, electronically generated reference frequency, $f_{^2\\mathrm{H},\\text{ref}}$. Any deviation, $\\delta f = f_{^2\\mathrm{H},\\text{measured}} - f_{^2\\mathrm{H},\\text{ref}}$, constitutes an error signal. This error is directly proportional to the drift in the magnetic field, $\\Delta B_0$.\n    -   **Correction:** The error signal is fed into a controller, which drives a current through a set of correction coils (shim coils). These coils generate a small, rapidly adjustable magnetic field, $\\Delta B_{\\text{corr}}$, that is superimposed on the main field $B_0$.\n    -   **Nullification:** The feedback loop adjusts $\\Delta B_{\\text{corr}}$ to counteract the drift $\\Delta B_0$ in real-time, such that the effective field experienced by the nuclei, $B_{\\text{eff}} = B_0 + \\Delta B_0 + \\Delta B_{\\text{corr}}$, is held constant. The system works to nullify the error signal, which forces $\\Delta B_{\\text{corr}} \\approx -\\Delta B_0$.\n\n3.  **Stabilization:** By maintaining a constant $B_{\\text{eff}}$, the lock system ensures that the deuterium frequency $f_{^2\\mathrm{H}}$ remains locked to its reference value. Due to the fixed ratio $\\gamma_{^1\\mathrm{H}}/\\gamma_{^2\\mathrm{H}}$, holding $f_{^2\\mathrm{H}}$ constant necessarily holds $f_{^1\\mathrm{H}}$ constant as well. This effectively removes the effect of the magnetic field drift, enabling the acquisition of high-resolution spectra over long periods.",

            "solution": "## Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe objective is to devise an experiment that can unambiguously differentiate between two potential causes for the weak and broad $\\mathrm{NH}$ signal:\n1.  **H/D Exchange**: The population of $\\mathrm{NH}$ protons, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$, decreases over time as they are replaced by deuterons, which are not detected in a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment. This leads to a decreasing integral $I_{\\mathrm{NH}}$. Also, if the exchange rate is on the order of the chemical shift difference, it can cause line broadening (an exchange contribution to $T_{2}$).\n2.  **Relaxation Effects**: A short intrinsic $T_{2}$ (due to, e.g., paramagnetic impurities or scalar coupling to a quadrupolar $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ nucleus) causes a broad line. A low signal-to-noise ratio can result from this broadening and/or from incomplete $T_{1}$ relaxation between scans (saturation) if the recycle delay $d_{1}$ is too short compared to $T_{1}$.\n\nA valid experiment must manipulate a parameter that selectively affects one mechanism while minimally affecting the other, or affects them in clearly distinguishable ways. An internal reference, such as the non-exchangeable aromatic protons, is crucial for quantitative comparisons.\n\n### Analysis of Option A\n\n- **Proposal**: Set $d_{1}\\gg T_{1}$, spike the sample with $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$, and monitor the integrals of the $\\mathrm{NH}$ peak ($I_{\\mathrm{NH}}$) and an aromatic peak ($I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$) over time.\n- **Reasoning**:\n    - The control $d_{1}\\gg T_{1}$ eliminates incomplete relaxation (saturation) as a cause for low signal intensity. This simplifies the integral expression to $I_{\\mathrm{NH}}(t)\\propto f_{\\mathrm{H}}(t)M_{0}$.\n    - H/D exchange is typically catalyzed by acid or base, and its rate is dependent on the concentration of the exchange partner. $\\text{DMSO-}d_6$ is hygroscopic and contains residual $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ which facilitates the exchange. Spiking with additional $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ increases the concentration of the exchangeable deuteron pool, thereby increasing the pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}'$.\n    - If exchange is the dominant mechanism, increasing its rate will cause a measurable, time-dependent decrease in the $\\mathrm{NH}$ population, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}(t)$, and thus its integral $I_{\\mathrm{NH}}(t)$. The aromatic protons are non-exchangeable, so $I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ serves as a stable internal standard. The ratio $I_{\\mathrm{NH}}(t)/I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}(t)$ should decay exponentially. This expectation is correct.\n    - If relaxation is the dominant mechanism, adding a small amount of diamagnetic $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ will not significantly alter the relaxation environment (e.g., it will not remove paramagnetic ions). Therefore, the relative intensity $I_{\\mathrm{NH}}/I_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ will remain constant over time, and the line shape will be unaffected. This expectation is also correct.\n- **Conclusion**: This experiment is well-designed. It directly probes the exchange hypothesis by manipulating the exchange rate and uses a proper internal control. The predicted outcomes correctly distinguish the two scenarios.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n- **Proposal**: Disable the deuterium lock and acquire spectra in protonated $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$.\n- **Reasoning**:\n    - The premise of this option is that the deuterium lock perturbs the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spins. This is fundamentally incorrect. The lock channel operates at the Larmor frequency of deuterium ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$), which is $\\gamma_D/\\gamma_H \\approx 15.3\\%$ of the proton frequency. At $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ for $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, the $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ frequency is approximately $92\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. The radiofrequency fields are highly frequency-selective, and the lock irradiation has no direct effect on the proton spins.\n    - The function of the lock is to stabilize the magnetic field $B_{0}$. Disabling it would lead to field drift, causing all resonances to broaden severely and shift over the course of the experiment, a catastrophic loss of resolution. The signal quality would degrade, not improve.\n    - While using $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$ would eliminate H/D exchange, it would also introduce a massive solvent signal, creating dynamic range problems for the spectrometer and obscuring the analyte signals.\n- **Conclusion**: The reasoning is based on a false premise about the function of the deuterium lock. The expected outcome is the opposite of what would occur in a real experiment.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\n- **Proposal**: Measure $T_{2}$ via a CPMG experiment under different conditions: original sample, after adding a chelator, and after spiking with $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$.\n- **Reasoning**:\n    - This approach directly measures a key relaxation parameter, $T_{2}$, and tests for specific causes of relaxation enhancement.\n    - **Test for Paramagnetism**: If fast relaxation is due to paramagnetic ions, adding a chelating agent (e.g., EDTA) will sequester them. This removes the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which would lead to a measurable increase in the $T_{2}$ of nearby protons, especially the $\\mathrm{NH}$ proton. The lines would narrow, and the echo amplitudes in the CPMG experiment would decay more slowly. This is a standard and definitive test for paramagnetic effects. The expectation is correct.\n    - **Test for Exchange**: Spiking with $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ accelerates exchange. This has two effects: (1) population depletion, which reduces the overall signal integral available at the start of any experiment, and (2) a potential change in the apparent $T_{2}$ due to exchange broadening effects ($T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$). A CPMG experiment measures the decay of the existing signal. It cannot recover signal from protons that have been chemically replaced by deuterons. Therefore, if the integral is low due to population depletion, the CPMG a-priori starts with a weaker signal which only gets weaker over time as exchange proceeds. The statement that lowering the echo time $2\\tau$ won't rescue the integral if the population $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is depleted is correct; pulse sequences can mitigate dephasing due to exchange but cannot reverse chemical conversion.\n- **Conclusion**: This is a powerful and rigorous experimental approach. It uses a specific measurement ($T_{2}$) and targeted perturbations (chelation, $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ spike) to cleanly distinguish between relaxation enhancement by paramagnetism and population loss via chemical exchange.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n- **Proposal**: Reduce the sample temperature from $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $243\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- **Reasoning**:\n    - The option incorrectly predicts the effect of temperature on relaxation for a small molecule. For small molecules in non-viscous solvents, their motion is in the \"extreme narrowing regime,\" where the correlation time $\\tau_{c}$ is very short. Both $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are inversely proportional to $\\tau_{c}$ in this regime ($1/T_1 \\propto \\tau_c$, $1/T_2 \\propto \\tau_c$). Lowering the temperature increases solvent viscosity, which slows molecular tumbling and thus *increases* $\\tau_{c}$. This leads to a *decrease* in both $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. Therefore, lowering the temperature would cause the $\\mathrm{NH}$ line to become broader, not sharper. The expectation of improved motional averaging and increased $T_2$ is incorrect.\n    - The option also incorrectly claims that if exchange were the cause, temperature would have no significant effect. Chemical reactions, including H/D exchange, are almost always temperature-dependent, typically slowing down at lower temperatures (Arrhenius law). Therefore, lowering the temperature would affect the exchange rate, which in turn affects both exchange broadening and the rate of population depletion. The effect would be significant, contrary to the claim.\n- **Conclusion**: The predicted outcomes for both hypotheses are based on scientifically incorrect assumptions about the temperature dependence of relaxation and chemical exchange.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Analysis of Option E\n\n- **Proposal**: Replace $\\text{DMSO-}d_6$ with $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$ and use an external deuterium lock (coaxial insert containing $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$).\n- **Reasoning**:\n    - This is an elegant experimental design that isolates the role of the solvent as a chemical reactant. Using $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$ removes the bulk source of deuterium for H/D exchange.\n    - Using an external lock in a capillary insert is a standard technique that allows the spectrometer to maintain field stability while the bulk solvent is non-deuterated. This correctly isolates the lock's function from the sample's chemical environment. The use of $d_{1}\\gg T_{1}$ is a good practice to ensure full magnetization recovery.\n    - **Expectation (Exchange)**: If H/D exchange with the deuterated solvent is the reason for the low integral, moving to a protonated solvent removes the cause. The N-H population, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$, will no longer be depleted. Thus, the $\\mathrm{NH}$ signal integral should recover to its full stoichiometric value relative to the aromatic protons. The contrast with the behavior in $\\text{DMSO-}d_6$ (low/decaying integral) would be conclusive. This expectation is correct.\n    - **Expectation (Relaxation)**: If the signal attenuation and broadening are due to an intrinsic relaxation mechanism (paramagnetism, scalar relaxation), this mechanism is largely independent of the solvent's isotopic composition (assuming similar viscosity for $\\text{DMSO-}d_6$ and $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$, which is a reasonable approximation). Therefore, the NH peak would remain similarly broad and attenuated in $\\text{DMSO-}h_6$. The statement that the lock source modification does not change $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ signal intensities is also correct. This expectation is correct.\n- **Conclusion**: This experiment provides a very clean and direct test of the exchange hypothesis by removing the exchange partner from the bulk solution. The experimental design is sound, and the interpretations are correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Options\nOptions A, C, and E each propose one or more valid, well-controlled experiments with correctly interpreted outcomes that would rigorously distinguish H/D exchange from relaxation effects.",
