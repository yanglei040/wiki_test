This practice explores the fundamental relationship between the absolute resonance frequency in Hertz ($Hz$), which is dependent on the spectrometer's magnetic field strength, and the field-independent chemical shift scale.

            "problem": "A single proton resonance in a liquid organic sample is observed relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at two magnetic field strengths using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The magnet and probe are tuned for proton resonance at nominal operating frequencies of $300$ MHz and $600$ MHz, respectively, and TMS is used as the internal reference in both spectra. The resonance of the sample is located at a chemical shift of $\\delta = 1.00$ ppm downfield from TMS in both spectra.\n\nStarting only from the Larmor relation for nuclear precession and the definition of electronic shielding for a nucleus in a molecule, and using the standard operational definition of chemical shift in parts per million relative to a reference compound, derive the expression that connects chemical shift, shielding, and spectrometer operating frequency, and use it to explain why the chemical shift in ppm is invariant with magnetic field strength even though the absolute frequency separation in hertz changes. Then compute the absolute frequency separations, in hertz, corresponding to $\\delta = 1.00$ ppm at $300$ MHz and at $600$ MHz.\n\nExpress the final numerical answers for the two absolute frequency separations in hertz as a row matrix, ordered as $\\left[\\Delta \\nu_{300\\ \\text{MHz}},\\ \\Delta \\nu_{600\\ \\text{MHz}}\\right]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, internally consistent, and well-posed, containing all necessary information for a complete derivation and calculation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between chemical shift, shielding, and spectrometer frequency, coupled with an explanation for the field-invariance of the chemical shift in ppm; second, a calculation of the absolute frequency separations.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Explanation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the Larmor relation, which describes the precessional frequency, $\\nu$, of a nucleus with gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ in an external magnetic field of strength $B$. For a bare nucleus in the primary external magnetic field $B_0$ of the spectrometer, this frequency is:\n$$ \\nu_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 $$\nThis frequency $\\nu_0$ is the nominal operating frequency of the spectrometer, for example, $300$ MHz or $600$ MHz for a proton.\n\nIn a molecule, a nucleus is surrounded by electrons. These electrons circulate in the presence of the external field $B_0$ and generate a small, local, induced magnetic field, $B_{ind}$, which opposes $B_0$. This phenomenon is called electronic shielding. The magnitude of the induced field is proportional to the external field:\n$$ B_{ind} = \\sigma B_0 $$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant, a dimensionless quantity that is characteristic of the chemical environment of the nucleus.\n\nThe effective magnetic field, $B_{eff}$, actually experienced by the nucleus is therefore reduced from the external field:\n$$ B_{eff} = B_0 - B_{ind} = B_0 - \\sigma B_0 = B_0 (1 - \\sigma) $$\nThe actual resonance frequency of this shielded nucleus, $\\nu_{nuc}$, is determined by this effective field, according to the Larmor relation:\n$$ \\nu_{nuc} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{eff} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma_{nuc}) $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{nuc}$ is the shielding constant for the sample nucleus. We can express this in terms of the spectrometer's nominal operating frequency, $\\nu_0$:\n$$ \\nu_{nuc} = \\nu_0 (1 - \\sigma_{nuc}) $$\nSimilarly, for the reference compound (tetramethylsilane, TMS), its resonance frequency, $\\nu_{ref}$, is given by:\n$$ \\nu_{ref} = \\nu_0 (1 - \\sigma_{ref}) $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{ref}$ is the shielding constant for the protons in TMS.\n\nThe absolute frequency separation, $\\Delta\\nu$, between the sample resonance and the reference resonance is given in hertz (Hz):\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{nuc} - \\nu_{ref} = \\nu_0 (1 - \\sigma_{nuc}) - \\nu_0 (1 - \\sigma_{ref}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 (1 - \\sigma_{nuc} - 1 + \\sigma_{ref}) = \\nu_0 (\\sigma_{ref} - \\sigma_{nuc}) $$\nThis equation shows that the frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ in hertz is directly proportional to the spectrometer operating frequency $\\nu_0$, and thus to the magnetic field strength $B_0$.\n\nThe chemical shift, $\\delta$, is a normalized quantity designed to be independent of the spectrometer's operating frequency. The standard operational definition expresses $\\delta$ in parts per million (ppm) by dividing the frequency separation in Hz by the spectrometer frequency in MHz. A more formal definition is:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\nu_{nuc} - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6 $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for the frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{nuc} - \\nu_{ref}$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\nu_0 (\\sigma_{ref} - \\sigma_{nuc})}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6 $$\nThe spectrometer frequency $\\nu_0$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\delta = (\\sigma_{ref} - \\sigma_{nuc}) \\times 10^6 $$\nThis final expression demonstrates that the chemical shift $\\delta$ depends only on the difference between the shielding constants of the reference and sample nuclei. It is fundamentally independent of the spectrometer frequency $\\nu_0$ and the external magnetic field strength $B_0$. Consequently, a given proton resonance will have the same chemical shift in ppm regardless of whether the spectrum is acquired on a $300$ MHz or a $600$ MHz instrument. While the absolute frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ (in Hz) doubles when the field strength doubles, the denominator in the definition of $\\delta$ also doubles, yielding a constant ratio.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Absolute Frequency Separations**\n\nThe problem provides the chemical shift $\\delta = 1.00$ ppm and two spectrometer operating frequencies. We use the standard operational relationship between chemical shift in ppm, frequency separation in Hz, and spectrometer frequency in MHz:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{ppm}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu_{\\text{Hz}}}{\\nu_{0, \\text{MHz}}} $$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the frequency separation in Hertz:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{\\text{Hz}} = \\delta_{\\text{ppm}} \\times \\nu_{0, \\text{MHz}} $$\n\nCase 1: At a spectrometer frequency of $300$ MHz.\nGiven $\\delta = 1.00$ ppm and $\\nu_0 = 300$ MHz.\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{300~\\text{MHz}} = 1.00 \\times 300 = 300~\\text{Hz} $$\n\nCase 2: At a spectrometer frequency of $600$ MHz.\nGiven $\\delta = 1.00$ ppm and $\\nu_0 = 600$ MHz.\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{600~\\text{MHz}} = 1.00 \\times 600 = 600~\\text{Hz} $$\n\nThe calculated frequency separations are $300$ Hz and $600$ Hz, respectively. These values are to be presented as a row matrix as requested.",

By analyzing the difference between a $C-H$ and $C-D$ bond , you will see how nuclear shielding is not a static property but rather a dynamic quantity, vibrationally averaged over the molecule's quantum states.",

            "problem": "A central concept in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is that the chemical shift arises from the magnetic shielding constant, denoted by $\\sigma$, which depends on the electronic structure and geometry of the molecule in the vicinity of the observed nucleus. Within the Born–Oppenheimer picture, electronic shielding is evaluated at fixed nuclear geometries, and the observed shielding is a vibrational average over the nuclear probability distribution. Consider the two isotopomers $\\,\\mathrm{R{-}CH{-}X}\\,$ and $\\,\\mathrm{R{-}CD{-}X}\\,$ at a saturated carbon center $\\mathrm{C}$, and model the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ and $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ stretching vibration as a one-dimensional oscillator with force constant $k$ and reduced mass $\\mu$. For a harmonic oscillator, the angular frequency is $\\omega=\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$ and the ground-state zero-point energy (ZPE) is $E_{0}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. In an anharmonic (e.g., Morse) potential, the vibrationally averaged bond length $\\langle r\\rangle$ is shifted from the equilibrium bond length $r_{e}$ because the potential is asymmetric; the magnitude of the shift increases with vibrational amplitude.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$ be the reduced masses for the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ and $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ stretches, respectively, with $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The shielding constant can be decomposed as $\\sigma=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$, where the diamagnetic term $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}$ depends on the near-nucleus electron density (schematically increasing with expectation values like $\\langle r^{-3}\\rangle$ of electron coordinates relative to the observed nucleus), and the paramagnetic term $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$ reflects second-order mixing with excited electronic states and depends on geometry and orbital energy gaps. The chemical shift $\\delta$ is observed relative to a reference and is inversely related to shielding, $\\delta\\propto(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}})$, so increased $\\sigma$ produces an upfield (lower $\\delta$) shift.\n\nWhich option most accurately defines primary versus secondary isotope shifts in NMR and correctly explains, from the vibrational averaging of $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ versus $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ bonds, how electron density redistribution alters $\\sigma$ at the observed nucleus?\n\nA. Primary isotope shifts are the changes in the chemical shift of a nucleus when an isotopic substitution is made on the atom directly bonded to that nucleus (one-bond effect), and secondary isotope shifts are the changes when the isotopic substitution is at atoms two or more bonds away. Because $\\omega=\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$ decreases when $\\mu$ increases, the ground-state mean-square vibrational amplitude $\\langle x^{2}\\rangle$ decreases for $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ compared to $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, reducing the anharmonic elongation of $\\langle r\\rangle$ above $r_{e}$ in $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$. This shorter vibrationally averaged $\\langle r\\rangle$ in $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ increases near-nucleus electron density at the directly bonded carbon, raising $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and typically also reduces $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$ for saturated $sp^3$ environments. The net effect is a slight increase in $\\sigma$ (upfield, lower $\\delta$) at the directly bonded ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ (primary shift), with smaller, distance-dependent changes at adjacent nuclei (secondary shifts).\n\nB. Primary isotope shifts are defined as changing the isotope of the observed nucleus (e.g., measuring $\\mathrm{^{13}C}$ instead of $\\mathrm{^{12}C}$), while secondary shifts refer to any isotopic substitution on nearby atoms. Because heavier isotopes store more ZPE, $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ has larger vibrational amplitude than $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, lengthening $\\langle r\\rangle$ and lowering electron density near the observed nucleus, decreasing $\\sigma$ and moving $\\delta$ downfield.\n\nC. Primary isotope shifts occur when isotopic substitution is at atoms two or more bonds away, and secondary shifts occur when substitution is directly bonded. The mechanism is that the equilibrium bond length $r_{e}$ depends on the isotope mass, so $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ has a different $r_{e}$ than $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, and this mass dependence of $r_{e}$ changes $\\sigma$ by altering the static geometry; vibrational averaging is negligible.\n\nD. Primary isotope shifts are one-bond effects and secondary shifts are multi-bond effects, but the origin of the shift is the direct magnetic dipole of deuterium altering the local magnetic field at neighboring nuclei via its gyromagnetic ratio, so the effect is independent of vibrational amplitudes and electron density; the largest shifts are expected on remote nuclei rather than those directly bonded.\n\nSelect the single best option.",

The relationship between isotopic mass, vibrational frequency, and average bond length in an anharmonic potential is a standard and correct physical chemical concept.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient theoretical background to deduce the correct mechanism for the deuterium isotope shift on a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR signal. It asks for a known set of definitions and a standard physical explanation.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and uses established scientific terminology.\n\nThere are no identified flaws. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to explain the origin of the primary isotope shift on the chemical shift of the carbon nucleus in $\\mathrm{R{-}CD{-}X}$ relative to $\\mathrm{R{-}CH{-}X}$.\n\n1.  **Definitions**: A primary isotope shift in NMR refers to the change in chemical shift of a nucleus (here, the carbon $\\mathrm{C}$) upon isotopic substitution on an atom directly bonded to it (here, $\\mathrm{D}$ for $\\mathrm{H}$). A secondary isotope shift refers to the effect on a nucleus from an isotopic substitution two or more bonds away.\n\n2.  **Vibrational Frequency and Energy**: The vibrational frequency of the $\\mathrm{C}$-isotope stretch is given by $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$. Since the mass of deuterium ($m_{\\mathrm{D}}$) is approximately twice the mass of protium ($m_{\\mathrm{H}}$), the reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ oscillator, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$, is greater than that for the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ oscillator, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}$. Given that the force constant $k$ is determined by the electronic structure and is the same for both isotopomers within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, it follows that $\\omega_{\\mathrm{D}}  \\omega_{\\mathrm{H}}$. Consequently, the zero-point energy (ZPE) of the ground vibrational state, $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, is lower for the $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ bond than for the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ bond: $E_{0,\\mathrm{D}}  E_{0,\\mathrm{H}}$.\n\n3.  **Anharmonicity and Average Bond Length**: Real molecular potentials are anharmonic, being steeper for compression ($r  r_e$) and shallower for extension ($r  r_e$) than a purely harmonic potential. A system oscillating in such a potential spends more of its time at $r  r_e$. This results in a vibrationally averaged bond length, $\\langle r \\rangle$, that is greater than the equilibrium bond length, $r_e$. The extent of this elongation, $\\langle r \\rangle - r_e$, increases with the amplitude of the vibration. Since the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ bond has a higher ZPE, its ground state has a larger vibrational amplitude than the $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ bond. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ bond experiences a greater degree of anharmonic elongation. The result is that the average bond length of $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ is longer than that of $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$: $\\langle r_{\\mathrm{C-H}} \\rangle  \\langle r_{\\mathrm{C-D}} \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Effect on Nuclear Shielding ($\\sigma$)**: The problem asks for the effect on the shielding of the carbon nucleus.\n    -   The shorter average bond length in the $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ case, $\\langle r_{\\mathrm{C-D}} \\rangle$, means that the bonding electrons are, on average, pulled closer to the carbon nucleus.\n    -   This increase in electron density in the vicinity of the carbon nucleus enhances the diamagnetic shielding term, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}$, which opposes the external magnetic field. Thus, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathrm{in~R-CD-X})  \\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathrm{in~R-CH-X})$.\n    -   The paramagnetic term, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$, is a deshielding contribution (it is negative). Its magnitude can also be affected by the change in average geometry. A shorter bond can lead to larger energy denominators in the second-order perturbation expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$, reducing its magnitude (making it less negative) and thus also contributing to an increase in total shielding.\n    -   The net effect is an increase in the total shielding constant for the carbon nucleus in the deuterated compound: $\\sigma(\\mathrm{C~in~R-CD-X})  \\sigma(\\mathrm{C~in~R-CH-X})$.\n\n5.  **Effect on Chemical Shift ($\\delta$)**: The chemical shift $\\delta$ is inversely related to the shielding constant $\\sigma$ via $\\delta\\propto(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}})$. An increased shielding $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ leads to a decreased (more upfield) chemical shift $\\delta$. Therefore, the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ resonance in $\\mathrm{R{-}CD{-}X}$ is shifted upfield (to a lower $\\delta$ value) relative to the resonance in $\\mathrm{R{-}CH{-}X}$. This is the primary isotope shift. Effects on more distant nuclei (secondary shifts) are explained by the same mechanism but are weaker due to the greater distance.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Primary isotope shifts are the changes in the chemical shift of a nucleus when an isotopic substitution is made on the atom directly bonded to that nucleus (one-bond effect), and secondary isotope shifts are the changes when the isotopic substitution is at atoms two or more bonds away. Because $\\omega=\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$ decreases when $\\mu$ increases, the ground-state mean-square vibrational amplitude $\\langle x^{2}\\rangle$ decreases for $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ compared to $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, reducing the anharmonic elongation of $\\langle r\\rangle$ above $r_{e}$ in $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$. This shorter vibrationally averaged $\\langle r\\rangle$ in $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ increases near-nucleus electron density at the directly bonded carbon, raising $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and typically also reduces $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$ for saturated $sp^3$ environments. The net effect is a slight increase in $\\sigma$ (upfield, lower $\\delta$) at the directly bonded ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ (primary shift), with smaller, distance-dependent changes at adjacent nuclei (secondary shifts).**\n\nThis option provides the correct definitions for primary and secondary isotope shifts. The mechanistic explanation follows the exact logical chain derived above: higher mass $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$ leads to lower frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{D}}$, lower ZPE, smaller vibrational amplitude, smaller anharmonic elongation, and thus a shorter average bond length $\\langle r_{\\mathrm{C-D}} \\rangle$. It correctly links this shorter bond length to an increase in the diamagnetic shielding term $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and correctly notes the likely reinforcing effect on the paramagnetic term $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The final conclusion of an increased total shielding $\\sigma$ and an upfield shift (lower $\\delta$) is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Primary isotope shifts are defined as changing the isotope of the observed nucleus (e.g., measuring $\\mathrm{^{13}C}$ instead of $\\mathrm{^{12}C}$), while secondary shifts refer to any isotopic substitution on nearby atoms. Because heavier isotopes store more ZPE, $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ has larger vibrational amplitude than $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, lengthening $\\langle r\\rangle$ and lowering electron density near the observed nucleus, decreasing $\\sigma$ and moving $\\delta$ downfield.**\n\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, the definition of a primary isotope shift is wrong; it refers to substitution on a neighboring atom, not the observed nucleus itself. Second, the physical premise \"heavier isotopes store more ZPE\" is false. As shown in the derivation, heavier isotopes have a *lower* ZPE ($E_0 \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$). This error invalidates the entire subsequent chain of reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Primary isotope shifts occur when isotopic substitution is at atoms two or more bonds away, and secondary shifts occur when substitution is directly bonded. The mechanism is that the equilibrium bond length $r_{e}$ depends on the isotope mass, so $\\mathrm{C{-}D}$ has a different $r_{e}$ than $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$, and this mass dependence of $r_{e}$ changes $\\sigma$ by altering the static geometry; vibrational averaging is negligible.**\n\nThis option incorrectly swaps the definitions of primary and secondary isotope shifts. Furthermore, its proposed mechanism is fundamentally flawed. It claims the equilibrium bond length $r_e$ is isotope-dependent, which violates the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, a core concept on which the standard explanation (and the problem setup) is based. The potential energy surface and its minimum ($r_e$) are functions of electronic coordinates only, not nuclear masses. The statement that vibrational averaging is negligible is also directly contrary to the established physical cause of the phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Primary isotope shifts are one-bond effects and secondary shifts are multi-bond effects, but the origin of the shift is the direct magnetic dipole of deuterium altering the local magnetic field at neighboring nuclei via its gyromagnetic ratio, so the effect is independent of vibrational amplitudes and electron density; the largest shifts are expected on remote nuclei rather than those directly bonded.**\n\nThis option starts with a correct definition but then proposes an incorrect mechanism. It confuses the isotope effect on chemical shift with nuclear spin-spin coupling mechanisms (either through-space dipolar coupling or through-bond scalar coupling). The isotope shift is a change in the electronic shielding, $\\sigma$, not a direct magnetic field effect from the deuterium nucleus's magnetic moment. The claim that the effect is independent of vibrational amplitudes and electron density is false. The concluding statement that the largest shifts are expected on remote nuclei is both empirically untrue and inconsistent with any plausible physical mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
