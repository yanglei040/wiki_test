It is scientifically grounded in the principles of spectrophotometry, specifically the Beer-Lambert law, and presents a well-posed task involving both a standard derivation and a practical calculation. The provided parameters are realistic and the assumptions are clearly stated, forming a self-contained and consistent problem.\n\nThe task is to first derive the decadic Beer-Lambert relation, $A = \\epsilon c l$, from fundamental microscopic principles and then use this relation to calculate a required concentration.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Beer-Lambert Relation**\n\nWe begin by considering the attenuation of a collimated beam of light as it passes through a homogeneous absorbing medium. The change in spectral irradiance (or intensity for simplicity), $dI$, upon traversing an infinitesimal pathlength, $dx$, is proportional to the incident irradiance, $I$, the number of absorbing centers per unit volume (number density, $N$), and the effective area an absorbing center presents to the incident photons (microscopic absorption cross-section, $\\sigma$). The negative sign indicates a decrease in irradiance due to absorption.\n\nThis relationship is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\ndI = -I \\sigma N dx\n$$\n\nTo find the total attenuation over a finite pathlength, $l$, we rearrange the equation to separate variables and integrate. We integrate the irradiance from its initial value, $I_0$, at the entrance of the cell ($x=0$) to its final value, $I$, at the exit ($x=l$).\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI}{I} = - \\int_{0}^{l} \\sigma N dx\n$$\n\nSince the solution is assumed to be homogeneous, the number density $N$ is constant throughout the path. The absorption cross-section $\\sigma$ is also constant for a given wavelength. Thus, we can treat $\\sigma$ and $N$ as constants with respect to the integration variable $x$.\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI}{I} = - \\sigma N \\int_{0}^{l} dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(I)]_{I_0}^{I} = - \\sigma N [x]_{0}^{l}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = - \\sigma N l\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = - \\sigma N l\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in terms of transmittance, $T = I/I_0$, and the natural or Naperian absorbance, $A_e$:\n$$\nA_e = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right) = \\sigma N l\n$$\n\nIn chemical spectroscopy, it is conventional to use the decadic (base-$10$) absorbance, $A$, defined as:\n$$\nA = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)\n$$\nThe relationship between the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) and the base-$10$ logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) is $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Applying this to our definitions of absorbance:\n$$\nA_e = \\ln(10) A\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $A_e$:\n$$\n\\ln(10) A = \\sigma N l\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\sigma N l}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to relate the microscopic quantities, number density $N$ (in units of molecules per unit volume, e.g., $\\mathrm{molecules \\cdot cm^{-3}}$) and cross-section $\\sigma$ (in units of area, e.g., $\\mathrm{cm^2}$), to the macroscopic quantities, molar concentration $c$ (in $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}$) and molar decadic absorptivity $\\epsilon$ (in $\\mathrm{L \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot cm^{-1}}$).\n\nThe number density $N$ is the product of the molar concentration $c$ and Avogadro's constant, $N_A$. We must be meticulous with units.\nLet $c$ be the concentration in $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}$ and $N$ be the number density in $\\mathrm{molecules \\cdot cm^{-3}}$.\n$N_A$ has units of $\\mathrm{molecules \\cdot mol^{-1}}$. The conversion between liters and cubic centimeters is $1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$\nN \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{molecules}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}}\\right] = c \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right] \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}} \\times N_A \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{molecules}}{\\mathrm{mol}}\\right]\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{c N_A}{1000}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is numerically the value in $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $N$ into our equation for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\sigma l}{\\ln(10)} \\left( \\frac{c N_A}{1000} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging to group the constants:\n$$\nA = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma N_A}{1000 \\ln(10)} \\right) c l\n$$\nThis is the Beer-Lambert relation, which is conventionally written as $A = \\epsilon c l$. By direct comparison, we identify the molar decadic absorptivity $\\epsilon$ as:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma N_A}{1000 \\ln(10)}\n$$\nThis derivation successfully establishes the required relationship $A = \\epsilon c l$. The assumed conditions (homogeneity, negligible scattering, collimated beam) were necessary for the validity of the integration and the linear relationship.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Concentration**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the concentration $c$ that yields a target absorbance of $A \\approx 0.8$. We use the derived formula:\n$$\nA = \\epsilon c l\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $c$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Absorbance $A = 0.8$ (dimensionless)\n- Molar decadic absorptivity $\\epsilon = 1200\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}\\ cm^{-1}}$\n- Pathlength $l = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent.

This is equivalent to evaluating the expression for $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ at $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_c$.\n$$\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx \\frac{1}{2 t \\left( n(\\tilde{\\nu}_c) + \\tilde{\\nu}_c \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}}\\right|_{\\tilde{\\nu}_c} \\right)}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $t$ gives the desired first-order dispersion-corrected estimator:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} \\left( n(\\tilde{\\nu}_c) + \\tilde{\\nu}_c \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}}\\right|_{\\tilde{\\nu}_c} \\right)}$$\nUsing the notation from the problem, where $n_c = n(\\tilde{\\nu}_c)$ and $s = \\left.\\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}\\right|_{\\tilde{\\nu}_c}$, the estimator is:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} (n_c + \\tilde{\\nu}_c s)}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Film Thickness**\n\nWe are given the following experimental values:\n- Central wavenumber: $\\tilde{\\nu}_c = 2500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- Fringe spacing: $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- Refractive index at $\\tilde{\\nu}_c$: $n_c = 1.500$\n- Refractive index dispersion: $s = -1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the group refractive index term in the denominator:\n$$n_c + \\tilde{\\nu}_c s = 1.500 + (2500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(-1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$n_c + \\tilde{\\nu}_c s = 1.500 - 0.03 = 1.470$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as required.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the estimator for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{2 (1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) (1.470)} = \\frac{1}{2940}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nTo express the result in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), we use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{2940} \\times 10^4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.4013605\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$t \\approx 3.401\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**Part 4: Commentary on the Effect of Dispersion**\n\nIf dispersion were ignored, the derivative term $s = \\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}$ would be set to zero. The estimator for thickness would simplify to the common non-dispersive formula:\n$$t_{\\text{no-disp}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} n_c}$$\nUsing the given values, the thickness calculated without considering dispersion would be:\n$$t_{\\text{no-disp}} = \\frac{1}{2 (1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) (1.500)} = \\frac{1}{3000}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\approx 3.333\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nComparing this to the dispersion-corrected value of $t \\approx 3.401\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, it is evident that ignoring dispersion leads to an **underestimation** of the film thickness.\n\nThe physical reason for this bias is that the fringe spacing $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ is inversely proportional to the group refractive index $n_g(\\tilde{\\nu}) = n(\\tilde{\\nu}) + \\tilde{\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}}$, not the phase refractive index $n(\\tilde{\\nu})$. In this problem, the dispersion $s = \\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}$ is negative (normal dispersion in this spectral region for many polymers), meaning the refractive index decreases as wavenumber increases. Consequently, the group index $n_g(\\tilde{\\nu}_c) = 1.470$ is smaller than the phase index $n_c = 1.500$. By ignoring dispersion, one effectively replaces the correct, smaller group index ($1.470$) in the denominator of the thickness formula with the larger phase index ($1.500$). Dividing by a larger number results in a smaller, and therefore underestimated, value for the thickness $t$.",
