By convention, it is expressed in units of reciprocal centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nTo obtain the value in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the wavelength $\\lambda$ must be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe energy $E$ of a single photon is quantized and is directly proportional to its frequency $\\nu$, as described by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$E = h\\nu$$\nBy substituting the expression for frequency, $\\nu = c/\\lambda$, we can also relate the energy directly to the wavelength:\n$$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nThe energy can be expressed in different units. While the SI unit is the Joule ($\\mathrm{J}$), the electronvolt ($\\mathrm{eV}$) is common in this context. The conversion is based on the magnitude of the elementary charge $e$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{J}}}{e}$$\nBefore calculation, we convert the given wavelength $\\lambda$ into the base SI unit of meters:\n$$\\lambda = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nWe now proceed to calculate the four required quantities, rounding each final result to $4$ significant figures.\n\nFirst, we determine the frequency $\\nu$ by solving the wave equation and substituting the values:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2.99792458\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 5.99584916 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is equal to $1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, the frequency rounded to $4$ significant figures is $\\nu \\approx 5.996 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nNext, for the spectroscopic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, we first express the wavelength in centimeters as $\\lambda = 5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\times (\\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}) = 5.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.

Using the relation $E = hc/\\lambda$ is preferable to avoid propagating rounding error from the intermediate frequency calculation:\n$$E = \\frac{(6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (2.99792458\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})}{5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 3.97289172... \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $E \\approx 3.973 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nFinally, we find the photon energy in electronvolts by converting the energy in Joules.

This ratio compares the characteristic thermal energy available at a given temperature $T$ with the quantum energy separation $\\Delta E$ of the nuclear spin states.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the Zeeman energy splitting $\\Delta E$ and the resonance frequency $\\nu_{0}$.

The exercise  uses a thought experiment to isolate the effect of a solvent's refractive index on the measured wavelength of an absorption band.
