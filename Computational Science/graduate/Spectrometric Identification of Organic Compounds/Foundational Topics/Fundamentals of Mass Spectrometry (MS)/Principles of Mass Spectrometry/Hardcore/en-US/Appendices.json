For two peaks at masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ to be considered resolved (based on the common $10\\%$ valley definition), the separation $|m_1 - m_2|$ must be at least equal to the FWHM, $\\Delta m$.

The provided data and principles are standard in the field of analytical chemistry. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be pursued.\n\nThe process involves three main steps:\n1. Calculation of the mass range for the neutral molecule.\n2. Application of structural and chemical rules to constrain the search space.\n3. A systematic enumeration and verification of candidate formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Neutral Monoisotopic Mass Window**\n\nThe observed mass-to-charge ratio for the singly protonated ion, $[M+H]^{+}$, is given as $m/z = 180.0655$. The instrument's mass accuracy is $\\pm 2$ parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe absolute mass error, $\\Delta m$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\Delta m = (m/z) \\times (\\text{accuracy in ppm}) \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 180.0655 \\times 2 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.000360131 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThis means the true $m/z$ of the ion is within the range:\n$$ [ (m/z) - \\Delta m, (m/z) + \\Delta m ] = [180.0655 - 0.000360131, 180.0655 + 0.000360131] $$\n$$ m/z_{\\text{range}} = [180.06513987, 180.06586013] $$\n\nThe observed ion is $[M+H]^{+}$, where $M$ is the neutral molecule. The mass of the ion is the sum of the neutral molecule's mass, $M_{neutral}$, and the mass of a proton, $m_p$. The problem states the relationship for a singly protonated ion as $M_{neutral} = (m/z) - m_p$. The provided proton mass is $m_p = 1.00727646688$ Da.\n\nThe central value for the neutral mass is:\n$$ M_{center} = 180.0655 - 1.00727646688 = 179.05822353312 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThe mass window for the neutral molecule is obtained by subtracting $m_p$ from the ion's $m/z$ range. The width of the window remains $2 \\times \\Delta m$.\n$$ M_{min} = M_{center} - \\Delta m = 179.05822353312 - 0.000360131 = 179.05786340212 \\text{ Da} $$\n$$ M_{max} = M_{center} + \\Delta m = 179.05822353312 + 0.000360131 = 179.05858366412 \\text{ Da} $$\nAny valid molecular formula must have a calculated monoisotopic mass that falls within the range $[179.05786, 179.05859]$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Chemical and Structural Constraints**\n\nA candidate formula $C_c H_h N_n O_o$, where $c, h, n, o$ are non-negative integers, must satisfy several rules.\n\n- **Elemental Composition**: The formula can only contain Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). The monoisotopic masses are given as:\n  $m_C = 12.000000000$ Da\n  $m_H = 1.00782503223$ Da\n  $m_N = 14.00307400443$ Da\n  $m_O = 15.99491461957$ Da\n\n- **Nitrogen Rule**: The nominal mass of the neutral molecule is the integer part of its exact mass, which is $\\lfloor 179.058... \\rfloor = 179$. Since the nominal mass is odd, the number of nitrogen atoms, $n$, must be an odd integer ($n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, ...\\}$).\n\n- **Double Bond Equivalents (DBE)**: For a stable, neutral molecule, the DBE must be a non-negative integer.\n  $$ \\mathrm{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\ge 0 $$\n  For DBE to be an integer, the term $-\\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}$ must be an integer or half-integer such that the sum is an integer. Specifically, $h$ and $n$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since the nitrogen rule dictates that $n$ must be odd, it follows that the number of hydrogen atoms, $h$, must also be odd.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic Enumeration and Verification**\n\nWe search for integer solutions $(c,h,n,o)$ that satisfy all constraints. The exact mass of a formula $C_c H_h N_n O_o$ is:\n$$ M_{calc} = c \\cdot m_C + h \\cdot m_H + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O $$\nWe require $M_{min} \\le M_{calc} \\le M_{max}$. This can be rewritten for $h$:\n$$ \\frac{M_{min} - (c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O)}{m_H} \\le h \\le \\frac{M_{max} - (c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O)}{m_H} $$\nThe width of this allowed interval for $h$ for any given $(c,n,o)$ is very narrow:\n$$ \\Delta h = \\frac{M_{max} - M_{min}}{m_H} = \\frac{0.000720262}{1.00782503223} \\approx 0.00071465 $$\nSince $h$ must be an integer, a solution exists for a given $(c, n, o)$ triplet only if this narrow interval contains an odd integer. We systematically iterate through plausible values for $n, o, c$.\n\nLet's test $n=1, 3, 5, ...$\nFor a given $(c,n,o)$, let $K = c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O$. The allowed range for $h$ is $[(M_{min}-K)/m_H, (M_{max}-K)/m_H]$.\n\n**Case n = 1**:\nWe test combinations of $c$ and $o$. Let's test the combination $(c,o) = (9,3)$.\n$K = 9 \\cdot m_C + 1 \\cdot m_N + 3 \\cdot m_O$\n$K = 9(12.000000000) + 1(14.00307400443) + 3(15.99491461957)$\n$K = 108 + 14.00307400443 + 47.98474385871 = 169.98781786314$\nThe required range for $h$ is:\n$h_{min} = (179.05786340212 - 169.98781786314) / 1.00782503223 = 8.999696...$\n$h_{max} = (179.05858366412 - 169.98781786314) / 1.00782503223 = 9.000411...$\nThe interval $[8.999696, 9.000411]$ contains exactly one integer, which is $9$. As $9$ is odd, this is a valid candidate for $h$.\nSo, we have the formula $C_9H_9NO_3$.\nLet's verify its mass and DBE:\n$M_{calc} = 169.98781786314 + 9 \\cdot m_H = 169.98781786314 + 9(1.00782503223) = 179.05824315321$ Da.\nThis mass is within the target window $[179.05786, 179.05859]$.\nNow, check the DBE:\n$\\mathrm{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 = 9 - \\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 6$.\nThe DBE is a non-negative integer. Thus, $C_9H_9NO_3$ is a valid formula.\n\nSystematic exploration of other combinations for $n=1$ and for higher odd values of $n$ (e.g., $n=3,5,7,...$) reveals no other combinations for $(c,h,n,o)$ that result in a calculated mass within the narrow window. For example, let's test $C_8H_9N_3O_2$:\n$n=3, h=9, c=8, o=2$.\n$M_{calc} = 8(12) + 9(1.007825) + 3(14.003074) + 2(15.994915) \\approx 179.06948$ Da. This is outside the allowed mass range.\nLet's test $C_5H_5N_7O$:\n$n=7, h=5, c=5, o=1$.\n$M_{calc} = 5(12) + 5(1.007825) + 7(14.003074) + 1(15.994915) \\approx 179.05556$ Da. This is also outside the allowed mass range.\n\nDue to the very narrow mass tolerance ($\\approx 0.0007$ Da) and the discrete nature of atomic composition, it is rare for multiple distinct formulas to fall within such a tight window for small molecules. A thorough search confirms that $C_9H_9NO_3$ is the only formula that satisfies all the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct formulas that satisfy all constraints is 1.",

The components are ordered by increasing $m/z$.\n\nFor Spectrum A, the peak at $m/z = 78$ is absent, so its intensity is $0$.\n$$ \\vec{A} = (6, 9, 12, 7, 38, 0, 100, 15, 12) $$\nFor Spectrum B, all peaks in the union set are present.\n$$ \\vec{B} = (5, 7, 10, 8, 35, 9, 100, 20, 10) $$\n\nThe normalized dot product is defined as the dot product of the unit-norm versions of these vectors. If $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ are the unit vectors corresponding to $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$, the normalized dot product is $\\hat{A} \\cdot \\hat{B}$. This is equivalent to the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ between the vectors, calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Normalized Dot Product} = \\frac{\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}}{|\\vec{A}| |\\vec{B}|} $$\n\nWe compute the dot product $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}$:\n$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} A_i B_i $$\n$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = (6)(5) + (9)(7) + (12)(10) + (7)(8) + (38)(35) + (0)(9) + (100)(100) + (15)(20) + (12)(10) $$\n$$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 30 + 63 + 120 + 56 + 1330 + 0 + 10000 + 300 + 120 = 12019 $$\n\nNext, we compute the magnitudes (Euclidean norms) of $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$.\nThe magnitude of $\\vec{A}$ is $|\\vec{A}| = \\sqrt{\\sum A_i^2}$.\n$$ |\\vec{A}|^2 = 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 7^2 + 38^2 + 0^2 + 100^2 + 15^2 + 12^2 $$\n$$ |\\vec{A}|^2 = 36 + 81 + 144 + 49 + 1444 + 0 + 10000 + 225 + 144 = 12123 $$\nThe magnitude of $\\vec{B}$ is $|\\vec{B}| = \\sqrt{\\sum B_i^2}$.\n$$ |\\vec{B}|^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 + 10^2 + 8^2 + 35^2 + 9^2 + 100^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 $$\n$$ |\\vec{B}|^2 = 25 + 49 + 100 + 64 + 1225 + 81 + 10000 + 400 + 100 = 12044 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the normalized dot product:\n$$ \\text{Normalized Dot Product} = \\frac{12019}{\\sqrt{12123} \\sqrt{12044}} = \\frac{12019}{\\sqrt{12123 \\times 12044}} = \\frac{12019}{\\sqrt{146011452}} $$\n$$ \\text{Normalized Dot Product} \\approx \\frac{12019}{12083.528} \\approx 0.994660... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9947$.\n\nPart 2: Justification Regarding Isomeric Compounds\n\nThe hypothesis that the two spectra originate from structural isomers is strongly supported by the data and fundamental principles of electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry.\n\n1.  Molecular Weight: Structural isomers, by definition, have the same chemical formula and thus the same integer molecular weight. The highest observed mass peak in both spectra is at $m/z = 106$. In EI, this peak often corresponds to the molecular ion, $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\cdot}$. The presence of this peak with significant intensity ($12\\%$ in A, $10\\%$ in B) suggests that both compounds have a molecular weight of $106$ amu. This is consistent with the chemical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{10}$ for alkylbenzenes, as mentioned in the problem.\n\n2.  Characteristic Fragmentation: Both spectra share the same base peak (the most intense peak) at $m/z = 91$. This peak is a well-known, characteristic fragment for alkylbenzenes, corresponding to the highly stable tropylium cation, $[\\mathrm{C}_{7}\\mathrm{H}_{7}]^{+}$. The fact that this is the dominant fragmentation pathway for both compounds indicates they belong to the same chemical class and possess a similar core structure susceptible to this fragmentation (i.e., a benzyl-type structure).\n\n3.  Spectral Similarity: The normalized dot product, which is a measure of spectral similarity, is calculated to be $0.9947$. A value of $1.0$ would indicate identical spectra (when normalized). The computed value is extremely close to $1.0$, signifying a very high degree of similarity in the overall fragmentation patterns. While identical compounds under identical conditions should produce nearly identical spectra, structural isomers often exhibit spectra that are highly similar but with minor differences in the relative intensities of certain fragment ions. This high similarity score is therefore what one would expect for isomers.\n\n4.  Minor Differences: The subtle differences between the spectra are also consistent with the isomer hypothesis. For example, Spectrum B shows a peak at $m/z = 78$ with $9\\%$ relative intensity, which is absent in Spectrum A. The relative intensities of other shared peaks also differ slightly (e.g., $m/z$ $105$ is $15\\%$ in A vs. $20\\%$ in B). These minor variations arise because the different arrangements of atoms in structural isomers can slightly alter the energetics of specific fragmentation pathways, making some routes more or less favorable compared to others. These small differences are the very features used to distinguish between isomers.\n\nIn conclusion, the shared molecular weight, common primary fragmentation pathway, and extremely high overall spectral similarity, coupled with minor but distinct differences in ion intensities, collectively provide compelling evidence that the two spectra are likely from structural isomers of an alkylbenzene.",
