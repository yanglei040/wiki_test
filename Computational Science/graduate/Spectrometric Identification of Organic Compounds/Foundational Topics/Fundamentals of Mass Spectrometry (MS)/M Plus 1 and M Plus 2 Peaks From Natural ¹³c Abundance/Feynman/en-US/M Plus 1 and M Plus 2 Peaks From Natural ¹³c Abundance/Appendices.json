            "problem": "An unknown, straight-chain hydrocarbon is analyzed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) using Electron Ionization (EI) at $70~\\text{eV}$, and a high-resolution analyzer such that isotope peak clusters are fully resolved. The molecular ion shows a measured isotopologue intensity ratio $I_{M+1}/I_{M} = 0.132$. Assume the molecule is a saturated acyclic alkane, so that its stoichiometry is $ \\mathrm{C}_{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\mathrm{H}_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} $ with $ n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2 n_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2 $. Use the following well-established facts:\n\n- Natural isotopic mole fractions: $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ has $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0107$, and $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ (deuterium) has $p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.55 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n- Isotopic substitutions at distinct atomic sites occur independently.\n- The measured $I_{M+k}$ reflects the relative abundance of isotopologues whose total heavy-isotope mass increment is $k$, and the molecular ion formation and detection efficiencies are assumed identical across isotopologues of the same molecule.\n\nStarting from the binomial statistics of independent isotopic substitutions and the definition of the monoisotopic molecular ion as the isotopologue containing only $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, derive a leading-order expression for the ratio $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ for a hydrocarbon $ \\mathrm{C}_{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\mathrm{H}_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} $ that retains only single-substitution contributions. Then, using the alkane stoichiometry stated above and the measured ratio $0.132$, determine $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Justify neglect of higher-order substitutions in your expression, and in your reasoning, identify physical or chemical factors that could cause deviations from the ideal estimate. Express your final $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ as an integer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the number of carbon atoms, $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$, in a saturated acyclic alkane with stoichiometry $\\mathrm{C}_{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\mathrm{H}_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$, where $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2 n_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2$. This is to be achieved by analyzing the measured intensity ratio of the $(M+1)$ isotopologue peak to the monoisotopic peak, $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$, from a mass spectrum.\n\nFirst, we derive the leading-order expression for the ratio $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$. The intensity of a given isotopologue peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to its natural abundance, assuming uniform ionization and detection efficiencies. Let the natural isotopic mole fraction (abundance) of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ be $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0107$ and that of $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ (deuterium) be $p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.55 \\times 10^{-4}$. Consequently, the abundances of the most common light isotopes, $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, are $(1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})$ and $(1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})$, respectively.\n\nThe monoisotopic molecular ion, designated $M$, is composed exclusively of the most abundant, lightest isotopes. For a hydrocarbon $\\mathrm{C}_{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\mathrm{H}_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}$, this corresponds to the species containing $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ atoms of $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ atoms of $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$. Assuming isotopic substitutions are independent events, the probability of this specific isotopic combination, $P(M)$, is the product of the probabilities for each atom. The intensity $I_{M}$ is proportional to this probability:\n$$ I_{M} \\propto P(M) = (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\n\nThe $(M+1)$ peak represents all isotopologues that have a nominal mass one unit greater than the monoisotopic mass. For a hydrocarbon, this arises from two primary, mutually exclusive events:\n1.  The presence of exactly one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom and $(n_{\\mathrm{C}}-1)$ $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms, with all $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ hydrogen atoms being $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$.\n2.  The presence of exactly one $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ atom and $(n_{\\mathrm{H}}-1)$ $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ atoms, with all $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ carbon atoms being $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe probability of the first event is given by the binomial distribution for selecting one atom out of $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ to be $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, multiplied by the probability that all hydrogens are $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$:\n$$ P(\\text{one } ^{13}\\mathrm{C}) = \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}{1} p_{\\mathrm{C}}^{1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}-1} \\times (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\nSimilarly, the probability of the second event is:\n$$ P(\\text{one } ^{2}\\mathrm{H}) = \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}{1} p_{\\mathrm{H}}^{1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}-1} \\times (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}} $$\nThe total probability for the $(M+1)$ species, $P(M+1)$, is the sum of these probabilities. The intensity $I_{M+1}$ is proportional to this sum:\n$$ I_{M+1} \\propto P(M+1) = n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}-1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} + n_{\\mathrm{H}} p_{\\mathrm{H}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}-1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}} $$\nThe intensity ratio $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ is the ratio of their respective probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}-1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}} + n_{\\mathrm{H}} p_{\\mathrm{H}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}-1} (1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}}{(1-p_{\\mathrm{C}})^{n_{\\mathrm{C}}} (1-p_{\\mathrm{H}})^{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}} $$\nSimplifying this expression by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator yields:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{C}}} + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{H}} p_{\\mathrm{H}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\nThe problem asks for a leading-order expression. Since the isotopic abundances $p_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are very small compared to $1$ ($p_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 10^{-2}$, $p_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 10^{-4}$), we can use the first-order Taylor approximation $1/(1-x) \\approx 1+x$ for small $x$, or more simply, approximate the denominators as $1-p_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 1$ and $1-p_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 1$. This simplification gives the leading-order expression:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} \\approx n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}} + n_{\\mathrm{H}} p_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\nThis approximation is justified because it neglects terms of order $p^2$ and higher. For instance, the next term in the expansion for carbon is $n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}}^2$, which is significantly smaller than $n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\nThe neglect of higher-order substitutions (e.g., two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms, or one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and one $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$) is justified on the same grounds. These events contribute to the $M+2$ peak. Their probabilities are proportional to products of small abundance values, such as $p_{\\mathrm{C}}^2$, $p_{\\mathrm{H}}^2$, or $p_{\\mathrm{C}}p_{\\mathrm{H}}$. For example, the probability of having two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms is approximately $\\binom{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}{2} p_{\\mathrm{C}}^2$. Since $p_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.01$, $p_{\\mathrm{C}}^2 \\approx 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude smaller. Thus, the probability of a double substitution is negligible compared to that of a single substitution, validating the use of the leading-order expression for the $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio.\n\nNow, we use this derived expression to find $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$. We are given that the molecule is a saturated acyclic alkane, so $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2 n_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2$. Substituting this into the approximate formula:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} \\approx n_{\\mathrm{C}} p_{\\mathrm{C}} + (2 n_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2) p_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} \\approx n_{\\mathrm{C}}(p_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2p_{\\mathrm{H}}) + 2p_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_{M}} - 2p_{\\mathrm{H}}}{p_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2p_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\nUsing the provided numerical values: $I_{M+1}/I_{M} = 0.132$, $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0107$, and $p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.55 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx \\frac{0.132 - 2(1.55 \\times 10^{-4})}{0.0107 + 2(1.55 \\times 10^{-4})} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx \\frac{0.132 - 0.00031}{0.0107 + 0.00031} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx \\frac{0.13169}{0.01101} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 11.961 $$\nSince the number of atoms $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ must be an integer, we round the result to the nearest integer, which is $12$. Thus, the hydrocarbon is inferred to be $\\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{26}$.\n\nFinally, several factors could cause the experimental ratio to deviate from the ideal estimate:\n1.  **Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIEs)**: The assumption of identical ionization and fragmentation efficiency for all isotopologues may not hold perfectly. Heavier isotopes form slightly stronger bonds, which can lead to small differences in fragmentation rates upon electron ionization. This could alter the relative abundance of the observed molecular ions.\n2.  **Co-eluting Impurities**: In GC-MS, another substance eluting from the gas chromatograph at the same retention time could contribute interfering ions at the $m/z$ values of $M$ or $M+1$.\n3.  **Ion-Molecule Reactions**: At non-ideal vacuum conditions in the ion source, reactions between ions and neutral molecules (e.g., protonation to form $[M+H]^+$) can occur, which would artificially increase the intensity of the $M+1$ signal.\n4.  **Natural Variation in Isotopic Abundance**: The values of $p_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are global averages. The specific isotopic composition of the sample can vary slightly based on its biological or geological origin.\n\nDespite these potential sources of error, the calculation provides a robust estimate for the number of carbon atoms.",

The focus is on the origin and assignment of $M+1$ and $M+2$ peaks arising from the natural abundance of isotopes, specifically the contributions from carbon-$13$ ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) and other heteroatom isotopes. Consider a singly charged species with elemental composition $C_{10}H_{14}N_{2}O_{2}S^{+}$ measured in an Orbitrap-type instrument operated at resolving power $R = 240{,}000$ (defined at $m/z = 200$).

The differences between these exact $\\delta$ values exceed the instrument’s $\\Delta m$ at $m_{0}$, so treating $M+1$ and $M+2$ as nominal $+1$ and $+2$ collapses distinct fine-structure peaks and causes elemental misassignments (for example, confusing $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ at $\\delta \\approx 1.995796$ with “two mass units”).\n\nB.

Calculation of Exact Mass Offsets, $\\delta$, for $M+1$ Isotopologues**\n\nThe mass offset, $\\delta$, for a single isotopic substitution is the difference between the exact mass of the heavy isotope and the light isotope.\n$\\delta = m(\\text{heavy}) - m(\\text{light})$.\n\n-   **$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{13}\\mathrm{C} \\leftarrow ^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 13.003355 - 12.000000 = 1.003355 \\ u$\n-   **$^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{2}\\mathrm{H} \\leftarrow ^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 2.014102 - 1.007825 = 1.006277 \\ u$\n-   **$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{15}\\mathrm{N} \\leftarrow ^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 15.000109 - 14.003074 = 0.997035 \\ u$\n-   **$^{17}\\mathrm{O}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{17}\\mathrm{O} \\leftarrow ^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 16.999132 - 15.994915 = 1.004217 \\ u$\n-   **$^{33}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{33}\\mathrm{S} \\leftarrow ^{32}\\mathrm{S}) = 32.971458 - 31.972071 = 0.999387 \\ u$\n\nThe mass differences between these $M+1$ components are, for example:\n$|\\delta(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - \\delta(^{15}\\mathrm{N})| = |1.003355 - 0.997035| = 0.006320 \\ u$.\n$|\\delta(^{2}\\mathrm{H}) - \\delta(^{13}\\mathrm{C})| = |1.006277 - 1.003355| = 0.002922 \\ u$.\nBoth separations are significantly larger than $\\Delta m \\approx 0.000942 \\ u$. Therefore, the $M+1$ fine structure is resolvable.\n\n**4. Calculation of Exact Mass Offsets, $\\delta$, for $M+2$ Isotopologues**\n\n-   **$^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{34}\\mathrm{S} \\leftarrow ^{32}\\mathrm{S}) = 33.967867 - 31.972071 = 1.995796 \\ u$\n-   **$^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ substitution:**\n    $\\delta(^{18}\\mathrm{O} \\leftarrow ^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 17.999160 - 15.994915 = 2.004245 \\ u$\n-   **Two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ substitutions:**\n    $\\delta(2 \\times {}^{13}\\mathrm{C}) = 2 \\times (m(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - m(^{12}\\mathrm{C})) = 2 \\times 1.003355 = 2.006710 \\ u$\n\nThe mass differences between these $M+2$ components are:\n$|\\delta(^{18}\\mathrm{O}) - \\delta(^{34}\\mathrm{S})| = |2.004245 - 1.995796| = 0.008449 \\ u$.\n$|\\delta(2 \\times {}^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - \\delta(^{18}\\mathrm{O})| = |2.006710 - 2.004245| = 0.002465 \\ u$.\nAgain, these separations are much larger than $\\Delta m \\approx 0.000942 \\ u$. The $M+2$ fine structure is also clearly resolvable.\n\nThe key insight is that the offsets are not integers. The offset for $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ is significantly less than $2$ ($\\approx 1.996$), while the offsets for $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ and two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ are significantly greater than $2$ ($\\approx 2.004$ and $\\approx 2.007$, respectively). This difference, arising from the mass defect, is the basis for unambiguous elemental assignment at high resolution.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option correctly lists all the calculated mass offsets for both $M+1$ and $M+2$ components. It correctly concludes that the differences between these offsets exceed the instrument's resolving power. The explanation of the pitfall—that treating these as nominal $+1$ and $+2$ shifts collapses resolvable peaks and leads to misassignment (e.g., misinterpreting the peak at $m_0 + 1.995796$)—is entirely accurate and is the central principle of high-resolution mass spectrometry.\n\n**B.** This option is fundamentally incorrect. The calculations show the mass separations are significantly *larger* than $\\Delta m$, not negligible. The offsets are not integer values of $1.000000$ or $2.000000$. The contributions are not solely from carbon. This option describes a low-resolution perspective, which is explicitly contradicted by the problem's premise of high resolution.\n\n**C.** This option makes several errors. The offset for two $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ substitutions is $2 \\times 0.997035 = 1.994070 \\ u$, which is measurably different from the $1.995796 \\ u$ offset for $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$. The assignment is incorrect. The separation between the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ ($\\delta = 1.003355 \\ u$) and $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ ($\\delta = 1.006277 \\ u$) components is $0.002922 \\ u$, which is more than three times the instrument's $\\Delta m$. They are not indistinguishable.\n\n**D.** This option is incorrect. The offset $2.004245 \\ u$ corresponds precisely to $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ and not to \"two mass units exactly\" ($2.000000 \\ u$), two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ ($2.006710 \\ u$), or one $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ ($1.995796 \\ u$). The claim that precise offsets are \"instrument-dependent\" is a grave conceptual error; the mass of an isotope is a fundamental physical constant. Using nominal mass \"improves robustness\" is the antithesis of high-resolution analysis.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that is scientifically sound and consistent with the principles of high-resolution mass spectrometry.",
