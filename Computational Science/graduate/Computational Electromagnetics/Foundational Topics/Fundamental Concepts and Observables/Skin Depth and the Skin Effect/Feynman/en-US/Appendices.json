            "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic, linear, semi-infinite conducting medium occupies the half-space $z \\ge 0$. The medium has electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, magnetic permeability $\\mu$, and electric permittivity $\\varepsilon$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the time-averaged volumetric Joule heating density $q(z)$ inside a good conductor subjected to a tangential magnetic field at its surface. We begin from Maxwell's equations in a source-free region, using the time-harmonic phasor convention $\\exp(j \\omega t)$. The relevant equations are Ampere's law and Faraday's law:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{H} = \\vec{J}_{total} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -j \\omega \\vec{B} $$\nThe total current density $\\vec{J}_{total}$ in a linear, conducting medium consists of the conduction current $\\vec{J} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$ and the displacement current $j \\omega \\vec{D}$. The constitutive relations for the homogeneous, isotropic, linear medium are $\\vec{D} = \\varepsilon \\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{B} = \\mu \\vec{H}$. Substituting these into Maxwell's equations gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{H} = \\sigma \\vec{E} + j \\omega \\varepsilon \\vec{E} = (\\sigma + j \\omega \\varepsilon) \\vec{E} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -j \\omega \\mu \\vec{H} $$\nThe problem is set in the diffusion limit of a good conductor, where the conduction current dominates the displacement current. This is specified by the condition $\\sigma \\gg \\omega \\varepsilon$. Under this approximation, the term $\\sigma + j \\omega \\varepsilon$ simplifies to $\\sigma$. Ampere's law becomes:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{H} \\approx \\sigma \\vec{E} $$\nThis equation provides the first requested relation between the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the spatial variation of the magnetic field $\\vec{H}$:\n$$ \\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\nabla \\times \\vec{H} $$\nTo find the spatial dependence of the fields, we derive a wave equation for $\\vec{H}$. We take the curl of Faraday's law:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\nabla \\times (-j \\omega \\mu \\vec{H}) = -j \\omega \\mu (\\nabla \\times \\vec{H}) $$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{V}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{V}$, and substituting $\\nabla \\times \\vec{H} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$, we get:\n$$ \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{E} = -j \\omega \\mu \\sigma \\vec{E} $$\nFrom $\\nabla \\times \\vec{H} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$, taking the divergence gives $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\vec{H}) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\sigma \\vec{E})$. The divergence of a curl is always zero, so $\\sigma (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) = 0$. For a non-zero conductivity $\\sigma$, this implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. The wave equation for $\\vec{E}$ thus simplifies to the vector Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\vec{E} = j \\omega \\mu \\sigma \\vec{E} $$\nA similar equation can be derived for $\\vec{H}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{H}) = \\nabla \\times (\\sigma \\vec{E}) = \\sigma (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\sigma (-j \\omega \\mu \\vec{H}) = -j \\omega \\mu \\sigma \\vec{H} $$\nUsing the vector identity and $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\mu \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{H} = 0$, which implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{H} = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\vec{H} = j \\omega \\mu \\sigma \\vec{H} $$\nThe problem states that all field quantities are independent of $x$ and $y$, so $\\partial/\\partial x = 0$ and $\\partial/\\partial y = 0$. The operator $\\nabla^2$ reduces to $d^2/dz^2$. The boundary condition is $\\vec{H}(z=0) = H_0 \\hat{x}$, which means the magnetic field is polarized in the $\\hat{x}$-direction. There are no sources to generate other components, so we can write $\\vec{H}(z) = H_x(z) \\hat{x}$. The Helmholtz equation for $H_x(z)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 H_x(z)}{dz^2} = j \\omega \\mu \\sigma H_x(z) $$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation of the form $d^2f/dz^2 - \\gamma^2 f = 0$, where the propagation constant $\\gamma$ is given by $\\gamma^2 = j \\omega \\mu \\sigma$. The general solution is $H_x(z) = A e^{-\\gamma z} + B e^{\\gamma z}$.\n\nTo find the specific value of $\\gamma$, we evaluate the square root of $j$:\n$$ j = \\exp(j\\pi/2) \\implies \\sqrt{j} = \\exp(j\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/4) + j\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nWe choose the root with a positive real part to satisfy the radiation condition that fields decay as $z \\to \\infty$. Thus:\n$$ \\gamma = \\sqrt{j \\omega \\mu \\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\omega \\mu \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu \\sigma}{2}} (1+j) $$\nThe real part of $\\gamma$, $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\omega \\mu \\sigma / 2}$, is the attenuation constant. The imaginary part, $\\beta = \\sqrt{\\omega \\mu \\sigma / 2}$, is the phase constant. The skin depth, $\\delta$, is defined as the inverse of the attenuation constant, $\\delta = 1/\\alpha = \\sqrt{2/(\\omega \\mu \\sigma)}$. So, $\\gamma$ can be written as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\delta} + j\\frac{1}{\\delta}$.\n\nThe radiation condition, $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} H_x(z) = 0$, requires that the coefficient of the growing exponential, $B$, must be zero. The solution is of the form $H_x(z) = A e^{-\\gamma z}$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $z=0$, $H_x(0) = H_0$, we find $A=H_0$. Therefore, the magnetic field inside the conductor is:\n$$ \\vec{H}(z) = H_0 e^{-\\gamma z} \\hat{x} = H_0 \\exp\\left(-z \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu \\sigma}{2}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-j z \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu \\sigma}{2}}\\right) \\hat{x} $$\nNext, we find the electric field using the relation $\\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\nabla \\times \\vec{H}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{H} = \\nabla \\times (H_x(z) \\hat{x}) = \\frac{d H_x}{dz} \\hat{y} = (-\\gamma H_x(z)) \\hat{y} $$\n$$ \\vec{E}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (-\\gamma H_x(z)) \\hat{y} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma} H_0 e^{-\\gamma z} \\hat{y} $$\nThe time-averaged volumetric Joule heating density, $q(z)$, is given by $q(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}\\{\\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E}^*\\}$, where $\\vec{E}^*$ is the complex conjugate of $\\vec{E}$. Using Ohm's law, $\\vec{J} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ q(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}\\{\\sigma \\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{E}^*\\} = \\frac{\\sigma}{2} |\\vec{E}(z)|^2 $$\nWe now calculate $|\\vec{E}(z)|^2$:\n$$ |\\vec{E}(z)|^2 = \\left| -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma} H_0 e^{-\\gamma z} \\right|^2 = \\frac{|\\gamma|^2}{\\sigma^2} |H_0|^2 |e^{-\\gamma z}|^2 $$\nHere, $H_0$ is the phasor amplitude at the boundary, and we assume it is real, representing the peak field value, so $|H_0|^2 = H_0^2$.\nThe term $|\\gamma|^2 = |\\gamma^2| = |j \\omega \\mu \\sigma| = \\omega \\mu \\sigma$.\nThe term $|e^{-\\gamma z}|^2$ is $|e^{-(\\alpha+j\\beta)z}|^2 = |e^{-\\alpha z} e^{-j\\beta z}|^2 = (e^{-\\alpha z})^2 = e^{-2\\alpha z}$.\nSubstituting $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\omega \\mu \\sigma / 2}$:\n$$ e^{-2\\alpha z} = \\exp\\left(-2z \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu \\sigma}{2}}\\right) = \\exp(-z \\sqrt{2 \\omega \\mu \\sigma}) $$\nCombining these results to find $q(z)$:\n$$ q(z) = \\frac{\\sigma}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\omega \\mu \\sigma}{\\sigma^2} H_0^2 \\right) \\exp(-z \\sqrt{2 \\omega \\mu \\sigma}) $$\n$$ q(z) = \\frac{\\sigma}{2} \\frac{\\omega \\mu}{\\sigma} H_0^2 \\exp(-z \\sqrt{2 \\omega \\mu \\sigma}) $$\n$$ q(z) = \\frac{\\omega \\mu H_0^2}{2} \\exp(-z \\sqrt{2 \\omega \\mu \\sigma}) $$\nThis expression for $q(z)$ is in terms of the required parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\omega$, $H_0$, and $z$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem concerns the behavior of time-harmonic electromagnetic fields in and around a good conductor. The governing equations are Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain (assuming $e^{j\\omega t}$ time dependence):\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -j\\omega\\mathbf{B} = -j\\omega\\mu\\mathbf{H} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J} + j\\omega\\mathbf{D} = (\\sigma + j\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field, $\\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, $\\epsilon$ is the electric permittivity, and $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity.\n\nTaking the curl of the first equation and substituting the second gives the vector Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = -j\\omega\\mu(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}) = -j\\omega\\mu(\\sigma + j\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E} $$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E}$ and assuming no free charges in the conductor ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$), we get:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E} = j\\omega\\mu(\\sigma + j\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E} = \\gamma^2 \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\sqrt{j\\omega\\mu(\\sigma + j\\omega\\epsilon)}$ is the propagation constant.\n\nFor copper at $f=10\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$:\n- $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- The ratio of conduction current to displacement current is $\\sigma/(\\omega\\epsilon)$. For copper, $\\epsilon \\approx \\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.\n- $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega\\epsilon} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^7}{(2\\pi \\times 10^7)(8.854 \\times 10^{-12})} \\approx 1.04 \\times 10^{11} \\gg 1$.\nThis confirms that copper is an excellent conductor at this frequency, so we can neglect the displacement current term: $\\sigma + j\\omega\\epsilon \\approx \\sigma$.\n\nThe propagation constant simplifies to $\\gamma \\approx \\sqrt{j\\omega\\mu\\sigma}$. Using $\\sqrt{j} = (1+j)/\\sqrt{2}$, we have:\n$$ \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\omega\\mu\\sigma} \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\alpha + j\\beta $$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}{2}}$.\n\nA plane wave propagating in the $z$-direction into the conductor decays as $e^{-\\gamma z} = e^{-\\alpha z}e^{-j\\beta z}$. The amplitude of the fields is attenuated by a factor of $1/e$ over a characteristic distance known as the **skin depth**, $\\delta$.\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}} $$\nThis exponential decay is the attenuation mechanism responsible for the skin effect, driven by the energy dissipation from induced eddy currents (Joule heating). The field variation is confined to a thin boundary layer of thickness on the order of $\\delta$.\n\nLet's calculate the skin depth for the given parameters:\n$$ \\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{(2\\pi \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m})(5.8 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{S/m})}} $$\n$$ \\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{8\\pi^2 \\times 5.8 \\times 10^7}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{4.58 \\times 10^9}} \\approx 2.09 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nSo, $\\delta \\approx 0.021\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Comparison of Length Scales:**\n- Skin Depth: $\\delta \\approx 0.021\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Conductor Thickness: $T = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Baseline Mesh Size: $h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nWe observe that $h \\approx 24 \\delta$. The baseline mesh size is more than an order of magnitude larger than the skin depth. A numerical method using finite elements of size $h$ and polynomial order $p=2$ cannot resolve physical phenomena that vary on the length scale of $\\delta$ when $h \\gg \\delta$. The polynomial basis functions are incapable of representing the steep exponential decay $e^{-x/\\delta}$ and rapid phase variation $e^{-jx/\\delta}$ (where the local \"wavelength\" is $2\\pi/\\beta = 2\\pi\\delta$).\n\nThis under-resolution leads to a gross misrepresentation of the wave propagation inside the conductor. The numerical wave impedance at the air-copper interface becomes drastically different from the physical wave impedance, causing large, non-physical (spurious) reflections of energy back into the air domain. This pollutes the entire solution, rendering predictions of surface current density and Joule losses inaccurate.\n\nTo prevent this, the mesh resolution in the direction normal to the conductor surface, $h_{\\text{normal}}$, must be fine enough to capture the field decay. A common rule for a polynomial order $p$ scheme is to have several degrees of freedom within the characteristic length scale $\\delta$. A quantitative requirement is typically $h_{\\text{normal}} \\le \\delta/N$ for some integer $N > 1$, where the choice of $N$ depends on the desired accuracy and the polynomial order $p$. For accurate loss prediction, a high resolution is needed, e.g., $N \\in [3, 5]$ for $p=2$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Because the free-space wavelength in air is large compared to $h$, a uniform mesh with $h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $p = 2$ is sufficient to avoid numerical dispersion and spurious reflections at the copper–air interface, and will capture the near-surface fields accurately without special refinement.**\nThe free-space wavelength is $\\lambda_0 = c/f = (3\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s})/(10\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 30\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Indeed, $\\lambda_0 \\gg h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, so the mesh is adequate for resolving waves in the air. However, the critical failure of this statement is ignoring the physics inside the conductor. As calculated, the skin depth is $\\delta \\approx 0.021\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The mesh size $h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is vastly larger than $\\delta$. A uniform mesh with this size is completely incapable of resolving the skin effect boundary layer. This will lead to massive spurious reflections and incorrect results for surface fields and losses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. An $hp$-adaptive boundary layer mesh that enforces near-surface element thickness $h_{b}$ in the surface-normal direction satisfying $h_{b} \\le \\delta/5$ with polynomial order $p_{b} \\ge 3$, combined with much coarser elements in directions tangential to the surface and in the interior ($h_{\\mathrm{tan}}, h_{\\mathrm{int}} \\gg \\delta$), yields accurate surface current density and Joule loss predictions while controlling cost.**\nThis statement describes a standard and effective strategy for skin effect problems. It correctly identifies the need for a highly anisotropic mesh that is very fine only in the direction normal to the surface, where fields vary rapidly. The proposed resolution criterion, $h_{b} \\le \\delta/5$, places at least 5 elements within one skin depth, which, especially when combined with a higher polynomial order ($p_{b} \\ge 3$), provides excellent resolution of the exponential decay. Allowing for much coarser elements tangentially and in the deep interior ($h_{\\mathrm{tan}}, h_{\\mathrm{int}} \\gg \\delta$) is appropriate since fields vary slowly in those regions. This $hp$-adaptive approach accurately captures the essential physics while being computationally efficient compared to a uniformly fine mesh.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Reducing the time-step size $\\Delta t$ in a time-domain discretization, while keeping the same coarse spatial mesh with $h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, eliminates the spurious reflections caused by under-resolution of the skin layer and suffices to predict accurate surface currents and losses.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. First, the problem is posed in the **frequency domain**, where there is no time-stepping and thus no \"time-step size $\\Delta t$\". Second, even if a time-domain method were used, the spurious reflections are a result of **spatial** under-resolution of the mesh ($h \\gg \\delta$). Reducing the time step $\\Delta t$ affects numerical stability (e.g., the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition) and temporal accuracy, but it cannot compensate for a spatial mesh that is too coarse to represent the field's spatial profile. The spatial discretization error would remain dominant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A surface impedance boundary condition derived from Maxwell’s equations for a good conductor, characterized by equal magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts of the surface impedance and valid when $\\delta$ is much smaller than the radius of curvature and thickness $T$, can be applied on a coarse mesh to significantly reduce the need to volumetrically resolve the skin layer and still yield accurate current and loss predictions.**\nThis describes the Surface Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC), a powerful asymptotic model. For a good conductor, the surface impedance is $Z_s = \\sqrt{j\\omega\\mu/\\sigma} = (1+j)\\sqrt{\\omega\\mu/(2\\sigma)} = (1+j)/(\\sigma\\delta)$. The real part (surface resistance) and imaginary part (surface reactance) are indeed equal: $R_s = X_s = 1/(\\sigma\\delta)$. The SIBC relates the tangential electric and magnetic fields at the surface, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{tan}} = Z_s (\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{tan}} \\times \\hat{n})$, effectively replacing the entire volume of the conductor with a boundary condition. This entirely obviates the need to mesh the conductor's interior, thus drastically reducing computational cost. The method's validity requires that the skin depth $\\delta$ be much smaller than the conductor thickness and local radii of curvature. In our case, $\\delta \\approx 0.021\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\ll T=5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. While sharp corners ($R_c=0$) violate this condition locally, the SIBC is still an excellent approximation for the overall losses and fields on the flat portions of the busbar. The statement correctly describes the SIBC, its properties, its validity conditions, and its primary benefit.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. A multiscale coupling that resolves the skin layer explicitly with a thin boundary-layer mesh and imposes a homogenized interior conduction model through a mortar-type interface or matched asymptotics reduces numerical dispersion and spurious reflections when $\\delta \\ll T$, and enables accurate surface current density and losses with substantially fewer degrees of freedom than a globally uniform fine mesh.**\nThis statement describes a general and advanced class of numerical techniques suitable for this multiscale problem. \"Matched asymptotics\" is the rigorous mathematical theory used to derive simplified models like the SIBC (Option D). \"Mortar-type interface\" methods are domain decomposition techniques for coupling dissimilar meshes, such as a fine boundary layer mesh (as in Option B) with a coarse mesh for the interior/exterior domain. By explicitly or asymptotically modeling the thin boundary layer, these methods correctly capture the field behavior, thus reducing numerical dispersion and spurious reflections. Their primary motivation is to achieve high accuracy with far fewer degrees of freedom than a brute-force, globally fine mesh. This statement is conceptually sound and accurately describes the state-of-the-art in this area.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
