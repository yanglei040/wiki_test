            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed thought experiment in computational electromagnetics, designed to probe the consequences of violating the discrete charge continuity condition in the standard Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. We may proceed with a rigorous analysis based on the discrete form of Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe FDTD method updates the electric and magnetic fields in a time-staggered fashion. The update for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is derived by a central-difference approximation of Ampère's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\partial \\mathbf{D}/\\partial t + \\mathbf{J}$. On the Yee grid, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{D}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{D}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\nabla_h \\times \\mathbf{H}^{n+1/2} - \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{D}^n$ is the discrete electric displacement at time $t^n = n \\Delta t$, $\\mathbf{H}^{n+1/2}$ is the discrete magnetic field at time $t^{n+1/2} = (n+1/2)\\Delta t$, $\\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2}$ is the source current density, and $\\nabla_h \\times$ is the discrete curl operator.\n\nThe central task is to determine the evolution of the discrete Gauss-law residual, defined as $r^n := \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n - \\rho^n$, where $\\nabla_h \\cdot$ is the discrete divergence operator.

Applying this to the magnetic field term, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^{n+1} = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2})\n$$\nThis equation is the discrete analogue of the charge continuity equation. It shows how the divergence of the displacement field evolves over time, driven by the divergence of the current density.\n\nNow, we use the definition of the residual, $r^n = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n - \\rho^n$, which can be written as $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n = r^n + \\rho^n$. Substituting this into the evolution equation for $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\nr^{n+1} + \\rho^{n+1} = (r^n + \\rho^n) - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2})\n$$\nThe problem states that the charge density $\\rho^n$ is held constant at zero for all time steps, so $\\rho^n = \\rho^{n+1} = 0$. The equation for the evolution of the residual $r^n$ simplifies to:\n$$\nr^{n+1} = r^n - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2})\n$$\nLet's analyze the evolution of $r^n$ based on the given conditions.\nThe initial conditions are $\\mathbf{E}^0 = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\rho^0 = 0$. Since the medium is linear, $\\mathbf{D}^0 = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{E}^0 = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the initial residual is $r^0 = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^0 - \\rho^0 = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\nDuring the source injection period, $0 \\le n \\le N_s-1$, the source is active and has a nonzero discrete divergence, $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2} \\neq 0$. The residual accumulates at each time step:\n$r^1 = r^0 - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{1/2}) = - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{1/2})$\n$r^2 = r^1 - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{3/2}) = - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{1/2} + \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{3/2})$\nIn general, for $n \\le N_s$:\n$$\nr^n = - \\Delta t \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{k+1/2}\n$$\nThe residual grows over this interval.\n\nAfter the source is turned off, for $n \\ge N_s$, the source's divergence is identically zero, $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2} = 0$. The evolution equation for the residual becomes:\n$$\nr^{n+1} = r^n\n$$\nThis means that for all $n \\ge N_s$, the residual stops changing and \"freezes\" at the value it attained at $n=N_s$: $r^n = r^{N_s}$.\n\nThe effect of this persistent, non-zero residual must be examined. Since $\\rho^n$ is held at $0$, the residual is equal to the divergence of the displacement field: $r^n = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n$. A non-zero divergence of $\\mathbf{D}$ (and thus $\\mathbf{E}$) is equivalent to the presence of a static net charge. This residual $r^{N_s}$ acts as an effective, non-physical discrete charge density that has been numerically injected into the simulation domain.\n\nBy the Helmholtz decomposition theorem, the electric field $\\mathbf{E}^n$ can be split into an irrotational (longitudinal) part $\\mathbf{E}_L^n$ and a solenoidal (transverse) part $\\mathbf{E}_T^n$. The irrotational part has zero curl ($\\nabla_h \\times \\mathbf{E}_L^n = \\mathbf{0}$) and carries all the divergence ($\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_L^n = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{E}^n$). The solenoidal part has zero divergence ($\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_T^n = \\mathbf{0}$) and carries all the curl.\nThe persistent residual $r^n$ for $n \\ge N_s$ sources a persistent, static, irrotational electric field component $\\mathbf{E}_L$ satisfying $\\nabla_h \\cdot (\\varepsilon \\mathbf{E}_L) = r^{N_s}$. This is a discrete Poisson equation. This longitudinal field component is static; it does not propagate or radiate away, as its evolution is not governed by the curl-based wave equations. The transverse components, $\\mathbf{E}_T$ and $\\mathbf{H}$, evolve according to the usual FDTD wave dynamics, largely unaffected by the static longitudinal field. If the inconsistent source were sustained indefinitely with a non-zero time average, the residual $r^n$ would grow linearly in time, causing the non-physical longitudinal electric field to grow without bound, leading to numerical instability.\n\nBased on this derivation, we evaluate the options:\n\nA. The discrete Gauss-law residual $r^n$ remains identically zero for all $n$ because the Yee scheme preserves $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n = \\rho^n$ automatically; any inconsistency in the source is annihilated by the property $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\nabla_h \\times \\mathbf{H}^{n+1/2} = 0$, so the fields remain unaffected globally.\n**Incorrect**. The derivation $r^{n+1} = r^n - \\Delta t (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2})$ shows that $r^n$ does not remain zero. The property $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\nabla_h \\times \\mathbf{H}^{n+1/2} = 0$ is what leads to the accumulation of the residual, not its annihilation. The Yee scheme does not automatically enforce $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n = \\rho^n$; it enforces a discrete continuity equation that relates the time-derivative of $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$ to $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$.\n\nB. The discrete Gauss-law residual $r^n$ accumulates the inconsistency introduced by the source according to $r^{n+1} = r^n - \\Delta t \\, \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2}$ when $\\rho^n$ is held fixed, so $r^n$ grows step-by-step during $0 \\le n \\le N_s-1$ and then freezes for $n \\ge N_s$. This residual acts as an effective discrete charge that sources a nonpropagating, irrotational (longitudinal) component of $\\mathbf{E}$ that persists after the source is turned off; if the source with nonzero time-average $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^{n+1/2}$ is sustained indefinitely, the longitudinal field grows without bound approximately linearly in $n$, while the curl-driven transverse dynamics proceed normally.\n**Correct**. This statement perfectly summarizes the conclusions of the derivation. The update rule, the accumulation and freezing of the residual, its interpretation as an effective charge, and the resulting non-propagating longitudinal field component are all correctly described. The behavior under a sustained source is also correctly stated.\n\nC. The discrete Gauss-law residual $r^n$ is radiated away at approximately the speed $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu \\varepsilon}$ by the displacement current term $\\partial \\mathbf{D}/\\partial t$; the fields remain purely solenoidal and any irrotational electric component is strictly forbidden by the Yee staggering, so no persistent error remains after a few time steps.\n**Incorrect**. The residual corresponds to a static charge error, which sources a static (zero-frequency) field component. Static fields do not radiate. The standard FDTD algorithm does not provide a mechanism to propagate this error away. Irrotational fields are not forbidden by the Yee lattice; they are simply uncoupled from the transverse wave propagation dynamics.\n\nD. The discrete Gauss-law residual $r^n$ excites only magnetic modes through Faraday’s law; therefore $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{E}^n$ remains exactly zero for all $n$ in a linear isotropic medium, regardless of the source inconsistency, and the electric field is unaffected.\n**Incorrect**. The residual is defined in terms of $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n$, so it is directly a measure of electric field divergence. The derivation shows $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{D}^n$ becomes non-zero, contradicting the claim that it remains exactly zero. The source inconsistency primarily affects the irrotational part of the electric field, not magnetic modes via Faraday's Law.\n\nE. The discrete Gauss-law residual $r^n$ decays exponentially due to numerical dispersion with a decay rate proportional to the Courant number $\\Delta t/\\Delta x$; any longitudinal component of $\\mathbf{E}$ is rapidly damped and vanishes as $n \\to \\infty$ even if the inconsistent source is sustained.\n**Incorrect**. The standard lossless FDTD scheme contains no intrinsic damping mechanism that would cause a static, zero-frequency error mode to decay. Numerical dispersion describes the frequency-dependence of the phase velocity of propagating waves, it does not cause damping of static fields. The residual persists or grows, it does not decay.",
