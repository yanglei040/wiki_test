            "problem": "Consider the frequency-domain Maxwell curl-curl formulation for Transverse Electric (TE) polarization in two spatial dimensions, where the in-plane electric field $\\mathbf{E}(x,y)$ satisfies the variational problem with uniform material parameters magnetic permeability $\\mu>0$ and electric permittivity $\\epsilon>0$. Let the computational domain be the unit square $\\Omega=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$, partitioned into two triangles $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ that exactly tile the square: $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ with vertices $\\mathbf{v}_{1}=(0,0)$, $\\mathbf{v}_{2}=(1,0)$, $\\mathbf{v}_{3}=(0,1)$, and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ with vertices $\\mathbf{v}_{4}=(1,1)$, $\\mathbf{v}_{5}=(0,1)$, $\\mathbf{v}_{6}=(1,0)$. The interior edge shared by $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ is the segment joining $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.\n\nAdopt the lowest-order Nédélec first-kind edge elements on each triangle, with three edge-based basis functions per triangle, and define the degrees of freedom associated with each oriented geometric edge by the line integral of the tangential component of $\\mathbf{E}$ over that edge. On each triangle $\\mathcal{T}$ with barycentric coordinates $\\lambda_{1}$, $\\lambda_{2}$, $\\lambda_{3}$ and constant gradients $\\nabla\\lambda_{i}$, use the canonical edge basis functions associated with edge $\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\mathbf{v}_{j}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_{ij}=\\lambda_{i}\\nabla\\lambda_{j}-\\lambda_{j}\\nabla\\lambda_{i},\\quad i\\neq j,\\quad i,j\\in\\{1,2,3\\}.\n$$\nDiscretize the TE variational problem in a broken $H(\\mathrm{curl})$ space and employ an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin formulation on the internal edge only, with a symmetric consistent numerical flux and penalty parameter $\\sigma>0$, so that the global system retains all per-element edge degrees of freedom without conforming identification across the interface. Assume that the boundary is perfectly matched with no external coupling terms added to the bilinear form so that only the interior-edge numerical flux contributes inter-element coupling.\n\nNumber the six global degrees of freedom by assigning the three edge degrees of freedom of $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ first and those of $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ second, in the following order: for $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$, DOF 1 is the bottom edge from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, DOF 2 is the left edge from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$, and DOF 3 is the interior diagonal edge from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$ as seen by $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$; for $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$, DOF 4 is the top edge from $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$, DOF 5 is the interior diagonal edge from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$ as seen by $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$, and DOF 6 is the right edge from $(1,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\n\nStarting from Maxwell’s equations and the definition of the lowest-order Nédélec first-kind basis functions, explicitly construct the $3\\times 3$ element stiffness matrix $A_{e}$ for each triangle, expressing each entry symbolically in terms of $\\mu$, $\\epsilon$, the angular frequency $\\omega$, the triangle area $|\\mathcal{T}|$, and the constant quantities $\\nabla\\lambda_{i}$ for that triangle.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the sparsity structure of a $6 \\times 6$ global stiffness matrix resulting from a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the 2D vector Helmholtz equation. The process involves analyzing the structure of the element matrices and the coupling terms introduced by the interior penalty method.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem is validated by extracting the givens and assessing them against the criteria of scientific soundness, well-posedness, and objectivity.\n\n**Extracted Givens:**\n-   **Equation:** Frequency-domain Maxwell curl-curl formulation for TE polarization, $\\nabla \\times (\\mu^{-1} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) - \\omega^2 \\epsilon \\mathbf{E} = 0$.\n-   **Domain:** Unit square $\\Omega=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n-   **Mesh:** Two triangles, $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ with vertices $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ with vertices $(1,1), (0,1), (1,0)$.\n-   **Shared Edge:** The segment joining $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.\n-   **Discretization:** Lowest-order Nédélec first-kind edge elements, $\\mathbf{N}_{ij}=\\lambda_{i}\\nabla\\lambda_{j}-\\lambda_{j}\\nabla\\lambda_{i}$.\n-   **Formulation:** Broken $H(\\mathrm{curl})$ space with a symmetric, consistent interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) method on the internal edge only.\n-   **Degrees of Freedom (DOFs):** Non-conforming, with 6 total DOFs.\n    -   $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ DOFs: 1: $(0,0)\\to(1,0)$, 2: $(0,0)\\to(0,1)$, 3: $(1,0)\\to(0,1)$.\n    -   $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ DOFs: 4: $(0,1)\\to(1,1)$, 5: $(1,0)\\to(0,1)$, 6: $(1,0)\\to(1,1)$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the standard finite element analysis of Maxwell's equations. The formulation, including Nédélec elements and IPDG, is a well-established topic in computational electromagnetics. The problem is well-posed, providing a detailed and self-consistent setup that leads to a unique sparsity pattern. The language is objective and precise. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Sparsity Pattern\n\nThe global matrix $A$ is assembled from contributions from each element and the interior edge. The entry $A_{ij}$ is computed from a bilinear form $a_h(\\mathbf{N}_j, \\mathbf{N}_i)$, where $\\mathbf{N}_k$ is the global basis function for DOF $k$.\n$$\na_h(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{T}_k} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{U}) (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) - \\omega^2 \\epsilon \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\mathbf{V} \\right) d\\mathbf{x} + j_{e}(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V})\n$$\nwhere $j_e$ is the IPDG term on the interior edge $e$.\n\n**Element Matrix Structure**\n\nFor each triangle $\\mathcal{T}$, the local element matrix $A_e$ has entries $A_{e,ij} = a_{\\mathcal{T}}(\\mathbf{N}_j, \\mathbf{N}_i)$, where $a_{\\mathcal{T}}$ is the part of the bilinear form integrated over $\\mathcal{T}$.\n$$A_e = \\frac{1}{\\mu} K_e - \\omega^2 \\epsilon M_e$$\nwith\n$$\nK_{e,ij} = \\int_{\\mathcal{T}} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{N}_i) (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{N}_j) d\\mathbf{x}\n$$\n$$\nM_{e,ij} = \\int_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_j d\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nFor the lowest-order Nédélec basis function $\\mathbf{N}_{uv} = \\lambda_u\\nabla\\lambda_v - \\lambda_v\\nabla\\lambda_u$, its curl is a constant on the triangle: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{N}_{uv} = 2 \\det(\\nabla\\lambda_u, \\nabla\\lambda_v)$. It can be shown that for any pair of vertices $u,v,w,z$ on a triangle, $\\det(\\nabla\\lambda_u, \\nabla\\lambda_v) = \\pm\\det(\\nabla\\lambda_w, \\nabla\\lambda_z)$. Therefore, for the three basis functions on a single triangle, the curl is a constant $C_{\\mathcal{T}}$ (up to a sign, which squares out). The stiffness matrix entries are $K_{e,ij} = C_{\\mathcal{T}}^2 |\\mathcal{T}| / \\mu$, which are all non-zero. The stiffness matrix $K_e$ is a dense $3 \\times 3$ matrix.\n\nThe mass matrix entries $M_{e,ij}$ involve integrals of products of different basis functions. These basis functions are not orthogonal, and for a general triangle, $\\int_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_j d\\mathbf{x} \\neq 0$ for $i \\neq j$. Thus, $M_e$ is also a dense $3 \\times 3$ matrix.\n\nConsequently, the element matrix $A_e$ is a dense $3 \\times 3$ matrix. This means the diagonal blocks of the global matrix, $A(1:3, 1:3)$ and $A(4:6, 4:6)$, are dense.\n\n**IPDG Coupling Structure**\n\nThe off-diagonal blocks of the global matrix are populated exclusively by the IPDG terms on the interior edge $e$. The IPDG bilinear form $j_e$ is given by\n$$\nj_e(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}) = - \\int_e \\left( \\{\\!\\{ \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{U} \\}\\!\\}_z [\\![ \\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{n} ]\\!]_z + \\{\\!\\{ \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V} \\}\\!\\}_z [\\![ \\mathbf{U} \\times \\mathbf{n} ]\\!]_z \\right) ds + \\int_e \\sigma [\\![ \\mathbf{U} \\times \\mathbf{n} ]\\!]_z [\\![ \\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{n} ]\\!]_z ds\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\!\\{ \\cdot \\}\\!\\}_z$ is the average of the scalar z-component of the curl, and $[\\![ \\cdot \\times \\mathbf{n} ]\\!]_z$ is the jump of the tangential component. Let $\\mathbf{t}$ be the unit tangent to $e$. The jump is $[\\![ \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\mathbf{t} ]\\!] = \\mathbf{U}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{t} - \\mathbf{U}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{t}$.\nA coupling term $A_{ij}$ between a DOF $i$ on $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and a DOF $j$ on $\\mathcal{T}_2$ is non-zero only if $j_e(\\mathbf{N}_j, \\mathbf{N}_i) \\neq 0$. This requires the tangential traces of both $\\mathbf{N}_i$ and $\\mathbf{N}_j$ to be non-zero on the edge $e$.\n\n**Analysis of Basis Functions on the Interface**\n\nLet's analyze the tangential trace of each basis function on the interface edge $e$, which is the segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$ with equation $x+y=1$. The tangent vector is $\\mathbf{t} = (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nFor $\\mathcal{T}_1$ (vertices $\\mathbf{v}_1=(0,0), \\mathbf{v}_2=(1,0), \\mathbf{v}_3=(0,1)$):\nThe barycentric coordinates are $\\lambda_1 = 1-x-y$, $\\lambda_2 = x$, $\\lambda_3 = y$. The interface is edge $\\mathbf{v}_2\\mathbf{v}_3$.\n-   **DOF 1 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_1\\mathbf{v}_2$):** Basis $\\mathbf{N}_1 \\propto \\mathbf{N}_{12} = \\lambda_1\\nabla\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_2\\nabla\\lambda_1 = (1-y, x)$. On $e$, $y=1-x$, so $\\mathbf{N}_1|_e = (x,x)$. The tangential component is $\\mathbf{N}_1|_e \\cdot \\mathbf{t} = (x,x) \\cdot (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2}) = 0$.\n-   **DOF 2 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_1\\mathbf{v}_3$):** Basis $\\mathbf{N}_2 \\propto \\mathbf{N}_{13} = \\lambda_1\\nabla\\lambda_3 - \\lambda_3\\nabla\\lambda_1 = (y, 1-x)$. On $e$, $\\mathbf{N}_2|_e = (1-x, 1-x)$. The tangential component is $\\mathbf{N}_2|_e \\cdot \\mathbf{t} = (1-x, 1-x) \\cdot (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2}) = 0$.\n-   **DOF 3 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_2\\mathbf{v}_3$):** Basis $\\mathbf{N}_3 \\propto \\mathbf{N}_{23} = \\lambda_2\\nabla\\lambda_3 - \\lambda_3\\nabla\\lambda_2 = (-y, x)$. On $e$, $\\mathbf{N}_3|_e = (x-1, x)$. The tangential component is $\\mathbf{N}_3|_e \\cdot \\mathbf{t} = (x-1, x) \\cdot (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2}) = (1-x+x)/\\sqrt{2} = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\neq 0$.\n\nFor $\\mathcal{T}_2$ (vertices $\\mathbf{v}_4=(1,1), \\mathbf{v}_5=(0,1), \\mathbf{v}_6=(1,0)$):\nThe interface is edge $\\mathbf{v}_6\\mathbf{v}_5$.\n-   **DOF 4 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_5\\mathbf{v}_4$):** By symmetry with DOF 2 (both are horizontal/vertical legs of a right triangle, evaluated on the hypotenuse), the tangential component on $e$ is zero.\n-   **DOF 5 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_6\\mathbf{v}_5$):** This is the interface edge itself. By analogy with DOF 3, its basis function $\\mathbf{N}_5$ will have a non-zero tangential component on $e$.\n-   **DOF 6 (edge $\\mathbf{v}_6\\mathbf{v}_4$):** By symmetry with DOF 1, the tangential component on $e$ is zero.\n\nThe crucial finding is that only basis functions associated with the interface edge itself (DOF 3 and DOF 5) have a non-zero tangential trace on that interface. Therefore, the IPDG formulation only creates coupling between DOF 3 and DOF 5. All other off-diagonal block entries are zero.\n\n**Global Sparsity Pattern Construction**\n\n1.  The submatrix for DOFs on $\\mathcal{T}_1$, $A(1:3, 1:3)$, is dense due to the element matrix being dense.\n2.  The submatrix for DOFs on $\\mathcal{T}_2$, $A(4:6, 4:6)$, is dense for the same reason.\n3.  The off-diagonal coupling $A_{ij}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, j \\in \\{4,5,6\\}$ is non-zero only if $i=3$ and $j=5$.\n4.  Similarly, $A_{ji}$ is non-zero only if $j=5$ and $i=3$.\n\nThis leads to the following sparsity pattern, where $1$ denotes a structurally non-zero entry and $0$ denotes a zero entry:\n-   Rows/Cols 1, 2, 3 form a dense block.\n-   Rows/Cols 4, 5, 6 form a dense block.\n-   Coupling exists only at entries $(3,5)$ and $(5,3)$.\n\nThe resulting $6 \\times 6$ sparsity matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational electromagnetics, specifically the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) or edge-based Finite Element Methods (FEM). The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to determine a unique, meaningful answer based on the topological structure of the Yee grid.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of nonzero entries per row of the matrix $K = C^{T} C$. Let the rows and columns of $K$ be indexed by the edges of the computational grid, denoted by $e_i$, $e_j$, etc. The matrix $K$ has dimensions $N_e \\times N_e$, where $N_e$ is the total number of edges. An entry $K_{ij}$ of this matrix is given by the dot product of the $i$-th and $j$-th columns of $C^{T}$, which is equivalent to the dot product of the $i$-th and $j$-th rows of the discrete curl matrix $C$. Let the faces of the grid be indexed by $k$. Then, the entry $K_{ij}$ is calculated as:\n$$K_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_f} C_{ki} C_{kj}$$\nwhere $C_{ki}$ is the entry of the incidence matrix $C$ corresponding to face $k$ and edge $i$. $C_{ki}$ is non-zero (equal to $+1$ or $-1$) if and only if edge $e_i$ is part of the boundary of face $f_k$.\n\nFrom the expression for $K_{ij}$, it is clear that $K_{ij}$ is non-zero if and only if there exists at least one face $f_k$ such that both edge $e_i$ and edge $e_j$ are part of its boundary. In other words, two edges $e_i$ and $e_j$ are coupled (resulting in a non-zero $K_{ij}$) if they share a common face. The number of nonzero entries in the $i$-th row of $K$ is therefore the total number of edges $e_j$ (including $e_i$ itself) that share at least one face with edge $e_i$.\n\nDue to the specified periodic boundary conditions and the uniform cubic Yee grid, the local connectivity is identical for every edge in the grid. We can therefore determine the number of nonzero entries by analyzing the local topology around a single, arbitrary edge, let's call it $e_i$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}(e_i)$ be the set of faces incident to the edge $e_i$. In a three-dimensional cubic lattice, any given edge is the intersection of exactly four faces. These four faces meet at the edge, arranged like the pages of a book. Therefore, the size of this set is $|\\mathcal{F}(e_i)| = 4$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{E}(f)$ be the set of edges that form the boundary of a face $f$. In a standard Yee grid composed of cubic cells, each face is a square. A square is bounded by four edges. Therefore, the size of this set is $|\\mathcal{E}(f)| = 4$.\n\nThe set of all edges that are coupled to $e_i$ is the union of the edge sets of all faces incident to $e_i$. Let this set of coupled edges be denoted by $N(e_i)$.\n$$N(e_i) = \\bigcup_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}(e_i)} \\mathcal{E}(f)$$\nThe number of nonzero entries in the row corresponding to $e_i$ is $|N(e_i)|$. We can calculate this size using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let the four faces incident to $e_i$ be $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$. Then:\n$$|N(e_i)| = \\left| \\bigcup_{k=1}^{4} \\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\right|$$\nThe formula for the union of four sets is:\n$$|N(e_i)| = \\sum_{k} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k)| - \\sum_{k<l} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l)| + \\sum_{k<l<m} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_m)| - |\\mathcal{E}(f_1) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_2) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_3) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_4)|$$\n\nWe evaluate each term:\n1.  **First term**: $\\sum_{k} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k)|$. Since each of the four faces is bounded by four edges, $|\\mathcal{E}(f_k)|=4$. The sum is $\\binom{4}{1} \\times 4 = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n2.  **Second term**: $\\sum_{k<l} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l)|$. This term accounts for the overcounting of edges shared by pairs of faces. In a standard cubic grid topology, two distinct faces $f_k$ and $f_l$ that are both incident to $e_i$ can only intersect along that single edge $e_i$. Thus, for any pair of distinct faces $f_k, f_l \\in \\mathcal{F}(e_i)$, their shared boundary edges are just the edge $e_i$ itself: $\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l) = \\{e_i\\}$. Therefore, $|\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l)| = 1$. The number of such pairs of faces is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. So, the total sum is $6 \\times 1 = 6$. This step formally verifies that there are no duplicate couplings created by multiple shared faces between the same pair of distinct edges, as posed by the problem.\n\n3.  **Third term**: $\\sum_{k<l<m} |\\mathcal{E}(f_k) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_l) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_m)|$. The intersection of the edge sets of any three distinct faces incident to $e_i$ is also just the common edge $\\{e_i\\}$. The number of such triplets of faces is $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$. The total sum is $4 \\times 1 = 4$.\n\n4.  **Fourth term**: $|\\mathcal{E}(f_1) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_2) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_3) \\cap \\mathcal{E}(f_4)|$. The intersection of all four edge sets is, again, just $\\{e_i\\}$. There is $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ such combination. The value is $1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n$$|N(e_i)| = 16 - 6 + 4 - 1 = 13$$\n\nThus, for any given edge $e_i$, there are a total of $13$ edges (including $e_i$ itself) that share a face with it. This means that the $i$-th row of the matrix $K$ contains exactly $13$ nonzero entries. This count includes the diagonal entry $K_{ii}$ (self-coupling) and $12$ off-diagonal entries $K_{ij}$ (coupling to neighboring edges).\n\nThe final answer is the total number of nonzero entries per row.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional periodic rectangular lattice modeling a toroidal discretization of a domain used in Computational Electromagnetics (CEM). The lattice has $N_x$ cells in the horizontal direction and $N_y$ cells in the vertical direction, with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. The mesh is represented by a cell complex with nodes, oriented edges, and oriented faces. The oriented edges are of two types: horizontal edges aligned with the $x$-direction and vertical edges aligned with the $y$-direction. Let the total number of edges be $E = 2 N_x N_y$ and the total number of faces be $F = N_x N_y$. A defect pattern is introduced by removing a subset of faces to model missing cells. This is a standard abstraction in global system assembly where entries of the global operator arise from local contributions associated with mesh entities; missing faces remove local contributions, modifying the sparsity and topological connectivity.\n\nStarting from Maxwell’s curl equations and the differential operator definitions, one can define a discrete curl operator on the edge space. The discrete curl maps edge degrees of freedom to face circulations by summing the oriented edge values around each face boundary. The face-edge incidence matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times E}$ encodes these oriented sums, and the discrete curl–curl operator on edges with unit Hodge weights is $A = C^\\top C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E \\times E}$. When faces are removed, the corresponding rows are removed from $C$, inducing changes in $A$ such as altered sparsity and connectivity. The kernel of $A$ is equal to the kernel of $C$, and its dimension is $E - \\operatorname{rank}(C)$.\n\nThe objective is to assemble $A$ for periodic but defective connectivity (missing faces), and to study the percolation threshold at which the edge adjacency graph induced by $A$ becomes disconnected. At this threshold, the kernel dimension of $A$ increases, complicating preconditioning. The adjacency graph is defined on the set of edges, where two distinct edges are adjacent if the corresponding off-diagonal entry of $A$ is nonzero. The number of connected components of this graph quantifies disconnection. The percolation threshold is defined here as the minimal fraction $p \\in [0,1]$ of faces removed such that the adjacency graph has more than one connected component.\n\nYour program must implement the following steps for each test case:\n1. Construct the periodic lattice with given $N_x$ and $N_y$ and enumerate the horizontal and vertical oriented edges and faces.\n2. Assemble the face-edge incidence matrix $C$ by assigning orientations so that each face’s row equals the algebraic sum of its four boundary edges in counterclockwise order, with the appropriate signs for orientation consistency.\n3. Initialize with no missing faces, then remove faces one by one in a random order (with a specified random seed $s$ for reproducibility), recomputing $C$ and $A = C^\\top C$ after each removal.\n4. After each removal, compute:\n   - The number of connected components in the edge adjacency graph induced by the off-diagonal nonzero pattern of $A$.\n   - The kernel dimension $E - \\operatorname{rank}(C)$ using a numerically stable singular value decomposition with a tolerance threshold $t = 10^{-10}$ for singular values considered zero.\n5. Stop when the graph becomes disconnected (number of components strictly greater than $1$), report the minimal fraction removed $p$ at disconnection, and report the number of connected components and kernel dimension at that threshold.\n\nYou must start from the fundamental base consisting of:\n- Maxwell’s equations and the definition of the curl operator.\n- The definition of oriented incidence in cell complexes.\n- The discrete operator assembly principle whereby global operators are formed by summing local contributions associated with mesh entities.\n\nThe program must produce a single line of output containing the aggregated results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test result is itself a list of $[p,\\text{components},\\text{nullity}]$ with $p$ a float and the other entries integers.

            "solution": "The problem posed is a valid, well-defined exercise in computational electromagnetics, grounded in the principles of discrete exterior calculus (DEC). It concerns the assembly of discrete operators on a periodic lattice and the analysis of their algebraic and topological properties as the domain is altered. We will proceed with a rigorous, step-by-step solution.\n\nThe foundation of this problem lies in the discretization of Maxwell's curl equations on a cellular complex, which here is a two-dimensional toroidal rectangular lattice. The geometric entities of this complex are a set of $0$-cells (nodes or vertices), $1$-cells (oriented edges), and $2$-cells (oriented faces). The physical degrees of freedom, such as a component of the electric field, are associated with these entities.\n\nLet the lattice have $N_x$ cells in the horizontal direction and $N_y$ cells in the vertical direction. Due to periodic boundary conditions, the lattice is topologically a torus. The number of faces (or $2$-cells) is $F = N_x N_y$, and the number of vertices ($0$-cells) is $V = N_x N_y$. Edges ($1$-cells) are of two types: $N_x N_y$ horizontal edges and $N_x N_y$ vertical edges, giving a total of $E = 2 N_x N_y$ edges.\n\nThe relationship between these entities is captured by boundary operators. The discrete curl operator is represented by the face-edge incidence matrix, denoted as $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times E}$. This matrix is a discrete representation of the continuous curl operator, mapping vector fields (represented by values on edges, i.e., $1$-forms) to scalar fields (represented by circulations on faces, i.e., $2$-forms).\n\nThe assembly of $C$ follows from the definition of the boundary of a face. We establish a consistent enumeration and orientation.\nLet faces be indexed by $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, F-1\\}$, and edges by $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, E-1\\}$. The entry $C_{km}$ is non-zero only if edge $m$ is part of the boundary of face $k$. Specifically, for a face $f_k$ with a counter-clockwise orientation, its boundary $\\partial f_k$ is a formal sum of its four boundary edges. The value of $C_{km}$ is $+1$ if edge $m$ is part of $\\partial f_k$ and its orientation matches the counter-clockwise traversal, and $-1$ if its orientation is opposite.\n\nTo implement this, we define a coordinate system $(i, j)$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$.\n- A face at $(i,j)$ is indexed $k = j \\cdot N_x + i$.\n- A horizontal edge starting at node $(i,j)$ is indexed $m = j \\cdot N_x + i$, for $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, F-1\\}$.\n- A vertical edge starting at node $(i,j)$ is indexed $m = F + j \\cdot N_x + i$, for $m \\in \\{F, \\dots, E-1\\}$.\nAll spatial indices $i$ and $j$ are taken modulo $N_x$ and $N_y$ respectively, to enforce periodicity.\n\nThe four oriented edges bounding face $(i,j)$ are:\n1. Bottom: horizontal edge at $(i,j)$, sign $+1$.\n2. Right: vertical edge at $(i+1, j)$, sign $+1$.\n3. Top: horizontal edge at $(i, j+1)$, sign $-1$ (since CCW traversal is right-to-left, opposite to edge orientation).\n4. Left: vertical edge at $(i, j)$, sign $-1$ (since CCW traversal is top-to-bottom, opposite to edge orientation).\nThese rules define the non-zero entries for each row of $C$.\n\nFrom $C$, we construct the discrete curl-curl operator $A = C^\\top C$, an $E \\times E$ matrix. An off-diagonal entry $A_{uv} = (C^\\top C)_{uv} = \\sum_k C_{ku} C_{kv}$ is non-zero if and only if edges $u$ and $v$ share at least one common face. This matrix $A$ can thus be interpreted as the adjacency matrix (up to its diagonal) of a graph where the nodes are the edges of the lattice.\n\nThe problem investigates the effect of removing faces, which models defects in the material or domain. Removing a face $f_k$ is equivalent to removing the $k$-th row from the matrix $C$. This alters $A = C^\\top C$, breaking connections in the edge-adjacency graph. The primary objective is to find the percolation threshold: the minimal fraction $p$ of randomly removed faces that disconnects this graph.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n1. For a given $N_x$, $N_y$, and random seed $s$, we first assemble the full incidence matrix $C$ for the complete toroidal lattice.\n2. A random permutation of the face indices $\\{0, \\dots, F-1\\}$ is generated using the seed $s$ to ensure reproducibility.\n3. We iterate, starting with $k=0$ faces removed (the initial state), up to $k=F$. In each step, we construct the reduced incidence matrix $C_k$ by keeping only the rows corresponding to the faces that have not been removed.\n4. For each $C_k$, we compute the curl-curl matrix $A_k = C_k^\\top C_k$.\n5. We then determine the number of connected components in the graph represented by $A_k$. This is accomplished using a standard graph traversal algorithm, such as one available in `scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components`.\n6. The iteration stops as soon as the number of connected components becomes strictly greater than $1$.\n7. At this stopping point, we report three quantities:\n    a. The fraction of removed faces, $p = k/F$.\n    b. The number of connected components.\n    c. The nullity (kernel dimension) of the operator $A_k$. Since $\\ker(A_k) = \\ker(C_k)$, the nullity is given by $\\dim(\\ker(C_k)) = E - \\operatorname{rank}(C_k)$. The rank is computed numerically from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $C_k$, counting the number of singular values exceeding a tolerance $t = 10^{-10}$.\n\nFor non-degenerate grids (where $N_x > 1$ and $N_y > 1$), the initial graph is fully connected. For degenerate \"tori\" where $N_x=1$ or $N_y=1$, the initial graph is already disconnected, and the algorithm correctly identifies the percolation threshold as $p=0$.",
