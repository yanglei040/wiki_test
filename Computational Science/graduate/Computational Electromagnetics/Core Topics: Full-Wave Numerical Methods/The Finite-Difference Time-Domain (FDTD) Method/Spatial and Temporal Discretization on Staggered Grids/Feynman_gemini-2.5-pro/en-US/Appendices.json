            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the discrete divergence operator for the electric flux density $\\mathbf{D}$ on a staggered Cartesian grid (Yee grid) and its application to a given synthetic field to find the corresponding charge density $\\rho$.\n\nThe derivation begins with the integral form of Gauss's law for the electric flux density $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\n\\iiint_{V} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\iint_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nwhere $V$ is a control volume and $\\partial V$ is its bounding surface with outward unit normal $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$.\n\nIn the context of a Yee grid, we apply this law to a single grid cell. Let the cell be indexed by $(i,j,k)$. The control volume $V$ is the rectangular prism corresponding to this cell, with volume $\\Delta V = \\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z$. The charge density $\\rho$ and the divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$ are evaluated at the cell center $(i,j,k)$.\n\nThe left-hand side of Gauss's law is approximated by assuming $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$ is constant over the small volume $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\iiint_{V} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\approx \\left.

On a staggered grid, the field components normal to each face are defined at the center of that face.\n1. Flux through faces normal to the $x$-axis:\nThe net flux in the $x$-direction is the flux out of the \"right\" face (at $i+\\frac{1}{2}$) minus the flux into the \"left\" face (at $i-\\frac{1}{2}$), which is $\\left[ D_x(i+\\frac{1}{2},j,k) - D_x(i-\\frac{1}{2},j,k) \\right] \\Delta y \\Delta z$.\n\n2.

We substitute the index $(i-1)$ into the formula for $D_x$:\n$D_x(i-\\frac{1}{2},j,k) = D_x((i-1)+\\frac{1}{2},j,k) = \\alpha (i-1) \\Delta x$.\nThe $x$-component of the discrete divergence is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{D_x(i+\\frac{1}{2},j,k) - D_x(i-\\frac{1}{2},j,k)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\alpha\\, i\\, \\Delta x - \\alpha (i-1) \\Delta x}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\alpha\\, i\\, \\Delta x - \\alpha\\, i\\, \\Delta x + \\alpha\\, \\Delta x}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\alpha\\, \\Delta x}{\\Delta x} = \\alpha\n$$\n\nFor the $y$-term and $z$-term, since the respective field components are identically zero, their differences are also zero.\n\nThe total discrete divergence at cell $(i,j,k)$ is the sum of these components:\n$$\n\\left.
