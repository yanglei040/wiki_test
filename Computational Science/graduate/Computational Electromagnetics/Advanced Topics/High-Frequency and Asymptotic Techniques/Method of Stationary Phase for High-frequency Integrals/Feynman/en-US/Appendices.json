In the Physical Optics (PO) approximation (Physical Optics (PO) is an asymptotic method for high-frequency scattering), the far-field scattered amplitude in a fixed direction can be written as a two-dimensional oscillatory surface integral over local coordinates $(x,y)$ with a rapidly varying phase and a slowly varying amplitude. Under the high-frequency assumption, the leading-order contribution is governed by the method of stationary phase applied to the integral. The phase Hessian at the specular point is linked to the surface’s second fundamental form, and its determinant depends on the product of the principal curvatures. Your task is to construct a stationary phase-based inversion to recover the local Gaussian curvature (the product of principal curvatures) at the specular point from measured high-frequency amplitudes.\n\nAssume the local surface near the specular point can be modeled as $z(x,y)=\\dfrac{x^2}{2 R_1}+\\dfrac{y^2}{2 R_2}$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the principal radii of curvature at $(0,0)$, and the principal curvatures are $\\kappa_1=\\dfrac{1}{R_1}$ and $\\kappa_2=\\dfrac{1}{R_2}$.

For a general surface element $\\mathbf{r}'(x,y) = (x, y, z(x,y))$, the integral takes the form:\n$$ I(k) = \\iint_S F(x,y) e^{i k (\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{o}}) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(x,y)} dS $$\nwhere $F(x,y)$ is a slowly varying amplitude function that includes polarization and material properties, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The surface element $dS$ can be approximated by $dx dy$ near the specular point where the surface is tangent to the $xy$-plane.\n\nFor the specified geometry of normal incidence and backscatter, we have $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{i}} = (0,0,-1)$ and $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{o}} = (0,0,1)$. The vector difference is $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{o}} = (0,0,-2)$. The phase term in the exponent is:\n$$ \\Phi(x,y) = k \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(x,y) = k (0,0,-2) \\cdot (x, y, z(x,y)) = -2k z(x,y) $$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ I(k) = \\iint F(x,y) e^{-i 2k z(x,y)} dx dy $$\nThis is a highly oscillatory integral for large $k$. According to the method of stationary phase, the dominant contribution comes from the point(s) where the gradient of the phase is zero. Let the phase function be written as $\\lambda f(x,y)$, where $\\lambda=k$ and $f(x,y)=-2z(x,y)$. The stationary point $(x_0, y_0)$ is found by solving $\\nabla f(x,y) = -2\\nabla z(x,y) = 0$. Given $z(x,y) = \\frac{x^2}{2R_1} + \\frac{y^2}{2R_2}$, the gradient components are $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = \\frac{x}{R_1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = \\frac{y}{R_2}$.

At the stationary point $(0,0)$, $f(0,0)=0$.\nThe Hessian of $f(x,y)$ is:\n$$ H_f = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}  \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2/R_1  0 \\\\ 0  -2/R_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of the Hessian is:\n$$ \\det(H_f) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{R_1}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2}{R_2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{R_1 R_2} = 4 \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2 = 4K $$\nAssuming the surface is convex (positive radii of curvature), the eigenvalues of $H_f$ are $-2/R_1$ and $-2/R_2$, which are both negative. The signature is $\\text{sgn}(H_f) = 0 - 2 = -2$. The phase factor becomes $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}(-2)} = e^{-i\\pi/2} = -i$.\n\nSubstituting these into the asymptotic formula:\n$$ I(k) \\approx F(0,0) e^{ik \\cdot 0} \\frac{2\\pi}{k \\sqrt{|4K|}} (-i) = F(0,0) \\frac{-i \\pi}{k \\sqrt{K}} $$\nThe magnitude of this integral, which the problem defines as the measured amplitude $A(k)$, is:\n$$ A(k) = |I(k)| = \\left| F(0,0) \\frac{-i \\pi}{k \\sqrt{K}} \\right| = \\frac{|F(0,0)| \\pi}{k \\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis derivation reveals that the product $k \\cdot A(k)$ should be a constant for a given surface:\n$$ P = k \\cdot A(k) = \\frac{|F(0,0)| \\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis expression contains the unknown factor $|F(0,0)|$, which relates to the reflection properties at the specular point. We can determine this constant by analyzing the provided test data. For Case $2$, we have $k_1=100$ and $A(k_1) \\approx 0.0314159$. The product is $P_2 = 100 \\times 0.0314159... = 3.14159... = \\pi$.\nThis strongly implies that the problem is constructed such that the slowly varying amplitude term at the specular point is normalized to unity, i.e., $|F(0,0)|=1$. Adopting this, our model simplifies to:\n$$ P = k \\cdot A(k) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}} $$\nThis provides the basis for the inversion. By calculating the product $P$ from the measured data, we can solve for the Gaussian curvature $K$:\n$$ \\sqrt{K} = \\frac{\\pi}{P} \\implies K = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{P} \\right)^2 $$\n\nThe algorithm is therefore as follows:\n$1$. For each set of measurements $\\{(k_j, A(k_j))\\}$, compute the constant product $P = k_j A(k_j)$. Since the data is noise-free, any single pair $(k_j, A(k_j))$ is sufficient.\n$2$. Compute the Gaussian curvature using the derived inversion formula $K = (\\pi/P)^2$.\n$3$. Report the value of $K$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ rounded to six decimal places.\n\nFor example, for Case $1$:\n$P = 100 \\times 0.02221441469079183 \\approx 2.22144147$.\n$K = (\\pi / 2.22144147)^2 = (3.14159265 / 2.22144147)^2 \\approx (1.41421356)^2 = 2$.\nThe calculations will be performed for all four cases.",
