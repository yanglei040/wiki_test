Focus on the transverse-magnetic polarization to $z$ (TM$z$) in which the nonzero field components are $(E_z, H_x, H_y)$. Starting only from Maxwell’s curl equations in differential form and the standard staggered Yee placement of the field components, construct an Alternating-Direction Implicit Finite-Difference Time-Domain (ADI-FDTD) scheme in two substeps: the first substep is implicit in the $x$-direction, and the second substep is implicit in the $y$-direction. Use a Peaceman–Rachford style time splitting, with half-step updates from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1/2}$ and from $t^{n+1/2}$ to $t^{n+1}$. \n\nYour tasks are:\n- Derive the fully discrete update relations for the first substep, implicit in $x$, that update $(H_x, H_y, E_z)$ from time index $n$ to $n+\\tfrac{1}{2}$, using centered second-order difference operators consistent with the Yee grid staggering. Clearly identify which spatial derivatives are treated implicitly and which explicitly in this substep. \n- Derive the fully discrete update relations for the second substep, implicit in $y$, that update $(H_x, H_y, E_z)$ from time index $n+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ to $n+1$, again specifying the implicit versus explicit treatment of the spatial derivatives.\n- For each substep, eliminate the magnetic field unknown implicit coupling as needed to reduce the update for $E_z$ to a one-dimensional tridiagonal linear system along the implicit direction. Explicitly write the tridiagonal stencil coefficients for the $E_z$ solve in each substep in terms of $\\Delta t$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\mu$, $\\Delta x$, and $\\Delta y$. Also provide the explicit finite-difference stencil coefficients appearing in the magnetic field updates.\n- Assume interior points and ignore boundary conditions so that standard centered differences apply everywhere. Clearly define your discrete derivative operators and the Yee staggering you adopt.\n\nFinally, from your tridiagonal system for $E_z$ in the first substep (implicit in $x$), extract the center coefficient of the tridiagonal operator (i.e., the coefficient multiplying $E_z$ at the current grid line index along $x$) as a closed-form analytical expression in terms of $\\Delta t$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\mu$, and $\\Delta x$. Report this center coefficient as your final answer. Do not include units in the final answer. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression.",

A grid point is denoted by indices $(i, j)$ corresponding to spatial coordinates $(i\\Delta x, j\\Delta y)$, and a time step is denoted by index $n$ for time $t^n = n\\Delta t$. The field components are staggered in space and time according to the standard Yee scheme for TM$_z$:\n- $E_z$ is located at $(i\\Delta x, j\\Delta y)$ and integer time steps $n\\Delta t$. We denote this as $E_z|_{i,j}^n$.\n- $H_x$ is located at $(i\\Delta x, (j+\\frac{1}{2})\\Delta y)$ and half-integer time steps $(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\Delta t$.

We denote this as $H_y|_{i+1/2, j}^{n+1/2}$.\n\nThe ADI-FDTD method, however, typically places all field components at the same time instances ($n, n+1/2, n+1$) within the algorithm. The spatial staggering is maintained:\n- $E_z \\rightarrow E_z|_{i,j}$\n- $H_x \\rightarrow H_x|_{i, j+1/2}$\n- $H_y \\rightarrow H_y|_{i+1/2, j}$\n\nWe define the second-order centered spatial difference operators consistent with this staggering:\n$$\n\\delta_x f|_{i} = \\frac{f|_{i+1/2} - f|_{i-1/2}}{\\Delta x}, \\quad \\delta_y f|_{j} = \\frac{f|_{j+1/2} - f|_{j-1/2}}{\\Delta y}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_x f|_{i+1/2} = \\frac{f|_{i+1} - f|_{i}}{\\Delta x}, \\quad \\delta_y f|_{j+1/2} = \\frac{f|_{j+1} - f|_{j}}{\\Delta y}\n$$\nFor the time derivatives over a half-step $\\Delta t/2$, we use a first-order forward difference, e.g., $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{F^{n+1/2} - F^n}{\\Delta t/2}$.\n\nThe Peaceman-Rachford splitting scheme divides the update from time $n$ to $n+1$ into two substeps. The right-hand side operator of the TM$_z$ system is split into operators containing only $x$-derivatives ($A_x$) and only $y$-derivatives ($A_y$).\n\n**Substep 1: Update from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1/2}$ (Implicit in $x$-direction)**\n\nIn this substep, the $x$-derivatives are treated implicitly (evaluated at time $n+1/2$) and the $y$-derivatives are treated explicitly (evaluated at time $n$).

The equation is of the form $a_i E_z|_{i-1,j}^{n+1/2} + b_i E_z|_{i,j}^{n+1/2} + c_i E_z|_{i+1,j}^{n+1/2} = d_i$. The stencil coefficients for the tridiagonal operator on $E_z$ are:\n- Left coefficient ($a_i$): $- \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta x)^2}$\n- Center coefficient ($b_i$): $1 + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta x)^2}$\n- Right coefficient ($c_i$): $- \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\nOnce the tridiagonal system is solved for all $E_z|_{i,j}^{n+1/2}$, the update for $H_y|_{i+1/2,j}^{n+1/2}$ is completed explicitly using the now-known $E_z$ values. The stencil coefficients for this $H_y$ update are $\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\mu\\Delta x}$ for $E_z|_{i+1,j}^{n+1/2}$ and $-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\mu\\Delta x}$ for $E_z|_{i,j}^{n+1/2}$.\n\n**Substep 2: Update from $t^{n+1/2}$ to $t^{n+1}$ (Implicit in $y$-direction)**\n\nThis substep is symmetric to the first. The $y$-derivatives are now implicit (evaluated at $t^{n+1}$), and the $x$-derivatives are explicit (evaluated at $t^{n+1/2}$).\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\frac{E_z^{n+1} - E_z^{n+1/2}}{\\Delta t/2} = \\frac{\\partial H_y^{n+1/2}}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial H_x^{n+1}}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{H_x^{n+1} - H_x^{n+1/2}}{\\Delta t/2} = -\\frac{\\partial E_z^{n+1}}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{H_y^{n+1} - H_y^{n+1/2}}{\\Delta t/2} = \\frac{\\partial E_z^{n+1/2}}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFollowing an analogous procedure as in Substep 1:\n\n1.

The $E_z$ and $H_x$ updates are implicitly coupled. We substitute the expression for $H_x^{n+1}$ into the $E_z$ update equation. This yields a tridiagonal system for each vertical line (constant $i$):\n    $$\n    - \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2} E_z|_{i,j-1}^{n+1} + \\left(1 + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2}\\right) E_z|_{i,j}^{n+1} - \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2} E_z|_{i,j+1}^{n+1} = \\text{RHS}\n    $$\n    where the RHS contains only known values from time $n+1/2$.\n    The stencil coefficients for the tridiagonal operator on $E_z$ are:\n    - Bottom coefficient: $- \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2}$\n    - Center coefficient: $1 + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2}$\n    - Top coefficient: $- \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{4\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta y)^2}$\n\n3.  After solving for $E_z^{n+1}$, the $H_x$ update is completed explicitly:\n    $$\n    H_x|_{i,j+1/2}^{n+1} = H_x|_{i,j+1/2}^{n+1/2} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\mu\\Delta y} \\left( E_z|_{i,j+1}^{n+1} - E_z|_{i,j}^{n+1} \\right)\n    $$\n    The stencil coefficients are $\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\mu\\Delta y}$ and $-\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\mu\\Delta y}$ on values of $E_z^{n+1}$.\n\nThe final answer requested is the center coefficient of the tridiagonal operator for the $E_z$ solve in the first substep, which is implicit in the $x$-direction.\nThis coefficient is identified as $b_i$ in the equation for Substep 1.\n$$\n\\text{Center Coefficient} = 1 + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2\\varepsilon\\mu(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$",

To six significant figures, this is $1.00000$.\n\nPhysical Interpretation:\nThe group velocity $v_g \\approx 1.51 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ is the propagation speed of the envelope of a narrowband wave packet centered at the given wavenumber ($k\\Delta x = \\pi/2$). This velocity is only about half the speed of light in vacuum, $c$. This significant deviation is a result of numerical dispersion, an artifact of the spatial and temporal discretization. For the given parameters, the grid resolution is $4$ cells per wavelength ($\\lambda = 2\\pi/k = 2\\pi/(\\pi/(2\\Delta x)) = 4\\Delta x$), which is quite coarse and leads to substantial numerical dispersion error, slowing the wave packet.\n\nThe amplification factor magnitude $|G|=1$ signifies that the numerical scheme is non-dissipative (unitary). The amplitude of a single plane-wave mode is perfectly preserved over time. For a wave packet, this means that while its shape will distort and spread due to the different speeds of its constituent frequency components (numerical dispersion), its total energy will be conserved over many time steps.\n\nThe final answers are the numerical value of the group velocity and the magnitude of the amplification factor.",

            "solution": "The starting point is the source-free one-dimensional Maxwell system with constant permeability $\\mu > 0$ and piecewise constant permittivity $\\epsilon(x) > 0$. The problem prescribes a specific numerical scheme based on a semi-discretization of the wave equation and asks for the derivation of the resulting tridiagonal coefficients after temporal discretization.\n\nThe problem specifies using a particular face-weighted flux formulation to construct the discrete spatial operator. For a uniform grid with nodes $x_j=j\\,\\Delta x$, the semi-discrete approximation of the wave equation $\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial t^2} = c^2(x)\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2}$ at node $x_j$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 E_j}{dt^2} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\left[c_{j+1/2}^2\\,(E_{j+1}-E_j) - c_{j-1/2}^2\\,(E_j-E_{j-1})\\right]\n$$\nThis can be written as $\\frac{d^2 E_j}{dt^2} = (L_d E)_j$, where $L_d$ is the discrete spatial operator. The face-centered squared wave speeds, $c_{j\\pm 1/2}^2$, are defined using a harmonic average, which is equivalent to an arithmetic average of the nodal permittivities:\n$$\nc_{j+1/2}^2 := \\frac{2}{\\mu\\left(\\epsilon_j+\\epsilon_{j+1}\\right)}.\n$$\nThis formulation is designed to maintain consistency at material interfaces.\n\nTo obtain the fully discrete implicit scheme, we apply the trapezoidal (Crank–Nicolson) rule to the second-order system. For a system $\\frac{d^2E}{dt^2} = L_d E$, the Crank-Nicolson method can be formulated by introducing an auxiliary velocity $V=\\partial E/\\partial t$, forming a first-order system:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} = V,\\qquad \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = L_d E.\n$$\nApplying the trapezoidal rule in time from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{E_j^{n+1} - E_j^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(V_j^{n+1}+V_j^n\\right),\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{V_j^{n+1} - V_j^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} L_d \\left(E_j^{n+1}+E_j^n\\right).\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $V_j^{n+1}$ as $V_j^{n+1} = V_j^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} L_d (E_j^{n+1}+E_j^n)$.

This corresponds to a non-standard tridiagonal form. Let's use the definition of the discrete Laplacian operator: $L_d E_j = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\left[c_{j-1/2}^2 E_{j-1} - (c_{j-1/2}^2+c_{j+1/2}^2)E_j + c_{j+1/2}^2 E_{j+1}\\right]$.

However, a large contrast in $\\epsilon(x)$ (e.g., $\\epsilon_{j+1} \\gg \\epsilon_j$) will cause a large variation in the magnitudes of the matrix entries. Since $c^2 \\propto 1/\\epsilon$, the coefficients $a_j$ and $c_j$ will be much smaller where $\\epsilon$ is large. This increases the condition number of the matrix, which can slow down iterative solvers or increase sensitivity to round-off errors in direct solvers.\n\nFor local truncation error, away from the interface where $\\epsilon(x)$ is constant, the scheme is second-order accurate in both space and time, $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2, \\Delta t^2)$. At the interface, the continuous solution has discontinuous derivatives. The use of a flux-conservative discretization with a consistent interface condition (harmonic averaging) ensures that the scheme converges to the correct weak solution. However, due to the non-smoothness of the solution and the coefficients, the local truncation error at nodes adjacent to the interface is typically reduced to first order, $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x)$.",
