            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in Maxwell's theory and computational electromagnetics, is well-posed with all necessary definitions provided, and is stated objectively. We proceed to derive the discrete continuity equation.\n\nThe derivation begins with the surface-charge continuity equation, which is a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations:\n$$\n\\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nTo obtain a discrete system of equations from this continuous partial differential equation, we employ a testing procedure. A natural choice, consistent with the pulse basis expansion for charge, is to integrate the equation over each triangle $T_m$ for $m = 1, \\dots, N_t$. This is equivalent to applying a testing function that is $1$ on $T_m$ and $0$ elsewhere.\n$$\n\\int_{T_m} \\left( \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} \\right) \\mathrm{d}S = 0\n$$\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$\n\\int_{T_m} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, \\mathrm{d}S + \\int_{T_m} \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} \\, \\mathrm{d}S = 0\n$$\n\nLet's analyze the first term, the divergence term. We substitute the given expansion for the surface current density, $\\mathbf{J}_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} i_{n}(t)\\, \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n$$\n\\int_{T_m} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} i_{n}(t)\\, \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right) \\mathrm{d}S = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} i_{n}(t) \\int_{T_m} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{T_m} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$ needs to be evaluated. The basis function $\\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r})$ is defined piecewise. On triangle $T_{n}^{+}$, $\\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{+}} \\, \\mathbf{r}_{n}^{+}(\\mathbf{r})$. Since $\\mathbf{r}_{n}^{+}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a linear vector field in the coordinates on the triangle surface, its surface divergence is constant, $\\nabla_s \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{n}^{+}(\\mathbf{r}) = 2$. Therefore, the surface divergence of the basis function is also constant on $T_{n}^{+}$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{+}} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{n}^{+}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{+}} (2) = \\frac{l_{n}}{A_{n}^{+}}, \\quad \\mathbf{r} \\in T_{n}^{+}\n$$\nSimilarly, on triangle $T_{n}^{-}$, $\\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{-}} \\, \\mathbf{r}_{n}^{-}(\\mathbf{r})$, and its surface divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{-}} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{n}^{-}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{l_{n}}{2 A_{n}^{-}} (2) = -\\frac{l_{n}}{A_{n}^{-}}, \\quad \\mathbf{r} \\in T_{n}^{-}\n$$\nThe divergence is zero elsewhere. Now we can evaluate the integral over $T_m$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $T_m = T_n^{+}$, the integral is $\\int_{T_m} \\frac{l_{n}}{A_{n}^{+}} \\, \\mathrm{d}S$. Since $T_m = T_n^{+}$, their areas are equal, $A_m = A_n^{+}$. The integral becomes $\\frac{l_{n}}{A_m} \\int_{T_m} \\mathrm{d}S = \\frac{l_{n}}{A_m} A_m = l_n$. In this case, the sign indicator $s_{mn}$ is defined as $+1$.\n    \\item If $T_m = T_n^{-}$, the integral is $\\int_{T_m} -\\frac{l_{n}}{A_{n}^{-}} \\, \\mathrm{d}S$. With $A_m = A_n^{-}$, the result is $-l_n$. In this case, $s_{mn} = -1$.\n    \\item If $T_m$ is not adjacent to edge $e_n$ (i.e., $T_m \\neq T_n^{+}$ and $T_m \\neq T_n^{-}$), then $\\mathbf{f}_n(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$ on $T_m$, its divergence is zero, and the integral is $0$. In this case, $s_{mn} = 0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn all cases, we find $\\int_{T_m} \\nabla_{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{n}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S = s_{mn} l_n$.\nThe divergence term thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} i_{n}(t) (s_{mn} l_n)\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the second term, the charge derivative term. We start by confirming consistency of the charge expansion. The problem gives the expansion $\\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{t}} Q_{k}(t)\\, P_{k}(\\mathbf{r})$ and states that $Q_m(t)$ is the total charge on triangle $T_m$. Let's verify this. The total charge on $T_m$ is $\\int_{T_m} \\rho_s(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$. Substituting the expansion:\n$$\n\\int_{T_m} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{t}} Q_{k}(t) P_{k}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{t}} Q_{k}(t) \\int_{T_m} P_{k}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S\n$$\nSince $P_k(\\mathbf{r})$ is non-zero only on $T_k$, the integral is non-zero only for $k = m$. Thus the sum reduces to one term: $Q_{m}(t) \\int_{T_m} P_{m}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$. The problem specifies the normalization $\\int_{T_{m}} P_{m}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S = 1$. Therefore, the integral $\\int_{T_m} \\rho_s(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$ is indeed equal to $Q_m(t)$, confirming consistency.\n\nNow we evaluate the second term of the main equation:\n$$\n\\int_{T_m} \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{T_m} \\rho_{s}(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_{m}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\n\nCombining the two terms, the discrete continuity equation for triangle $T_m$ is:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} s_{mn} l_n i_{n}(t) + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_{m}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds for each triangle $m=1, \\dots, N_t$. This system of $N_t$ equations can be expressed in a compact matrix form. Let $\\mathbf{i}(t)$ be the $N_e \\times 1$ column vector of current coefficients $\\{i_n(t)\\}$, and $\\mathbf{Q}(t)$ be the $N_t \\times 1$ column vector of charge coefficients $\\{Q_m(t)\\}$. We use the incidence-length matrix $\\mathbf{D}_{\\ell} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_{t} \\times N_{e}}$ with entries $[\\mathbf{D}_{\\ell}]_{mn} = s_{mn} l_{n}$. The summation term $\\sum_{n=1}^{N_{e}} s_{mn} l_n i_{n}(t)$ is the $m$-th element of the matrix-vector product $\\mathbf{D}_{\\ell}\\mathbf{i}(t)$.\nThe entire system of equations can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}_{\\ell} \\mathbf{i}(t) + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{Q}(t) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is an $N_t \\times 1$ zero vector.\nSolving for the time derivative of the charge vector, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{Q}(t) = - \\mathbf{D}_{\\ell} \\mathbf{i}(t)\n$$\nThis is the discrete form of the charge continuity equation, which relates the rate of change of charge on the triangles to the net current flowing out of them, represented via the edge current coefficients.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the validation of discrete charge conservation on a triangulated surface.

We integrate the continuity equation over an arbitrary triangular patch $T_n$ and a single time interval $[t_j, t_{j+1}]$ of duration $\\Delta t = t_{j+1} - t_j$. This corresponds to applying a test function that is piecewise constant in space (equal to $1$ on $T_n$ and $0$ elsewhere) and piecewise constant in time (equal to $1$ over $[t_j, t_{j+1}]$ and $0$ elsewhere).\n\nThe tested equation is:\n$$ \\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}} \\int_{T_n} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} \\right) dS \\, dt = 0 $$\n\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$ \\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}} \\int_{T_n} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dS \\, dt + \\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}} \\int_{T_n} \\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} \\, dS \\, dt = 0 $$\n\nLet's analyze the first term involving the current $\\mathbf{J}$. The problem states that $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ is expanded using Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) spatial basis functions $\\mathbf{f}_i(\\mathbf{r})$ and piecewise-constant temporal basis functions $b_j(t)$. The temporal basis function $b_j(t)$ is a unit rectangular pulse on $[t_j, t_{j+1}]$.\nThe expansion is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{i,k} I_{i,k} \\mathbf{f}_i(\\mathbf{r}) b_k(t) $$\nWithin the specific time interval $[t_j, t_{j+1}]$, we have $b_k(t) = \\delta_{kj}$ (Kronecker delta), so the current is constant in time:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{i} I_{i,j} \\mathbf{f}_i(\\mathbf{r}) \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [t_j, t_{j+1}] $$\nSubstituting this into the first term:\n$$ \\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}} \\int_{T_n} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{i} I_{i,j} \\mathbf{f}_i(\\mathbf{r}) \\right) dS \\, dt $$\nSince the integrand is constant in time over the interval, the time integral yields a factor of $\\Delta t$.

            "problem": "Consider a monochromatic plane wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ normally incident on an infinite, perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) flat plate. The physical boundary condition that the tangential electric field on the PEC surface vanishes is represented by the time-domain integral equation (TDIE) as the statement that the total tangential electric field equals zero on the surface for all time $t$, namely $E_{\\text{tan}}(t) = E_{\\text{inc}}(t) + E_{\\text{scat}}(t) = 0$. In the continuous-time frequency-domain limit, this enforces the exact reflection coefficient $-1$, i.e., the reflected field has a phase shift of $\\pi$ relative to the incident field on the surface.\n\nIn computational electromagnetics, marching-on-in-time TDIE formulations often represent the surface current density using temporal basis functions $b_j(t)$ and enforce the boundary condition in a weak (tested) sense over each time interval. When a temporal basis $b(t)$ is used and the field is tested over its support, the contribution of a monochromatic signal $e^{-i \\omega t}$ is weighted by the normalized Fourier transform of $b(t)$, which introduces numerical dispersion and phase error in the effective enforcement. This problem asks you to derive the phase error introduced by two choices of temporal basis and to compute and compare the resulting phase errors for specified test cases.\n\nWork in one dimension along the surface normal, assume uniform time step $\\Delta t  0$, and consider the following temporal basis functions:\n\n- Piecewise-constant (zero-order) basis $b_0(t)$ on a single interval,\n$$\nb_0(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n1,  0 \\le t  \\Delta t,\\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith normalized Fourier transform\n$$\nB_0(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} e^{-i \\omega t}\\, dt.\n$$\n\n- Piecewise-linear (first-order, hat) basis $b_1(t)$ across two consecutive intervals,\n$$\nb_1(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\nt/\\Delta t,  0 \\le t  \\Delta t,\\\\\n2 - t/\\Delta t,  \\Delta t \\le t  2\\Delta t,\\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith normalized Fourier transform\n$$\nB_1(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\int_{0}^{2\\Delta t} b_1(t)\\, e^{-i \\omega t}\\, dt.\n$$\n\nTasks:\n\n1. Starting from Maxwell’s equations and the PEC boundary condition $E_{\\text{tan}}(t) = 0$, explain why, when enforcing the boundary condition in a tested sense over a temporal basis $b(t)$, the numerical enforcement introduces an additional complex factor equal to the normalized Fourier transform $B(\\omega)$ of the chosen $b(t)$. Argue that for a monochromatic $e^{-i \\omega t}$ excitation and exact spatial representation, the numerical phase error introduced by temporal testing with $b(t)$ is given by\n$$\n\\delta \\phi(\\omega) = \\arg\\left(B(\\omega)\\right),\n$$\nexpressed in radians.\n\n2.

Express all phase errors in radians.\n\n4. Implement a program that computes $\\delta \\phi_0(\\omega)$ and $\\delta \\phi_1(\\omega)$ for each of the following test cases, specified by frequency $f$ and time step $\\Delta t$, with $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. All frequencies must be provided in Hertz and all time steps in seconds; express the phase errors in radians. The final results for each test case should be rounded to $12$ decimal places. The test suite is:\n\n- Test case A (general case): $f = 1\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $\\Delta t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Test case B (Nyquist boundary): $f = 5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $\\Delta t = 100\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Test case C (low-frequency, small step): $f = 100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, $\\Delta t = 10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Test case D (moderate case near half-$\\pi$): $f = 3\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $\\Delta t = 75\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Test case E (near-Nyquist high frequency): $f = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $\\Delta t = 100\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n5. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each test case result must be a list of two floats in radians, in the order $[\\delta \\phi_0, \\delta \\phi_1]$, rounded to $12$ decimal places.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in computational electromagnetics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The tasks are logically structured and lead to a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the specified tasks in order.\n\n### Task 1: Justification for the Phase Error Formula\n\nThe core of a time-domain integral equation (TDIE) method for a perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) scatterer is the enforcement of the boundary condition that the total tangential electric field is zero on the conductor's surface $S$ for all time $t$:\n$$E_{\\text{tan}}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = E_{\\text{inc,tan}}(\\mathbf{r}, t) + E_{\\text{scat,tan}}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = 0, \\quad \\mathbf{r} \\in S, \\forall t$$\nThe scattered field $E_{\\text{scat}}$ is generated by the surface current density $J_s$ induced by the incident field. This relationship is represented by a linear integro-differential operator $\\mathcal{L}$, such that $E_{\\text{scat,tan}}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathcal{L}\\{J_s(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\}$. The equation to be solved for $J_s$ is thus:\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{J_s(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\} = -E_{\\text{inc,tan}}(\\mathbf{r}, t), \\quad \\mathbf{r} \\in S$$\nIn a numerical method of moments (MoM) framework, the unknown continuous function $J_s$ is approximated by a series of basis functions. The equation is not enforced at every point in space and time, but rather in a \"weak\" or \"tested\" sense. This involves projecting the equation onto a set of testing functions. For a Galerkin scheme, the testing functions are the same as the basis functions.\n\nThe problem states that a temporal basis function $b(t)$ is used for testing. When we test the boundary condition over the support of $b(t)$ (or a time-shifted version of it), we enforce:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b(t-t_n) \\left[ E_{\\text{inc,tan}}(t) + E_{\\text{scat,tan}}(t) \\right] dt = 0$$\nfor discrete time steps $t_n$. Let us consider a monochromatic incident field $E_{\\text{inc,tan}}(t) = E_0 e^{-i\\omega t}$. The tested incident field term is:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b(t-t_n) E_0 e^{-i\\omega t} dt$$\nBy substituting $\\tau = t-t_n$, this becomes:\n$$E_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega (\\tau+t_n)} d\\tau = E_0 e^{-i\\omega t_n} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau$$\nThe integral is the standard Fourier transform of the basis function $b(t)$. Using the problem's definition of the normalized Fourier transform, $B(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int b(t) e^{-i \\omega t} dt$, the integral is equal to $\\Delta t \\cdot B(\\omega)$. The tested incident field at step $n$ is thus $(E_0 e^{-i\\omega t_n}) \\cdot (\\Delta t \\cdot B(\\omega))$.\n\nThe physical incident field at time $t_n$ is simply $E_0 e^{-i\\omega t_n}$. The effect of the temporal testing procedure is to multiply the physical field by a complex factor $\\Delta t \\cdot B(\\omega)$. The constant real factor $\\Delta t$ is typically absorbed into the definition of the system matrix. The remaining complex factor $B(\\omega)$ modifies the phase and amplitude relationship between the incident and scattered fields that the numerical system enforces.\n\nThe exact physical reflection process for a normal-incidence plane wave on an infinite PEC plate is described by a reflection coefficient $R_{\\text{exact}} = -1 = e^{i\\pi}$. This implies a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians and no change in amplitude. The numerical scheme, however, enforces a condition that is effectively modified by the complex factor $B(\\omega)$. The numerical reflection coefficient can be considered as $R_{\\text{num}}(\\omega) = R_{\\text{exact}} \\cdot B(\\omega) = -B(\\omega)$.\n\nThe phase of the numerical reflection coefficient is $\\arg(R_{\\text{num}}(\\omega)) = \\arg(-1) + \\arg(B(\\omega)) = \\pi + \\arg(B(\\omega))$. The phase error, $\\delta\\phi$, is the additional phase introduced by the numerical method, which is the difference between the numerical phase and the exact phase:\n$$\\delta\\phi(\\omega) = \\arg(R_{\\text{num}}(\\omega)) - \\arg(R_{\\text{exact}}) = (\\pi + \\arg(B(\\omega))) - \\pi = \\arg(B(\\omega))$$\nThis confirms the expression for the phase error given in the problem statement.\n\n### Task 2: Derivation of $B_0(\\omega)$ and $B_1(\\omega)$\n\nWe now derive the closed-form expressions for the normalized Fourier transforms of the piecewise-constant and piecewise-linear basis functions.\n\nFor the piecewise-constant (zero-order) basis $b_0(t)$:\n$$B_0(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} (1) \\cdot e^{-i \\omega t}\\, dt = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\frac{e^{-i\\omega t}}{-i\\omega} \\right]_0^{\\Delta t}$$\n$$B_0(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega\\Delta t} (e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t} - 1) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\Delta t} (1 - e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t})$$\nTo express this in terms of the sinc function, we factor out a phase term from the numerator:\n$$1 - e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t} = e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2}(e^{i\\omega\\Delta t/2} - e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2}) = e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2}(2i\\sin(\\omega\\Delta t/2))$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $B_0(\\omega)$:\n$$B_0(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\Delta t} \\left[ e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2}(2i\\sin(\\omega\\Delta t/2)) \\right] = e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2} \\frac{2\\sin(\\omega\\Delta t/2)}{\\omega\\Delta t}$$\nUsing the definition $\\mathrm{sinc}(x) = (\\sin x)/x$:\n$$B_0(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega\\Delta t/2)}{\\omega\\Delta t/2} = e^{-i \\omega \\Delta t/2}\\, \\mathrm{sinc}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right)$$\n\nFor the piecewise-linear (first-order) basis $b_1(t)$, direct integration is possible but tedious. A more elegant method utilizes the convolution theorem. The triangular hat function $b_1(t)$ can be constructed as the scaled self-convolution of the rectangular box function $b_0(t)$. Let $b_{0,\\Delta t}(t)$ be the unscaled box function, equal to $1$ on $[0, \\Delta t]$ and $0$ otherwise. Its convolution with itself is:\n$$(b_{0,\\Delta t} * b_{0,\\Delta t})(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b_{0,\\Delta t}(\\tau) b_{0,\\Delta t}(t-\\tau) d\\tau = \\begin{cases} t,  0 \\le t  \\Delta t \\\\ 2\\Delta t-t,  \\Delta t \\le t  2\\Delta t \\\\ 0,  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThis is a triangle function with height $\\Delta t$ at $t=\\Delta t$. The basis function $b_1(t)$ is this triangle scaled by $1/\\Delta t$ to have a unit peak:\n$$b_1(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} (b_{0,\\Delta t} * b_{0,\\Delta t})(t)$$\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ denote the Fourier transform operator $\\int(\\cdot)e^{-i\\omega t}dt$. By the convolution theorem, $\\mathcal{F}\\{f*g\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}\\mathcal{F}\\{g\\}$.\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{b_1(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\mathcal{F}\\{b_{0,\\Delta t}\\}^2$$\nWe know that $\\mathcal{F}\\{b_{0,\\Delta t}\\} = \\Delta t \\cdot B_0(\\omega)$. Substituting this in:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{b_1(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} (\\Delta t \\cdot B_0(\\omega))^2 = \\Delta t \\cdot B_0(\\omega)^2$$\nThe normalized transform $B_1(\\omega)$ is defined as $B_1(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\mathcal{F}\\{b_1(t)\\}$. Therefore:\n$$B_1(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} (\\Delta t \\cdot B_0(\\omega)^2) = B_0(\\omega)^2$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $B_0(\\omega)$:\n$$B_1(\\omega) = \\left( e^{-i \\omega \\Delta t/2}\\, \\mathrm{sinc}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\right)^2 = e^{-i \\omega \\Delta t}\\, \\mathrm{sinc}^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right)$$\nBoth derivations match the expressions provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Task 3: Numerical Phase Errors $\\delta\\phi_0(\\omega)$ and $\\delta\\phi_1(\\omega)$\n\nThe phase error $\\delta\\phi$ is the argument of the complex function $B(\\omega)$.\nFor the piecewise-constant basis:\n$$\\delta\\phi_0(\\omega) = \\arg(B_0(\\omega)) = \\arg\\left( e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2} \\mathrm{sinc}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe sinc function $\\mathrm{sinc}(x)$ is real-valued. For numerical stability in time-marching schemes, the time step $\\Delta t$ must be chosen to resolve the highest frequency of interest $\\omega_{\\max}$. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition typically requires $\\Delta t$ to be small enough such that $\\omega_{\\max} \\Delta t  \\pi$. Under this condition, the argument of the sinc function, $x = \\omega\\Delta t/2$, lies in the interval $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, where $\\mathrm{sinc}(x)$ is strictly positive. For the given test cases, the maximum value of $\\omega\\Delta t$ is $\\pi$ (at the Nyquist limit), so $\\omega\\Delta t/2 \\le \\pi/2$, and $\\mathrm{sinc}(\\omega\\Delta t/2) \\ge \\mathrm{sinc}(\\pi/2) = 2/\\pi  0$.\nSince the sinc term is positive and real, its argument is $0$. The phase of $B_0(\\omega)$ is determined solely by the complex exponential term:\n$$\\delta\\phi_0(\\omega) = \\arg(e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t/2}) = -\\frac{\\omega\\Delta t}{2}$$\n\nFor the piecewise-linear basis:\n$$\\delta\\phi_1(\\omega) = \\arg(B_1(\\omega)) = \\arg\\left( e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t} \\mathrm{sinc}^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe term $\\mathrm{sinc}^2(\\omega\\Delta t/2)$ is the square of a real number, so it is always non-negative. For the frequencies of interest, it is strictly positive. Therefore, its argument is $0$. The phase of $B_1(\\omega)$ is determined entirely by the complex exponential:\n$$\\delta\\phi_1(\\omega) = \\arg(e^{-i\\omega\\Delta t}) = -\\omega\\Delta t$$\nThe phase error for the first-order basis is exactly twice that of the zero-order basis. This corresponds to an effective numerical time delay of $\\Delta t/2$ for $b_0(t)$ and $\\Delta t$ for $b_1(t)$, which matches the temporal centroids of the respective basis functions.\n\n### Task 4  5: Implementation and Output\n\nUsing the results from Task 3 and the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, the phase errors to be computed are:\n$$\\delta\\phi_0(f, \\Delta t) = -\\frac{(2\\pi f)\\Delta t}{2} = -\\pi f \\Delta t$$\n$$\\delta\\phi_1(f, \\Delta t) = -(2\\pi f)\\Delta t = -2\\pi f \\Delta t$$\nThese simple expressions are computationally robust and avoid direct evaluation of the sinc function, fulfilling the directive to handle the $\\omega\\Delta t \\to 0$ limit safely. A Python program will be implemented to calculate these values for the specified test cases, with inputs $f$ in Hertz and $\\Delta t$ in seconds, and outputting the phase errors in radians, rounded to $12$ decimal places. The output will be formatted as a single-line string representing a list of lists.",
