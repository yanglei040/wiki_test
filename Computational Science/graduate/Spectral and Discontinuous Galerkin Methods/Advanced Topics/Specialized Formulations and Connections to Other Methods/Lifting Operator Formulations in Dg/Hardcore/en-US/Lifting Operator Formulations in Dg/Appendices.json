A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the function $L_F(g) \\in V_h = \\mathbb{P}_1(K)$. Since $L_F(g)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $1$, it can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions $\\{\\phi_0(x), \\phi_1(x)\\} = \\{1, x\\}$. Let this representation be:\n$$\nL_F(g)(x) = c_0 \\phi_0(x) + c_1 \\phi_1(x) = c_0 \\cdot 1 + c_1 \\cdot x\n$$\nwhere $c_0$ and $c_1$ are the unknown coefficients to be determined.\n\nThe defining equation for the lifting operator is:\n$$\n\\int_{K} L_F(g)\\, v \\, dx = \\int_{F} g\\, v \\, ds\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all test functions $v \\in V_h$. It is sufficient to enforce this condition for the basis functions $v = \\phi_0(x)$ and $v = \\phi_1(x)$. This yields a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns $c_0$ and $c_1$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $L_F(g)(x)$ into the defining equation, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (c_0 + c_1 x) \\, v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\{1\\}} g(1) \\, v(1) \\, ds\n$$\nThe integral over the face $F=\\{1\\}$ is interpreted as a point evaluation, so $\\int_{\\{1\\}} f(x) ds = f(1)$. Given $g=1$ on $F$, the right-hand side becomes $g(1)v(1) = 1 \\cdot v(1) = v(1)$.\n\nWe now test for each basis function:\n\nCase 1: $v(x) = \\phi_0(x) = 1$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (c_0 + c_1 x) \\cdot 1 \\, dx = \\phi_0(1) = 1\n$$\n$$\nc_0 \\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \\, dx + c_1 \\int_{-1}^{1} x \\, dx = 1\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \\, dx = [x]_{-1}^{1} = 1 - (-1) = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} x \\, dx = \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0\n$$\nSo, the first equation is:\n$$\n2c_0 + 0 \\cdot c_1 = 1\n$$\n\nCase 2: $v(x) = \\phi_1(x) = x$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (c_0 + c_1 x) \\cdot x \\, dx = \\phi_1(1) = 1\n$$\n$$\nc_0 \\int_{-1}^{1} x \\, dx + c_1 \\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \\, dx = 1\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} x \\, dx = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \\, dx = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nSo, the second equation is:\n$$\n0 \\cdot c_0 + \\frac{2}{3} c_1 = 1\n$$\n\nWe have the following system of linear equations for $(c_0, c_1)$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\int_K \\phi_0 \\phi_0 dx & \\int_K \\phi_0 \\phi_1 dx \\\\\n\\int_K \\phi_1 \\phi_0 dx & \\int_K \\phi_1 \\phi_1 dx\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_0 \\\\\nc_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_0(1) \\\\\n\\phi_1(1)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_0 \\\\\nc_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the mass-matrix system mentioned in the problem.

Since $P_m(1) = 1$, we have:\n$$ b_m = j \\sqrt{m + \\frac{1}{2}} $$\n\n**2. Modal Coefficients of the Filtered Lifting**\nLet the filtered lifting polynomial be $r_\\mu(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p} c_k \\phi_k(\\xi)$. Substitute this expansion into its defining variational equation:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{p} c_k \\phi_k\\right) v \\,d\\xi + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{p} c_k \\frac{d\\phi_k}{d\\xi}\\right) \\frac{dv}{d\\xi} \\,d\\xi = j v(1) $$\nAgain, we test with $v(\\xi) = \\phi_m(\\xi)$:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{p} c_k \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_k \\phi_m \\,d\\xi + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\sum_{k=0}^{p} c_k \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{d\\phi_k}{d\\xi} \\frac{d\\phi_m}{d\\xi} \\,d\\xi = j \\phi_m(1) $$\nLet $M_{mk} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_k \\phi_m \\,d\\xi$ be the entries of the mass matrix and $S_{mk} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{d\\phi_k}{d\\xi} \\frac{d\\phi_m}{d\\xi} \\,d\\xi$ be the entries of the stiffness matrix. Due to orthonormality, $M_{mk} = \\delta_{mk}$. The system of equations for the coefficients $\\mathbf{c} = (c_0, \\dots, c_p)^T$ is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{p} (\\delta_{mk} + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{mk}) c_k = j \\phi_m(1) $$\nThis is a linear system $(I + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{f}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and the right-hand side vector has components $f_m = j \\phi_m(1) = b_m$.\n\n**3. Application of the Asymptotic Assumption**\nThe problem states that for high $p$, the stiffness matrix is dominated by its diagonal, i.e., $S_{mk} \\approx S_{mm} \\delta_{mk}$. Under this assumption, the linear system decouples into a set of scalar equations:\n$$ (\\delta_{mm} + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{mm}) c_m \\approx j \\phi_m(1) $$\n$$ (1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{mm}) c_m \\approx j \\phi_m(1) $$\nSolving for the filtered coefficient $c_m$:\n$$ c_m \\approx \\frac{j \\phi_m(1)}{1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{mm}} $$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Attenuation Factor**\nThe attenuation factor $A_k$ is the ratio $c_k/b_k$. Using our expressions for $b_k$ and $c_k$:\n$$ A_k = \\frac{c_k}{b_k} \\approx \\frac{j \\phi_k(1) / (1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{kk})}{j \\phi_k(1)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} S_{kk}} $$\nTo find the final form, we must compute the diagonal stiffness term $S_{kk}$.\n$$ S_{kk} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\frac{d\\phi_k}{d\\xi}(\\xi) \\right)^2 d\\xi $$\nUsing $\\phi_k(\\xi) = \\sqrt{k + \\frac{1}{2}} P_k(\\xi)$, its derivative is $\\frac{d\\phi_k}{d\\xi} = \\sqrt{k + \\frac{1}{2}} P_k'(\\xi)$.\n$$ S_{kk} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\sqrt{k + \\frac{1}{2}} P_k'(\\xi) \\right)^2 d\\xi = \\left(k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\int_{-1}^{1} (P_k'(\\xi))^2 d\\xi $$\nUsing the provided identity $\\int_{-1}^{1} (P_k'(\\xi))^2 d\\xi = k(k+1)$:\n$$ S_{kk} = \\left(k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) k(k+1) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $S_{kk}$ into the formula for $A_k$:\n$$ A_k \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\left(k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) k(k+1)} $$\n\n**5. Final Expression for $A_p$ and Interpretation**\nWe require the attenuation factor for the highest mode, $k=p$:\n$$ A_p \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\left(p + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) p(p+1)} $$\nThis expression can be simplified. Note that $k + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2k+1}{2}$. For $k=p$:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\left(p + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) p(p+1) = \\mu \\frac{2}{h} \\frac{2p+1}{2} p(p+1) = \\frac{\\mu}{h} p(p+1)(2p+1) $$\nThus, the final expression for $A_p$ is:\n$$ A_p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{h} p(p+1)(2p+1)} $$\nThe term $p(p+1)(2p+1)$ scales asymptotically as $2p^3$ for large $p$. Therefore, $A_p \\approx \\frac{h}{2\\mu p^3}$. This $\\mathcal{O}(p^{-3})$ scaling shows that the attenuation factor becomes very small for high-order modes. This behavior is characteristic of spectral filtering: the stabilization term, which involves derivatives, penalizes oscillatory (high-frequency) components of the solution, effectively damping the high-order modes of the lifted jump. This enhances numerical stability by filtering out potential high-frequency instabilities that can arise in DG methods.",
