In a spectral Galerkin setting, one enforces the boundary conditions by basis recombination with a lifting function $w(x)$ so that $u(x)=v(x)+w(x)$ and $v(x)$ satisfies homogeneous Dirichlet conditions.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the analysis of a spectral Galerkin method for the one-dimensional Poisson equation with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The core tasks are to determine if the choice of a lifting function affects the conditioning of the reduced system's stiffness matrix, and to compute the condition number of said matrix for a specific polynomial basis.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the structure of the Galerkin system. The problem is given by\n$$-u''(x)=f(x)\\quad\\text{for }x\\in[-1,1],\\qquad u(-1)=\\alpha,\\quad u(1)=\\beta.$$\nWe decompose the solution $u(x)$ into $u(x) = v(x) + w(x)$, where $w(x)$ is a lifting function that satisfies the inhomogeneous boundary conditions, $w(-1)=\\alpha$ and $w(1)=\\beta$, and $v(x)$ belongs to a function space where functions satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, i.e., $v(-1)=v(1)=0$.\n\nThe weak formulation is to find $u(x)$ such that $a(u, \\phi) = \\ell(\\phi)$ for all suitable test functions $\\phi$ that vanish at the boundaries. Substituting $u=v+w$ gives:\n$$a(v+w, \\phi) = \\ell(\\phi)$$\nBy the linearity of the bilinear form $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, we have:\n$$a(v, \\phi) + a(w, \\phi) = \\ell(\\phi)$$\nThis can be rearranged to find the unknown function $v(x)$:\n$$a(v, \\phi) = \\ell(\\phi) - a(w, \\phi)$$\nWe seek an approximate solution for $v(x)$ in a finite-dimensional subspace spanned by basis functions $\\{\\phi_j\\}_{j=1}^N$ which satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions. Let $v(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_j \\phi_j(x)$. Using the Galerkin method, we test against each basis function $\\phi_i(x)$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_j a(\\phi_j, \\phi_i) = \\ell(\\phi_i) - a(w, \\phi_i)$$\nThis forms a linear system of equations $K C = F$, where:\n- The stiffness matrix $K$ has entries $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$.\n- The vector of unknowns $C$ has entries $C_j = c_j$.\n- The right-hand side vector $F$ has entries $F_i = \\ell(\\phi_i) - a(w, \\phi_i) = \\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)\\phi_i(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{-1}^{1}w'(x)\\phi_i'(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\n\nThe conditioning of the reduced Galerkin system is determined by the condition number of the stiffness matrix $K$. As shown by its definition, $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$, the entries of $K$ depend only on the bilinear form $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and the basis functions $\\{\\phi_j\\}$ for the homogeneous subspace. The choice of the lifting function $w(x)$ only affects the right-hand side vector $F$. Therefore, the stiffness matrix $K$ and its condition number are independent of the specific choice of $w(x)$, whether it be linear like $w_L(x)$, quadratic like $w_Q(x)$, or any other valid lifting.\n\nAs requested by the problem, we can construct examples of such lifting functions.\nA linear lifting function $w_L(x) = ax+b$ must satisfy:\n$$w_L(-1) = -a+b = \\alpha$$\n$$w_L(1) = a+b = \\beta$$\nSolving this system yields $a = \\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}$. So, $w_L(x) = \\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{2}x + \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}$.\nA quadratic lifting function $w_Q(x)$ can be constructed by adding a quadratic term to $w_L(x)$ that vanishes at the boundaries $x=\\pm 1$. A simple choice is to add a multiple of $x^2-1$:\n$$w_Q(x) = w_L(x) + C(x^2-1) = \\left(\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{2}\\right)x + \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2} + C(x^2-1)$$\nfor any non-zero constant $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which ensures the polynomial is truly quadratic. This satisfies $w_Q(-1)=\\alpha$ and $w_Q(1)=\\beta$.\n\nNow, we compute the stiffness matrix $K$ for the homogeneous subspace spanned by the basis functions $\\phi_{1}(x)=x^{2}-1$ and $\\phi_{2}(x)=x^{3}-x$.\nThe bilinear form is $a(g,h)=\\int_{-1}^{1}g'(x)h'(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\nThe derivatives of the basis functions are:\n$$\\phi_{1}'(x) = 2x$$\n$$\\phi_{2}'(x) = 3x^{2}-1$$\nThe entries of the $2\\times 2$ stiffness matrix $K$ are $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$.\n\n$K_{11} = a(\\phi_1, \\phi_1) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_1'(x) \\phi_1'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (2x)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} 4x^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x$\n$$K_{11} = 4 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{4}{3} (1^3 - (-1)^3) = \\frac{4}{3} (1 - (-1)) = \\frac{8}{3}$$\n\n$K_{12} = a(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_1'(x) \\phi_2'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (2x)(3x^2-1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (6x^3 - 2x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$\nThe integrand is an odd function, and the integral is over a symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$, so the integral is zero.\n$$K_{12} = 0$$\nSince the bilinear form is symmetric, $K_{21} = K_{12} = 0$.\n\n$K_{22} = a(\\phi_2, \\phi_2) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_2'(x) \\phi_2'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (3x^2-1)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (9x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$\nThe integrand is an even function.\n$$K_{22} = \\left[ \\frac{9x^5}{5} - \\frac{6x^3}{3} + x \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left[ \\frac{9}{5}x^5 - 2x^3 + x \\right]_{-1}^{1}$$\n$$K_{22} = \\left( \\frac{9}{5}(1)^5 - 2(1)^3 + 1 \\right) - \\left( \\frac{9}{5}(-1)^5 - 2(-1)^3 + (-1) \\right)$$\n$$K_{22} = \\left( \\frac{9}{5} - 2 + 1 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{9}{5} + 2 - 1 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{4}{5} \\right) = \\frac{8}{5}$$\nThus, the stiffness matrix is:\n$$K = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{8}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{8}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe problem asks for the Euclidean condition number $\\kappa_2(K)$. For a symmetric positive definite matrix, $\\kappa_2(K) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}}{\\lambda_{\\min}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and $\\lambda_{\\min}$ are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of $K$.\nSince $K$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{8}{3}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nComparing the two eigenvalues: $\\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{40}{15}$ and $\\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{24}{15}$.\nSo, $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{8}{3}$ and $\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nThe condition number is:\n$$\\kappa_2(K) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}}{\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{8/3}{8/5} = \\frac{8}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nThe final result is independent of the lifting functions $w_L(x)$ and $w_Q(x)$, as predicted by our initial analysis.",

Boundary Operator $A$**\n\nThe boundary operator $A$ maps the coefficient vector $c$ to the values of the function and its derivative at the boundaries.\n$$\nA\\,c = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   v(-1) \\\\\n   v'(1)\n   \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   \\sum_{n=0}^{N} c_n P_n(-1) \\\\\n   \\sum_{n=0}^{N} c_n P_n'(1)\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the provided identities $P_n(-1) = (-1)^n$ and $P_n'(1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we can construct the matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times (N+1)}$ explicitly. Its rows are formed by the values of these functions for $n=0, \\dots, N$.\nThe first row of $A$, corresponding to the evaluation at $x=-1$, is:\n$$\nA_{0,n} = P_n(-1) = (-1)^n \\quad \\text{for } n=0, \\dots, N\n$$\nThe second row of $A$, corresponding to the derivative evaluation at $x=1$, is:\n$$\nA_{1,n} = P_n'(1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\quad \\text{for } n=0, \\dots, N\n$$\nThus, the matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & \\dots & (-1)^N \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 3 & 6 & \\dots & \\frac{N(N+1)}{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Lifting Function $\\ell(x)$**\n\nWe seek a lifting function $\\ell(x)$ of minimal polynomial degree satisfying $\\ell(-1)=0$ and $\\ell'(1)=\\alpha$. The proposed function is $\\ell(x) = \\alpha(1+x)$.\nLet's verify the boundary conditions:\n- $\\ell(-1) = \\alpha(1+(-1)) = 0$.\n- $\\ell'(x) = \\alpha$, so $\\ell'(1) = \\alpha$.\nThe conditions are met. A polynomial of degree $0$ cannot satisfy these conditions (unless $\\alpha=0$), so degree $1$ is minimal.\n\nTo express $\\ell(x)$ in the Legendre basis, we use the fact that $P_0(x)=1$ and $P_1(x)=x$.\n$$\n\\ell(x) = \\alpha \\cdot 1 + \\alpha \\cdot x = \\alpha P_0(x) + \\alpha P_1(x)\n$$\nThe corresponding coefficient vector $c_{\\text{lift}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ is therefore:\n$$\nc_{\\text{lift}} = [\\alpha, \\alpha, 0, \\dots, 0]^T\n$$\nWe verify that $A c_{\\text{lift}} = [0, \\alpha]^T$ by direct computation:\n$$\nA c_{\\text{lift}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\sum_{n=0}^{N} (c_{\\text{lift}})_n (-1)^n \\\\\n    \\sum_{n=0}^{N} (c_{\\text{lift}})_n \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha (-1)^0 + \\alpha (-1)^1 \\\\\n    \\alpha \\frac{0(1)}{2} + \\alpha \\frac{1(2)}{2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha - \\alpha \\\\\n    0 + \\alpha\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 \\\\\n    \\alpha\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe verification is exact. The lifting residual $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lift}}$ is analytically zero.\n\n**3. Homogeneous Basis Construction**\n\nThe homogeneous basis functions $\\{\\psi_k(x)\\}_{k=1}^K$ span the subspace $\\mathcal{V}_H$ where the boundary conditions are zero. The coefficient vectors of these functions must lie in the null space (kernel) of the operator $A$.\n$$\n\\ker(A) = \\{ c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N+1} \\;:\\; A\\,c = \\mathbf{0} \\}\n$$\nThe space of polynomials of degree at most $N$ has dimension $N+1$. The two rows of $A$ are linearly independent for $N \\ge 1$. Therefore, they impose two independent linear constraints, and the dimension of $\\ker(A)$ is $K = (N+1)-2 = N-1$. We compute a basis for this null space, forming the columns of a matrix $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N+1)\\times K}$. This can be done numerically using, for instance, a singular value decomposition of $A$. The columns of $Z$ are the coefficient vectors of the homogeneous basis functions $\\psi_k(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} Z_{n,k} P_n(x)$.\n\n**4. Mass Matrix and Condition Number**\n\nThe $L^2$ mass matrix $M$ in the standard Legendre basis is diagonal due to orthogonality:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_i(x) P_j(x) \\, dx = \\frac{2}{2i+1} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nSo, $M = \\operatorname{diag}(2, 2/3, 2/5, \\dots, 2/(2N+1))$.\nThe mass matrix in the new homogeneous basis $\\{\\psi_k\\}$ is given by $M_Z = Z^T M Z$. We compute this matrix and its $2$-norm condition number, $\\kappa(M_Z) = \\sigma_{\\max}(M_Z) / \\sigma_{\\min}(M_Z)$.\n\n**5. Orthonormalization**\n\nTo improve the conditioning of the mass matrix, we orthonormalize the homogeneous basis with respect to the $L^2$ inner product, which is equivalent to the $M$-inner product on the coefficient vectors. Let $M=W^2$, where $W=\\operatorname{diag}(\\sqrt{2/(2n+1)})$. We form the weighted basis matrix $Y=WZ$ and perform a thin QR factorization $Y=QR$. The new, $M$-orthonormal coefficient matrix is $Z_{\\text{ortho}} = W^{-1}Q$.\nBy construction, the new mass matrix is the identity:\n$$\nZ_{\\text{ortho}}^T M Z_{\\text{ortho}} = (W^{-1}Q)^T (W^2) (W^{-1}Q) = Q^T W^{-T} W^2 W^{-1} Q = Q^T Q = I_K\n$$\nThis holds because $W$ is symmetric ($W=W^T$, so $W^{-T}=W^{-1}$) and $Q$ has orthonormal columns ($Q^T Q=I_K$). The basis functions $\\phi_k(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} (Z_{\\text{ortho}})_{n,k} P_n(x)$ are $L^2$-orthonormal and satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions, since the columns of $Z_{\\text{ortho}}$ are linear combinations of the columns of $Z$ and thus lie in $\\ker(A)$.\n\n**6. Condition Number Comparison**\nWe will compute and compare three condition numbers:\n- $\\kappa(M)$: For the diagonal matrix $M$, this is the ratio of its largest to smallest diagonal entry. $\\kappa(M) = \\max_n(M_{nn})/\\min_n(M_{nn}) = (2/1) / (2/(2N+1)) = 2N+1$.\n- $\\kappa(M_Z)$: The condition number of the mass matrix in the recombined, but not orthonormalized, basis. This is expected to be larger than $1$.\n- $\\kappa(Z_{\\text{ortho}}^T M Z_{\\text{ortho}})$: By construction, this is $\\kappa(I_K) = 1$. This serves as a numerical verification of the orthonormalization process. Deviations from $1$ will be due to floating-point error.\n\n**7. Error Quantification**\nWe compute two error metrics to assess the numerical stability and accuracy of the basis construction.\n- Boundary condition error $\\varepsilon_{\\text{bc}}$: This measures how well the orthonormalized basis functions $\\{\\phi_k\\}$ satisfy the zero boundary conditions. We compute $A Z_{\\text{ortho}}$ and find the maximum absolute value among all its entries.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{bc}} = \\max\\left\\{ \\max_{k} |\\phi_k(-1)| ,\\; \\max_{k} |\\phi_k'(1)| \\right\\} = \\|A Z_{\\text{ortho}}\\|_{\\max}\n$$\n- Lifting residual $\\varepsilon_{\\text{lift}}$: This measures the error in satisfying the inhomogeneous boundary conditions for the lifting function.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{lift}} = \\left\\|A\\,c_{\\text{lift}} - \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\nTheoretically, both errors should be zero. In practice, they will be on the order of machine precision, reflecting the accumulation of floating-point errors during the linear algebra computations.\nThe following code implements these steps for the given test cases.",
