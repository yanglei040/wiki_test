Assume that the coefficients of $A$ are bounded and measurable and satisfy the usual uniform ellipticity and symmetry conditions.\n\nYou are asked to assess the compactness of $I_{s}$ on such re-entrant domains, relate it to the spectral properties of $T$, and compare approximation rates for global spectral methods versus discontinuous Galerkin (DG, discontinuous Galerkin) methods when approximating $T$ and its spectrum. In doing so, reason from the following foundational bases:\n- The definition of compactness of an operator between Banach spaces and the Rellich–Kondrachov compactness theorem on bounded Lipschitz domains.\n- The spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces.\n- The impact of reduced Sobolev regularity due to corner/edge singularities on approximation rates.\n\nSelect the statement that is correct and best justified by these principles.\n\nA. For any bounded Lipschitz domain $\\Omega$ (including those with re-entrant corners), the embedding $I_{s}:H^{s}(\\Omega)\\hookrightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact for all $s>0$. Consequently, $T:L^{2}(\\Omega)\\to L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact and self-adjoint, so its spectrum consists of real eigenvalues accumulating only at $0$. Lack of boundary smoothness reduces solution regularity (e.g., to $H^{1+\\alpha}(\\Omega)$ with $0<\\alpha<1$ depending on corner angles), which degrades global spectral-method convergence from exponential (in the analytic case) to algebraic rates determined by the available Sobolev regularity, while discontinuous Galerkin methods with local $h$-refinement and $p$-enrichment can recover optimal algebraic rates by concentrating resolution near singularities.\n\nB. Re-entrant corners violate the assumptions of the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem; therefore $I_{s}:H^{s}(\\Omega)\\to L^{2}(\\Omega)$ fails to be compact for all $s\\le 1$, so $T$ is not compact and has continuous spectrum. Any observed clustering of discrete spectra at $0$ in Galerkin approximations is a numerical artifact of truncation and not reflective of the infinite-dimensional operator.\n\nC. Compactness of $I_{s}:H^{s}(\\Omega)\\to L^{2}(\\Omega)$ holds if and only if $\\Omega$ is convex. On non-convex Lipschitz polygons with re-entrant corners the embedding is only continuous, not compact, and interior-penalty discontinuous Galerkin formulations restore compactness at the discrete level, creating spurious eigenvalue clustering near $0$ that vanishes under mesh refinement.\n\nD. Although $I_{s}:H^{s}(\\Omega)\\to L^{2}(\\Omega)$ remains compact on bounded Lipschitz domains, the lack of inter-element continuity in discontinuous Galerkin spaces makes the discrete Riesz map non-compact. Hence, even when approximating a compact operator $T$, the discontinuous Galerkin approximate spectra need not cluster at $0$, in contrast to conforming spectral methods.",
            "solution": "We start from the following first principles.\n\n1. Rellich–Kondrachov compactness on bounded Lipschitz domains: If $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is bounded and Lipschitz, then for any $s>0$ the embedding $I_{s}:H^{s}(\\Omega)\\hookrightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact. The notion of compactness is that bounded sets in $H^{s}(\\Omega)$ are mapped into relatively compact sets in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. The Lipschitz assumption is satisfied by polygonal and polyhedral domains, even with re-entrant corners or edges; corners reduce local smoothness of solutions but do not invalidate the Lipschitz property.\n\n2. Spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators: If $T:\\mathcal{H}\\to\\mathcal{H}$ is a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ (here $\\mathcal{H}=L^{2}(\\Omega)$), then its spectrum is a sequence of real eigenvalues with finite multiplicities accumulating only at $0$, together with possibly $0$ itself.\n\n3. Elliptic solution operator compactness via composition: The solution operator $S:L^{2}(\\Omega)\\to H^1_0(\\Omega)$ mapping data $f$ to the unique variational solution $u$ is bounded by Lax–Milgram. The embedding $J:H^1_0(\\Omega)\\hookrightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact by Rellich–Kondrachov. Therefore $T=J\\circ S:L^{2}(\\Omega)\\to L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact as a composition of a bounded operator and a compact operator. Symmetry and positivity of $A$ transfer to self-adjointness and positivity of $T$ on $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\n\n4. Corner singularities and approximation rates: On domains with re-entrant corners (opening angle $\\omega\\in(\\pi,2\\pi)$ in $d=2$), solutions of $-\\Delta u = f$ with smooth $f$ and homogeneous Dirichlet data exhibit singular behavior of the form $r^{\\lambda}\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$ in polar coordinates near the corner, with $\\lambda=\\pi/\\omega\\in(0,1)$. Thus, while $u\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$, one typically has $u\\in H^{1+\\lambda-\\varepsilon}(\\Omega)$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$, but not in $H^{1+\\lambda}(\\Omega)$. This reduces the available Sobolev regularity for approximation. Global spectral methods achieve exponential convergence only for analytic targets; for $u\\in H^{r}(\\Omega)$ with finite $r>0$, best-approximation errors in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ decay algebraically in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, with rates determined by $r$. Discontinuous Galerkin methods permit local mesh refinement ($h$) and polynomial enrichment ($p$); by grading the mesh toward the corner and/or increasing local polynomial degrees, one can recover optimal algebraic rates commensurate with the true regularity, and in $hp$-settings with geometric refinement even exponential rates have been proved for classes of corner singularities, though such $hp$-exponential results are not required here to conclude the compactness or clustering properties.\n\nWe now analyze each option.\n\nOption A: It states that on bounded Lipschitz domains, including those with re-entrant corners, the embedding $I_{s}$ is compact for all $s>0$. This follows directly from the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem, as polygonal and polyhedral domains are Lipschitz regardless of convexity. It then asserts that $T$ is compact and self-adjoint and hence has spectrum consisting of eigenvalues accumulating at $0$. This follows from items $2$ and $3$ above. Finally, it explains that boundary singularities reduce Sobolev regularity, degrading global spectral-method convergence from exponential (the analytic case) to algebraic, while discontinuous Galerkin methods with local $h/p$ refinement can deliver optimal algebraic rates by resolving the singularity. This is consistent with the regularity discussion in item $4$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: It claims that re-entrant corners violate Rellich–Kondrachov and that $I_{s}$ is not compact for all $s\\le 1$. This is false: re-entrant corners still yield a Lipschitz boundary, and the embedding $H^{s}(\\Omega)\\hookrightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact for every $s>0$ on any bounded Lipschitz domain. Therefore the conclusion that $T$ is not compact with continuous spectrum is unfounded. The assertion that eigenvalue clustering at $0$ is a mere numerical artifact contradicts the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, which applies to $T$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: It asserts that compactness holds if and only if $\\Omega$ is convex. Convexity is not required for Rellich–Kondrachov; bounded Lipschitz suffices. The further claim that discontinuous Galerkin restores compactness at the discrete level and creates spurious clustering is conceptually flawed: any finite-dimensional discretization yields a finite-rank operator, but consistency and stability of the Galerkin method ensure approximation of the true spectrum, not spurious disappearance of clustering with refinement. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: It agrees that $I_{s}$ is compact but then asserts that the discrete spectra from discontinuous Galerkin do not cluster at $0$ due to lack of conformity. This contradicts the fact that stable, consistent discontinuous Galerkin schemes approximate the same compact operator $T$; their discrete operators are finite-rank and self-adjoint with respect to suitable inner products, and as the dimension grows the computed eigenvalues approximate those of $T$, including clustering at $0$. Nonconformity does not negate the compactness of the target operator nor the asymptotic clustering behavior. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A is consistent with the foundational theorems and the effect of corner singularities on approximation rates, while correctly linking compactness to eigenvalue clustering at $0$ rather than to a loss of compactness.",
