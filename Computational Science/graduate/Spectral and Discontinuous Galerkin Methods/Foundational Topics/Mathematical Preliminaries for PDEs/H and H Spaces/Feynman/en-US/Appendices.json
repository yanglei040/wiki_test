Propose a vector field $h_{C}:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, depending on a scalar constant $C\\in\\mathbb{R}$, that is everywhere tangent to circles around the $z$-axis, and whose magnitude depends only on the radius $r$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, grounded in the fundamental theory of vector calculus and Sobolev spaces on a multiply connected domain. We proceed by addressing each of the five parts sequentially.\n\nLet the domain be $\\Omega=\\{(r,\\theta,z): a<r<b,\\ 0<z<L,\\ 0\\le \\theta<2\\pi\\}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r,\\theta,z)$. The standard unit vectors in the cylindrical system are $\\hat{r}$, $\\hat{\\theta}$, and $\\hat{z}$. The volume element is $dV = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz$.\n\n**1. Proposal and Verification of $h_C \\in H(\\mathrm{curl},\\Omega)\\cap H(\\mathrm{div},\\Omega)$**\n\nWe are asked to propose a vector field $h_C$ that is tangent to circles around the z-axis and whose magnitude depends only on the radius $r$. This structure implies that $h_C$ must be of the form $h_C(r,\\theta,z) = f(r)\\hat{\\theta}$ for some scalar function $f$. A canonical choice for such a field, which will be shown to be harmonic, is one where the magnitude is inversely proportional to the radius. Let us propose:\n$$\nh_C = C\\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\theta}\n$$\nwhere $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar constant.\n\nTo prove that $h_C \\in H(\\mathrm{curl},\\Omega)\\cap H(\\mathrm{div},\\Omega)$, we must verify that $h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$, $\\nabla \\times h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$, and $\\nabla \\cdot h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$.\n\nFirst, we check if $h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$ by computing its squared $L^2$-norm:\n$$\n\\|h_C\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\int_\\Omega |h_C|^2 \\, dV\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of $h_C$ is $|h_C|^2 = h_C \\cdot h_C = \\left(C\\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\theta}\\right) \\cdot \\left(C\\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{C^2}{r^2}$.\n$$\n\\|h_C\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\int_0^L \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_a^b \\frac{C^2}{r^2} (r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz) = C^2 \\int_0^L dz \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{r} dr\n$$\n$$\n= C^2 (L)(2\\pi) [\\ln(r)]_a^b = 2\\pi L C^2 (\\ln(b) - \\ln(a)) = 2\\pi L C^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\n$$\nSince $0 < a < b$ and $L > 0$, the quantity $2\\pi L \\ln(b/a)$ is a finite positive number. Thus, for any finite constant $C$, the integral is finite. This confirms that $h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$.\n\nNext, we compute the curl of $h_C$. In cylindrical coordinates, the curl of a vector field $F = F_r\\hat{r} + F_\\theta\\hat{\\theta} + F_z\\hat{z}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times F = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial (rF_\\theta)}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{r} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_r}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial r}\\right)\\hat{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial (rF_\\theta)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial F_r}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)\\hat{z}\n$$\nFor $h_C$, we have $F_r=0$, $F_\\theta = C/r$, and $F_z=0$. The components are independent of $\\theta$ and $z$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\times h_C = \\frac{1}{r}(0-0)\\hat{r} + (0-0)\\hat{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\cdot \\frac{C}{r}\\right) - 0\\right)\\hat{z} = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r}\\right)\\hat{z} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe curl is the zero vector field, $\\mathbf{0}$. The $L^2$-norm of the zero vector field is $\\|\\mathbf{0}\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = 0$, which is finite. Thus, $\\nabla \\times h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the divergence of $h_C$. In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot F = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial (rF_r)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial F_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nFor $h_C$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot h_C = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial (r \\cdot 0)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial (C/r)}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial z} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe divergence is the zero scalar field, $0$. The $L^2$-norm of the zero scalar field is $\\|0\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = 0$, which is finite. Therefore, $\\nabla \\cdot h_C \\in L^2(\\Omega)$.\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, we have proven that $h_C \\in H(\\mathrm{curl},\\Omega)\\cap H(\\mathrm{div},\\Omega)$.\n\n**2. Nontriviality and Harmonic Property of $h_C$**\n\nFor any $C \\neq 0$, the magnitude of $h_C$ is $|h_C| = |C|/r$. Since $r \\in (a,b)$ within $\\Omega$, $|h_C|$ is strictly positive everywhere in the domain. Thus, $h_C$ is not the zero vector field almost everywhere, i.e., it is nontrivial.\n\nA vector field $u$ is defined as harmonic if it is both curl-free and divergence-free. From the calculations in Part 1, we found that:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $\\nabla \\times h_C = \\mathbf{0}$\n    \\item $\\nabla \\cdot h_C = 0$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThese relations hold pointwise for all points in $\\Omega$, not just in a weak or distributional sense. Therefore, $h_C$ is a harmonic field in the strong sense.\n\n**3. Proof that $h_C$ is not a Gradient**\n\nAccording to the fundamental theorem for line integrals (a consequence of Stokes' theorem), if a vector field $v$ is the gradient of a scalar potential $\\phi \\in H^1(\\Omega)$ (i.e., $v = \\nabla\\phi$), then its circulation around any closed curve $\\gamma \\subset \\Omega$ must be zero: $\\oint_\\gamma v \\cdot d\\ell = 0$.\n\nTo prove that $h_C$ is not a gradient of any such $\\phi$, we must find a closed curve $\\gamma$ in $\\Omega$ for which the circulation is non-zero. Let's choose the curve suggested by the problem's description of the domain's topology: a circle of radius $\\rho$ at a constant height $z_0$, where $a < \\rho < b$ and $0 < z_0 < L$.\nThis curve $\\gamma$ can be parametrized in cylindrical coordinates as $r=\\rho$, $z=z_0$, with $\\theta$ varying from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The differential line element is $d\\ell = \\rho\\,d\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta}$.\n\nThe circulation of $h_C$ around $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\n\\oint_\\gamma h_C \\cdot d\\ell = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(C\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\hat{\\theta}\\right) \\cdot (\\rho\\,d\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta}) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} C \\, d\\theta = C[\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi C\n$$\nFor any choice of $C \\neq 0$, the circulation is non-zero. This non-zero result proves that $h_C$ cannot be expressed as the gradient of any single-valued scalar potential $\\phi \\in H^1(\\Omega)$. Such fields are known as non-exact harmonic fields and are generators of the first de Rham cohomology group of the domain $\\Omega$.\n\n**4. Proof that $h_C$ is not a Curl of a Potential with Tangential Boundary Conditions**\n\nWe want to show that $h_C$ cannot be written as $\\nabla \\times A$ for a vector potential $A \\in H(\\mathrm{curl},\\Omega)$ that satisfies the boundary condition $A \\times \\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0}$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. We use an argument by contradiction.\n\nAssume such a vector potential $A$ exists, so $h_C = \\nabla \\times A$.\nLet's consider a surface $S \\subset \\overline{\\Omega}$ that cuts through the annulus. A convenient choice is a radial cross-section at a fixed angle, say $\\theta=0$:\n$$\nS = \\{(r, \\theta, z) : a \\le r \\le b, 0 \\le z \\le L, \\theta=0\\}\n$$\nThe unit normal to this surface (in the direction of increasing $\\theta$) is $\\mathbf{n}_S = \\hat{\\theta}$. The boundary of this surface, $\\partial S$, is a rectangle that lies entirely on the boundary of the domain $\\partial \\Omega$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the flux of $h_C$ through $S$:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_S h_C \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_S \\, dS\n$$\nThe area element is $dS = dr\\,dz$.\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_0^L \\int_a^b \\left(C\\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\theta}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{\\theta} \\, dr \\, dz = C \\int_0^L dz \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{r} dr = C(L)[\\ln(r)]_a^b = C L \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\n$$\nFor any $C \\neq 0$, this flux is non-zero.\n\nNow, by our assumption $h_C = \\nabla \\times A$, we can apply Stokes' theorem to relate this flux to a line integral of $A$ over the boundary $\\partial S$:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_S (\\nabla \\times A) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_S \\, dS = \\oint_{\\partial S} A \\cdot d\\ell\n$$\nThe path of integration $\\partial S$ lies on the boundary of the domain, $\\partial\\Omega$. The boundary condition on $A$ is $A \\times \\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0}$ for every point on $\\partial\\Omega$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal to $\\partial\\Omega$. This condition implies that the vector $A$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{n}$ (i.e., $A$ is normal to the boundary surface).\n\nThe differential path element $d\\ell$ along the curve $\\partial S$ is, by its nature, tangent to the boundary surface $\\partial\\Omega$. Therefore, at every point along the integration path $\\partial S$, the vector $A$ is orthogonal to the vector $d\\ell$. Their dot product is zero:\n$$\nA \\cdot d\\ell = 0 \\quad \\text{for all points on } \\partial S\n$$\nThis implies that the line integral is zero:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial S} A \\cdot d\\ell = 0\n$$\nWe have thus arrived at a contradiction:\n$$\nC L \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) = 0\n$$\nGiven that $L>0$ and $b>a>0$, this equation can only be true if $C=0$. However, we are interested in nontrivial fields where $C\\neq 0$. This contradiction shows that our initial assumption was false. Therefore, for any $C \\neq 0$, $h_C$ cannot be written as the curl of a vector potential $A$ satisfying the specified tangential boundary condition. Such fields are related to the second de Rham cohomology group of the domain relative to its boundary.\n\n**5. Determination of the Normalization Constant $C$**\n\nWe need to find the unique constant $C>0$ such that the $L^2$-norm of $h_C$ is equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\|h_C\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = 1\n$$\nFrom Part 1, we calculated the squared norm:\n$$\n\\|h_C\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = 2\\pi L C^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\n$$\nSetting this equal to $1^2=1$:\n$$\n2\\pi L C^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $C^2$:\n$$\nC^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi L \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}\n$$\nSince we require $C>0$, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi L \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi L \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}}\n$$\nThis provides the unique positive constant $C$ that normalizes the field $h_C$ in the $L^2$ sense.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the theory of finite element methods and Sobolev spaces, is well-posed, and all terms are objectively and precisely defined.\n\nThe total set of basis functions, which we denote by $\\mathcal{B}$, is the union of the three orientation-wise families:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i,j,k}\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(y)}_{i,j,k}\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(z)}_{i,j,k}\\right\\}\n$$\nwith indices spanning the ranges specified in the problem statement. The element-wise $H(\\operatorname{curl})$ mass matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}$ has entries given by the $L^2(\\hat{K})$ inner product of these basis functions. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{\\beta}$ be two generic basis functions from $\\mathcal{B}$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are global indices.

The basis functions are defined as a scalar polynomial multiplied by a constant Cartesian unit vector $\\boldsymbol{e}_d$, where $d \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$. Let's consider the inner product of two basis functions with different orientations, for instance, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i,j,k}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(y)}_{i',j',k'}$.

Therefore, the integrand is identically zero, and the resulting matrix entry is $M_{\\alpha\\beta} = 0$. The same reasoning applies to the pairs $(\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}, \\boldsymbol{e}_{z})$ and $(\\boldsymbol{e}_{y}, \\boldsymbol{e}_{z})$. This demonstrates that the mass matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}$ is block-diagonal, with coupling only between basis functions of the same orientation.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\boldsymbol{M}^{(x)} & \\boldsymbol{0} & \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{0} & \\boldsymbol{M}^{(y)} & \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{0} & \\boldsymbol{0} & \\boldsymbol{M}^{(z)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere each block $\\boldsymbol{M}^{(d)}$ corresponds to the inner products of the $d$-oriented basis functions.\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of each block, for example, $\\boldsymbol{M}^{(x)}$. The basis functions for this block are $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i,j,k}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i',j',k'}$. The corresponding matrix entry is:\n$$\nM^{(x)}_{(i,j,k), (i',j',k')} = \\int_{\\hat{K}} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i,j,k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{(x)}_{i',j',k'} \\,d\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\psi_{i}(x)\\psi_{j}(y)\\psi_{k}(z)\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\psi_{i'}(x)\\psi_{j'}(y)\\psi_{k'}(z)\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz\n$$\nUsing $\\boldsymbol{e}_{x} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} = 1$ and applying Fubini's theorem to separate the integral over the tensor-product domain $\\hat{K} = [-1,1]^3$, we obtain:\n$$\nM^{(x)}_{(i,j,k), (i',j',k')} = \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} \\psi_i(x)\\psi_{i'}(x) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} \\psi_j(y)\\psi_{j'}(y) \\,dy \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} \\psi_k(z)\\psi_{k'}(z) \\,dz \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the one-dimensional basis functions $\\{\\psi_n\\}$ are $L^2(-1,1)$-orthonormal, which means $\\int_{-1}^{1}\\psi_{m}(\\xi)\\psi_{n}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi = \\delta_{mn}$, where $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta. Applying this property to each of the three integrals yields:\n$$\nM^{(x)}_{(i,j,k), (i',j',k')} = \\delta_{ii'} \\delta_{jj'} \\delta_{kk'}\n$$\nThis result implies that the matrix entry is $1$ if and only if $(i,j,k) = (i',j',k')$, and $0$ otherwise. Therefore, the block $\\boldsymbol{M}^{(x)}$ is an identity matrix. The same logic applies to $\\boldsymbol{M}^{(y)}$ and $\\boldsymbol{M}^{(z)}$, which are also identity matrices. The full mass matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}$ is therefore a large identity matrix.\n\nThe problem requires a justification using the exactness of Gauss-Legendre (GL) quadrature. An $N_q$-point GL rule on $[-1,1]$ is exact for any polynomial of degree up to $2N_q-1$. The integrand in the $x$-direction is $\\psi_i(x)\\psi_{i'}(x)$, which is a polynomial of degree $i+i'$. For the $x$-oriented block, the maximum value for $i$ and $i'$ is $p_x-1$, so the maximum degree is $2(p_x-1)$. To ensure exactness, we need $2N_{q,x}-1 \\ge 2(p_x-1)$, or $N_{q,x} \\ge p_x-1/2$, implying $N_{q,x} \\ge p_x$ since $N_{q,x}$ must be an integer. Similarly, for the $y$ and $z$ directions, the maximum polynomial degrees are $2p_y$ and $2p_z$, requiring $N_{q,y} \\ge p_y+1$ and $N_{q,z} \\ge p_z+1$ points. With a sufficient number of quadrature points, the tensor-product GL quadrature rule computes the integrals exactly, reaffirming that $M^{(x)}_{(i,j,k), (i',j',k')} = \\delta_{ii'} \\delta_{jj'} \\delta_{kk'}$.\n\nSince $\\boldsymbol{M}$ is an identity matrix, its non-zero entries are all on the diagonal and have a value of $1$. The total number of non-zero entries is equal to the total number of basis functions, which is the dimension of the matrix. We calculate this by summing the number of functions in each orientation family.\n\nNumber of $x$-oriented functions, $N_x$:\nThe indices are $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, p_x-1\\}$, $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, p_y\\}$, $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, p_z\\}$.

This stability is mathematically guaranteed by the celebrated inf-sup or Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition. This hands-on problem demystifies this abstract condition by having you compute the exact value of the inf-sup constant for the most fundamental pairing of spaces, providing a concrete understanding of what makes a particular finite element discretization stable and robust .",

            "solution": "The inf-sup constant $\\beta_{\\hat{K}}$ is derived by explicitly computing the terms in its definition for arbitrary non-zero elements $q \\in \\hat{Q}$ and $v \\in \\hat{V}$.\n\nLet $q(x,y) = c$ (with $c \\neq 0$) and $v(x,y) = (a_{1} + b_{1} x, a_{2} + b_{2} y)$. The area of the cell $\\hat{K}$ is 4.\n\n**1. Derivation of $\\beta_{\\hat{K}}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the bilinear form and norms:\n*   The divergence is constant: $\\nabla \\cdot v = b_1 + b_2$.\n*   The bilinear form is $b(v,q) = -\\int_{\\hat{K}} (b_1+b_2) c \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y = -4c(b_1+b_2)$. Thus, $|b(v,q)| = 4|c||b_1+b_2|$.\n*   The $L^2$-norm of $q$ is $\\|q\\|_{0,\\hat{K}}^2 = \\int_{\\hat{K}} c^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y = 4c^2$, so $\\|q\\|_{0,\\hat{K}} = 2|c|$.\n*   The $H(\\mathrm{div})$ norm of $v$ requires two parts:\n    *   $\\|\\nabla \\cdot v\\|_{0,\\hat{K}}^2 = \\int_{\\hat{K}} (b_1+b_2)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y = 4(b_1+b_2)^2$.\n    *   $\\|v\\|_{0,\\hat{K}}^2 = \\int_{-1}^1\\int_{-1}^1 [(a_1+b_1x)^2 + (a_2+b_2y)^2] \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y = (4a_1^2 + \\frac{4}{3}b_1^2) + (4a_2^2 + \\frac{4}{3}b_2^2)$.\n    *   Combining them: $\\|v\\|_{H(\\mathrm{div};\\hat{K})}^2 = 4a_1^2 + 4a_2^2 + \\frac{4}{3}(b_1^2+b_2^2) + 4(b_1+b_2)^2$.\n\nNext, we form and maximize the quotient. The term for a given $v$ and $q$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{|b(v,q)|}{\\|v\\|_{H(\\mathrm{div})}\\, \\|q\\|_{0,\\hat{K}}} = \\frac{4|c||b_1+b_2|}{ \\left( \\sqrt{4a_1^2 + \\dots} \\right) (2|c|) } = \\frac{2|b_1+b_2|}{\\sqrt{4a_1^2 + 4a_2^2 + \\frac{4}{3}(b_1^2+b_2^2) + 4(b_1+b_2)^2}}\n$$\nSince the choice of $q \\in \\hat{Q}$ (i.e., the value of $c$) cancels, the infimum over $q$ is trivial. We find the supremum over $v$. To maximize the fraction, we minimize the denominator by setting $a_1=0$ and $a_2=0$. The expression to maximize becomes:\n$$\n\\sup_{b_1,b_2 \\text{ not both } 0} \\frac{2|b_1+b_2|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}(b_1^2+b_2^2) + 4(b_1+b_2)^2}}\n$$\nTo maximize this, we maximize its square. Equivalently, we minimize the reciprocal of the square:\n$$\nf(b_1,b_2) = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}(b_1^2+b_2^2) + 4(b_1+b_2)^2}{4(b_1+b_2)^2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{b_1^2+b_2^2}{(b_1+b_2)^2}\n$$\nThe minimum of $f$ occurs when the term $\\frac{b_1^2+b_2^2}{(b_1+b_2)^2}$ is minimized. This happens when $b_1=b_2$, which yields a value of $\\frac{2b_1^2}{(2b_1)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe minimum value of $f$ is $1 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{7}{6}$.\nThe maximum of the squared quotient is the reciprocal, $6/7$. Therefore, the inf-sup constant is $\\beta_{\\hat{K}} = \\sqrt{6/7}$.\n\n**2. Brief Justification and Qualitative Discussion**\n\n*   **Higher-Order Spaces:** A lower bound for the inf-sup constant for the pair $(\\mathrm{RT}_k, P_k)$, where $P_k$ is the space of polynomials of degree $k$, can be established by constructing a Fortin operator, $\\Pi_k: H(\\mathrm{div}) \\to \\mathrm{RT}_k$. This operator must be bounded independently of the polynomial degree $k$ and satisfy the commuting property $\\nabla \\cdot (\\Pi_k v) = \\mathcal{P}_k(\\nabla \\cdot v)$, where $\\mathcal{P}_k$ is the $L^2$-projection onto $P_k$. Such an operator guarantees the existence of a stable test function for any pressure in $P_k$, leading to an inf-sup constant that is uniformly bounded below, independent of $k$.\n\n*   **Transformation to Physical Cell:** Under an affine Piola map $F(x) = Ax+b$ from $\\hat{K}$ to a physical cell $K$, the bilinear form is invariant, but the norms transform. The inf-sup constant on the physical cell, $\\beta_K$, becomes dependent on the Jacobian matrix $A$. Its value depends on the cell's size and shape, as captured by operator norms of $A$ and $A^{-1}$. For a family of shape-regular meshes, it is possible to define scaled norms to ensure that the inf-sup constant is bounded below by a value that is independent of the mesh size $h_K$, depending only on the mesh shape-regularity constant.",
