            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal polynomial exactness degrees for volume and face quadrature rules, denoted $q_V$ and $q_F$ respectively, for a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of the linear advection equation.\n\nLet the discrete solution $u_h$ and test function $v_h$ belong to the space of polynomials of total degree at most $p \\ge 1$ on each element $K$ of a mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$. The scalar linear advection equation is given by\n$$\n\\partial_t u + \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a} \\, u) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a constant vector. Since $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is constant, the divergence term simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a} \\, u) = \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla u$.\n\nTo derive the semi-discrete weak formulation, we multiply the spatial part of the equation by a test function $v_h$ and integrate over an element $K$:\n$$\n\\int_K (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla u_h) v_h \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nApplying integration by parts (Green's theorem) yields:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial K} (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_K) u_h v_h \\, dS - \\int_K (\\boldsymbol{a} u_h) \\cdot \\nabla v_h \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{n}_K$ is the outward-pointing unit normal on the boundary $\\partial K$. Since $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is constant, this is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial K} u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_K) v_h \\, dS - \\int_K u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h) \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nIn the DG method, the trace of $u_h$ on the element boundary $\\partial K$ is replaced by a numerical flux. The problem specifies the central flux, where the numerical normal flux is given by $\\widehat{f} = (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) \\{u_h\\}$. The term $u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_K)$ is replaced by $\\widehat{f}$.\n\nThe contribution of element $K$ to the spatial operator is thus:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial K} \\widehat{f}(u_h) v_h \\, dS - \\int_K u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h) \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nThe bilinear form $B(u_h, v_h)$ is obtained by summing these contributions over all elements $K \\in \\mathcal{T}_h$:\n$$\nB(u_h, v_h) = \\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_h} \\left( \\int_{\\partial K} \\widehat{f}(u_h) v_h \\, dS - \\int_K u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h) \\, d\\boldsymbol{x} \\right)\n$$\nWe can rewrite the sum of boundary integrals as a sum over the set of all unique faces $\\mathcal{F}$ in the mesh. Let $F$ be an interior face between elements $K^-$ and $K^+$, with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_F$ pointing from $K^-$ to $K^+$. The contribution from this face to the sum is:\n$$\n\\int_F \\widehat{f}(u_h^-, u_h^+, \\boldsymbol{n}_F) v_h^- \\, dS + \\int_F \\widehat{f}(u_h^+, u_h^-, -\\boldsymbol{n}_F) v_h^+ \\, dS\n$$\nThe central flux $\\widehat{f}(u^-, u^+, \\boldsymbol{n}) = (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\frac{u^- + u^+}{2} = (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\{u\\}$ is conservative, i.e., $\\widehat{f}(u^+, u^-, -\\boldsymbol{n}) = -\\widehat{f}(u^-, u^+, \\boldsymbol{n})$. Thus, the interior face term becomes:\n$$\n\\int_F \\widehat{f}(u_h^-, u_h^+, \\boldsymbol{n}_F) (v_h^- - v_h^+) \\, dS = \\int_F (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) \\{u_h\\} [v_h] \\, dS\n$$\nFor a boundary face $F$, the problem states to interpret $\\{u\\}$ as the interior trace $u$ and $[v]$ as the interior trace $v$. The face integral term thus becomes $\\int_F (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) u_h v_h \\, dS$. This convention allows us to write the sum over all faces in a unified way.\n\nThe complete bilinear form is:\n$$\nB(u_h, v_h) = - \\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_h} \\underbrace{\\int_K u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h) \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}}_{\\text{Volume Integral}} + \\sum_{F \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\underbrace{\\int_F (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) \\{u_h\\} [v_h] \\, dS}_{\\text{Face Integral}}\n$$\nWe need to find the minimal quadrature exactness degrees, $q_V$ and $q_F$, to integrate the volume and face terms exactly for all $u_h, v_h$ in the polynomial space of degree at most $p$. The problem assumes affine element mappings, which implies that the Jacobian determinant for volume integrals and the Jacobian determinant and normal vector for face integrals are constant on each element and face, respectively. This ensures that the polynomial degree of the integrands is preserved when transforming to the reference element/face.\n\n**Volume Integral Quadrature ($q_V$)**\n\nThe integrand of the volume integral on an element $K$ is $I_V = u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h)$.\n-   $u_h$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $p$.\n-   $v_h$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $p$. Its gradient, $\\nabla v_h$, is a vector of polynomials of total degree at most $p-1$.\n-   Since $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is a constant vector, the dot product $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h$ is a scalar polynomial of total degree at most $p-1$.\n-   The product $I_V = u_h (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\nabla v_h)$ is therefore a polynomial of total degree at most $p + (p-1) = 2p-1$.\n\nTo ensure this integral is computed exactly, the volume quadrature rule must be exact for all polynomials up to this degree. This gives an upper bound $q_V \\ge 2p-1$. To show this is minimal, we must demonstrate that a polynomial of degree exactly $2p-1$ can be formed. Consider a one-dimensional case where $u_h(x) = x^p$ and $v_h(x) = x^p$. Then $\\nabla v_h = v_h'(x) = p x^{p-1}$. The integrand is $u_h (a v_h') = x^p (a \\cdot p x^{p-1}) = ap x^{2p-1}$, which is a polynomial of degree $2p-1$. Thus, a quadrature rule with exactness less than $2p-1$ would fail.\nThe minimal required polynomial exactness degree for the volume quadrature is $q_V = 2p-1$.\n\n**Face Integral Quadrature ($q_F$)**\n\nThe integrand of the face integral on a face $F$ is $I_F = (\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) \\{u_h\\} [v_h]$.\n-   The term $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F$ is constant on face $F$ due to the affine mesh assumption.\n-   The traces of $u_h$ and $v_h$ on the face $F$ are polynomials of total degree at most $p$ in the face's local coordinates.\n-   On an interior face, the average $\\{u_h\\} = \\frac{u_h^- + u_h^+}{2}$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $p$.\n-   The jump $[v_h] = v_h^- - v_h^+$ is also a polynomial of total degree at most $p$.\n-   The product $\\{u_h\\} [v_h]$ is therefore a polynomial of total degree at most $p + p = 2p$.\n\nOn a boundary face, the integrand according to the specified convention is $(\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_F) u_h v_h$. Both $u_h$ and $v_h$ are polynomials of degree at most $p$ on the face. Their product is a polynomial of degree at most $2p$.\n\nIn both cases, the face integrand is a polynomial of total degree at most $2p$. To guarantee exact integration, the face quadrature rule must be exact for all polynomials up to this degree, so $q_F \\ge 2p$. To see that this is minimal, consider a face where we can choose the traces independently. Let $\\phi$ be a polynomial of degree $p$ in the face coordinates. We can construct $u_h$ and $v_h$ such that on the face, $u_h^-=\\phi, u_h^+=0$ and $v_h^-=\\phi, v_h^+=0$. Then $\\{u_h\\}=\\phi/2$ and $[v_h]=\\phi$. The product $\\{u_h\\}[v_h]=\\phi^2/2$ is a polynomial of degree $2p$. Thus, a quadrature rule with exactness less than $2p$ would not be sufficient.\nThe minimal required polynomial exactness degree for the face quadrature is $q_F = 2p$.\n\nIn summary, the minimal quadrature exactness degrees are $q_V = 2p-1$ for the volume integrals and $q_F = 2p$ for the face integrals.",

The length of the cell is $h = x_{j+1/2} - x_{j-1/2}$.\n\nFor piecewise constant basis functions ($p=0$), we let $u_h(x,t) = u_j(t)$ for $x \\in I_j$, and we choose the test function $v_h(x) = 1$ for $x \\in I_j$ and $0$ otherwise.\nWith $v_h = 1$, its derivative $\\frac{\\partial v_h}{\\partial x} = 0$, so the integral on the right-hand side vanishes. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{I_j} \\frac{d u_j}{d t} (1) \\, dx = - \\left( (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j+1/2} - (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j-1/2} \\right) $$\n$$ h \\frac{d u_j}{d t} = - \\left( (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j+1/2} - (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j-1/2} \\right) $$\nThe problem specifies a central numerical flux. At the interface $x_{j+1/2}$ between cells $j$ and $j+1$, the solution has traces $u_j(t)$ from the left and $u_{j+1}(t)$ from the right. The central flux for the physical flux $f(u)=au$ is the arithmetic average:\n$$ (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j+1/2} = \\frac{a u_j(t) + a u_{j+1}(t)}{2} $$\nSimilarly, at the interface $x_{j-1/2}$:\n$$ (a \\hat{u}_h)_{j-1/2} = \\frac{a u_{j-1}(t) + a u_j(t)}{2} $$\nSubstituting these flux expressions into the semi-discrete equation gives:\n$$ h \\frac{d u_j}{d t} = - \\left( \\frac{a u_j + a u_{j+1}}{2} - \\frac{a u_{j-1} + a u_j}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ h \\frac{d u_j}{d t} = - \\frac{a}{2} (u_j + u_{j+1} - u_{j-1} - u_j) $$\n$$ \\frac{d u_j}{d t} = - \\frac{a}{2h} (u_{j+1} - u_{j-1}) $$\n\n### Step 3: Fourier Analysis and Eigenvalue Determination\n\nWe insert the Fourier mode $u_j(t) = \\hat{u}(t) \\exp(i k x_j)$ with $x_j=jh$ into the semi-discrete equation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\hat{u}(t) e^{ikjh} \\right) = - \\frac{a}{2h} \\left( \\hat{u}(t) e^{ik(j+1)h} - \\hat{u}(t) e^{ik(j-1)h} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} e^{ikjh} = - \\frac{a}{2h} \\hat{u}(t) e^{ikjh} \\left( e^{ikh} - e^{-ikh} \\right) $$\nDividing by $e^{ikjh}$ and using Euler's formula $e^{i\\phi} - e^{-i\\phi} = 2i\\sin(\\phi)$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = - \\frac{a}{2h} \\hat{u}(t) (2i\\sin(kh)) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = \\left( - \\frac{ia}{h} \\sin(kh) \\right) \\hat{u}(t) $$\nThis is of the form $d\\hat{u}/dt = \\lambda(k)\\hat{u}$, so the eigenvalue of the semi-discrete operator is:\n$$ \\lambda(k) = - \\frac{ia}{h} \\sin(kh) $$\nThe eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which is characteristic of a non-dissipative, centered spatial discretization.\n\n### Step 4: Amplification Factor for SSPRK(3,3)\n\nThe SSPRK(3,3) method for an ODE $y' = L(y)$ is given by:\n$$ y^{(1)} = y_n + \\Delta t L(y_n) $$\n$$ y^{(2)} = \\frac{3}{4} y_n + \\frac{1}{4} (y^{(1)} + \\Delta t L(y^{(1)})) $$\n$$ y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} y_n + \\frac{2}{3} (y^{(2)} + \\Delta t L(y^{(2)})) $$\nFor the scalar test equation $y'=\\lambda y$, we have $L(y)=\\lambda y$.

Now we substitute $z$ with our specific expression:\n$$ z = \\lambda(k)\\Delta t = \\left( - \\frac{ia}{h} \\sin(kh) \\right) \\Delta t = -i \\frac{a \\Delta t}{h} \\sin(kh) $$\nUsing the non-dimensional parameters $\\nu = a \\Delta t / h$ and $\\theta = k h$:\n$$ z = -i \\nu \\sin(\\theta) $$\nWe compute the powers of $z$:\n$$ z^2 = (-i)^2 (\\nu \\sin(\\theta))^2 = -\\nu^2\\sin^2(\\theta) $$\n$$ z^3 = (-i)^3 (\\nu \\sin(\\theta))^3 = i \\nu^3\\sin^3(\\theta) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $G=R(z)$:\n$$ G(\\theta, \\nu) = 1 + (-i\\nu\\sin(\\theta)) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\nu^2\\sin^2(\\theta)) + \\frac{1}{6}(i\\nu^3\\sin^3(\\theta)) $$\n$$ G(\\theta, \\nu) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\nu^2\\sin^2(\\theta) \\right) - i \\left( \\nu\\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{6}\\nu^3\\sin^3(\\theta) \\right) $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the amplification factor.\n\n### Step 5: Stability Analysis and Critical Timestep\n\nFor the scheme to be numerically stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any Fourier mode: $|G| \\le 1$.\n$$ |G|^2 = (\\text{Re}(G))^2 + (\\text{Im}(G))^2 \\le 1 $$\nLet $X = \\nu\\sin(\\theta)$.\n$$ |G|^2 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2}X^2 \\right)^2 + \\left( - \\left(X - \\frac{1}{6}X^3\\right) \\right)^2 $$\n$$ |G|^2 = \\left( 1 - X^2 + \\frac{1}{4}X^4 \\right) + \\left( X^2 - \\frac{1}{3}X^4 + \\frac{1}{36}X^6 \\right) $$\n$$ |G|^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)X^4 + \\frac{1}{36}X^6 $$\n$$ |G|^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{12}X^4 + \\frac{1}{36}X^6 = 1 - \\frac{X^4}{36}(3 - X^2) $$\nThe stability condition $|G|^2 \\le 1$ becomes:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{X^4}{36}(3 - X^2) \\le 1 $$\n$$ - \\frac{X^4}{36}(3 - X^2) \\le 0 $$\nSince $X^4 \\ge 0$, this inequality holds if and only if:\n$$ 3 - X^2 \\ge 0 \\implies X^2 \\le 3 $$\n$$ |X| \\le \\sqrt{3} $$\nSubstituting back $X = \\nu \\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$ |\\nu \\sin(\\theta)| \\le \\sqrt{3} $$\nSince $\\nu = a\\Delta t/h > 0$, this is $\\nu |\\sin(\\theta)| \\le \\sqrt{3}$.\nTo ensure stability for all possible Fourier modes, this condition must hold for the value of $\\theta=kh$ that maximizes $|\\sin(\\theta)|$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to find a sufficient lower bound on the blending coefficient $\\alpha$ that ensures the semi-discrete DG scheme is nonlinearly energy stable. Energy stability implies that the total discrete $L^2$-energy, $E_h$, does not increase in time. The energy is defined as:\n$$\nE_h = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\int_{I_k} \\frac{u_h^2}{2} dx_h\n$$\nwhere $u_h$ is the polynomial approximation in element $I_k$, and the integral is approximated using the LGL collocation quadrature rule. We analyze the time derivative of the energy, $\\frac{dE_h}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of change of energy can be conceptually decomposed into several parts:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_h}{dt} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, h}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{surf}}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, h}}$ is the contribution from the volume integrals evaluated with inexact quadrature, and $\\dot{E}_{\\text{surf}}$ is the contribution from the numerical flux at the element interfaces.\n\nWe can further decompose these terms. The volume term can be written as the sum of the term that would arise from exact integration and an aliasing error term, $A$:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, h}} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, exact}} + A\n$$\nThe surface flux term, using the blended flux $\\widehat{f} = (1-\\alpha)f^{\\text{cen}} + \\alpha f^{\\text{up}}$, can be decomposed into the contribution from the central flux and the contribution from the upwind-biased part:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\text{surf}} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{surf, cen}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}}\n$$\nCombining these, the total energy rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_h}{dt} = \\left( \\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, exact}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{surf, cen}} \\right) + A + \\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}}\n$$\nWe now analyze each component based on the facts provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Conservative Part**: The first fact states that the scheme with a central flux and exact volume quadrature is energy conservative. This directly implies that the sum of these two contributions is zero:\n    $$\n    \\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, exact}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{surf, cen}} = 0\n    $$\n    This simplifies the energy rate equation to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dE_h}{dt} = A + \\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Dissipative Part ($\\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}}$)**: The Rusanov flux is given by $f^{\\text{up}} = f^{\\text{cen}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}[u]$, where $[u] = u_R - u_L$ is the jump across an interface, and $u_L$ and $u_R$ are the states on the left and right of the interface, respectively. The blended flux is:\n    $$\n    \\widehat{f} = (1-\\alpha)f^{\\text{cen}} + \\alpha\\left(f^{\\text{cen}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}[u]\\right) = f^{\\text{cen}} - \\frac{\\alpha\\lambda}{2}[u]\n    $$\n    The contribution to the energy rate from the interface terms is $\\sum_j ([u]_j \\widehat{f}_j - \\text{boundary terms from } \\dot{E}_{\\text{vol, exact}})$. The combination of the central flux contribution and the exact volume term is already accounted for (it is zero). The remaining part, which we call the dissipation, arises from the upwind portion of the flux. The energy change due to the surface terms is $\\sum_j \\mathcal{F}_j$, where $\\mathcal{F}_j$ is the numerical energy flux across interface $j$. The dissipation corresponds to the difference between the energy flux with $\\widehat{f}$ and with $f^{\\text{cen}}$. This results in a dissipation rate summed over all interfaces $j$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}} = -\\sum_j \\frac{\\alpha\\lambda}{2} [u]_j^2\n    $$\n    Since $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda \\ge 0$, this term is non-positive, representing energy dissipation at the interfaces.\n\n3.  **Aliasing Part ($A$)**: The third fact provides a model for the energy production due to nonlinear aliasing from under-integration of the volume term. It is given as a sum of per-interface contributions, $A = \\sum_j A_j$, with the bound:\n    $$\n    A_j \\le \\frac{U}{2}\\eta p [u]_j^2\n    $$\n    Summing over all interfaces, the total aliasing production is bounded by:\n    $$\n    A \\le \\sum_j \\frac{U}{2}\\eta p [u]_j^2\n    $$\n\nCombining the bounds for aliasing and dissipation, we get an upper bound for the rate of change of total energy:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_h}{dt} = A + \\dot{E}_{\\text{diss}} \\le \\sum_j \\frac{U}{2}\\eta p [u]_j^2 - \\sum_j \\frac{\\alpha\\lambda}{2} [u]_j^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE_h}{dt} \\le \\sum_j \\left( \\frac{U}{2}\\eta p - \\frac{\\alpha\\lambda}{2} \\right) [u]_j^2\n$$\nFor energy stability, we require $\\frac{dE_h}{dt} \\le 0$. A sufficient condition to guarantee this for any possible configuration of jumps $[u]_j$ is that the coefficient of each $[u]_j^2$ term is non-positive:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{2}\\eta p - \\frac{\\alpha\\lambda}{2} \\le 0\n$$\nWe can now solve for $\\alpha$. The problem specifies that the Rusanov parameter $\\lambda$ is set to the velocity bound $U$, so $\\lambda=U$.\n$$\n\\frac{U}{2}\\eta p \\le \\frac{\\alpha U}{2}\n$$\nSince $U > 0$, we can divide by $U/2$ without changing the inequality:\n$$\n\\eta p \\le \\alpha\n$$\nThus, a sufficient condition for nonlinear energy stability is $\\alpha \\ge \\eta p$. This lower bound for $\\alpha$ depends on the polynomial degree $p$ and the aliasing level $\\eta$, but not on the mesh size $h$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the single minimal value of $\\alpha$ that ensures stability for all specified polynomial degrees, $p \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, given $\\eta = 0.18$. We must satisfy the condition for the \"worst case\" among these values of $p$.\n\nFor $p=3$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ge 0.18 \\times 3 = 0.54\n$$\nFor $p=4$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ge 0.18 \\times 4 = 0.72\n$$\nFor $p=5$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ge 0.18 \\times 5 = 0.90\n$$\n\nTo ensure stability simultaneously for all three cases, $\\alpha$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these lower bounds:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ge \\max(0.54, 0.72, 0.90) = 0.90\n$$\nThe minimal value of $\\alpha$ that satisfies this condition is $\\alpha = 0.90$. The problem asks for this dimensionless number to be rounded to four significant figures.",
