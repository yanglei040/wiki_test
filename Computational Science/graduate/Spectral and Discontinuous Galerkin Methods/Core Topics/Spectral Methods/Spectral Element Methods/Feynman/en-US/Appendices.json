            "introduction": "A core concept in the spectral element method is the ability to represent functions using different polynomial bases. This exercise explores the fundamental link between the modal basis, built from orthogonal Legendre polynomials, and the nodal basis, which uses Lagrange polynomials defined at the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) points. By deriving the transformation matrix between these two representations for a low-degree polynomial, you will gain a concrete understanding of how modal coefficients relate to function values at specific points within an element.",

It is scientifically grounded in the mathematical theory of orthogonal polynomials and numerical analysis, it is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and it is expressed in objective, formal language. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to derive the linear transformation that maps the modal Legendre coefficients, $\\{a_{k}\\}_{k=0}^{p}$, of a polynomial $u(x)$ to its nodal values, $\\{u_{i}\\}_{i=0}^{p}$, at the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) points. We must then compute this transformation matrix explicitly for the case where the polynomial degree is $p=3$.\n\nLet $u(x)$ be a polynomial of degree at most $p$. Its modal representation in the Legendre basis is given by\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p} a_{k} P_{k}(x)$$\nwhere $\\{a_{k}\\}_{k=0}^{p}$ are the modal coefficients and $\\{P_{k}(x)\\}_{k=0}^{p}$ are the Legendre polynomials.\n\nThe nodal representation of the same polynomial is given by\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{p} u_{j} \\ell_{j}(x)$$\nwhere $\\{u_{j}\\}_{j=0}^{p}$ are the nodal values at the GLL points $\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=0}^{p}$, i.e., $u_{j} = u(x_{j})$, and $\\{\\ell_{j}(x)\\}_{j=0}^{p}$ are the Lagrange cardinal polynomials satisfying $\\ell_{j}(x_{i}) = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nTo find the relationship between the modal coefficients $\\{a_{k}\\}$ and the nodal values $\\{u_{i}\\}$, we evaluate the modal representation at each of the GLL points $x_{i}$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, p$:\n$$u_{i} = u(x_{i}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p} a_{k} P_{k}(x_{i})$$\nThis equation provides a system of $p+1$ linear equations relating the nodal values to the modal coefficients. We can express this system in matrix form.

The equation for the $i$-th nodal value is:\n$$u_i = P_{0}(x_i)a_0 + P_{1}(x_i)a_1 + \\dots + P_{p}(x_i)a_p$$\nThus, the entry in the $i$-th row and $k$-th column of the matrix $T$ (using $0$-based indexing for both rows and columns) is given by:\n$$T_{ik} = P_{k}(x_{i})$$\n\nNow, we will compute this matrix explicitly for the case $p=3$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and verification of a matrix-free gradient operator for the spectral element method on a three-dimensional reference hexahedron, $[-1,1]^3$, for a polynomial degree of $p=4$. This involves three main tasks: (1) determining the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) nodes and quadrature weights, (2) constructing the one-dimensional differentiation matrix, and (3) implementing the tensor-product-based gradient evaluation and testing it against analytical solutions.\n\n**Part 1: Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre Nodes and Weights for $p=4$**\n\nFor a polynomial degree $p$, the spectral element method uses $N=p+1$ interpolation points on the reference interval $[-1,1]$. For $p=4$, we have $N=5$ points. These points are the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) nodes. They consist of the endpoints of the interval, $x_0=-1$ and $x_{N-1}=1$, and the roots of the derivative of the Legendre polynomial of degree $p$.\n\nThe Legendre polynomial of degree $p=4$ is given by the Rodrigues formula:\n$$ P_4(x) = \\frac{1}{2^4 4!} \\frac{d^4}{dx^4}(x^2-1)^4 = \\frac{1}{8}(35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3) $$\nIts derivative, $P_4'(x)$, is:\n$$ P_4'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{8}(35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3) \\right) = \\frac{1}{8}(140x^3 - 60x) = \\frac{5}{2}x(7x^2-3) $$\nThe internal GLL nodes are the roots of $P_4'(x)=0$, which are:\n$$ x(7x^2-3)=0 \\implies x=0, \\quad x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} $$\nCombining these internal nodes with the endpoints $\\{-1, 1\\}$ and sorting them, we obtain the five GLL nodes for $p=4$, which we denote by $\\{\\xi_i\\}_{i=0}^4$:\n$$ \\xi_0 = -1, \\quad \\xi_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}, \\quad \\xi_2 = 0, \\quad \\xi_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}, \\quad \\xi_4 = 1 $$\n\nThe corresponding GLL quadrature weights $w_i$ are given by the formula:\n$$ w_i = \\frac{2}{p(p+1)[P_p(\\xi_i)]^2} $$\nFor $p=4$, this becomes $w_i = \\frac{2}{4(5)[P_4(\\xi_i)]^2} = \\frac{1}{10[P_4(\\xi_i)]^2}$.

For example:\n- $D_{01} = \\frac{P_4(\\xi_0)}{P_4(\\xi_1)(\\xi_0 - \\xi_1)} = \\frac{1}{(-3/7)(-1 - (-\\sqrt{3/7}))} = \\frac{7}{3(1-\\sqrt{3/7})}$\n- $D_{10} = \\frac{P_4(\\xi_1)}{P_4(\\xi_0)(\\xi_1 - \\xi_0)} = \\frac{-3/7}{1(-\\sqrt{3/7} - (-1))} = \\frac{-3}{7(1-\\sqrt{3/7})}$\nThe full $5 \\times 5$ matrix $D$ will be assembled numerically in the accompanying code. A crucial property of this matrix is that the sum of each row is zero, i.e., $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} D_{ij} = 0$ for all $i$, because the derivative of a constant function (which is represented by a vector of all ones) is zero.\n\n**Part 3: Matrix-Free 3D Gradient Evaluation**\n\nIn three dimensions, a function $u(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$ on the reference hexahedron $[-1,1]^3$ is approximated using a tensor-product basis:\n$$ u^h(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} U_{ijk} L_i(\\xi) L_j(\\eta) L_k(\\zeta) $$\nwhere $U_{ijk} = u(\\xi_i, \\eta_j, \\zeta_k)$ are the values of the function at the $N \\times N \\times N$ grid of GLL points.\n\nTo compute the partial derivative with respect to $\\xi$ at a grid point $(\\xi_a, \\eta_b, \\zeta_c)$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^h}{\\partial \\xi}(\\xi_a, \\eta_b, \\zeta_c) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} U_{ijk} L_i'(\\xi_a) L_j(\\eta_b) L_k(\\zeta_c) $$\nUsing the property of Lagrange polynomials $L_j(x_b) = \\delta_{jb}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^h}{\\partial \\xi}(\\xi_a, \\eta_b, \\zeta_c) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} U_{ibc} L_i'(\\xi_a) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} D_{ai} U_{ibc} $$\nThis shows that the derivative with respect to $\\xi$ at all grid points can be found by applying the 1D differentiation matrix $D$ along the first dimension (the $\\xi$-axis) of the 3D data array $U$. Let $(G_\\xi)_{abc}$ denote the numerical derivative with respect to $\\xi$ at point $(\\xi_a, \\eta_b, \\zeta_c)$. The operations for all three gradient components are:\n- $\\displaystyle (G_\\xi)_{abc} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} D_{ai} U_{ibc}$\n- $\\displaystyle (G_\\eta)_{abc} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} D_{bj} U_{ajc}$\n- $\\displaystyle (G_\\zeta)_{abc} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} D_{ck} U_{abk}$\n\nA \"matrix-free\" strategy avoids assembling the global $N^3 \\times N^3$ differentiation operator. Instead, we store $U$ as an $N \\times N \\times N$ array and apply the small $N \\times N$ matrix $D$ along each dimension successively. This is computationally efficient and requires significantly less memory. In NumPy, these tensor contractions can be elegantly implemented using `np.einsum`.\n\nFinally, for each test case, we compute the numerical gradient arrays $G_\\xi$, $G_\\eta$, $G_\\zeta$ using this method. We then evaluate the analytical gradients on the GLL grid to obtain the exact gradient arrays $G_{\\xi, \\text{exact}}$, $G_{\\eta, \\text{exact}}$, $G_{\\zeta, \\text{exact}}$. The error $E$ is the maximum absolute difference between the numerical and exact values over all grid points and all three components, as defined in the problem statement. For Test A (constant) and Test B (polynomial of degree $\\le p$), the spectral differentiation is exact, so the error is expected to be at the level of machine floating-point precision. For Tests C and D, which contain non-polynomial terms, the error reflects the interpolation error of the spectral method.",

First, we must construct the piecewise polynomial DG-SEM approximation $u_h(x)$ for a given function $f(x)$ on a two-element mesh. Second, we must provide a rigorous justification for why this method mitigates Gibbs oscillations.\n\n### Part 1: Construction of the DG-SEM Approximation $u_h(x)$\n\nThe global approximation $u_h(x)$ is constructed by piecing together the local polynomial interpolants on each element, $u_h^{(E_1)}(x)$ and $u_h^{(E_2)}(x)$.\n\n**1. Approximation on Element $E_1 = [0, 0.5]$**\n\nFor the first element $E_1 = [0, 0.5]$, the left and right boundaries are $x_L=0$ and $x_R=0.5$. The affine map from the reference coordinate $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ to the physical coordinate $x \\in E_1$ is:\n$$\nx(\\xi) = \\frac{0+0.5}{2} + \\frac{0.5-0}{2}\\,\\xi = 0.25 + 0.25\\xi = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4}\n$$\nThe inverse map is $\\xi(x) = 4x - 1$.\n\nThe $p=3$ GLL nodes on the reference element are $\\xi_0 = -1$, $\\xi_1 = -1/\\sqrt{5}$, $\\xi_2 = 1/\\sqrt{5}$, and $\\xi_3 = 1$. We map these to physical coordinates in $E_1$:\n- $x_0 = x(\\xi_0) = \\frac{1-1}{4} = 0$\n- $x_1 = x(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1 - 1/\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\approx 0.138$\n- $x_2 = x(\\xi_2) = \\frac{1 + 1/\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\approx 0.362$\n- $x_3 = x(\\xi_3) = \\frac{1+1}{4} = 0.5$\n\nNext, we evaluate the function $f(x)$ at these nodal points. The function is defined as:\n$$\nf(x)=\\begin{cases}\nx, & 0\\le x<0.5 \\\\\nx+1, & 0.5\\le x\\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n- $f(x_0) = f(0) = 0$\n- $f(x_1) = x_1 = \\frac{1 - 1/\\sqrt{5}}{4}$, since $x_1 < 0.5$.\n- $f(x_2) = x_2 = \\frac{1 + 1/\\sqrt{5}}{4}$, since $x_2 < 0.5$.\n- $f(x_3) = f(0.5) = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5$.\n\nThe local DG-SEM interpolant on $E_1$ is given by $u_h^{(E_1)}(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} f(x_j)\\,\\ell_j(\\xi(x))$, where $\\ell_j(\\xi)$ are the Lagrange polynomials for the GLL nodes. We can express this in the reference coordinate $\\xi$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} f(x_j)\\,\\ell_j(\\xi)\n$$\nWe can simplify the calculation by noting that for $j=0,1,2$, we have $f(x_j)=x_j$. The function $g(x)=x$ corresponds to $g(\\xi) = (1+\\xi)/4$ in reference coordinates. The degree-3 interpolant of a degree-1 polynomial is the polynomial itself. Let's separate the contribution from the discontinuity at $x_3=0.5$.\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi) = \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{3} x_j \\ell_j(\\xi) \\right) - x_3 \\ell_3(\\xi) + f(x_3) \\ell_3(\\xi)\n$$\nThe sum in the parenthesis is the exact interpolant of $x(\\xi)$, which is $x(\\xi)$ itself.\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{3} x_j \\ell_j(\\xi) = x(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4}\n$$\nSo, the interpolant becomes:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4} - x_3\\ell_3(\\xi) + f(x_3)\\ell_3(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4} + (f(x_3)-x_3)\\ell_3(\\xi)\n$$\nSubstituting $x_3 = 0.5$ and $f(x_3)=1.5$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4} + (1.5-0.5)\\ell_3(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{4} + \\ell_3(\\xi)\n$$\nThe Lagrange polynomial $\\ell_3(\\xi)$ corresponding to the node $\\xi_3=1$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_3(\\xi) = \\frac{(\\xi - \\xi_0)(\\xi - \\xi_1)(\\xi - \\xi_2)}{(\\xi_3 - \\xi_0)(\\xi_3 - \\xi_1)(\\xi_3 - \\xi_2)} = \\frac{(\\xi + 1)(\\xi + 1/\\sqrt{5})(\\xi - 1/\\sqrt{5})}{(1 + 1)(1 + 1/\\sqrt{5})(1 - 1/\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{(\\xi+1)(\\xi^2 - 1/5)}{2(1-1/5)} = \\frac{5}{8}(\\xi^3+\\xi^2-\\frac{1}{5}\\xi-\\frac{1}{5})\n$$\n$$\n\\ell_3(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{8}(5\\xi^3 + 5\\xi^2 - \\xi - 1)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $u_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi)$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(\\xi) = \\frac{2}{8}(1+\\xi) + \\frac{1}{8}(5\\xi^3 + 5\\xi^2 - \\xi - 1) = \\frac{1}{8}(5\\xi^3 + 5\\xi^2 + \\xi + 1)\n$$\nFinally, we convert back to the physical coordinate $x$ using $\\xi = 4x-1$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(5(4x-1)^3 + 5(4x-1)^2 + (4x-1) + 1)\n$$\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(5(64x^3 - 48x^2 + 12x - 1) + 5(16x^2 - 8x + 1) + 4x)\n$$\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(320x^3 - 240x^2 + 60x - 5 + 80x^2 - 40x + 5 + 4x)\n$$\n$$\nu_h^{(E_1)}(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(320x^3 - 160x^2 + 24x) = 40x^3 - 20x^2 + 3x\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $x \\in [0, 0.5)$.\n\n**2. Approximation on Element $E_2 = [0.5, 1]$**\n\nFor the second element $E_2 = [0.5, 1]$, we have $x_L=0.5$ and $x_R=1$. The affine map is:\n$$\nx(\\xi) = \\frac{0.5+1}{2} + \\frac{1-0.5}{2}\\,\\xi = 0.75 + 0.25\\xi = \\frac{3+\\xi}{4}\n$$\nThe inverse map is $\\xi(x) = 4x - 3$.\nThe physical GLL nodes are $x_j = x(\\xi_j)$. For any point $x \\in [0.5, 1]$, the function is $f(x)=x+1$. So, for all nodes $x_j$ in this element, we have $f(x_j)=x_j+1$.\nThe local interpolant is $u_h^{(E_2)}(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} f(x_j)\\,\\ell_j(\\xi(x))$. In reference coordinates:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_2)}(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} (x_j+1)\\,\\ell_j(\\xi)\n$$\nBy linearity of interpolation, this is the sum of the interpolant of $x(\\xi)$ and the interpolant of $1$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_2)}(\\xi) = \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3} x_j \\ell_j(\\xi)\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3} 1 \\cdot \\ell_j(\\xi)\\right)\n$$\nSince $x(\\xi)=\\frac{3+\\xi}{4}$ and $1$ are both polynomials of degree $\\le 3$, their interpolants are exact.\n$$\nu_h^{(E_2)}(\\xi) = x(\\xi) + 1 = \\frac{3+\\xi}{4} + 1 = \\frac{7+\\xi}{4}\n$$\nConverting back to the physical coordinate $x$ using $\\xi = 4x-3$:\n$$\nu_h^{(E_2)}(x) = \\frac{7+(4x-3)}{4} = \\frac{4x+4}{4} = x+1\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$.\n\n**3. Global Approximation $u_h(x)$**\n\nThe global DG-SEM approximation $u_h(x)$ is the piecewise function defined by the local interpolants, using the same domain split as the original function $f(x)$:\n$$\nu_h(x) = \\begin{cases}\nu_h^{(E_1)}(x), & 0 \\le x  0.5 \\\\\nu_h^{(E_2)}(x),  0.5 \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the interface $x=0.5$, we check the values from both sides:\n- $u_h^{(E_1)}(0.5) = 40(0.5)^3 - 20(0.5)^2 + 3(0.5) = 40(1/8) - 20(1/4) + 1.5 = 5 - 5 + 1.5 = 1.5$.\n- $u_h^{(E_2)}(0.5) = 0.5+1 = 1.5$.\nSince the values match, the resulting global approximation $u_h(x)$ is continuous.\n\n### Part 2: Justification for Mitigation of Gibbs Oscillations\n\nThe mitigation of Gibbs oscillations in a DG-SEM framework, particularly when the mesh is aligned with discontinuities, stems from the principle of locality in the approximation basis.\n\n1.  **Gibbs Phenomenon in Global Approximations:** The Gibbs phenomenon arises when a function with a jump discontinuity is approximated by a truncated series of smooth, globally supported basis functions, such as a Fourier series or a single high-degree polynomial. The attempt to represent a sharp jump with smooth functions forces the approximation to develop spurious oscillations near the discontinuity. The amplitude of these oscillations does not decay as the number of basis functions increases; they merely become spatially compressed towards the jump.\n\n2.  **Locality of DG-SEM:** The DG-SEM approach fundamentally differs by employing a \"divide and conquer\" strategy. The domain is partitioned into a mesh of non-overlapping elements. On each element, the solution is approximated by a local polynomial, constructed from basis functions (e.g., Lagrange polynomials) whose support is confined to that single element. The global solution is the piecewise collection of these local polynomials.\n\n3.  **Exploiting Mesh Alignment:** The crucial step in this problem is that the element interface at $x=0.5$ is deliberately aligned with the jump discontinuity of the function $f(x)$. This ensures that *within the interior of each element*, the function $f(x)$ is analytic (infinitely differentiable).\n    -   On element $E_1=[0, 0.5)$, the function is $f(x)=x$.\n    -   On element $E_2=[0.5, 1]$, the function is $f(x)=x+1$.\n\n4.  **Containment of Oscillations:** Let's analyze the approximation on each element separately.\n    -   On $E_2=[0.5, 1]$, the function to be interpolated is $f(x)=x+1$, a polynomial of degree $1$. The degree $p=3$ polynomial interpolant is exact: $u_h^{(E_2)}(x) = x+1$. There is zero error and consequently no oscillation on this element.\n    -   On $E_1=[0, 0.5]$, the situation is more subtle. The function is $f(x)=x$ for $x \\in [0, 0.5)$, but the interpolant is constructed using the nodal value $f(0.5)=1.5$ at the right endpoint. This value belongs to the other side of the jump. The interpolation on $E_1$ is therefore performed on a set of points that are not samples of a single smooth function. This mismatch forces the resulting polynomial, $u_h^{(E_1)}(x) = 40x^3 - 20x^2 + 3x$, to deviate from the underlying smooth function $g(x)=x$. The error on the element, $E(x) = u_h^{(E_1)}(x) - x$, exhibits oscillations. This is a localized Gibbs phenomenon.\n    -   The key, however, is **containment**. Because the Lagrange basis functions associated with element $E_1$ are zero for all $x \\notin E_1$, the oscillatory behavior of $u_h^{(E_1)}(x)$ is strictly confined to the interval $[0, 0.5]$. It does not propagate to, or \"pollute,\" the approximation on element $E_2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By aligning the mesh with the discontinuity, the DG-SEM does not eliminate the root cause of the Gibbs phenomenon (approximating a non-smooth feature with smooth polynomials), but it strictly localizes its effects. The oscillations are contained within the single element adjacent to the jump. In elements where the function is smooth, the approximation can achieve high (spectral) accuracy. This containment is the essence of how DG-SEM mitigates Gibbs oscillations: it prevents them from contaminating the solution across the entire domain, a problem that plagues methods based on global basis functions.",
