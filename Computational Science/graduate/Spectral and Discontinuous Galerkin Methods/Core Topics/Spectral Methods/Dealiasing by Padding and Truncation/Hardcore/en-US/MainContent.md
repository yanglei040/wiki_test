The evaluation of nonlinear terms on discrete grids introduces a persistent challenge: **[aliasing error](@entry_id:637691)**. This phenomenon, where unresolvable high-frequency interactions masquerade as low-frequency components, can contaminate results and even lead to catastrophic [numerical instability](@entry_id:137058).

Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides guided coding exercises to solidify your understanding and translate theory into practical skill. By progressing through these sections, you will gain a deep, functional mastery of one of the most critical aspects of modern [scientific computing](@entry_id:143987).

## Principles and Mechanisms

Spectral and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods achieve their high accuracy through the use of global or local high-order basis functions, such as trigonometric or algebraic polynomials. While these methods exhibit exceptional properties for linear problems, the treatment of nonlinearities introduces a significant challenge: **[aliasing](@entry_id:146322)**. Aliasing errors arise when the interaction of basis functions generates new modes or frequencies that cannot be exactly represented by the discrete computational grid or polynomial basis. These unresolvable modes masquerade as, or "alias" to, lower-frequency modes that lie within the resolved spectrum, contaminating the solution and potentially leading to numerical instability. This chapter elucidates the fundamental mechanisms of aliasing in both Fourier and polynomial-based methods and details the primary strategies for its mitigation: truncation and padding.

### The Fundamental Mechanism of Aliasing in Pseudospectral Methods

At the heart of aliasing in Fourier [pseudospectral methods](@entry_id:753853) is the duality between physical and spectral space, connected by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The efficiency of these methods stems from evaluating nonlinear terms, such as a product $w(x) = u(x)v(x)$, via pointwise multiplication on a grid of collocation points in physical space, rather than performing a computationally expensive convolution in Fourier space. However, this convenience is the very source of [aliasing](@entry_id:146322).

For continuous, [periodic functions](@entry_id:139337), the Fourier series coefficients of a product are given by the convolution of the individual function's coefficients. If $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are band-limited, with their highest [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) magnitudes being $K_u$ and $K_v$ respectively, their product $w(x)$ will be band-limited to a [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) magnitude of $K_u + K_v$. The [pseudospectral method](@entry_id:139333), however, operates on a finite grid of $N$ points. This discretization fundamentally alters the nature of the convolution. Instead of a standard convolution over the infinite set of integers, the DFT enforces a **[circular convolution](@entry_id:147898)** (or cyclic convolution) over a [finite set](@entry_id:152247) of wavenumbers, typically indexed from $k=0$ to $N-1$ or in a centered range such as $k \in \{-\frac{N}{2}, \dots, \frac{N}{2}-1\}$.

Let's formalize this. Consider a function $u(x)$ and its square $w(x) = u(x)^2$, sampled on $N$ [equispaced points](@entry_id:637779) $x_j$. The DFT of the sampled values of $w(x_j)$ is given by $\hat{w}_k$. By substituting the inverse DFT representation of $u(x_j)$ into the expression for $w(x_j)$ and then into the DFT formula for $\hat{w}_k$, one can show through the orthogonality of discrete [complex exponentials](@entry_id:198168) that the resulting coefficients are given by the [circular convolution](@entry_id:147898) sum :
$$
\hat{w}_k = \sum_{k_1, k_2 : k_1+k_2 \equiv k \pmod{N}} \hat{u}_{k_1} \hat{u}_{k_2}
$$
This formula is the mathematical embodiment of aliasing. A given coefficient $\hat{w}_k$ receives contributions not only from pairs $(k_1, k_2)$ whose wavenumbers sum exactly to $k$, but also from all pairs whose wavenumbers sum to $k + mN$ for any non-zero integer $m$. The true, unaliased coefficient would only include the $m=0$ term. The terms with $m \neq 0$ represent the [aliasing error](@entry_id:637691), where energy from high-wavenumber interactions "wraps around" the periodic [spectral domain](@entry_id:755169) and contaminates lower-wavenumber coefficients.

For instance, consider a [discretization](@entry_id:145012) with $N=12$ points, and a function whose only non-zero Fourier coefficients are $\hat{u}_7 = \alpha$ and $\hat{u}_8 = \beta$. The interaction between these two modes, $\hat{u}_7 \hat{u}_8$, corresponds to a sum of wavenumbers $s = 7+8=15$. The true product should have energy at wavenumber $15$. However, on the $12$-point grid, this contribution is aliased to the wavenumber $k_{\text{alias}} = 15 \pmod{12} = 3$. The coefficient $\hat{w}_3$ will thus incorrectly receive a contribution of $2\alpha\beta$ (from the interactions $\hat{u}_7\hat{u}_8$ and $\hat{u}_8\hat{u}_7$) . This phenomenon is also referred to as "fold-over," as the high-wavenumber spectrum is folded back into the principal range of wavenumbers defined by the grid.

It is crucial to distinguish this **[nonlinear aliasing](@entry_id:752630) error** from **linear [sampling error](@entry_id:182646)**. If we attempt to represent a function that is not band-limited to the grid's representable range—for example, a pure sine wave $u(x) = \exp(iKx)$ with a wavenumber $K$ greater than the Nyquist frequency $N/2$—the DFT will alias this single mode to a lower wavenumber within the representable range. This is an error in the initial representation of the function itself. Nonlinear [aliasing](@entry_id:146322), by contrast, occurs even when the initial functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are perfectly represented on the grid; the error is generated by the nonlinear operation [@problem_id:3374780, @problem_id:3374785].

### Dealiasing by Truncation: The "Two-Thirds Rule"

Since aliasing arises from high-[wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) products wrapping around the [spectral domain](@entry_id:755169), one way to prevent it is to ensure that no such high wavenumbers are ever generated. This can be achieved by truncating the input spectra so severely that the resulting product spectrum is narrow enough to fit entirely within the principal range of the grid, without any wrap-around. This is the philosophy behind [dealiasing](@entry_id:748248) by truncation, famously known as **Orszag's 2/3 rule** for quadratic nonlinearities.

Let's derive the general principle. Suppose we retain modes up to a cutoff wavenumber $K_{\max}$, such that $|k| \le K_{\max}$ for all retained modes. The quadratic product of two such functions will generate modes with wavenumbers up to $|k| \le 2K_{\max}$. To avoid aliasing, we must ensure that the highest-[wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) product does not alias back into the retained band. The "worst-case" scenario for [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) involves the highest possible sum of wavenumbers, $S_{\max} = K_{\max} + K_{\max} = 2K_{\max}$, potentially [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) to the highest possible retained mode, $K_{\max}$. Using the centered wavenumber range $\{ -N/2, \dots, N/2-1 \}$, the first aliased copy of the positive spectrum appears at wavenumbers $k' = S - N$. To avoid contamination, the smallest magnitude of any aliased mode must be greater than our cutoff $K_{\max}$. The smallest aliased magnitude will come from the largest sum, $2K_{\max}$. The aliased [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) is $k' = 2K_{\max} - N$, and its magnitude is $|k'| = N - 2K_{\max}$. The condition for no [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) is that this must lie outside the retained band:
$$
N - 2K_{\max} > K_{\max}
$$
Or, more precisely for integer wavenumbers, $|k'| \ge K_{\max} + 1$, which gives $N - 2K_{\max} \ge K_{\max} + 1$. Rearranging this inequality yields a sharp condition on the maximum allowable cutoff [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) :
$$
3K_{\max} \le N-1 \implies K_{\max} \le \left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{3} \right\rfloor
$$
This result is the 2/3 rule: to dealias a [quadratic nonlinearity](@entry_id:753902) on an $N$-point grid without padding, one can only use approximately the lowest third of the available modes, or $2/3$ of the Nyquist frequency $(N/2)$.

This principle can be generalized. For a nonlinearity of order $m$ (e.g., a term like $u^m$), the product spectrum extends to wavenumbers of magnitude $mK_{\max}$. To prevent the highest modes from [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) back into the retained band of $|k| \le K_{\max}$, the aliased wavenumbers must fall outside this band. The "worst-case" interaction at $mK_{\max}$ would alias to a wavenumber near $mK_{\max} - N$. The no-aliasing condition is that this aliased mode must have a magnitude greater than $K_{\max}$, leading to the general truncation rule :
$$
(m+1)K_{\max}  N \implies K_{\max}  \frac{N}{m+1}
$$
For a cubic nonlinearity ($m=3$), this requires $K_{\max}  N/4$, a "1/4 rule." This strategy becomes increasingly inefficient for higher-order nonlinearities as it requires discarding a large fraction of the available degrees of freedom a priori .

### Dealiasing by Padding: The "Three-Halves Rule"

An alternative, and often more practical, approach is to retain the full resolution of the initial functions (e.g., up to $K_c \approx N/2$) but perform the nonlinear computation on a temporary, finer grid. This method is known as **[dealiasing](@entry_id:748248) by padding** or the **3/2 rule** for quadratic nonlinearities.

The procedure is as follows [@problem_id:3423305, @problem_id:3374785]:
1.  **Padding**: Start with the spectral coefficients $\{\hat{u}_k\}_{|k|\le K_c}$. Create an extended array of size $M  N$ by inserting zeros for all high-wavenumber modes ($K_c  |k| \le M/2$).
2.  **Transform**: Perform an inverse FFT of size $M$ on the padded array to obtain function values on a fine grid of $M$ points.
3.  **Multiply**: Compute the pointwise product on this fine grid.
4.  **Transform Back**: Perform a forward FFT of size $M$ on the product to obtain its spectral coefficients on the padded grid, $\{\hat{w}^{(M)}_k\}_{|k|\le M/2}$.
5.  **Truncation**: Discard the high-wavenumber coefficients from the padded computation, retaining only the modes in the original bandwidth, $\{\hat{w}_k\}_{|k|\le K_c}$.

The key insight is that by performing the computation on an $M$-point grid, the [circular convolution](@entry_id:147898) is now modulo $M$ instead of modulo $N$. The aliasing condition becomes $k_1+k_2 \equiv k \pmod M$. To ensure that the computed coefficients for the retained modes $|k| \le K_c$ are alias-free, we must choose $M$ large enough to prevent any wrap-around contamination.

The product of two functions band-limited to $K_c$ has a true spectrum extending to $2K_c$. The first aliased copy of this spectrum on the $M$-point grid will be centered around $M$. The lowest wavenumber in this aliased copy is $M - 2K_c$. To keep the desired band $|k| \le K_c$ clean, we must ensure that it does not overlap with this aliased band. This requires:
$$
M - 2K_c  K_c \implies M  3K_c
$$
Since the original grid has $N$ points, and typically we use as many modes as possible, we can approximate $K_c \approx N/2$. Substituting this gives the famous **3/2 rule**:
$$
M  3(N/2) = 1.5N
$$
Thus, to dealias a [quadratic nonlinearity](@entry_id:753902), one must pad the grid to at least $1.5$ times its original size (e.g., choosing $M = \lceil 3N/2 \rceil$) .

This padding strategy specifically neutralizes the nonlinear wrap-around mechanism by making the modulus of the convolution, $M$, too large for aliasing to occur in the desired [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) band. It does not, however, correct for any linear [sampling error](@entry_id:182646) that might have been present in the initial data . For a general nonlinearity of order $m$ (like $u^m$), the product spectrum extends to $mK_c$. The same logic requires $M - mK_c > K_c$, which implies $M > (m+1)K_c$. With $K_c \approx N/2$, the required padding factor $\alpha = M/N$ becomes $\alpha > (m+1)/2$ .

### Aliasing and Dealiasing in Polynomial-Based Methods

The phenomenon of [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) is not unique to Fourier methods. An analogous mechanism exists in methods based on polynomial approximations, such as Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and [spectral element methods](@entry_id:755171). In this context, the role of the discrete grid is played by a **numerical quadrature rule**, and [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) arises from the **underintegration** of integrals in the [weak formulation](@entry_id:142897).

Consider the assembly of a weak form containing a nonlinear flux, such as $\int_{-1}^{1} v(x) f(u(x)) \,dx$, where $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are polynomials of degree $p$ from the approximation space. The integrand, $v(x)f(u(x))$, is itself a polynomial. If the chosen [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061), with $Q$ points, is not exact for a polynomial of this degree, the discrete inner product will differ from the true continuous inner product. This discrepancy is the [aliasing error](@entry_id:637691).

For example, in the DG formulation of Burgers' equation with flux $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2$, a typical [volume integral](@entry_id:265381) term involves an integrand of the form $(\partial_x v(x)) f(u(x))$. If $u$ and $v$ are degree-$p$ polynomials, $f(u)$ is degree $2p$ and $\partial_x v$ is degree $p-1$. The total integrand is a polynomial of degree $3p-1$ . A standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature with $Q=p+1$ points is only exact for polynomials of degree up to $2(p+1)-1 = 2p+1$. The quadrature is inexact if $3p-1 > 2p+1$, which simplifies to $p > 2$. Thus, for any polynomial degree $p > 2$, [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) will occur .

This [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) manifests as a **spurious modal transfer**. The inexact quadrature misinterprets high-degree polynomial products as contributions to lower-degree [modal coefficients](@entry_id:752057). For instance, if we compute the projection of $(P_2(x))^2$ onto $P_2(x)$ using an under-sufficient 3-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061) cannot distinguish the $P_4(x)$ component of $(P_2(x))^2$ from a lower-degree alias, leading to an incorrect value for the $P_2$ modal coefficient [@problem_id:3374796, @problem_id:3374723].

Two [dealiasing](@entry_id:748248) strategies, analogous to the Fourier case, can be employed:

1.  **Overintegration**: This is the most direct approach and is analogous to padding. One simply chooses a [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061) with a sufficient number of points, $M_q$, to integrate the weak-form integrand exactly. For a cubic flux $f(u) = \frac{1}{3}u^3$ and basis degree $N$, the volume integrand can have a degree of $4N-1$. A Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre rule, exact for polynomials of degree $2M_q-3$, would require $2M_q-3 \ge 4N-1$, or $M_q \ge 2N+1$ points .

2.  **Polynomial Padding**: This strategy is conceptually similar to padding but operates entirely in the space of polynomials. Before computing the nonlinearity, the solution $u(x)$ (a degree-$N$ polynomial) is represented in a higher-degree [polynomial space](@entry_id:269905) of degree $P$. The nonlinear term $f(u)$ is then formed exactly within this space. For this to be possible, the degree $P$ must be at least as large as the degree of $f(u)$. For a cubic flux, $f(u)$ has degree $3N$, so one must pad to a [polynomial space](@entry_id:269905) of at least degree $P = 3N$ before projecting the result back down to the original degree-$N$ space .

In summary, whether in the context of Fourier series or orthogonal polynomials, the evaluation of nonlinearities on a [discrete set](@entry_id:146023) of points necessitates careful consideration of aliasing. While techniques like modal filtering can enhance stability, they cannot reverse [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) errors that have already occurred . Only systematic [dealiasing](@entry_id:748248) through truncation or padding (overintegration) can guarantee that the computed nonlinear interactions accurately reflect the underlying [continuous dynamics](@entry_id:268176) within the retained spectral or [modal basis](@entry_id:752055).
