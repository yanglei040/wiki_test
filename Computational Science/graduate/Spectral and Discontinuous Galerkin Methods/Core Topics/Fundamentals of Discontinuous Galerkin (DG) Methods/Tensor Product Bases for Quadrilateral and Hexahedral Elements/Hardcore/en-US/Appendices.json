            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard exercise in constructing orthonormal bases for spectral methods, a fundamental topic in numerical analysis and applied mathematics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the normalization constants $c_{n}$ and $c_{i j k}$ that scale the Legendre polynomials $P_{n}(x)$ and their tensor products $P_{i}(x) P_{j}(y) P_{k}(z)$ to form orthonormal bases on the domains $[-1,1]$ and $[-1,1]^3$, respectively. An orthonormal basis is one in which the inner product of any two distinct basis functions is zero (orthogonality), and the inner product of any basis function with itself, which is its squared norm, is one (normalization).\n\nFirst, we consider the one-dimensional case on the interval $[-1,1]$. The $L^{2}([-1,1])$ inner product is given by $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) g(x) \\, dx$. We seek to construct an orthonormal basis $\\{\\phi_{n}(x)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ from the sequence of Legendre polynomials $\\{P_{n}(x)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$. Let the orthonormal basis functions be defined as $\\phi_{n}(x) = c_{n} P_{n}(x)$, where $c_{n}$ is the real-valued normalization constant we need to find.\n\nThe condition for orthonormality is $\\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{m} \\rangle = \\delta_{nm}$, where $\\delta_{nm}$ is the Kronecker delta. Let us compute this inner product:\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{m} \\rangle = \\langle c_{n} P_{n}, c_{m} P_{m} \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} (c_{n} P_{n}(x)) (c_{m} P_{m}(x)) \\, dx = c_{n} c_{m} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{n}(x) P_{m}(x) \\, dx\n$$\nThe problem provides the orthogonality relation for Legendre polynomials: $\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{n}(x) P_{m}(x) \\, dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{nm}$. Substituting this into our expression yields:\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{m} \\rangle = c_{n} c_{m} \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{nm}\n$$\nFor this expression to be equal to $\\delta_{nm}$, we must consider the case where $n=m$. When $n \\neq m$, $\\delta_{nm}=0$, and the orthogonality condition $\\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{m} \\rangle = 0$ is already satisfied. For normalization, we require the squared $L^{2}$-norm of $\\phi_{n}(x)$ to be unity. The squared norm is $\\|\\phi_{n}\\|^2 = \\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{n} \\rangle$. Setting $m=n$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_{n}, \\phi_{n} \\rangle = (c_{n})^2 \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{nn} = (c_{n})^2 \\frac{2}{2n+1}\n$$\nFor normalization, we set this equal to $1$:\n$$\n(c_{n})^2 \\frac{2}{2n+1} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $c_{n}$, we find $(c_{n})^2 = \\frac{2n+1}{2}$. By convention, we choose the positive root for the normalization constant:\n$$\nc_{n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2n+1}{2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we extend this to the three-dimensional case on the reference hexahedron $[-1,1]^3$. The tensor-product $L^{2}$ inner product is given by $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x,y,z) g(x,y,z) \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz$. We seek a tensor-product orthonormal basis $\\{\\Phi_{i j k}(x,y,z)\\}_{i,j,k \\ge 0}$ where $\\Phi_{i j k}(x,y,z) = c_{i j k} P_{i}(x) P_{j}(y) P_{k}(z)$. The constant $c_{i j k}$ is the normalization constant.\n\nThe condition for orthonormality in this multi-index setting is $\\langle \\Phi_{i j k}, \\Phi_{l m n} \\rangle = \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jm} \\delta_{kn}$. As before, we focus on the normalization condition by calculating the squared norm of a basis function, which corresponds to setting $(l,m,n) = (i,j,k)$:\n$$\n\\| \\Phi_{i j k} \\|^2 = \\langle \\Phi_{i j k}, \\Phi_{i j k} \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} [c_{i j k} P_{i}(x) P_{j}(y) P_{k}(z)]^2 \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz\n$$\n$$\n\\| \\Phi_{i j k} \\|^2 = (c_{i j k})^2 \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{i}(x)^2 P_{j}(y)^2 P_{k}(z)^2 \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz\n$$\nDue to the tensor-product nature of the function and the domain, the triple integral is separable into a product of three one-dimensional integrals:\n$$\n\\| \\Phi_{i j k} \\|^2 = (c_{i j k})^2 \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{i}(x)^2 \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{j}(y)^2 \\, dy \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{k}(z)^2 \\, dz \\right)\n$$\nWe can use the one-dimensional result for the squared norm of a Legendre polynomial, $\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{n}(x)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1}$. Applying this to each integral:\n$$\n\\| \\Phi_{i j k} \\|^2 = (c_{i j k})^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{2i+1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2}{2j+1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2}{2k+1} \\right) = (c_{i j k})^2 \\frac{8}{(2i+1)(2j+1)(2k+1)}\n$$\nFor normalization, we set this squared norm to $1$:\n$$\n(c_{i j k})^2 \\frac{8}{(2i+1)(2j+1)(2k+1)} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $c_{i j k}$, we get $(c_{i j k})^2 = \\frac{(2i+1)(2j+1)(2k+1)}{8}$. Again taking the positive root:\n$$\nc_{i j k} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2i+1)(2j+1)(2k+1)}{8}}\n$$\nWe observe that $c_{i j k} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2i+1}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2j+1}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2k+1}{2}} = c_i c_j c_k$. This confirms that the orthonormal tensor-product basis is formed by the product of the one-dimensional orthonormal basis functions, i.e., $\\Phi_{i j k}(x,y,z) = \\phi_{i}(x) \\phi_{j}(y) \\phi_{k}(z)$.\n\nThe required normalization constants are thus determined.",

            "solution": "The problem is composed of two parts. First, we must compute the exact value of the integral $I_{ij}$. Second, we must determine the condition under which a tensor-product Gauss-Legendre quadrature evaluates this integral exactly.\n\nPart 1: Analytical Computation of $I_{ij}$\n\nThe integral to be computed is given as\n$$\nI_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_{i}(\\xi)\\,\\phi_{j}(\\eta)\\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_{i}(\\xi) = P_{i}(\\xi)$ and $\\phi_{j}(\\eta) = P_{j}(\\eta)$, with $P_k(x)$ being the standard Legendre polynomial of degree $k$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The indices $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers.\nDue to the separable nature of the integrand and the rectangular domain, the integral can be written as a product of two one-dimensional integrals:\n$$\nI_{ij} = \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{i}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{j}(\\eta)\\,d\\eta \\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate $I_{ij}$, we first need to compute the general integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} P_k(x)\\,dx$ for a non-negative integer $k$. We can do this by leveraging the orthogonality property of Legendre polynomials. The standard orthogonality relation is\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_m(x) P_n(x) \\,dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{mn}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $m=n$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe can express the constant function $1$ as the zeroth-degree Legendre polynomial, $P_0(x) = 1$. Therefore, the integral we wish to compute can be written as:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_k(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_k(x) P_0(x) \\,dx\n$$\nApplying the orthogonality relation with $m=k$ and $n=0$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_k(x) P_0(x) \\,dx = \\frac{2}{2(0)+1} \\delta_{k0} = 2 \\delta_{k0}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the integral is equal to $2$ if $k=0$, and it is equal to $0$ if $k \\neq 0$. Since $k$ is a non-negative integer, this means the integral is $0$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nNow we can substitute this result back into the expression for $I_{ij}$. The two one-dimensional integrals are:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{i}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi = 2 \\delta_{i0}\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{j}(\\eta)\\,d\\eta = 2 \\delta_{j0}\n$$\nMultiplying these two results gives the value of $I_{ij}$:\n$$\nI_{ij} = (2 \\delta_{i0}) (2 \\delta_{j0}) = 4 \\delta_{i0} \\delta_{j0}\n$$\nThe product of the two Kronecker deltas, $\\delta_{i0} \\delta_{j0}$, is equal to $1$ only when both $i=0$ and $j=0$. If either $i \\neq 0$ or $j \\neq 0$, the product is $0$. Therefore, we can express the result as:\n$$\nI_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 4 & \\text{if } i=0 \\text{ and } j=0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $I_{ij}$.\n\nPart 2: Condition for Exact Quadrature\n\nWe now consider the evaluation of $I_{ij}$ using a tensor-product Gauss-Legendre quadrature with $p$ points in each coordinate direction. A one-dimensional $p$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule approximates an integral on $[-1, 1]$ as a weighted sum:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k f(x_k)\n$$\nwhere $x_k$ are the roots of $P_p(x)$ and $w_k$ are the corresponding quadrature weights. The cardinal property of this rule is that it is exact for any polynomial $f(x)$ of degree up to $2p-1$. That is, if $\\deg(f) \\le 2p-1$, the approximation is an equality.\n\nThe two-dimensional tensor-product quadrature rule for $I_{ij}$ is given by:\n$$\nI_{ij}^{quad} = \\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\sum_{l=1}^{p} w_k w_l P_i(\\xi_k) P_j(\\eta_l) = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k P_i(\\xi_k)\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l=1}^{p} w_l P_j(\\eta_l)\\right)\n$$\nFor this two-dimensional quadrature to be exact, i.e., $I_{ij}^{quad} = I_{ij}$, both of the one-dimensional quadrature sums must be exact representations of their corresponding integrals.\n1. The first sum must be exact:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k P_i(\\xi_k) = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_i(\\xi)\\,d\\xi\n$$\nThis is true if the degree of the integrand, $P_i(\\xi)$, is less than or equal to $2p-1$. The degree of $P_i(\\xi)$ is $i$. Thus, we require $i \\le 2p-1$.\n\n2. The second sum must be exact:\n$$\n\\sum_{l=1}^{p} w_l P_j(\\eta_l) = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_j(\\eta)\\,d\\eta\n$$\nSimilarly, the degree of the integrand, $P_j(\\eta)$, is $j$. This equality holds if $j \\le 2p-1$.\n\nFor the tensor-product quadrature to be exact for $I_{ij}$, both conditions must hold simultaneously:\n$$\ni \\le 2p-1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad j \\le 2p-1\n$$\nThis is equivalent to requiring that the maximum of the two degrees satisfies the condition:\n$$\n\\max(i, j) \\le 2p-1\n$$\nTo find the minimal condition on $p$, we solve this inequality for $p$:\n$$\n2p \\ge \\max(i, j) + 1 \\implies p \\ge \\frac{\\max(i, j) + 1}{2}\n$$\nSince $p$ must be an integer, the minimal number of quadrature points required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the right-hand side. This can be expressed using the ceiling function:\n$$\np_{min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\max(i, j) + 1}{2} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nThis is the minimal condition on $p$ that guarantees exactness.\n\nFinally, we must verify that under this condition, the quadrature reproduces the analytical result from Part 1.\nIf the condition $p \\ge (\\max(i, j) + 1)/2$ is satisfied, then by the definition of exactness for Gauss-Legendre quadrature, we have:\n$$\nI_{ij}^{quad} = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k P_i(\\xi_k)\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l=1}^{p} w_l P_j(\\eta_l)\\right) = \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_i(\\xi)\\,d\\xi \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} P_j(\\eta)\\,d\\eta \\right)\n$$\nThe right-hand side is precisely the definition of $I_{ij}$. As we computed in Part 1, this value is $4 \\delta_{i0} \\delta_{j0}$. Therefore, under the derived minimal condition on $p$, the quadrature is guaranteed to be exact and reproduces the analytical result. This completes the verification.",

The integrand $u^3$ is a polynomial of total degree $6$, with terms up to degree $6$ in individual variables, which exceeds the exactness limit of the quadrature rule, leading to under-integration.\n\n### Task 3: Computation of the aliasing error $E$\nThe aliasing error $E$ is the difference between the exact integral and the quadrature approximation:\n$$ E = I_{\\mathrm{exact}} - I_{\\mathrm{quad}} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{96}{35} - \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{96 \\times 3 - 16 \\times 35}{105} = \\frac{288 - 560}{105} = -\\frac{272}{105} $$\n\n### Task 4: Computation of the corrected integral $I_{\\mathrm{corr}}$\nThe corrected integral is defined as the exact integral of the $L^{2}$ projection of $u^{3}$ onto the polynomial space $Q_{2}([-1,1]^{2})$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{Q_{2}}(u^{3}) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\nThis integral can be expressed using the standard $L^{2}$ inner product over $[-1,1]^{2}$, $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x,y)g(x,y) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$, as:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\langle P_{Q_{2}}(u^{3}), 1 \\rangle $$\nThe defining property of the $L^{2}$ projection $P_{V}(f)$ of a function $f$ onto a space $V$ is that the error $f - P_{V}(f)$ is orthogonal to every function $v \\in V$. This means $\\langle f - P_{V}(f), v \\rangle = 0$ for all $v \\in V$, which implies:\n$$ \\langle f, v \\rangle = \\langle P_{V}(f), v \\rangle \\quad \\forall v \\in V $$\nIn our case, $f = u^{3}$ and $V = Q_{2}([-1,1]^{2})$. We need to evaluate $I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\langle P_{Q_{2}}(u^{3}), 1 \\rangle$. The function $v(x,y)=1$ is a constant, which is a polynomial of degree $0$ in each variable, and is therefore an element of the space $Q_{2}([-1,1]^{2})$.\nBy setting $v=1$ in the defining property of the projection, we get:\n$$ \\langle u^{3}, 1 \\rangle = \\langle P_{Q_{2}}(u^{3}), 1 \\rangle $$\nThe left-hand side is the exact integral of $u^{3}$:\n$$ \\langle u^{3}, 1 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} u(x,y)^{3} \\cdot 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y = I_{\\mathrm{exact}} $$\nThe right-hand side is the definition of the corrected integral:\n$$ \\langle P_{Q_{2}}(u^{3}), 1 \\rangle = I_{\\mathrm{corr}} $$\nTherefore, the corrected integral is equal to the exact integral:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = I_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{96}{35} $$\nThis result demonstrates a key property of $L^2$ projections: the integral of the projection of a function is equal to the integral of the function itself, as the integral is simply the inner product with the function $1$, which belongs to the polynomial space.\n\nThe final answers for $E$ and $I_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ are thus:\n$E = -\\frac{272}{105}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{96}{35}$",
