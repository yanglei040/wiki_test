## Introduction
In the Finite Element Method (FEM), numerical quadrature is essential for computing element stiffness matrices, especially when dealing with complex geometries. While standard "full" [quadrature rules](@entry_id:753909) are designed to integrate these matrices accurately, they can paradoxically lead to severe numerical pathologies. For certain problems, particularly those involving thin structures or [nearly incompressible materials](@entry_id:752388), fully integrated elements can become artificially stiff—a phenomenon known as "locking"—yielding grossly inaccurate results. This creates a critical knowledge gap: how can we modify the integration process to retain physical accuracy without succumbing to these numerical failures?

This article delves into advanced quadrature strategies, namely reduced and selective integration, which provide powerful remedies to these challenges. Across three comprehensive chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of these indispensable techniques.

*   The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will lay the theoretical groundwork. It introduces the concepts of full and reduced integration, explains the origins of volumetric and [shear locking](@entry_id:164115), and details the critical danger of hourglass instabilities that arise from under-integration.

*   Next, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will showcase how these methods are applied in practice. We will explore their canonical use in solid and [structural mechanics](@entry_id:276699) and reveal their broader relevance in fields such as geomechanics, wave propagation, and [contact mechanics](@entry_id:177379), highlighting connections to related advanced methods like the B-bar formulation.

*   Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide a series of guided computational exercises. These will allow you to directly observe the effects of locking, analyze the mechanism of selective integration at the element level, and implement a stabilization scheme to control for [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855).

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the application of the Finite Element Method (FEM), the assembly of element stiffness matrices and load vectors requires the evaluation of integrals over each element's domain. While these integrals can sometimes be computed analytically, particularly for simple element geometries and constant coefficients, the use of [isoparametric mapping](@entry_id:173239) to handle complex geometries typically results in integrands that are rational functions, making analytical integration intractable. Consequently, **[numerical quadrature](@entry_id:136578)** is an indispensable tool in computational practice. This chapter elucidates the principles behind standard and advanced quadrature strategies, focusing on the techniques of reduced and selective integration, their motivating physical and numerical challenges, and their theoretical underpinnings.

### Numerical Integration and Full Quadrature

The [element stiffness matrix](@entry_id:139369) for a typical elliptic problem is formed by integrals of a bilinear form over the element domain $\Omega_e$. For instance, in [linear elasticity](@entry_id:166983), its entries are of the form:
$$ \mathbf{K}_e = \int_{\Omega_e} \mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{D} \mathbf{B} \, dV $$
where $\mathbf{B}$ is the [strain-displacement matrix](@entry_id:163451) derived from shape function derivatives and $\mathbf{D}$ is the material [constitutive matrix](@entry_id:164908). Using an [isoparametric mapping](@entry_id:173239) from a reference element $\hat{\Omega}$ (e.g., a square or cube) to the physical element $\Omega_e$, this integral is transformed into:
$$ \mathbf{K}_e = \int_{\hat{\Omega}} \mathbf{B}(\boldsymbol{\xi})^T \mathbf{D} \mathbf{B}(\boldsymbol{\xi}) \det(\mathbf{J}(\boldsymbol{\xi})) \, d\boldsymbol{\xi} $$
where $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ are the reference coordinates and $\mathbf{J}(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ is the Jacobian of the mapping. This integral is then approximated by a weighted sum of the integrand evaluated at specific points, known as Gauss points:
$$ \mathbf{K}_e \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N_{gp}} w_i \left( \mathbf{B}(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i)^T \mathbf{D} \mathbf{B}(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i) \det(\mathbf{J}(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i)) \right) $$

The choice of the number of Gauss points, $N_{gp}$, and their locations and weights is critical. A **full quadrature** (or "exact" quadrature) rule is one chosen to be sufficiently accurate to integrate the [stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659) without degrading the optimal convergence rate of the element. The required order of the rule depends on the polynomial degree of the integrand.

To determine this, we must analyze the integrand's structure. Consider the scalar diffusion problem $a(u,v)=\int_{\Omega}\nabla u\cdot\nabla v\,dx$ discretized with bilinear quadrilateral ($Q_1$) elements on a mesh of affine-mapped parallelograms . On the reference square $\hat{K}=[-1,1]^{2}$, the $Q_1$ [shape functions](@entry_id:141015) $N_i(\xi, \eta)$ are bilinear. Their gradients with respect to reference coordinates, $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\xi}} N_i$, are linear. For an affine map, the Jacobian $\mathbf{J}$ is constant. The gradient in physical coordinates is $\nabla_x N_i = (\mathbf{J}^{-1})^T \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\xi}} N_i$, so it is also linear in $\xi$ and $\eta$. The integrand for the [stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659), $\nabla_x N_i \cdot \nabla_x N_j$, is therefore a product of two linear functions, resulting in a polynomial of degree at most 2 in each coordinate direction. A 1D Gauss-Legendre rule with $n$ points is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$. To exactly integrate a quadratic polynomial (degree 2), we require $2n-1 \ge 2$, which implies $n \ge 1.5$. Thus, the minimal integer is $n=2$. A $2 \times 2$ tensor-product Gauss rule is required for exact integration in this case, and is considered the "full" integration scheme for a $Q_1$ element.

### The Principle and Perils of Reduced Integration

**Reduced integration** is the practice of intentionally using a [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061) of a lower order than that required for full quadrature, while keeping the [shape functions](@entry_id:141015) and the underlying finite element space unchanged . For the $Q_1$ element, this typically means using a $1 \times 1$ rule (a single Gauss point at the element center) instead of the full $2 \times 2$ rule. The primary motivations for this are twofold: a modest reduction in computational cost, and, far more importantly, the alleviation of numerical "locking" phenomena, which will be discussed shortly.

However, this technique is not without significant drawbacks. The most critical issue is the potential introduction of **[spurious zero-energy modes](@entry_id:755267)**, commonly known as **[hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855)**. These are non-physical deformation patterns that the element can undergo without generating any strain energy, because the strains associated with these modes are zero at the reduced set of integration points.

A classic example can be constructed for a rectangular $Q_1$ element in plane strain . Consider a nodal displacement pattern where nodes are displaced horizontally by $\boldsymbol{u} = (\alpha, 0, -\alpha, 0, \alpha, 0, -\alpha, 0)$ for nodes 1 through 4 respectively, forming a characteristic "hourglass" shape. The interpolated [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) is $\boldsymbol{u}(\xi, \eta) = (\alpha \xi \eta, 0)$. The strain components can be computed as $\varepsilon_{xx} = \partial u_x / \partial x$, $\varepsilon_{yy} = \partial u_y / \partial y$, and $\gamma_{xy} = \partial u_x / \partial y + \partial u_y / \partial x$. For a rectangular element, this results in a strain field where $\varepsilon_{xx}$ is proportional to $\eta$ and $\gamma_{xy}$ is proportional to $\xi$. Crucially, at the element center $(\xi, \eta)=(0,0)$, all strain components are zero. Since one-point quadrature only evaluates the [strain energy density](@entry_id:200085) at this single point, the calculated [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) for this non-zero deformation is exactly zero:
$$ U_{\text{red}} = \text{Area} \times \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(0,0)^T \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(0,0) = 0 $$
The resulting [element stiffness matrix](@entry_id:139369) is **rank-deficient**, meaning it has a larger null-space than just the physical rigid-body modes. If not properly constrained, these [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855) can propagate through the mesh, leading to uncontrollable, oscillatory solutions that are physically meaningless .

The problem is exacerbated by element distortion . For a distorted, non-affine element, the Jacobian $\mathbf{J}$ and the [strain-displacement matrix](@entry_id:163451) $\mathbf{B}$ become more complex functions of $\xi$ and $\eta$. While an hourglass deformation pattern always produces zero strain at the element's center (and thus zero energy under reduced integration), its *exact* [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) (computed with full integration) increases with the degree of element distortion. Reduced integration misses this stabilizing energy, making the discrepancy between the numerical model and physical reality larger for poor-quality meshes. This amplifies the instability.

### Numerical Locking Phenomena

Despite the risk of [hourglassing](@entry_id:164538), reduced integration is a powerful tool because it can cure numerical **locking**. Locking is a pathology in which a [finite element formulation](@entry_id:164720) becomes overly stiff and provides grossly inaccurate results, typically as a material or geometric parameter approaches a physical limit. Two common forms are [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606) and [shear locking](@entry_id:164115).

**Volumetric locking** occurs in the analysis of [nearly incompressible materials](@entry_id:752388), such as rubber or certain biological tissues. As Poisson's ratio $\nu$ approaches $0.5$, the [bulk modulus](@entry_id:160069) $K$ becomes very large. The material must deform with nearly zero volume change (i.e., the divergence of the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) must be near zero, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} \approx 0$). Standard low-order displacement-based elements, when fully integrated, impose this constraint at multiple Gauss points. The limited kinematic freedom of the element cannot satisfy these multiple constraints simultaneously, causing the element to "lock up" and exhibit an artificially stiff response .

**Shear locking** is prevalent in the analysis of thin structures like plates and shells using Reissner-Mindlin theory, which accounts for [shear deformation](@entry_id:170920). The bending stiffness of a plate scales with its thickness cubed ($t^3$), while its transverse shear stiffness scales linearly with thickness ($t$). In the thin plate limit ($t \to 0$), the shear stiffness becomes orders of magnitude larger than the bending stiffness. The formulation thus heavily penalizes any non-zero shear strains. Due to interpolation incompatibilities between the rotation and displacement fields in low-order elements, [pure bending](@entry_id:202969) deformations can induce spurious shear strains at the Gauss points. With full integration, the element resists these spurious strains, suppressing valid bending deformation and "locking" into a rigid state .

### The Remedy: Selective Integration

**Selective integration**, also known as [selective reduced integration](@entry_id:168281) (SRI), offers an elegant solution by combining the strengths of full and reduced integration. The core idea is to decompose the element's [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) (and thus its bilinear form) into two or more parts and apply different [quadrature rules](@entry_id:753909) to each part .
$$ a_h(u_h, v_h) = a_{h, 1}(u_h, v_h) + a_{h, 2}(u_h, v_h) $$
Typically, the term responsible for locking is integrated with a reduced rule, while the term that provides stability and controls [hourglassing](@entry_id:164538) is integrated with a full rule.

For **[volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606)** in linear elasticity, the strain energy is split into a volumetric part (related to volume change) and a deviatoric part (related to shape change). The standard SRI strategy is:
*   Integrate the locking-prone **volumetric term** using a **reduced ($1 \times 1$) [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061)**. This relaxes the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592), effectively enforcing it only at the element's center.
*   Integrate the **deviatoric term** using a **full ($2 \times 2$) [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061)**. This term governs the element's shear response and provides the necessary stiffness to control [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855).
This approach prevents [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606) while maintaining stability   .

For **[shear locking](@entry_id:164115)** in Reissner-Mindlin plates, the energy is split into a bending part and a transverse shear part. The SRI strategy is:
*   Integrate the locking-prone **shear term** using a **reduced ($1 \times 1$) quadrature rule**. This weakens the constraint against spurious shear strains, allowing the element to bend freely.
*   Integrate the **bending term** using a **full ($2 \times 2$) quadrature rule** to accurately capture the curvature.
This procedure effectively recovers the correct thin-plate behavior in the limit as $t \to 0$ .

### Theoretical Framework: Variational Crimes and Consistency

The use of numerical quadrature that does not exactly integrate the bilinear form ($a_h \neq a$) is formally known as a **[variational crime](@entry_id:178318)**. This has profound consequences for the mathematical properties of the finite element method .

The cornerstone of the [error analysis](@entry_id:142477) for the standard Galerkin method is the **Galerkin orthogonality** property: $a(u - u_h, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \in V_h$. This states that the error in the solution is orthogonal to the finite element space with respect to the [energy inner product](@entry_id:167297). When reduced or selective integration is used, the computed solution $u_h^Q$ satisfies $a_h(u_h^Q, v_h) = \ell_h(v_h)$. The exact Galerkin [orthogonality property](@entry_id:268007) is lost. In general, $a(u - u_h^Q, v_h) \neq 0$. Consequently, the standard error estimate from Céa's lemma is no longer directly applicable. The [error analysis](@entry_id:142477) must be performed using a more general result, such as **Strang's First Lemma**, which includes an additional term to bound the **[consistency error](@entry_id:747725)** introduced by the quadrature.

A method is consistent if it can exactly reproduce the exact solution when that solution lies within the finite element space. A [necessary condition for convergence](@entry_id:157681) is that the method must pass the **patch test**, which requires that it can exactly reproduce a state of constant strain. While reduced integration introduces a [variational crime](@entry_id:178318), well-designed selective integration schemes are constructed precisely to pass the patch test . This ensures that even though Galerkin orthogonality in its exact form is violated, the method remains consistent for these fundamental polynomial fields and will converge to the correct solution as the mesh is refined .

The success of [selective reduced integration](@entry_id:168281) for [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606) can be understood at an even deeper level. Applying 1-point quadrature to the volumetric energy of a $Q_1$ element is algebraically equivalent to using a [mixed formulation](@entry_id:171379) with a bilinear [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) and a piecewise constant pressure field ($Q_1/P_0$ element) and then statically condensing the pressure unknown . The reduced integration implicitly introduces this more flexible pressure space, which is better suited to satisfying the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592) and thus circumvents locking. This reveals that reduced and selective integration are not merely computational tricks, but are deeply connected to the underlying structure of stable [mixed finite element methods](@entry_id:165231).
