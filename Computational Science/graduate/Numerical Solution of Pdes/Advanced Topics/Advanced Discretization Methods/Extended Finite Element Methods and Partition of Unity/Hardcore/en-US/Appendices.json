The crack is modeled with the extended finite element method (XFEM) using the Heaviside enrichment to represent the displacement jump across the crack faces and the near-tip asymptotic branch enrichments to capture the singular fields near the crack tip. The crack is defined as the line segment from $\\mathbf{x}_A=(0.2,0.9)$ to the tip $\\mathbf{x}_T=(2.4,0.9)$ (coordinates in the same units as the mesh), and it does not pass through any node or coincide with any element edge.\n\nAssume the following enrichment selection rules:\n\n(1) Heaviside enrichment: A node is Heaviside-enriched if at least one element attached to it is intersected by the interior of $\\Gamma_c$ and the node does not belong to the near-tip enriched set.\n\n(2) Near-tip enrichment: Let $e_t$ be the unique element containing the crack tip $\\mathbf{x}_T$.

            "solution": "We begin from the foundational finite element concepts: a bilinear quadrilateral element associates each node with a scalar shape function whose support is the union of elements that contain the node. In two-dimensional linear elasticity, the displacement field has two components, so each node possesses $2$ standard degrees of freedom. In the extended finite element method (XFEM), the partition of unity provided by the standard shape functions is multiplied by enrichment functions to represent features such as displacement jumps and crack-tip singularities. Each scalar enrichment function at a node introduces a vector-valued enriched coefficient with $2$ additional degrees of freedom.\n\nWe apply the provided enrichment selection rules:\n\nStep $1$: Identify the elements intersected by the interior of $\\Gamma_c$ and the element containing the crack tip.\n\nThe crack $\\Gamma_c$ is the segment from $\\mathbf{x}_A=(0.2,0.9)$ to $\\mathbf{x}_T=(2.4,0.9)$, i.e., a horizontal line at $y=0.9$ from $x=0.2$ to $x=2.4$. The element extents are:\n- $e_1=[1,2,6,5]$ spans $x \\in [0,1]$, $y \\in [0,1]$,\n- $e_2=[2,3,7,6]$ spans $x \\in [1,2]$, $y \\in [0,1]$,\n- $e_3=[3,4,8,7]$ spans $x \\in [2,3]$, $y \\in [0,1]$,\n- $e_4=[5,6,10,9]$ spans $x \\in [0,1]$, $y \\in [1,2]$,\n- $e_5=[6,7,11,10]$ spans $x \\in [1,2]$, $y \\in [1,2]$,\n- $e_6=[7,8,12,11]$ spans $x \\in [2,3]$, $y \\in [1,2]$.\n\nBecause $y=0.9 \\in (0,1)$, the crack lies within the bottom row of elements ($e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$). The $x$-interval of the crack is $[0.2,2.4]$, which intersects:\n- $e_1$ for $x \\in [0.2,1]$ (interior intersection),\n- $e_2$ for $x \\in [1,2]$ (interior intersection),\n- $e_3$ for $x \\in [2,2.4]$ (interior intersection up to the tip).\n\nThe crack tip point $\\mathbf{x}_T=(2.4,0.9)$ satisfies $22.43$ and $00.91$, hence the tip element is $e_t=e_3$.\n\nStep $2$: Construct the near-tip enriched node set according to rule $(2)$.\n\nBy rule $(2)$, the near-tip enriched set consists of the nodes of $e_t$ and of all elements sharing an edge with $e_t$. The edge-adjacent neighbors of $e_3$ are:\n- Left neighbor $e_2$ (shared vertical edge along $x=2$),\n- Top neighbor $e_6$ (shared horizontal edge along $y=1$),\nand there is no right neighbor (domain boundary at $x=3$) nor bottom neighbor (domain boundary at $y=0$).\n\nThus, the near-tip patch is the union of elements $\\{e_2,e_3,e_6\\}$ with node sets:\n- $e_2$ has nodes $\\{2,3,7,6\\}$,\n- $e_3$ has nodes $\\{3,4,8,7\\}$,\n- $e_6$ has nodes $\\{7,8,12,11\\}$.\n\nTaking the union, the near-tip enriched node set is\n$\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{tip}}=\\{2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12\\}$.\n\nBy the stated approximation, each near-tip-enriched node introduces $4$ scalar branch functions, each with a $2$-component vector coefficient, for $8$ additional degrees of freedom per node.\n\nStep $3$: Construct the Heaviside enriched node set according to rule $(1)$.\n\nPer rule (1), a node is Heaviside-enriched if its support is intersected by the interior of $\\Gamma_c$ and it is not in the near-tip enriched set. The nodes whose supports are intersected by the crack are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. From this set, we remove the nodes that are in the near-tip enriched set $\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{tip}}$.\nThe Heaviside-enriched nodes are therefore\n$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\} \\setminus \\{2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12\\} = \\{1,5\\}$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{N}_{H}=\\{1,5\\}$.\n\nEach Heaviside-enriched node introduces a single scalar Heaviside function with a $2$-component vector coefficient, for $2$ additional degrees of freedom per node.\n\nStep $4$: Count the additional degrees of freedom.\n\n- Heaviside contribution: $|\\mathcal{N}_{H}| \\times 2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$ additional degrees of freedom.\n- Near-tip contribution: $|\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{tip}}| \\times 8 = 8 \\times 8 = 64$ additional degrees of freedom.\n\nTotal additional degrees of freedom introduced by the enrichment relative to the standard finite element model is\n$4 + 64 = 68$.\n\nStep $5$: Justification of the selection.\n\nThe Heaviside enrichment is assigned to nodes whose nodal supports are intersected by the interior of the crack segment, ensuring the partition of unity can represent a displacement jump across the crack faces in elements cut by the crack away from the tip. Excluding nodes in the near-tip patch from Heaviside enrichment avoids overlapping discontinuous and singular enrichments on the same nodes, which can cause ill-conditioning and linear dependence.\n\nThe near-tip enrichment is assigned to the tip element and its edge-adjacent neighbors to capture the square-root singularity and angular variation of the stress and displacement fields near the crack tip using the four standard two-dimensional branch functions. Extending the tip enrichment to the one-ring of edge-adjacent elements provides sufficient support to represent the asymptotic fields while maintaining a compact enriched region. This division of enriched sets is consistent with the extended finite element method’s partition of unity framework and leverages the local nature of the crack-tip singular fields while separately handling the displacement jump away from the tip.\n\nTherefore, the total number of additional degrees of freedom is $68$.",

            "problem": "Consider the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) built from the Partition of Unity Method (PUM), in which a standard finite element basis $\\{N_{i}\\}$ is augmented locally by enrichment functions of the form $N_{i}(x)\\,\\psi(x)$, where $\\psi(x)$ is an enrichment function. In PUM, the defining property is that the standard shape functions satisfy the partition of unity, namely $\\sum_{i} N_{i}(x) = 1$ for all $x$ in an element, which guarantees exact reproduction of constant fields and, under appropriate completeness, exact reproduction of linear fields. In XFEM with Heaviside enrichment, nodes whose support is intersected by a discontinuity (e.g., a crack) are enriched, and elements with standard nodes that are adjacent to enriched nodes but are not themselves cut by the discontinuity are called blending elements.\n\nLet a one-dimensional domain $\\Omega = [0,2h]$ be discretized by a uniform mesh with nodes at $x_{0}=0$, $x_{1}=h$, and $x_{2}=2h$. Consider linear Lagrange shape functions on the element $E_{1}=[x_{0},x_{1}]$, namely $N_{0}(x)$ and $N_{1}(x)$, and define a discontinuity by the level-set function $\\phi(x) = x - \\tfrac{3}{2}h$. Use the naive Heaviside enrichment $\\psi(x) = H(\\phi(x))$, where $H(\\cdot)$ is the Heaviside function taking values $-1$ for negative arguments and $+1$ for positive arguments. The node at $x_{1}$ is enriched because its support includes the cut element $[x_{1},x_{2}]$, while $E_{1}$ is a blending element.\n\nIn the blending element $E_{1}$, the local XFEM basis is taken as $\\{N_{0}(x),\\,N_{1}(x),\\,N_{1}(x)\\,H(\\phi(x))\\}$ (i.e., naive, non-shifted enrichment).

Provide the simplified closed-form expression for $S(x)$ valid for all $x \\in [0,h]$. No rounding is required. Express your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of $x$ and $h$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the partition of unity property for a naively enriched basis in a blending element within the context of the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM).\n\nFirst, we define the standard linear Lagrange shape functions on the element $E_{1} = [0, h]$. The nodes of this element are at $x_{0}=0$ and $x_{1}=h$. The shape functions are defined such that $N_{i}(x_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. For a linear basis on the interval $[0,h]$, these are:\n$$\nN_{0}(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{h}\n$$\n$$\nN_{1}(x) = \\frac{x}{h}\n$$\nThese functions are valid for $x \\in [0,h]$. As stated in the problem, they satisfy the partition of unity property:\n$$\nN_{0}(x) + N_{1}(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{h}\\right) + \\frac{x}{h} = 1\n$$\nfor all $x \\in E_{1}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the enrichment function, $\\psi(x) = H(\\phi(x))$, on this element. The level-set function is $\\phi(x) = x - \\frac{3}{2}h$. The discontinuity occurs where $\\phi(x)=0$, i.e., at $x=\\frac{3}{2}h$, which is in the adjacent element $E_{2}=[h,2h]$, not in $E_{1}=[0,h]$.\nFor any point $x \\in E_{1}$, we have $0 \\le x \\le h$. Therefore, the value of the level-set function is bounded by:\n$$\n\\phi(0) \\le \\phi(x) \\le \\phi(h)\n$$\n$$\n0 - \\frac{3}{2}h \\le \\phi(x) \\le h - \\frac{3}{2}h\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{3}{2}h \\le \\phi(x) \\le -\\frac{1}{2}h\n$$\nSince $h0$, $\\phi(x)$ is strictly negative for all $x \\in E_{1}$. According to the problem's definition of the Heaviside function, $H(y)=-1$ for $y0$. Thus, the enrichment function is constant over the entire element $E_{1}$:\n$$\nH(\\phi(x)) = -1 \\quad \\forall x \\in E_{1} = [0,h]\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the pointwise sum $S(x)$ of the local XFEM basis functions $\\{N_{0}(x),\\,N_{1}(x),\\,N_{1}(x)\\,H(\\phi(x))\\}$ on the element $E_{1}$:\n$$\nS(x) = N_{0}(x) + N_{1}(x) + N_{1}(x)\\,H(\\phi(x))\n$$\nWe can group the first two terms, which constitute the standard partition of unity, and then substitute the values for $N_1(x)$ and $H(\\phi(x))$:\n$$\nS(x) = \\left( N_{0}(x) + N_{1}(x) \\right) + N_{1}(x)\\,H(\\phi(x))\n$$\n$$\nS(x) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{h}\\right) (-1)\n$$\n$$\nS(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{h}\n$$\nThis is the simplified closed-form expression for $S(x)$ valid for all $x \\in [0,h]$.\n\nThis result clearly shows that $S(x) \\neq 1$ for any $x \\in (0,h]$. The partition of unity is violated for the naive enriched basis.\n\nThe implication of this violation is profound. The partition of unity property, $\\sum \\Psi_k(x) = 1$ for a basis $\\{\\Psi_k\\}$, is the fundamental requirement for the basis to be able to reproduce a constant field $u(x)=C$ by simply assigning the value $C$ to all corresponding degrees of freedom. The failure to satisfy this property means the basis fails the zeroth-order patch test. An approximation method that fails this test will not, in general, converge to the exact solution as the mesh is refined.\n\nThis deficiency has direct consequences for the approximation of any function, including the linear field $u(x)=x$. If the basis is unable to correctly represent a constant field (a polynomial of degree $0$), its ability to optimally approximate a linear field (a polynomial of degree $1$) is fundamentally compromised. The error in approximation is polluted by this low-order inconsistency, leading to a degradation of the convergence rate from the optimal order expected for linear elements. The mechanism is the introduction of the enrichment term $N_{1}(x)H(\\phi(x))$, which in this case is equal to $-N_{1}(x)$, effectively corrupting the balanced structure of the standard basis functions that guarantees the partition of unity.\n\nFurthermore, a more severe pathology arises from the fact that the enrichment function $H(\\phi(x))=-1$ is constant over the element. This makes the local basis $\\{N_{0}(x), N_{1}(x), N_{1}(x)H(\\phi(x))\\}$ linearly dependent, since $N_{1}(x)H(\\phi(x)) = -N_{1}(x)$. The third basis function is a scalar multiple of the second. This would result in a singular element stiffness matrix, making it impossible to solve the global system of equations. This demonstrates a complete failure of the naive enrichment strategy in blending elements. To correct this, shifted enrichment functions are used in practice, such as $N_{i}(x)(H(\\phi(x))-H(\\phi(x_i)))$, which restore the partition of unity and linear independence.",
