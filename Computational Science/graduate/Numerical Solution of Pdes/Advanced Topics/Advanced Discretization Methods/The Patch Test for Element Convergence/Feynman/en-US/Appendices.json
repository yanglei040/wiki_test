The material is homogeneous and isotropic with Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, so that the constitutive law is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbb{C}$ is the fourth-order elasticity tensor for plane strain.

            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a patch test for a finite element formulation of two-dimensional linear elasticity. The validity of the problem is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard, non-trivial problem in computational mechanics designed to verify the convergence properties of a finite element. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe weak form of the equilibrium equation in the absence of body forces is given by the principle of virtual work. For any kinematically admissible virtual displacement field $\\mathbf{w}$ that vanishes on the portion of the boundary with prescribed essential boundary conditions, the following must hold:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nIn the Galerkin finite element method, we seek an approximate displacement field $\\mathbf{u}^h$ from a finite-dimensional space such that the residual vanishes for all test functions $\\mathbf{w}^h$ from the same space. The residual vector $\\mathbf{R}$ is the vector of nodal forces that are not balanced. For a set of discrete degrees of freedom, the component of the residual corresponding to a degree of freedom $i$, let's say $R_i$, is found by setting the test function to be the basis function $\\mathbf{w}_i$ for that degree of freedom:\n$$\nR_i = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{u}^h) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}_i) \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nThe problem requires us to show that for the free, interior node $(0)$, the assembled residual vector is zero.\n\nFirst, we determine the nodal displacement degrees of freedom for the five nodes. The problem specifies an exact displacement field that is linear in coordinates $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} u(x,y) \\\\ v(x,y) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a+bx+cy \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are arbitrary real constants. The finite element formulation uses piecewise linear shape functions on three-node triangles. A fundamental property of this basis is that it can exactly represent any function that is a linear polynomial in $x$ and $y$. To achieve this exact representation, the nodal degrees of freedom $\\mathbf{d}_i$ at each node $i$ must be set to the value of the exact field at the coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ of that node.\nThe nodal coordinates are given as:\nNode $(0): (x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$\nNode $(1): (x_1,y_1)=(1,0)$\nNode $(2): (x_2,y_2)=(0,1)$\nNode $(3): (x_3,y_3)=(-1,0)$\nNode $(4): (x_4,y_4)=(0,-1)$\n\nEvaluating the exact displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$ at each of these nodal coordinates yields the nodal displacement vectors $\\mathbf{d}_i = (u_i, v_i)^T$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_0 = \\mathbf{u}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_1 = \\mathbf{u}(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} a+b \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_2 = \\mathbf{u}(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} a+c \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_3 = \\mathbf{u}(-1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} a-b \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_4 = \\mathbf{u}(0,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} a-c \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWith these nodal displacements, the interpolated field $\\mathbf{u}^h(x,y)$ is identical to the exact field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$ everywhere on the patch.\n\nNext, we analyze the resulting strain and stress fields and the consequence for the numerical integration. The small strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the symmetric part of the displacement gradient. For the exact field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} b & c \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe strain tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} b & c \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} b & 0 \\\\ c & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} b & \\frac{c}{2} \\\\ \\frac{c}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis strain tensor is constant throughout the entire patch. Since the material is homogeneous and isotropic, the fourth-order elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ is a constant. The resulting stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, is therefore also constant throughout the patch. Let us denote this constant stress tensor by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$.\n\nWithin any triangular element $e$, the finite element strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^h_e$ is computed from the nodal displacements $\\mathbf{d}^e$ via the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B}^e$ as $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^h_e = \\mathbf{B}^e \\mathbf{d}^e$. For a linear three-node triangle, the shape functions are linear, their derivatives are constant, and thus the matrix $\\mathbf{B}^e$ is constant within the element. As the interpolated displacement field $\\mathbf{u}^h$ is identical to $\\mathbf{u}$, the computed strain field $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^h$ must be identical to $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. Hence, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^h_e$ is a constant tensor, equal to $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, for every element $e$. The finite element stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h_e = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^h_e$ is therefore also constant within each element and equal to the constant stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$ across the patch.\n\nThe problem states that all element integrals are evaluated using one-point (centroid) quadrature. The integral for the element internal force vector is $\\mathbf{f}_{int}^e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} (\\mathbf{B}^e)^T \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h_e \\, d\\Omega$. The integrand is $(\\mathbf{B}^e)^T \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h_e$. Since both $\\mathbf{B}^e$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h_e$ are constant over the element domain $\\Omega_e$, their product is a constant vector. A one-point quadrature rule, which evaluates the integrand at the centroid and multiplies by the area, is exact for any integrand that is a constant. Therefore, the use of one-point quadrature to compute the element internal force vector is exact in this case.\n\nFinally, we must show that the assembled residual at the interior node $(0)$ vanishes. The residual at node $(0)$ is the sum of the forces contributed to this node by the four elements that share it: $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$. More formally, the residual vector $\\mathbf{R}_{(0)}$ has components given by the weak form, where the test function $\\mathbf{w}$ is chosen as the vector-valued basis function associated with the degrees of freedom at node $(0)$. Let $N_0(x,y)$ be the global, piecewise linear \"hat\" function which is unity at node $(0)$ and zero at all other nodes. The test functions for the $x$ and $y$ degrees of freedom at node $(0)$ are $\\mathbf{w}_x = N_0(x,y) \\mathbf{e}_x$ and $\\mathbf{w}_y = N_0(x,y) \\mathbf{e}_y$, where $\\mathbf{e}_x=(1,0)^T$ and $\\mathbf{e}_y=(0,1)^T$. By definition, $N_0(x,y)$ is zero on the boundary of the patch, $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nThe $x$-component of the residual at node $(0)$ is:\n$$\nR_{(0),x} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}_x) \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nAs established, the stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^h$ is a constant tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$ over the entire domain $\\Omega$.\n$$\nR_{(0),x} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}_x) \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\boldsymbol{A} : \\nabla\\boldsymbol{B} = \\nabla\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{A}^T\\boldsymbol{B}) - (\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{A})\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B}$ and the symmetry of the stress tensor ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0^T = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$), we can write $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}_x) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 : \\nabla\\mathbf{w}_x = \\nabla\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0\\mathbf{w}_x) - (\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0)\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_x$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$ is constant, its divergence is zero: $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The expression for the residual component simplifies to:\n$$\nR_{(0),x} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 \\mathbf{w}_x) \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nApplying the divergence theorem, we convert the volume integral to a surface integral over the boundary of the patch $\\partial\\Omega$:\n$$\nR_{(0),x} = \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 \\mathbf{w}_x) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} \\mathbf{w}_x \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 \\mathbf{n}) \\, dS\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the boundary. The test function $\\mathbf{w}_x$ is chosen to be the basis function for an interior node, which is, by definition, zero on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ of the patch. Since $\\mathbf{w}_x = \\mathbf{0}$ for all points on $\\partial\\Omega$, the integrand is zero everywhere on the boundary. Therefore, the integral is zero:\n$$\nR_{(0),x} = 0\n$$\nAn identical argument holds for the $y$-component of the residual, $R_{(0),y}$, by using the test function $\\mathbf{w}_y$.\n$$\nR_{(0),y} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{w}_y) \\, d\\Omega = \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} \\mathbf{w}_y \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 \\mathbf{n}) \\, dS = 0\n$$\nThus, both components of the residual vector at the interior node $(0)$ are zero. This demonstrates that the finite element formulation is in equilibrium at the interior node, thereby passing the patch test. The assembled residual vector at node $(0)$ is the zero vector.",

Derivation of $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ and its rank**\n\nWe evaluate the strain-displacement matrix at the center of the parent element, $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,0)$. This requires the derivatives of the shape functions at this point.\n$N_1 = \\tfrac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial \\xi}|_{(0,0)}=-\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial \\eta}|_{(0,0)}=-\\tfrac{1}{4}$\n$N_2 = \\tfrac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial \\xi}|_{(0,0)}=\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial \\eta}|_{(0,0)}=-\\tfrac{1}{4}$\n$N_3 = \\tfrac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta) \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial \\xi}|_{(0,0)}=\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial \\eta}|_{(0,0)}=\\tfrac{1}{4}$\n$N_4 = \\tfrac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1+\\eta) \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_4}{\\partial \\xi}|_{(0,0)}=-\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\partial N_4}{\\partial \\eta}|_{(0,0)}=\\tfrac{1}{4}$\n\nLet $\\mathbf{J}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} J^{-1}_{11} & J^{-1}_{12} \\\\ J^{-1}_{21} & J^{-1}_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The derivatives of $N_i$ with respect to $x, y$ at $(0,0)$ are, for example, for node $1$:\n$\\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial x}|_{(0,0)} = J^{-1}_{11}(-\\tfrac{1}{4}) + J^{-1}_{12}(-\\tfrac{1}{4}) = -\\tfrac{1}{4}(J^{-1}_{11} + J^{-1}_{12})$\n$\\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial y}|_{(0,0)} = J^{-1}_{21}(-\\tfrac{1}{4}) + J^{-1}_{22}(-\\tfrac{1}{4}) = -\\tfrac{1}{4}(J^{-1}_{21} + J^{-1}_{22})$\nThe full matrix $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is then constructed by assembling the $\\mathbf{B}_i(0,0)$ blocks for $i=1, \\dots, 4$. For $\\mathbf{B}_1(0,0)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_1(0,0) = -\\frac{1}{4}\\begin{pmatrix} J^{-1}_{11} + J^{-1}_{12} & 0 \\\\ 0 & J^{-1}_{21} + J^{-1}_{22} \\\\ J^{-1}_{21} + J^{-1}_{22} & J^{-1}_{11} + J^{-1}_{12} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe other $\\mathbf{B}_i$ blocks are formed analogously using their respective gradients.\n\nTo determine the rank of the $3 \\times 8$ matrix $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$, we assess its ability to map nodal displacement vectors $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^8$ to strain vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The rank is the dimension of the image of this linear map. An affine displacement field, $u(x,y) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y$ and $v(x,y) = d_0 + d_1 x + d_2 y$, corresponds to a state of constant strain: $\\varepsilon_{xx} = c_1$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = d_2$, $\\gamma_{xy} = c_2 + d_1$. Since a $Q_1$ element can exactly reproduce any affine field (as will be shown in Part 2), it is possible to choose nodal displacements $\\mathbf{d}$ that correspond to any arbitrary constant strain state. The formulation with one-point integration at $(0,0)$ will then calculate this strain state exactly. This means for any target strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists a nodal displacement vector $\\mathbf{d}$ such that $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)\\mathbf{d} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^*$. The mapping is surjective, and thus the dimension of the image is $3$. The rank of $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is $3$.\n\n**2. The Constant Strain Patch Test**\n\nThe patch test verifies that an element formulation can exactly reproduce a state of constant strain. For this, we consider an arbitrary affine displacement field, which produces constant strains:\n$u(x,y) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y$\n$v(x,y) = d_0 + d_1 x + d_2 y$\nThe corresponding strains are $\\varepsilon_{xx} = c_1$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = d_2$, and $\\gamma_{xy} = c_2 + d_1$.\n\nThe nodal displacements for the element are set to the values of this field at the nodes: $u_i = u(x_i,y_i)$ and $v_i = v(x_i,y_i)$.\nThe interpolated displacement field within the element is $u_h(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi,\\eta) u_i$.\nCrucially, the problem states an affine mapping from parent to physical space: $x(\\xi,\\eta) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1\\xi + \\alpha_2\\eta$ and $y(\\xi,\\eta) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\xi + \\beta_2\\eta$. Substituting this into the affine displacement field gives:\n$u(x(\\xi,\\eta), y(\\xi,\\eta)) = c_0 + c_1(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1\\xi + \\alpha_2\\eta) + c_2(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\xi + \\beta_2\\eta)$.\nThis expression is a linear polynomial in $\\xi$ and $\\eta$. The space of functions spanned by the bilinear shape functions $\\{N_i\\}_{i=1}^4$ is $\\{1, \\xi, \\eta, \\xi\\eta\\}$, which contains all linear polynomials. A fundamental property of Lagrange interpolation is that if the function being interpolated lies within the span of the basis functions, the interpolation is exact. Therefore, the interpolated displacement field is identical to the exact displacement field:\n$u_h(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi,\\eta) u_i = u(x(\\xi,\\eta), y(\\xi,\\eta))$.\nThe same holds for $v_h(\\xi,\\eta) = v(x(\\xi,\\eta), y(\\xi,\\eta))$.\n\nThe strains are calculated from this interpolated field. Since $u_h$ and $v_h$ are identical to the original affine fields, their derivatives will be a fortiori identical:\n$\\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = c_1$\n$\\frac{\\partial v_h}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = d_2$\n$\\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v_h}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = c_2+d_1$\nThe calculated strain field is constant throughout the element and is identical to the exact target strain. The one-point integration scheme evaluates the strain at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,0)$. Since the strain is constant, the value at this single point is the exact, constant strain. Thus, the element formulation passes the constant strain patch test.\n\n**3. Number of Hourglass Modes**\n\nZero-energy modes are non-zero nodal displacement vectors $\\mathbf{d}$ that result in zero strain energy. For a single element, the strain energy is proportional to $\\mathbf{d}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K}_e\\mathbf{d}$. The element stiffness matrix is given as $\\mathbf{K}_e = w\\,\\det(\\mathbf{J})\\,\\mathbf{B}(0,0)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{D}\\,\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$. Since $w>0$, $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) \\neq 0$, and the material matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ is positive definite, the condition $\\mathbf{d}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K}_e\\mathbf{d}=0$ is equivalent to $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nThis means the zero-energy modes are the vectors in the null space of the matrix $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$.\n\nThe Rank-Nullity Theorem states that for a linear map represented by a matrix $\\mathbf{A}: V \\to W$, $\\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\mathbf{A})) + \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{dim}(V)$.\nIn our case, the matrix is $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$, which maps from the space of nodal displacements $\\mathbb{R}^8$ to the space of strains $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- The dimension of the domain (space of nodal displacements) is $8$ ($4$ nodes $\\times$ $2$ DOFs/node).\n- From Part 1, the rank of $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is $3$.\n\nApplying the theorem:\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0))) + \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0)) = 8$\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0))) + 3 = 8$\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0))) = 5$\n\nThere are $5$ linearly independent zero-energy modes. These modes are composed of rigid-body motions and spurious, non-physical modes called hourglass modes.\n- **Rigid-body motions**: These are displacement patterns that physically result in zero strain. For a $2$D body, there are $3$ such modes:\n  1. Translation in the $x$-direction.\n  2. Translation in the $y$-direction.\n  3. Infinitesimal rotation in the $xy$-plane.\n- **Hourglass modes**: These are the remaining zero-energy modes that are not rigid-body motions. They correspond to deformations that, by coincidence of the numerical integration scheme, produce zero strain at the Gauss point(s), but would have non-zero strain elsewhere.\nThe number of hourglass modes is the total number of zero-energy modes minus the number of rigid-body modes.\n\nNumber of hourglass modes = $\\text{dim}(\\ker(\\mathbf{B}(0,0))) - (\\text{Number of rigid-body modes})$\nNumber of hourglass modes = $5 - 3 = 2$.\n\nThese two modes correspond to \"bow-tie\" or \"barrel\"-like deformations of the element in the $u$ and $v$ directions, respectively. For instance, a nodal displacement pattern of $u_i$ proportional to $\\{1, -1, 1, -1\\}$ and $v_i=0$ interpolates to a field $u(\\xi, \\eta) \\propto \\xi\\eta$, whose gradients are zero at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,0)$, thus producing zero strain at the integration point.",

This recovers the nearly incompressible limit in which the bulk modulus diverges while the shear modulus remains bounded away from zero.\n\nNext, we examine the $P_{1}$ patch test for the $Q_{1}$ bilinear quadrilateral element (four-node, tensor-product of linear polynomials). Let $u(x) = a + B x$ be a linear displacement field on $\\Omega$, where $a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times 2}$ are constants, and $x=(x_{1},x_{2})^{\\top}$. The $Q_{1}$ displacement space on a shape-regular mesh contains all polynomials of total degree at most one (i.e., the vector space spanned by $\\{1,x_{1},x_{2}\\}$ componentwise), because the bilinear basis functions reproduce linear polynomials exactly and there is no loss of generality on parallelogram elements. Specifically, for any affine function $f(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x_{1} + \\gamma x_{2}$, the nodal interpolation into the $Q_{1}$ space is exact, and thus the finite element interpolation $u_{h}$ satisfies $u_{h} \\equiv u$ at the nodes and throughout each element. The small-strain tensor $\\varepsilon(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^{\\top}\\right)$ computed from an affine $u$ is exactly constant, and with exact integration of polynomials up to degree $2$ on each element (for example, $2\\times 2$ Gauss quadrature on rectangles), the element stiffness reproduces the exact constant stress state. Therefore, by the definition of the patch test as exact reproduction of a constant strain state, the $Q_{1}$ element passes the $P_{1}$ patch test.\n\nWe now address volumetric locking through a mixed formulation diagnostic. Introduce the hydrostatic pressure $p$ and the mixed weak form in Herrmann form:\n$$\n\\text{Find } (u,p) \\in V\\times Q \\text{ such that }\n\\begin{cases}\na(u,v) + b(v,p) = \\ell(v) & \\forall v\\in V \\,, \\\\[4pt]\nb(u,q) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\,(p,q) = 0 & \\forall q\\in Q \\,,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $a(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\epsilon)\\,\\varepsilon'(u):\\varepsilon'(v)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$, $b(v,p) = \\int_{\\Omega} p\\,\\nabla\\cdot v\\,\\mathrm{d}x$, and $(p,q) = \\int_{\\Omega} p\\,q\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The discrete spaces are $V_{h}$ for displacements and $Q_{h}$ for pressures, both taken as continuous $Q_{1}$ functions on the same uniform quadrilateral mesh.\n\nA fundamental diagnostic for stability (and thus absence of locking) is the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) inf–sup constant:\n$$\n\\beta_{h} \\;=\\; \\inf_{p_{h}\\in Q_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}}\\,\\sup_{v_{h}\\in V_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} p_{h}\\,\\nabla\\cdot v_{h}\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{\\|p_{h}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\\,\\|v_{h}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}} \\,.\n$$\nIf $\\beta_{h}$ vanishes, the discrete problem fails the inf–sup condition, leading to pressure checkerboard modes and volumetric locking as $\\lambda(\\epsilon)\\to+\\infty$.\n\nWe construct a nontrivial $p_{h}\\in Q_{h}$ such that $b(v_{h},p_{h})=0$ for all $v_{h}\\in V_{h}$.
