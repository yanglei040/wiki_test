            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, incompressible flow advanced by a fractional-step (projection) method in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

            "solution": "The problem requires a multistep derivation and calculation within the context of computational fluid dynamics, specifically concerning the projection method for incompressible flows. We will proceed by first deriving the continuous Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE), then discretizing it and formulating the Jacobi iterative scheme, followed by a numerical calculation for one iteration step, and finally a discussion on the method's convergence.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE)**\n\nThe projection method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations advances the solution in time by splitting the momentum equation update into two steps. The governing equations for an incompressible fluid with constant density $\\rho$ are the continuity equation and the momentum equation.\n\nThe core of the projection method lies in the second step, the correction or projection step. After an intermediate velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$, is computed (typically by solving the momentum equation without the pressure gradient term), a pressure field $p^{n+1}$ is found such that the corrected velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$, is divergence-free.\n\nThe relationship between the corrected velocity $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$, the intermediate velocity $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$, and the pressure at the new time step, $p^{n+1}$, is given by the projection step equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p^{n+1} $$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the time step. This equation can be rearranged to express the corrected velocity explicitly:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p^{n+1} $$\nThe fundamental constraint for an incompressible flow is that the velocity field must be divergence-free (solenoidal) at all times. We enforce this condition on the corrected velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0 $$\nTo derive the equation for the pressure $p^{n+1}$, we take the divergence of the velocity correction equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p^{n+1} \\right) $$\nApplying the incompressibility constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$ to the left side and using the linearity of the divergence operator on the right side, we get:\n$$ 0 = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p^{n+1} \\right) $$\nAssuming the density $\\rho$ and time step $\\Delta t$ are constants, they can be moved outside the divergence operator:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p^{n+1}) = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} $$\nThe operator $\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla$ is the Laplacian operator, denoted by $\\nabla^2$ or $\\Delta$. Thus, we arrive at the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE):\n$$ \\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} $$\nThis elliptic partial differential equation determines the pressure field required to project the intermediate velocity field onto a divergence-free space.\n\n**2. Discretization and Jacobi Iteration**\n\nWe discretize the PPE on a uniform two-dimensional Cartesian grid with spacing $h$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions. Let $p_{i,j}$ denote the pressure at the center of cell $(i,j)$.\n\nThe Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 p$ at $(i,j)$ is approximated using a standard second-order, five-point finite difference stencil:\n$$ (\\nabla^2 p)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i-1,j}}{h^2} + \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i,j-1}}{h^2} $$\nThe source term on the right-hand side, which we denote as $q$, is discretized at the cell center $(i,j)$. The problem specifies a staggered grid arrangement where velocities are stored at cell faces. The divergence of the intermediate velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} = (u^{\\ast}, v^{\\ast})$ is approximated by a central difference:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast})_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{u^{\\ast}_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} - u^{\\ast}_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}}{h} + \\frac{v^{\\ast}_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} - v^{\\ast}_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}}{h} $$\nThe discretized source term is then:\n$$ q_{i,j} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t}\\right) \\left( \\frac{u^{\\ast}_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} - u^{\\ast}_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}}{h} + \\frac{v^{\\ast}_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} - v^{\\ast}_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}}{h} \\right) $$\nCombining these, the fully discretized PPE is:\n$$ \\frac{p_{i+1,j} + p_{i-1,j} + p_{i,j+1} + p_{i,j-1} - 4p_{i,j}}{h^2} = q_{i,j} $$\nTo derive the Jacobi fixed-point iteration, we solve this equation for the center pressure $p_{i,j}$. Let the iteration counter be $m$. The Jacobi method updates the value at $(i,j)$ using only the values from the previous iteration, $m$, for all neighboring points.\n$$ -4p_{i,j} = h^2 q_{i,j} - (p_{i+1,j} + p_{i-1,j} + p_{i,j+1} + p_{i,j-1}) $$\n$$ p_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} (p_{i+1,j} + p_{i-1,j} + p_{i,j+1} + p_{i,j-1} - h^2 q_{i,j}) $$\nThe Jacobi update rule is therefore:\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( p^{(m)}_{i+1,j} + p^{(m)}_{i-1,j} + p^{(m)}_{i,j+1} + p^{(m)}_{i,j-1} - h^2 q_{i,j} \\right) $$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation of One Jacobi Iteration**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Grid spacing: $h = 0.01 \\,\\text{m}$.\n- Density: $\\rho = 1000 \\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$.\n- Time step: $\\Delta t = 0.1 \\,\\text{s}$.\n- Intermediate velocities:\n  - $u^{\\ast}_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = 0.20 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $u^{\\ast}_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j} = 0.10 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n  - $v^{\\ast}_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} = -0.05 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $v^{\\ast}_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}} = -0.10 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Previous-iterate pressures (at iteration $m$):\n  - $p^{(m)}_{i+1,j} = 100000$ Pa, $p^{(m)}_{i-1,j} = 100010$ Pa, $p^{(m)}_{i,j+1} = 100000$ Pa, $p^{(m)}_{i,j-1} = 100005$ Pa.\n\nFirst, we compute the discrete divergence of $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$ at cell $(i,j)$:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast})_{i,j} = \\frac{0.20 - 0.10}{0.01} + \\frac{-0.05 - (-0.10)}{0.01} = \\frac{0.10}{0.01} + \\frac{0.05}{0.01} = 10 + 5 = 15 \\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we compute the source term $q_{i,j}$:\n$$ q_{i,j} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast})_{i,j} = \\frac{1000}{0.1} \\times 15 = 10000 \\times 15 = 150000 \\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} $$\nNow, we compute the term $h^2 q_{i,j}$ that appears in the Jacobi formula:\n$$ h^2 q_{i,j} = (0.01)^2 \\times 150000 = 0.0001 \\times 150000 = 15 \\,\\text{Pa} $$\nFinally, we perform one Jacobi iteration to find $p^{(m+1)}_{i,j}$:\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( p^{(m)}_{i+1,j} + p^{(m)}_{i-1,j} + p^{(m)}_{i,j+1} + p^{(m)}_{i,j-1} - h^2 q_{i,j} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the given pressure values and the calculated term:\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} (100000 + 100010 + 100000 + 100005 - 15) $$\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} (400015 - 15) $$\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} (400000) $$\n$$ p^{(m+1)}_{i,j} = 100000 \\,\\text{Pa} $$\n\n**4. Convergence Rate of the Jacobi Method**\n\nThe convergence of the Jacobi method for the linear system $A\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{b}$ is governed by the spectral radius, $\\rho(T_J)$, of the Jacobi iteration matrix $T_J$. For the 2D Poisson equation discretized with the five-point stencil on a rectangular grid with $N_x \\times N_y$ interior points and Dirichlet boundary conditions, the spectral radius of the Jacobi matrix is given by:\n$$ \\rho(T_J) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N_x+1}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N_y+1}\\right) \\right] $$\nFor a large number of grid points, i.e., $N_x \\gg 1$ and $N_y \\gg 1$, the arguments of the cosine functions are small. We can use the Taylor series expansion $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/2$ for small $x$.\n$$ \\rho(T_J) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N_x+1}\\right)^2\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N_y+1}\\right)^2\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\rho(T_J) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{(N_x+1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(N_y+1)^2} \\right) $$\nSince the grid spacing $h$ is inversely proportional to $N_x$ and $N_y$ (e.g., $h_x = L_x/(N_x+1)$ for a domain of length $L_x$), we have $\\rho(T_J) \\approx 1 - O(h^2)$.\n\nThis result has a critical implication for the performance of the Jacobi method. As the grid is refined (i.e., $N_x, N_y \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $h \\rightarrow 0$), the spectral radius $\\rho(T_J)$ approaches $1$. The convergence rate, which depends on how much smaller than $1$ the spectral radius is, becomes extremely low. The number of iterations required to reduce the error by a fixed factor is proportional to $(1 - \\rho(T_J))^{-1}$, which is $O(N_x^2 + N_y^2)$ or $O(h^{-2})$. This indicates that the computational effort for the Jacobi solver increases quadratically with the grid resolution in each direction, making it prohibitively slow for fine grids and large-scale problems. This poor scaling necessitates the use of more advanced and efficient solvers like the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method, conjugate gradient methods, or, most effectively, multigrid methods.",

For Dirichlet boundaries, use constant $p_D$; for Neumann boundaries, use constant $g$.\n\n1. Happy path (mixed boundary conditions):\n    - $N_x = 10$, $N_y = 8$, $L_x = 1.0$, $L_y = 1.0$,\n    - $f = 0.0$,\n    - West: Dirichlet $p_D = 0.0$; East: Dirichlet $p_D = 1.0$; South: Neumann $g = 0.0$; North: Neumann $g = 0.0$.\n\n2. Pure Neumann, globally consistent:\n    - $N_x = 12$, $N_y = 12$, $L_x = 1.0$, $L_y = 2.0$,\n    - $f = 3.0$ (constant),\n    - West: Neumann $g = 0.0$; East: Neumann $g = 0.0$; South: Neumann $g = 2.0$; North: Neumann $g = 4.0$.\n    - The discrete global balance condition should hold: $\\sum f \\Delta x \\Delta y \\approx \\sum g\\, A_{\\text{face}}$.\n\n3. Pure Neumann, globally inconsistent:\n    - $N_x = 16$, $N_y = 16$, $L_x = 1.0$, $L_y = 1.0$,\n    - $f = 1.0$ (constant),\n    - West: Neumann $g = 0.0$; East: Neumann $g = 0.0$; South: Neumann $g = 0.0$; North: Neumann $g = 0.0$.\n    - The discrete global balance condition should fail: $\\sum f \\Delta x \\Delta y \\not\\approx \\sum g\\, A_{\\text{face}}$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, produce a three-element list $[b, m, r]$ where $b$ is a boolean indicating solvability (for pure Neumann cases, true if the global balance holds within tolerance; for mixed boundary cases, always true), $m$ is a float equal to the absolute mismatch $|\\sum f \\Delta x \\Delta y - \\sum g A_{\\text{face}}|$, and $r$ is a float equal to the discrete $\\ell_2$ norm of the residual of the original PPE equations per cell (for pure Neumann cases, exclude the gauged row when computing the residual norm). Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the format $[[b_1,m_1,r_1],[b_2,m_2,r_2],[b_3,m_3,r_3]]$.\n\nNumerical tolerances:\n- Use a balance tolerance of $10^{-10}$ when determining the boolean $b$ for solvability in pure Neumann cases.",
            "solution": "### Derivation of the Finite Volume Discretization\n\nThe governing equation is the Poisson equation for pressure $p(\\mathbf{x})$ on a two-dimensional domain $\\Omega = [0,L_x] \\times [0,L_y]$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p = f $$\nwhere $f$ is a given source term. Using the identity $\\nabla^2 p = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p)$, we can write the equation in conservation form. The finite volume method starts by integrating this equation over a control volume (or cell) $V_{i,j}$ centered at $(x_i, y_j)$:\n$$ \\int_{V_{i,j}} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p) \\,dV = \\int_{V_{i,j}} f \\,dV $$\nApplying the divergence theorem to the left-hand side converts the volume integral into a surface integral over the boundary of the control volume, $\\partial V_{i,j}$:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial V_{i,j}} (\\nabla p) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\,dS = \\int_{V_{i,j}} f \\,dV $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the surface $\\partial V_{i,j}$.\n\nThe grid is uniform and cell-centered, with $N_x \\times N_y$ cells. The cell dimensions are $\\Delta x = L_x/N_x$ and $\\Delta y = L_y/N_y$, so the volume (area in 2D) of cell $V_{i,j}$ is $\\Delta V = \\Delta x \\Delta y$. The pressure $p_{i,j}$ represents the value at the cell center. The surface integral is the sum of fluxes across the four faces of the rectangular cell (east, west, north, south):\n$$ F_e + F_w + F_n + F_s = f_{i,j} \\Delta x \\Delta y $$\nwhere $F_k$ is the total flux out of face $k$. For an interior face, e.g., the east face between cell $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$, the flux is approximated using a second-order central difference for the gradient:\n$$ F_e = \\int_{\\text{east face}} (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_x) \\,dS \\approx \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\Delta y $$\nSimilarly, the fluxes for the other faces of an interior cell are:\n$$ F_w = \\int_{\\text{west face}} (\\nabla p \\cdot (-\\mathbf{e}_x)) \\,dS \\approx -\\left(\\frac{p_{i,j} - p_{i-1,j}}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\Delta y $$\n$$ F_n = \\int_{\\text{north face}} (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_y) \\,dS \\approx \\left(\\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta y}\\right) \\Delta x $$\n$$ F_s = \\int_{\\text{south face}} (\\nabla p \\cdot (-\\mathbf{e}_y)) \\,dS \\approx -\\left(\\frac{p_{i,j} - p_{i,j-1}}{\\Delta y}\\right) \\Delta x $$\nSubstituting these into the balance equation yields the standard five-point stencil for the Laplacian:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}(p_{i+1,j} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i-1,j}) + \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}(p_{i,j+1} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i,j-1}) = f_{i,j} \\Delta x \\Delta y $$\nThis equation forms one row in a linear system $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of unknown cell-centered pressures. For an interior cell $(i,j)$ with 1D index $k = j \\cdot N_x + i$:\n- Diagonal coefficient: $A_{k,k} = -2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}\\right)$\n- Off-diagonal coefficients: $A_{k, k\\pm 1} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ (for east/west neighbors), $A_{k, k\\pm N_x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$ (for north/south neighbors).\n- Right-hand side: $b_k = f_{i,j} \\Delta x \\Delta y$.\n\n#### Boundary Conditions\n\nFor cells adjacent to the domain boundary, one or more flux terms must be modified.\n\n**1. Neumann Boundary Condition**:\nThe normal derivative is prescribed, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial n} = g$. The flux across the boundary face is directly specified. For example, on the east boundary ($x=L_x$), the outward normal is $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{e}_x$, so $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}=g_e$. The flux out of the east face of cell $(N_x-1, j)$ is:\n$$ F_e = \\int_{\\text{east face}} (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_x) \\,dS = \\int g_e \\,dS = g_e \\Delta y $$\nThis is a known value. The flux balance becomes $F_w + F_n + F_s + g_e \\Delta y = f_{N_x-1,j} \\Delta x \\Delta y$. The known flux term moves to the right-hand side, so $b_k$ is modified: $b_k \\rightarrow b_k - g_e \\Delta y$. Similar modifications apply to other Neumann boundaries, with careful attention to the outward normal's direction.\n\n**2. Dirichlet Boundary Condition**:\nThe pressure is prescribed, $p=p_D$. The flux is approximated using a one-sided difference between the cell center and the boundary. For the east face of cell $(N_x-1, j)$, the face is at $x=L_x$ and the cell center is at $x=L_x-\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$. The gradient is $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{p_D - p_{N_x-1,j}}{\\Delta x/2}$. The flux is:\n$$ F_e = \\left(\\frac{p_D - p_{N_x-1,j}}{\\Delta x/2}\\right) \\Delta y = 2\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}(p_D - p_{N_x-1,j}) $$\nThis expression contains the unknown $p_{N_x-1,j}$ and the known $p_D$. The term involving the unknown modifies the diagonal element of matrix $A$: $A_{k,k} \\rightarrow A_{k,k} - 2\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. The term involving the known value modifies the right-hand side vector: $b_k \\rightarrow b_k - 2\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}p_D$.\n\n### Solvability and Gauge Fixing\n\nFor a pure Neumann problem, the matrix $A$ is singular, having a nullspace corresponding to a constant pressure field (i.e., $A\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$ if $\\mathbf{c}$ is a vector of constants). A solution exists only if the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to the nullspace of $A^T$. This leads to the compatibility condition, which in its continuous form is:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} f \\,dV = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial n} \\,dS $$\nIn discrete form, this is checked by comparing the sum of all source terms with the sum of all prescribed boundary fluxes:\n$$ \\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} \\Delta x \\Delta y = \\sum_{\\text{bnd faces}} g_k A_k $$\nIf this condition holds, a unique solution can be obtained by \"gauge fixing\" — constraining one pressure value. We set $p_{0,0}=0$ by modifying the first row of the linear system to be $1 \\cdot p_{0,0} = 0$.\n\n### Residual Calculation\n\nAfter solving the (possibly modified) system $A'\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}'$ to find $\\mathbf{p}$, the quality of the solution is assessed by computing the residual of the *original* equations, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{vec}} = A\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{b}$. The discrete $\\ell_2$ norm per cell is then calculated as the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of the residual vector components. For pure Neumann problems, the equation corresponding to the gauged cell is excluded from this calculation as it was artificially altered.\n$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_{\\text{eq}}} \\sum_{k \\in \\text{non-gauged}} ( (A\\mathbf{p})_k - b_k )^2} $$\nwhere $N_{\\text{eq}}$ is the number of equations in the sum ($N_x N_y$ for mixed-BC cases, $N_x N_y - 1$ for pure Neumann cases).",
