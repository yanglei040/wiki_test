            "problem": "Consider the unit-square domain in the plane with vertices $\\left(0,0\\right)$, $\\left(1,0\\right)$, $\\left(1,1\\right)$, $\\left(0,1\\right)$ listed in counterclockwise order. An advancing front method (AFM) for mesh generation is to be initiated from the boundary to generate a triangular mesh suitable for the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). The prescribed uniform target mesh-size is $h=0.4$. In a uniform size field, the boundary is first discretized so that each active front edge has length less than or equal to the target size. Then, interior candidates are generated by perpendicular placement above active front edges to form approximately equilateral triangles.\n\nProceed as follows:\n- Discretize the bottom boundary edge $\\left[\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(1,0\\right)\\right]$ into $N$ equal segments, where $N$ is the smallest positive integer for which each segment length is less than or equal to $h$.\n- Select the central segment of this discretization as the initial active front edge, and construct the first interior candidate point by placing it orthogonally to this edge at its midpoint, with the distance chosen so that the two new edges joining the candidate to the segment’s endpoints each have length exactly $h$. The orientation of the placement must be chosen to lie inside the domain.\n\nUsing only these principles, compute the Cartesian coordinates of this first interior candidate point. Justify the orientation choice from first principles of oriented boundaries and inward normals. Round your final coordinate values to four significant figures, and report them as an ordered pair $(x,y)$ without units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the field of computational geometry and numerical methods, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information to determine a unique solution, and objective in its language and formulation.\n\nThe problem asks for the Cartesian coordinates of the first interior candidate point generated by an Advancing Front Method (AFM) in a unit-square domain. The process is initiated from the bottom boundary.\n\nStep 1: Discretize the bottom boundary.\nThe bottom boundary of the unit square is the line segment from $P_1(0,0)$ to $P_2(1,0)$. The length of this segment is $L=1$. It is to be discretized into $N$ equal segments, where $N$ is the smallest positive integer such that the length of each segment, $s = L/N$, is less than or equal to the prescribed mesh-size $h=0.4$.\nWe must satisfy the inequality:\n$$s \\le h$$\n$$\\frac{1}{N} \\le 0.4$$\nSolving for $N$, we find:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5$$\nSince $N$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $N$ that satisfies this condition is $N=3$.\nThe length of each segment is $s = 1/3$. The boundary is discretized by the points $(0,0)$, $(1/3,0)$, $(2/3,0)$, and $(1,0)$. This creates three segments.\n\nStep 2: Identify the initial active front edge.\nThe problem specifies selecting the central segment of this discretization as the initial active front edge. With $N=3$ segments, the central segment is the second one. Its endpoints are $A = (1/3, 0)$ and $B = (2/3, 0)$. The length of this edge is $s = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the placement and orientation of the candidate point.\nThe candidate point, let's call it $P_c(x_c, y_c)$, is to be constructed by placing it orthogonally to the active front edge $AB$ at its midpoint, $M$.\nThe midpoint $M$ of the segment $AB$ is:\n$$M = \\left( \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, \\frac{y_A + y_B}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1/3 + 2/3}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, 0 \\right)$$\nThe active front edge $AB$ lies on the x-axis. A vector tangent to this edge is $\\vec{T} = (1, 0)$. An orthogonal direction is therefore parallel to the y-axis, represented by the unit vectors $(0,1)$ or $(0,-1)$.\n\nThe orientation must be chosen so the point lies inside the domain. This is justified by considering the oriented boundary of the domain. The vertices are given in counterclockwise order: $(0,0) \\to (1,0) \\to (1,1) \\to (0,1)$. This defines a positive orientation for the boundary. For a positively oriented boundary in a 2D plane, the inward-pointing normal vector $\\vec{n}$ is obtained by rotating the tangent vector $\\vec{T}$ by an angle of $+\\pi/2$ radians (90 degrees counterclockwise).\nThe bottom edge is traversed from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, so the tangent vector is in the direction of the positive x-axis, $\\vec{T}=(1,0)$. The rotation of a vector $(T_x, T_y)$ by $+\\pi/2$ is given by $(-T_y, T_x)$.\nApplying this transformation to $\\vec{T}=(1,0)$ gives the inward normal vector:\n$$\\vec{n} = (-0, 1) = (0,1)$$\nThis vector points in the positive y-direction, which is into the interior of the unit-square domain $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. Thus, the candidate point $P_c$ must be placed \"above\" the midpoint $M$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the coordinates of the candidate point.\nThe point $P_c$ is located at a a certain distance, let's call it $d$, from $M$ along the direction of $\\vec{n}$. Its coordinates will be $P_c = M + d\\vec{n} = (1/2, 0) + d(0,1) = (1/2, d)$.\nThe problem states that the two new edges, $AP_c$ and $BP_c$, must each have a length of exactly $h=0.4$. We can use the distance formula to find $d$. Let's consider the edge $AP_c$:\n$$|AP_c|^2 = (x_c - x_A)^2 + (y_c - y_A)^2 = h^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + (d - 0)^2 = (0.4)^2$$\nThe base of the triangle is $s = 1/3$. The distance from endpoint $A$ to the midpoint $M$ is $s/2 = 1/6$. The problem describes an isosceles triangle with endpoints $A$ and $B$ and apex $P_c$. The height of this triangle is $d$. We can form a right-angled triangle with vertices $A$, $M$, and $P_c$. The Pythagorean theorem gives:\n$$|AM|^2 + |MP_c|^2 = |AP_c|^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + d^2 = (0.4)^2$$\nWe convert $0.4$ to a fraction, $0.4 = 4/10 = 2/5$.\n$$\\frac{1}{36} + d^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{25}$$\nNow, we solve for $d^2$:\n$$d^2 = \\frac{4}{25} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{4 \\times 36 - 1 \\times 25}{25 \\times 36} = \\frac{144 - 25}{900} = \\frac{119}{900}$$\nSince the point must be inside the domain, we take the positive root for $d$:\n$$d = \\sqrt{\\frac{119}{900}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{30}$$\nThe coordinates of the candidate point $P_c$ are $(x_c, y_c) = (1/2, d) = (1/2, \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{30})$.\n\nStep 5: Final numerical calculation and rounding.\nThe problem requires the final coordinates to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe x-coordinate is:\n$x_c = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\nTo four significant figures, this is written as $0.5000$.\nThe y-coordinate is:\n$y_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{30} \\approx \\frac{10.9087121}{30} \\approx 0.363623737$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.3636$.\nThe coordinates of the first interior candidate point are $(0.5000, 0.3636)$.",

Let the points be defined as follows: $A = (0,0)$, $B = (1,0)$, $C = (0.5, -0.5)$, $D = (0.5, 0.5)$, and the proposed new point $p = (0.5, 0.3)$.\nThe existing edges mentioned are $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. The problem specifies we must test for intersection with the vertical edge, which is the segment $\\overline{CD}$.\nThe two proposed new edges are $\\overline{Ap}$ and $\\overline{Bp}$.\n\nThe standard method for determining if two line segments, say $\\overline{P_1P_2}$ and $\\overline{P_3P_4}$, intersect is to use an orientation predicate. The orientation of an ordered triplet of points $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ with coordinates $p_1=(x_1, y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2, y_2)$, and $p_3=(x_3, y_3)$ is given by the sign of the determinant:\n$$ \\text{orientation}(p_1, p_2, p_3) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 & y_2 - y_1 \\\\ x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 \\end{pmatrix} = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (x_3 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1) $$\nA positive value indicates a counter-clockwise turn (or `left turn`) at $p_2$ going from $p_1$ to $p_3$. A negative value indicates a clockwise turn (`right turn`). A value of zero indicates that the three points are collinear.\n\nTwo segments $\\overline{P_1P_2}$ and $\\overline{P_3P_4}$ intersect if and only if one of two conditions is met:\n1.  **General Case:** The endpoints of each segment lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment. This is true if $\\text{orientation}(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ and $\\text{orientation}(P_1, P_2, P_4)$ have different signs, AND $\\text{orientation}(P_3, P_4, P_1)$ and $\\text{orientation}(P_3, P_4, P_2)$ have different signs.\n2.  **Special Case (Collinear):** An endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment. This occurs if one of the orientation tests yields zero, and a point is shown to lie within the bounding box of a segment with which it is collinear.\n\nWe will test each proposed edge for intersection with the existing vertical edge $\\overline{CD}$.\n\n**Test 1: Intersection of proposed edge $\\overline{Ap}$ with existing edge $\\overline{CD}$**\n\nLet $P_1 = A = (0,0)$, $P_2 = p = (0.5, 0.3)$.\nLet $P_3 = C = (0.5, -0.5)$, $P_4 = D = (0.5, 0.5)$.\n\nWe check the orientation of the endpoints of $\\overline{CD}$ with respect to the line containing $\\overline{Ap}$.\n$$ \\text{orientation}(A, p, C) = (0.5 - 0)(-0.5 - 0) - (0.5 - 0)(0.3 - 0) = (0.5)(-0.5) - (0.5)(0.3) = -0.25 - 0.15 = -0.4 $$\n$$ \\text{orientation}(A, p, D) = (0.5 - 0)(0.5 - 0) - (0.5 - 0)(0.3 - 0) = (0.5)(0.5) - (0.5)(0.3) = 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.1 $$\nSince the signs are different (one is negative, one is positive), the segment $\\overline{CD}$ straddles the line containing $\\overline{Ap}$.\n\nNext, we check the orientation of the endpoints of $\\overline{Ap}$ with respect to the line containing $\\overline{CD}$.\n$$ \\text{orientation}(C, D, A) = (0.5 - 0.5)(0 - (-0.5)) - (0 - 0.5)(0.5 - (-0.5)) = (0)(0.5) - (-0.5)(1) = 0.5 $$\n$$ \\text{orientation}(C, D, p) = (0.5 - 0.5)(0.3 - (-0.5)) - (0.5 - 0.5)(0.5 - (-0.5)) = (0)(0.8) - (0)(1) = 0 $$\nThe orientation for the triplet $(C, D, p)$ is zero. This indicates a special case: the points $C$, $D$, and $p$ are collinear. Since $p$ is an endpoint of the segment $\\overline{Ap}$, we must check if $p$ lies on the segment $\\overline{CD}$.\nFor a point $p=(x_p, y_p)$ to be on the segment $\\overline{CD}$ with endpoints $C=(x_C, y_C)$ and $D=(x_D, y_D)$, its coordinates must satisfy:\n$x_p \\in [\\min(x_C, x_D), \\max(x_C, x_D)]$ and $y_p \\in [\\min(y_C, y_D), \\max(y_C, y_D)]$.\nHere, $p=(0.5, 0.3)$, $C=(0.5, -0.5)$, and $D=(0.5, 0.5)$.\nFor the $x$-coordinate: $0.5 \\in [\\min(0.5, 0.5), \\max(0.5, 0.5)]$, which is $0.5 \\in [0.5, 0.5]$. This is true.\nFor the $y$-coordinate: $0.3 \\in [\\min(-0.5, 0.5), \\max(-0.5, 0.5)]$, which is $0.3 \\in [-0.5, 0.5]$. This is also true.\nTherefore, the point $p$ lies on the segment $\\overline{CD}$.\nSince $p$ is an endpoint of $\\overline{Ap}$ and also lies on $\\overline{CD}$, the two segments intersect at point $p = (0.5, 0.3)$.\n\n**Test 2: Intersection of proposed edge $\\overline{Bp}$ with existing edge $\\overline{CD}$**\n\nLet $P_1 = B = (1,0)$, $P_2 = p = (0.5, 0.3)$.\nLet $P_3 = C = (0.5, -0.5)$, $P_4 = D = (0.5, 0.5)$.\n\nThe analysis is analogous. The point $p$ is an endpoint of the proposed segment $\\overline{Bp}$. From the previous test, we have already proven that the point $p$ lies on the existing segment $\\overline{CD}$. By definition, if two segments share a point, they intersect. The intersection point is again $p=(0.5, 0.3)$.\nTherefore, the second proposed edge $\\overline{Bp}$ also intersects the existing vertical edge $\\overline{CD}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt least one intersection occurs; in fact, both proposed edges intersect the existing vertical edge $\\overline{CD}$. The intersection point for both is the same point $p = (0.5, 0.3)$. The problem asks for the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point.\nThe $y$-coordinate of $p$ is $0.3$.\nIf no intersection had occurred, the answer would be $0$. Since an intersection is found, the answer is the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point.\nFinal answer is $0.3$.",
