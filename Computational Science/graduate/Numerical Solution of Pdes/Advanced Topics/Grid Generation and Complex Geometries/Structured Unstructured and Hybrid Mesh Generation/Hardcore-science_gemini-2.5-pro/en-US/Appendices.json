You seek to build an anisotropic mesh for piecewise linear finite element interpolation that is locally aligned with the principal curvature directions encoded by the Hessian of $u$. As a local model of a single anisotropic element in a structured, unstructured, or hybrid mesh, consider the right triangle $K$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(\\ell_{x},0)$, and $(0,\\ell_{y})$, whose legs are aligned with the coordinate axes. The area is fixed to $A = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ell_{x}\\ell_{y}$ so that any change in the element’s aspect ratio reflects a redistribution of resolution rather than a change in local element count.\n\nUsing only the following foundational facts:\n- the linear Lagrange interpolant on a triangle agrees with $u$ at the triangle’s vertices,\n- Taylor’s theorem up to second order with the constant Hessian $H[u] = \\nabla^{2} u$ for a quadratic field,\n- the leading-order interpolation error of piecewise linear elements is governed by the Hessian of $u$,\n\nderive, from first principles, the expression for the supremum of the pointwise interpolation error magnitude on $K$ in terms of $\\ell_{x}$, $\\ell_{y}$, and $\\lambda$, and then determine the element aspect ratio $r = \\ell_{x}/\\ell_{y}$ that minimizes this supremum under the fixed-area constraint.

Start by stating the goal: to derive the interpolation error and then minimize it.\n    2.  **Part I: Derivation of the Interpolation Error**\n        *   Define the function $u(x,y) = x^2 + \\lambda y^2$.\n        *   Define the triangular element $K$ with vertices $V_0=(0,0)$, $V_1=(\\ell_x,0)$, $V_2=(0,\\ell_y)$.\n        *   Define the linear Lagrange interpolant $\\Pi_K u(x,y)$ on $K$. It has the form $ax+by+c$.\n        *   Enforce the interpolation conditions:\n            *   $\\Pi_K u(0,0) = u(0,0) = 0 \\implies c=0$.\n            *   $\\Pi_K u(\\ell_x,0) = u(\\ell_x,0) = \\ell_x^2 \\implies a\\ell_x = \\ell_x^2 \\implies a=\\ell_x$.\n            *   $\\Pi_K u(0,\\ell_y) = u(0,\\ell_y) = \\lambda \\ell_y^2 \\implies b\\ell_y = \\lambda \\ell_y^2 \\implies b=\\lambda \\ell_y$.\n        *   State the resulting interpolant: $\\Pi_K u(x,y) = \\ell_x x + \\lambda \\ell_y y$.\n        *   Define the pointwise interpolation error $E(x,y) = u(x,y) - \\Pi_K u(x,y)$.\n        *   Write out the error function: $E(x,y) = (x^2 - \\ell_x x) + \\lambda(y^2 - \\ell_y y)$.\n        *   Analyze the sign of $E(x,y)$ on $K$. For any $(x,y) \\in K$, we have $0 \\le x \\le \\ell_x$ and $0 \\le y \\le \\ell_y$. Therefore, $x(x-\\ell_x) \\le 0$ and $y(y-\\ell_y) \\le 0$. Since $\\lambda > 0$, $E(x,y) \\le 0$ on $K$.\n        *   The magnitude of the error is $|E(x,y)| = -E(x,y) = (\\ell_x x - x^2) + \\lambda(\\ell_y y - y^2)$.\n        *   Our goal is to find the supremum of this function, let's call it $F(x,y)$, on the compact set $K$.\n        *   Find the gradient of $F(x,y)$: $\\nabla F = (\\ell_x - 2x, \\lambda(\\ell_y - 2y))$.\n        *   Setting $\\nabla F = 0$ gives the critical point $(x_c, y_c) = (\\ell_x/2, \\ell_y/2)$.\n        *   Check if this point is in the domain $K$.

The error scales with the curvature (the diagonal entries of the Hessian) multiplied by the square of the element size in that direction.\n    3.  **Part II: Minimization of the Error Supremum**\n        *   State the optimization problem: Minimize $S(\\ell_x, \\ell_y)$ subject to the fixed-area constraint $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\ell_x \\ell_y$.\n        *   From the constraint, express one variable in terms of the other: $\\ell_y = \\frac{2A}{\\ell_x}$.\n        *   Substitute this into the expression for $S$:\n            $S(\\ell_x) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\ell_x^2 + \\lambda (\\frac{2A}{\\ell_x})^2) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\ell_x^2 + \\frac{4A^2\\lambda}{\\ell_x^2})$.\n        *   Find the minimum by differentiating with respect to $\\ell_x$ and setting the result to zero.\n            $\\frac{dS}{d\\ell_x} = \\frac{1}{4} (2\\ell_x - \\frac{8A^2\\lambda}{\\ell_x^3}) = 0$.\n        *   Solve for $\\ell_x$: $2\\ell_x = \\frac{8A^2\\lambda}{\\ell_x^3} \\implies \\ell_x^4 = 4A^2\\lambda \\implies \\ell_x^2 = 2A\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\n        *   Use the constraint to find the corresponding $\\ell_y^2$: $\\ell_y^2 = (\\frac{2A}{\\ell_x})^2 = \\frac{4A^2}{\\ell_x^2} = \\frac{4A^2}{2A\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{2A}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$.\n        *   Compute the desired aspect ratio $r = \\ell_x/\\ell_y$. Its square is $r^2 = \\frac{\\ell_x^2}{\\ell_y^2}$.\n        *   $r^2 = \\frac{2A\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{2A/\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\lambda$.\n        *   Since $\\ell_x$ and $\\ell_y$ represent lengths, they must be positive, hence $r$ must be positive.\n        *   $r = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$.",

Using a $P1$ finite element basis $\\{\\phi_i\\}$, the problem discretizes to a linear system $K U = F$, where the entries of the global stiffness matrix $K$ are given by $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_j, \\phi_i) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j \\, d\\Omega$. Note that the matrix is symmetric, so $K_{ij}=K_{ji}$.\n\nAn off-diagonal entry $K_{ij}$ ($i \\neq j$) is non-zero only if the nodes $P_i$ and $P_j$ are connected by an edge. Its value is the sum of contributions from the triangles that share this edge. For an edge connecting $P_i$ and $P_j$ that is part of a triangle $T$, the contribution to the stiffness matrix entry $K_{ij}$ from that triangle is given by the formula:\n$$ K_{ij}^{T} = \\int_{T} \\nabla\\phi_i \\cdot \\nabla\\phi_j \\, d\\Omega = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\theta_{k}) $$\nwhere $\\theta_k$ is the angle in triangle $T$ at the vertex $P_k$ opposite the edge $\\overline{P_iP_j}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the sign of $K_{13}$. The edge $\\overline{P_1P_3}$ is an interior edge shared by triangles $T_1$ and $T_2$. The total entry $K_{13}$ is the sum of the contributions from these two triangles:\n$$ K_{13} = K_{13}^{T_1} + K_{13}^{T_2} $$\n\n-   For triangle $T_1 = (P_1, P_2, P_3)$, the angle opposite the edge $\\overline{P_1P_3}$ is $\\theta_2$ at vertex $P_2$. We found $\\theta_2 = \\pi/2$. The contribution is:\n    $$ K_{13}^{T_1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\theta_2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\pi/2) = 0 $$\n\n-   For triangle $T_2 = (P_1, P_3, P_4)$, the angle opposite the edge $\\overline{P_1P_3}$ is $\\phi_4$ at vertex $P_4$. We found this angle to be obtuse ($\\phi_4 > \\pi/2$). The contribution is:\n    $$ K_{13}^{T_2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\phi_4) $$\n\nThe total stiffness matrix entry is $K_{13} = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\phi_4) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cot(\\phi_4)$.\nFor an obtuse angle $\\phi_4 \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$, its cotangent is negative, i.e., $\\cot(\\phi_4) < 0$.\nTherefore, the sign of $K_{13}$ is positive:\n$$ K_{13} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{a negative number}) > 0 $$\n\nAn $M$-matrix is a matrix $A$ that satisfies three conditions:\n1.  It is a $Z$-matrix, meaning all its off-diagonal entries are non-positive ($A_{ij} \\le 0$ for $i \\ne j$).\n2.  It is non-singular.\n3.  Its inverse is non-negative ($A^{-1} \\ge 0$).\n\nSince we have found that the off-diagonal entry $K_{13}$ is positive, the stiffness matrix $K$ is not a $Z$-matrix. Consequently, $K$ cannot be an $M$-matrix.\n\nThe Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) for this problem is guaranteed to hold if the stiffness matrix $K$ is an $M$-matrix. Since $K$ is not an $M$-matrix, the DMP is not guaranteed to hold. The presence of the obtuse angle $\\phi_4$ in the mesh is the direct cause of the failure of the $M$-matrix property.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, the compliance indicator $I=1$ if the mesh yields an $M$-matrix, and $I=0$ otherwise. As the matrix is not an $M$-matrix, the indicator is $I=0$.",

The coordinates are:\n$\\mathbf{x}_1 = (\\cos(-\\alpha), \\sin(-\\alpha)) = (\\cos\\alpha, -\\sin\\alpha)$\n$\\mathbf{x}_2 = (\\cos(-\\alpha/3), \\sin(-\\alpha/3)) = (\\cos(\\alpha/3), -\\sin(\\alpha/3))$\n$\\mathbf{x}_3 = (\\cos(\\alpha/3), \\sin(\\alpha/3))$\n$\\mathbf{x}_4 = (\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)$\n\nNow we compute the components of $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (x(0), y(0))$.\nThe $y$-component is:\n$$\ny(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(0) y_i = N_1(0)(-\\sin\\alpha) + N_2(0)(-\\sin(\\alpha/3)) + N_3(0)(\\sin(\\alpha/3)) + N_4(0)(\\sin\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $N_i(0)$:\n$$\ny(0) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(-\\sin\\alpha) + \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)(-\\sin(\\alpha/3)) + \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)(\\sin(\\alpha/3)) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(\\sin\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\ny(0) = \\frac{1}{16}\\sin\\alpha - \\frac{9}{16}\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) + \\frac{9}{16}\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{16}\\sin\\alpha = 0\n$$\nThis result is expected due to the symmetry of the geometry and the interpolation nodes about the $x$-axis.\n\nThe $x$-component is:\n$$\nx(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(0) x_i = N_1(0)\\cos\\alpha + N_2(0)\\cos(\\alpha/3) + N_3(0)\\cos(\\alpha/3) + N_4(0)\\cos\\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $N_i(0)$:\n$$\nx(0) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)\\cos\\alpha + \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) + \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)\\cos\\alpha\n$$\n$$\nx(0) = -\\frac{2}{16}\\cos\\alpha + \\frac{18}{16}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) = \\frac{9}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos\\alpha\n$$\nThe radial position at $t=0$ is $r(0) = \\sqrt{x(0)^2 + y(0)^2} = \\sqrt{x(0)^2 + 0^2} = |x(0)|$.\nFor $0 < \\alpha \\leq \\pi/2$, we have $0 < \\alpha/3 \\leq \\pi/6$. In this range, both $\\cos\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\cos(\\alpha/3) > 0$. We must check the sign of $x(0)$. Using the trigonometric triple-angle identity $\\cos\\alpha = 4\\cos^3(\\alpha/3) - 3\\cos(\\alpha/3)$, we can write:\n$$\nx(0) = \\frac{9}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{8}\\left(4\\cos^3(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - 3\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3})\\right) = \\frac{9}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^3(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) + \\frac{3}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3})\n$$\n$$\nx(0) = \\frac{12}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^3(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) = \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^3(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) \\left(3 - \\cos^2(\\frac{\\alpha}{3})\\right)\n$$\nFor $0 < \\alpha/3 \\leq \\pi/6$, $\\cos(\\alpha/3)$ is in the range $[\\sqrt{3}/2, 1)$. Thus $\\cos^2(\\alpha/3)$ is in $[3/4, 1)$. The term $3 - \\cos^2(\\alpha/3)$ is therefore positive, as is $\\cos(\\alpha/3)$. This confirms that $x(0) > 0$, so $r(0) = x(0)$.\n\nFinally, the radial error $\\varepsilon(\\alpha)$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\alpha) = r(0) - 1 = x(0) - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the simplified expression for $x(0)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\alpha) = \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^3(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - 1\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the radial error at the midpoint. It can also be expressed in the form containing both $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha/3$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\alpha) = \\frac{9}{8}\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{3}) - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos(\\alpha) - 1\n$$\nThe two forms are equivalent. The first form, involving only functions of $\\alpha/3$, is more compact.",
