            "solution": "The problem is to perform a modified equation analysis on a given finite difference scheme for the one-dimensional linear advection equation to find the leading artificial diffusion term.\n\nThe given partial differential equation (PDE) is the linear advection equation:\n$$\nu_t + a\\,u_x = 0\n$$\nwhere $u = u(x,t)$ is the solution variable, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $a0$ is the constant advection speed. Subscripts denote partial differentiation, i.e., $u_t = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ and $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n\nThe finite difference scheme provided is:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n+1} = u_{j}^{n} - a\\,\\Delta t\\,\\frac{u_{j}^{n} - u_{j-1}^{n}}{h}\n$$\nHere, $u_j^n$ is the numerical approximation of the exact solution $u$ at grid point $x_j = j h$ and time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, where $h$ is the uniform spatial step size and $\\Delta t$ is the uniform time step. This scheme uses a forward difference in time (Forward Euler) and a backward difference in space (first-order upwind, since $a0$).\n\nThe goal of modified equation analysis is to determine the PDE that is actually solved by the numerical scheme. This is achieved by expanding each term of the discrete scheme in a Taylor series around a central point, typically $(x_j, t_n)$, and then rearranging the resulting expression into the form of a PDE.\n\nLet us expand the terms $u_j^{n+1}$ and $u_{j-1}^n$ around the point $(x_j, t_n)$. We assume the exact solution $u(x,t)$ is sufficiently smooth to permit these expansions.\nThe Taylor series expansion in time for $u_j^{n+1} = u(x_j, t_n + \\Delta t)$ is:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u(x_j,t_n) + \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2!} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^3}{3!} \\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial t^3} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta t)^4)\n$$\nThe Taylor series expansion in space for $u_{j-1}^n = u(x_j - h, t_n)$ is:\n$$\nu_{j-1}^n = u(x_j,t_n) - h \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{h^2}{2!} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{h^3}{3!} \\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x^3} + \\mathcal{O}(h^4)\n$$\nFor brevity, we will denote the partial derivatives evaluated at $(x_j, t_n)$ by subscripts, for example, $u_t = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\Big|_{(x_j, t_n)}$.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the finite difference scheme by dividing by $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + a \\frac{u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n}{h} = 0\n$$\nNow, substitute the Taylor series expansions into this equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left( \\left(u + \\Delta t\\, u_t + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} u_{tt} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta t)^3)\\right) - u \\right) + \\frac{a}{h} \\left( u - \\left(u - h\\, u_x + \\frac{h^2}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{h^3}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}(h^4)\\right) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSimplifying the terms within the parentheses yields:\n$$\n\\left( u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta t)^2) \\right) + \\frac{a}{h} \\left( h\\, u_x - \\frac{h^2}{2} u_{xx} + \\frac{h^3}{6} u_{xxx} - \\mathcal{O}(h^4) \\right) = 0\n$$\nDistributing the factors $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$ and $\\frac{a}{h}$:\n$$\nu_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + a u_x - \\frac{ah}{2} u_{xx} + \\frac{ah^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\text{H.O.T.} = 0\n$$\nwhere H.O.T. stands for higher-order terms. Rearranging the equation to group terms by their derivative order, we get:\n$$\n(u_t + a u_x) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} - \\frac{ah}{2} u_{xx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2, h^2, \\Delta t h) = 0\n$$\nThis expression represents the truncation error of the scheme. The modified equation is obtained by setting this entire expression to zero. The first term, $(u_t + a u_x)$, is the original PDE. For the exact solution, this term is zero. The remaining terms represent the error introduced by the discretization.\n\nTo find the effective PDE, we must express the time derivatives ($u_{tt}$, $u_{ttt}$, etc.) in terms of spatial derivatives. This is done by repeatedly differentiating the PDE itself, $u_t = -a u_x$, assuming the solution is sufficiently smooth.\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$:\n$$\nu_{tt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (u_t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (-a u_x) = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\partial_x u) = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\partial_t u) = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (u_t)\n$$\nNow, substitute $u_t = -a u_x$ into this result:\n$$\nu_{tt} = -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-a u_x) = a^2 u_{xx}\n$$\nThis relationship holds for the solution of the modified equation itself, not just the original PDE, in the limit of small $h$ and $\\Delta t$. Now, we substitute this expression for $u_{tt}$ back into our expanded equation:\n$$\n(u_t + a u_x) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (a^2 u_{xx}) - \\frac{ah}{2} u_{xx} + \\text{H.O.T.} = 0\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to isolate the original PDE operator:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = - \\left( \\frac{a^2 \\Delta t}{2} - \\frac{ah}{2} \\right) u_{xx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\left( \\frac{ah}{2} - \\frac{a^2 \\Delta t}{2} \\right) u_{xx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nThis is the modified equation. The leading error term is a second-derivative term, which acts like a diffusion term of the form $\\nu_{\\text{num}} u_{xx}$. The coefficient $\\nu_{\\text{num}}$ is the numerical (or artificial) diffusion coefficient. By comparing terms, we identify it as:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{ah}{2} - \\frac{a^2 \\Delta t}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks to express this result in terms of $a$, $h$, and $\\Delta t$ by using the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number, defined as $\\lambda = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{h}$. We can factor the expression for $\\nu_{\\text{num}}$ to make this relationship explicit:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{ah}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{h} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression contains the quantities $a$, $h$, and $\\Delta t$, and its structure is made clear by the presence of the CFL number group. The stability condition for this explicit scheme is $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$. For this range, $\\nu_{\\text{num}} \\ge 0$, indicating that the scheme introduces a stabilizing diffusion. When $\\lambda=1$, the numerical diffusion vanishes, and the scheme becomes exact for the given PDE (as the truncation error's leading term becomes zero).\n\nThe final expression for the numerical diffusion coefficient is therefore $\\frac{ah}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{h} \\right)$.",

Its evolution is governed by the modified equation, obtained by substituting the Taylor expansions into the scheme:\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + a \\left(C_1 v^{(1)} + \\frac{h^2}{6}C_3 v^{(3)} + \\dots\\right) = -\\mu \\left(\\frac{D_4}{24} v^{(4)} + \\frac{h^2 D_6}{720} v^{(6)} + \\dots\\right)$$\nEnforcing consistency ($C_1=1, D_4=24, D_0=0, D_2=0$), and rearranging gives:\n$$v_t + a v_x + \\mu v_{xxxx} = -h^2 \\left( a\\frac{C_3(\\alpha)}{6} v^{(3)} + \\mu\\frac{D_6(\\beta)}{720} v^{(6)} \\right) - h^4 \\left( a\\frac{C_5(\\alpha)}{120} v^{(5)} + \\mu\\frac{D_8(\\beta)}{40320} v^{(8)} \\right) + O(h^6)$$\nThe problem requires \"no spurious terms of order $O(h^2)$ or $O(h^3)$\". The $O(h^3)$ terms are naturally zero due to the centered stencils. For the $O(h^2)$ terms to vanish for any solution $v$, their coefficients must be zero:\n$$C_3(\\alpha) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D_6(\\beta) = 0$$\nThese conditions, combined with the consistency conditions, ensure the scheme's truncation error is $O(h^4)$. The modified equation matches the target PDE up to order $O(h^3)$. The discrepancy is $O(h^4)$, hence the scheme is fourth-order accurate. This satisfies the problem's accuracy requirement, interpreted as demanding a fourth-order scheme.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Stencil Coefficients\n\n**Coefficients for $\\mathcal{D}_1$:**\nWe need to find the minimal $m$ and coefficients $\\{\\alpha_k\\}$ satisfying:\n1.  $C_1(\\alpha) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^{m} k \\alpha_k = 1 \\implies \\sum_{k=1}^{m} k \\alpha_k = 1/2$\n2.  $C_3(\\alpha) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^{m} k^3 \\alpha_k = 0 \\implies \\sum_{k=1}^{m} k^3 \\alpha_k = 0$\nFor $m=1$, this is impossible. We try the minimal case $m=2$, which gives a system of two equations for $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$:\n$$\\begin{cases} \\alpha_1 + 2\\alpha_2 = 1/2 \\\\ \\alpha_1 + 8\\alpha_2 = 0 \\end{cases}$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $6\\alpha_2 = -1/2$, so $\\alpha_2 = -1/12$. Substituting back gives $\\alpha_1 = -8\\alpha_2 = -8(-1/12) = 2/3$.\nThe coefficients are: $\\alpha_1 = 2/3$, $\\alpha_2 = -1/12$. By anti-symmetry, $\\alpha_{-1} = -2/3$ and $\\alpha_{-2} = 1/12$, with $\\alpha_0=0$. This corresponds to a minimal half-width of $m=2$.\n\n**Coefficients for $\\mathcal{D}_4$:**\nWe need to find the minimal $n$ and coefficients $\\{\\beta_k\\}$ satisfying:\n1.  $D_0(\\beta) = \\beta_0 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\beta_k = 0$\n2.  $D_2(\\beta) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \\beta_k = 0 \\implies \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \\beta_k = 0$\n3.  $D_4(\\beta) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^4 \\beta_k = 24 \\implies \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^4 \\beta_k = 12$\n4.  $D_6(\\beta) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^6 \\beta_k = 0 \\implies \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^6 \\beta_k = 0$\nFor $n3$, this system is overdetermined. We try the minimal case $n=3$, which gives 3 equations for $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3$:\n$$\\begin{cases} \\beta_1 + 4\\beta_2 + 9\\beta_3 = 0 \\\\ \\beta_1 + 16\\beta_2 + 81\\beta_3 = 12 \\\\ \\beta_1 + 64\\beta_2 + 729\\beta_3 = 0 \\end{cases}$$\nSubtracting equations yields:\n- $(Eq. 2) - (Eq. 1) \\implies 12\\beta_2 + 72\\beta_3 = 12 \\implies \\beta_2 + 6\\beta_3 = 1$\n- $(Eq. 3) - (Eq. 2) \\implies 48\\beta_2 + 648\\beta_3 = -12 \\implies 4\\beta_2 + 54\\beta_3 = -1$\nSubstituting $\\beta_2 = 1-6\\beta_3$ into the second reduced equation:\n$4(1-6\\beta_3) + 54\\beta_3 = -1 \\implies 4 - 24\\beta_3 + 54\\beta_3 = -1 \\implies 30\\beta_3 = -5 \\implies \\beta_3 = -1/6$.\nThen $\\beta_2 = 1 - 6(-1/6) = 1+1 = 2$.\nAnd $\\beta_1 = -4\\beta_2 - 9\\beta_3 = -4(2) - 9(-1/6) = -8 + 3/2 = -13/2$.\nFinally, we find $\\beta_0$ from $D_0=0$:\n$\\beta_0 = -2(\\beta_1+\\beta_2+\\beta_3) = -2(-13/2 + 2 - 1/6) = -2(-39/6 + 12/6 - 1/6) = -2(-28/6) = 28/3$.\nThe coefficients are: $\\beta_1 = -13/2$, $\\beta_2 = 2$, $\\beta_3 = -1/6$, and $\\beta_0=28/3$. By symmetry, $\\beta_{-k}=\\beta_k$. This corresponds to a minimal half-width of $n=3$.\n\nThe minimal half-widths are $m=2$ and $n=3$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\nThe vector of required coefficients is $[\\alpha_{-2},\\,\\alpha_{-1},\\,\\alpha_{0},\\,\\alpha_{1},\\,\\alpha_{2},\\,\\beta_{-3},\\,\\beta_{-2},\\,\\beta_{-1},\\,\\beta_{0},\\,\\beta_{1},\\,\\beta_{2},\\,\\beta_{3}]$.\n- $\\alpha_{-2} = -\\alpha_2 = 1/12$\n- $\\alpha_{-1} = -\\alpha_1 = -2/3$\n- $\\alpha_0 = 0$\n- $\\alpha_1 = 2/3$\n- $\\alpha_2 = -1/12$\n- $\\beta_{-3} = \\beta_3 = -1/6$\n- $\\beta_{-2} = \\beta_2 = 2$\n- $\\beta_{-1} = \\beta_1 = -13/2$\n- $\\beta_0 = 28/3$\n- $\\beta_1 = -13/2$\n- $\\beta_2 = 2$\n- $\\beta_3 = -1/6$\n\nThe final row vector is:\n$[\\frac{1}{12}, -\\frac{2}{3}, 0, \\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{12}, -\\frac{1}{6}, 2, -\\frac{13}{2}, \\frac{28}{3}, -\\frac{13}{2}, 2, -\\frac{1}{6}]$",
