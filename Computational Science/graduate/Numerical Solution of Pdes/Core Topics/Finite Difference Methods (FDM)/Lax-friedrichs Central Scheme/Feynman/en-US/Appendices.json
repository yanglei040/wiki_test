Use the Lax-Friedrichs central scheme to approximate the solution. The Lax-Friedrichs scheme advances a grid function $u_j^n \\approx u(x_j,t^n)$ on a uniform grid $x_j = j\\,\\Delta x$ with time step $\\Delta t$ by combining neighbor averaging and a centered difference in space with a forward difference in time. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed by treating indices modulo the number of grid points. \n\nYour tasks are to:\n1) Derive, from first principles using Taylor expansion and the definition of local truncation error, the predicted rate of convergence (the order of accuracy) of the Lax-Friedrichs central scheme for this problem when the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number $\\lambda = a\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ is held fixed in $(0,1)$ as $\\Delta x \\to 0$ with $\\Delta t \\propto \\Delta x$.\n2) Design and implement a grid refinement study that computes the solution at a fixed final time $T$ for a sequence of grids $\\Delta x_k = L/N_k$ with $N_{k+1} = 2 N_k$, compares against the exact solution $u(x,T) = u_0(x - a T)$ (with periodicity), and measures the discrete $L^2$-norm of the error $e_k = \\left(\\Delta x_k \\sum_j \\lvert u_j^N - u(x_j,T) \\rvert^2 \\right)^{1/2}$.

For each test case, take $L = 1$, periodic boundary conditions, and the exact solution $u(x,T) = u_0(x - a T)$ where the shift is taken modulo $L$. Use a time step $\\Delta t$ determined from the specified CFL number as $\\Delta t = \\text{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / \\lvert a \\rvert$ for each grid; if $a = 0$, take $\\Delta t = \\text{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x$ (not used in these tests). Advance in time with steps of size $\\Delta t$, and if $T$ is not an integer multiple of $\\Delta t$, use a final shorter step so that the total simulated time is exactly $T$. For each test case, use $N_k = N_0 \\cdot 2^k$ for $k = 0,1,2,3$ (four refinement levels).

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, well-posed, and directly pertains to the specified topic in numerical analysis. The provided parameters and conditions are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution to be determined.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: a theoretical derivation of the convergence rate for the Lax-Friedrichs scheme, the design and implementation of a numerical experiment to measure this rate, and a comparison between the theoretical and experimental results.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Order of Convergence\n\nThe one-dimensional linear advection equation is given by\n$$\nu_t + a\\,u_x = 0\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the conserved quantity, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $a$ is the constant wave speed. We are given a periodic domain $x \\in [0,L]$ and a smooth periodic initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$.\n\nThe Lax-Friedrichs central scheme for this equation on a uniform grid with spatial step $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$ is given by\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{j+1}^n + u_{j-1}^n) - \\frac{a\\,\\Delta t}{2\\,\\Delta x}(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nwhere $u_j^n$ is the numerical approximation of the solution $u(x_j, t^n)$ at grid point $x_j=j\\,\\Delta x$ and time $t^n=n\\,\\Delta t$.\n\nTo determine the order of accuracy, we calculate the local truncation error, $\\tau_j^n$. The truncation error is found by substituting the exact solution $u(x,t)$ into the finite difference equation and normalizing appropriately. Let $L_{\\Delta t, \\Delta x}$ be the difference operator associated with the scheme:\n$$\nL_{\\Delta t, \\Delta x}(u_j^n) \\equiv \\frac{u_j^{n+1} - \\frac{1}{2}(u_{j+1}^n + u_{j-1}^n)}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{2\\,\\Delta x}(u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n) = 0\n$$\nThe local truncation error $\\tau_j^n$ is defined by applying this operator to the exact solution $u(x,t)$ at the point $(x_j, t^n)$:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = L_{\\Delta t, \\Delta x}(u(x_j, t^n))\n$$\nWe use Taylor series to expand the terms $u(x_j, t^{n+1})$, $u(x_{j+1}, t^n)$, and $u(x_{j-1}, t^n)$ around the point $(x_j, t^n)$. Let $u$ and its partial derivatives $u_t, u_x, u_{tt}, u_{xx}, \\dots$ denote their values at $(x_j, t^n)$.\n\nThe expansions are:\n$$\nu(x_j, t^{n+1}) = u + u_t \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} u_{tt} (\\Delta t)^2 + \\frac{1}{6} u_{ttt} (\\Delta t)^3 + O((\\Delta t)^4)\n$$\n$$\nu(x_{j\\pm1}, t^n) = u \\pm u_x \\Delta x + \\frac{1}{2} u_{xx} (\\Delta x)^2 \\pm \\frac{1}{6} u_{xxx} (\\Delta x)^3 + \\frac{1}{24} u_{xxxx} (\\Delta x)^4 + O((\\Delta x)^5)\n$$\nFrom the second expansion, we derive expressions for the spatial average and difference terms in the scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(u(x_{j+1}, t^n) + u(x_{j-1}, t^n)) = u + \\frac{1}{2} u_{xx} (\\Delta x)^2 + \\frac{1}{24} u_{xxxx} (\\Delta x)^4 + O((\\Delta x)^6)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{a}{2\\,\\Delta x}(u(x_{j+1}, t^n) - u(x_{j-1}, t^n)) = \\frac{a}{2\\,\\Delta x}(2u_x \\Delta x + \\frac{1}{3}u_{xxx}(\\Delta x)^3 + O((\\Delta x)^5)) = a\\,u_x + \\frac{a}{6}u_{xxx}(\\Delta x)^2 + O((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expansions into the expression for $\\tau_j^n$:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left(u + u_t \\Delta t + \\frac{u_{tt}}{2}(\\Delta t)^2 + \\dots\\right) - \\left(u + \\frac{u_{xx}}{2}(\\Delta x)^2 + \\dots\\right) \\right] + \\left(a\\,u_x + \\frac{a u_{xxx}}{6}(\\Delta x)^2 + \\dots\\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = (u_t + a\\,u_x) + \\frac{u_{tt}}{2}\\Delta t - \\frac{u_{xx}}{2\\Delta t}(\\Delta x)^2 + O((\\Delta t)^2, (\\Delta x)^2)\n$$\nSince $u(x,t)$ is the exact solution to the PDE, the term $(u_t + a\\,u_x)$ is zero. The leading terms of the truncation error are:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = \\frac{1}{2} u_{tt} \\Delta t - \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t} u_{xx} (\\Delta x)^2 + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the PDE itself to relate time and space derivatives. Since $u_t = -a\\,u_x$, we can differentiate with respect to time to get $u_{tt} = (-a\\,u_x)_t = -a\\,u_{xt} = -a\\,(u_t)_x = -a\\,(-a\\,u_x)_x = a^2 u_{xx}$. Substituting $u_{tt} = a^2 u_{xx}$ into the error expression:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = \\frac{1}{2} (a^2 u_{xx}) \\Delta t - \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t} u_{xx} (\\Delta x)^2 + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = \\frac{u_{xx}}{2\\Delta t} \\left( a^2 (\\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 \\right) + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nLet $\\lambda = a\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ be the Courant number as defined in the problem. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = \\frac{u_{xx} (\\Delta x)^2}{2\\Delta t} (\\lambda^2 - 1) + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the CFL number, $\\text{CFL} = \\lvert a \\rvert \\Delta t / \\Delta x$, is held fixed as $\\Delta x \\to 0$. This implies $\\Delta t \\propto \\Delta x$. Therefore, the ratio $\\Delta x/\\Delta t$ is a constant, and the leading term of the local truncation error is:\n$$\n\\tau_j^n = O(\\Delta x)\n$$\nAdditionally, since $\\Delta t \\propto \\Delta x$, the error is also $O(\\Delta t)$. Thus, the Lax-Friedrichs scheme is first-order accurate in both space and time. By the Lax Equivalence Theorem, for a consistent and stable scheme, the order of convergence of the global error is the same as the order of the local truncation error. Since the CFL condition $\\lvert a \\rvert \\Delta t / \\Delta x < 1$ ensures stability, the scheme will converge.\n\nTherefore, the theoretically predicted rate of convergence is $p=1$.\n\n### Part 2: Grid Refinement Study\n\nTo experimentally verify the theoretical order of convergence, a grid refinement study is performed. The methodology is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, we solve the problem on a sequence of four grids. The number of grid points is $N_k = N_0 \\cdot 2^k$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$. The corresponding grid spacing is $\\Delta x_k = L/N_k$.\n2.  The time step $\\Delta t_k$ for each grid is determined by fixing the CFL number, i.e., $\\Delta t_k = \\text{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x_k / \\lvert a \\rvert$.\n3.  The numerical solution $u_j^N$ is computed up to the final time $T$. A final, smaller time step is used if $T$ is not an integer multiple of $\\Delta t_k$ to ensure the total simulation time is exactly $T$.\n4.  The error is measured by comparing the numerical solution to the known exact solution, $u(x,T) = u_0(x - aT \\pmod L)$, using the discrete $L^2$-norm:\n    $$\n    e_k = \\left( \\Delta x_k \\sum_{j=0}^{N_k-1} | u_j^N(T) - u(x_j, T) |^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n    $$\n5.  If the method has a convergence rate of $p$, the error is expected to scale as $e_k \\approx C(\\Delta x_k)^p$ for some constant $C$. Taking the logarithm of this relation gives:\n    $$\n    \\log e_k \\approx \\log C + p \\log \\Delta x_k\n    $$\n    This is a linear relationship between $\\log e_k$ and $\\log \\Delta x_k$. The slope of this line is the order of convergence, $p$.\n6.  The experimental order of convergence is computed by performing a least-squares linear regression on the set of points $\\{(\\log \\Delta x_k, \\log e_k)\\}_{k=0}^3$ and finding the slope of the best-fit line.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Verification\n\nThe implemented program follows the design described in Part 2. It applies the Lax-Friedrichs scheme to each of the three test cases, performs the grid refinement study, and computes the experimental order of convergence. Based on the derivation in Part 1, the experimental order of convergence for each test case is expected to be approximately $1.0$. The final output of the program will list these computed orders.",

So the second term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\Delta x} \\left(-2(1-\\cos(\\theta))\\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1-\\cos(\\theta))\n$$\nCombining these, we find the amplification rate:\n$$\n\\lambda(\\theta) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1-\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}\\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nThe damping of a mode is governed by the real part of $\\lambda(\\theta)$, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\theta))$. A more negative value implies stronger damping. The mode-wise damping rate can be defined as $D(\\theta) = -\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\theta))$.\nFrom our expression for $\\lambda(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\theta)) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1-\\cos(\\theta))\n$$\nThus, the damping rate is:\n$$\nD(\\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1-\\cos(\\theta))\n$$\nTo find where the damping rate is maximized, we must find the maximum of the function $f(\\theta) = 1-\\cos(\\theta)$ over the domain $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi)$. The constants $\\alpha$ and $\\Delta x$ are positive. The function $\\cos(\\theta)$ has a minimum value of $-1$, which occurs at $\\theta = \\pm\\pi$. At these values, $f(\\theta)$ achieves its maximum value: $f(\\pm\\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nTherefore, the damping rate $D(\\theta)$ is maximized at $\\theta = \\pm\\pi$. This corresponds to the highest resolvable wavenumber on the grid, representing grid-scale oscillations (e.g., a pattern of alternating signs). The maximum damping occurs exactly at $\\theta=\\pi$ (and $\\theta=-\\pi$), which is consistent with the problem's statement that it occurs \"near $\\theta \\approx \\pi$\".\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the e-folding Smearing Length $N_e$\n\nA sharp jump discontinuity is composed of a wide spectrum of Fourier modes, including those with the highest wavenumbers. The smearing of the discontinuity by the numerical scheme is primarily due to the rapid damping of these high-wavenumber modes. The problem defines the \"e-folding smearing length\" $N_e$ based on the decay of the highest-wavenumber Fourier mode.\n\nAs established in Part 1, the highest-wavenumber mode resolvable on the grid corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$. The amplitude of this mode, $\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(t)$, evolves according to the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{d\\hat{u}_{\\pi}}{dt} = \\lambda(\\pi)\\hat{u}_{\\pi}$. The solution is $\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(t) = \\hat{u}_{\\pi}(0)\\exp(\\lambda(\\pi)t)$. The magnitude of the amplitude is $|\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(t)| = |\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(0)|\\exp(\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\pi))t)$.\n\nWe evaluate the real part of $\\lambda(\\theta)$ at $\\theta = \\pi$:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\pi)) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1-\\cos(\\pi)) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta x}(1 - (-1)) = -\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe e-folding condition states that the amplitude decreases by a factor of $\\exp(-1)$. Let $t_e$ be the time required for this decay.\n$$\n\\frac{|\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(t_e)|}{|\\hat{u}_{\\pi}(0)|} = \\exp(\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\pi))t_e) = \\exp(-1)\n$$\nThis implies $\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\pi))t_e = -1$. Substituting the value of $\\text{Re}(\\lambda(\\pi))$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\Delta x}\\right) t_e = -1 \\implies t_e = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the e-folding time for the highest-wavenumber mode.\n\nThe problem provides a physical link between this time and the smearing length $N_e$. The discontinuity is assumed to advect with the physical speed $a$. The time $t_e$ is the time it takes for the feature to travel a distance of $N_e \\Delta x$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\nt_e = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{N_e \\Delta x}{a}\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for the e-folding time $t_e$, we can solve for $N_e$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_e \\Delta x}{a} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nWe can cancel $\\Delta x$ from both sides and rearrange to find the closed-form expression for $N_e$:\n$$\nN_e = \\frac{a}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nThis expression gives the e-folding smearing length in units of grid cells, in terms of the physical advection speed $a$ and the numerical dissipation parameter $\\alpha$.",
