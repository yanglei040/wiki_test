            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Semi-discrete Symbol and Dispersion Relation**\n\nThe semi-discrete system is obtained by replacing the spatial derivative $u_x$ in the PDE $u_t = -u_x$ with the discrete operator $D_h u$, which we denote by $(\\partial_x u)_j$. The compact scheme gives a relation for this operator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\, (u_t)_{j-1} + (u_t)_j \\;=\\; -\\frac{1}{h} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} u_{j+1} + u_j - \\frac{5}{4} u_{j-1} \\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the Fourier ansatz $u_j(t) = \\hat{u}(t) \\exp(i \\theta j)$ into this equation. The time derivative is $(u_t)_j = \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} \\exp(i \\theta j)$. Substituting these forms into the semi-discrete equation and dividing by the common factor $\\exp(i \\theta j)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-i \\theta) + 1 \\right) = -\\frac{\\hat{u}}{h} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\exp(i \\theta) + 1 - \\frac{5}{4} \\exp(-i \\theta) \\right)\n$$\nThe semi-discrete symbol $s(\\theta)$ is defined by $\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = s(\\theta) \\hat{u}$. Solving for $s(\\theta)$:\n$$\ns(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{h} \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\exp(i \\theta) - \\frac{5}{4} \\exp(-i \\theta)}{1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-i \\theta)}\n$$\nTo find the real and imaginary parts, we use Euler's formula, $\\exp(i\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, and rationalize the denominator. The numerator becomes $N(\\theta) = 1 - \\cos\\theta + i\\frac{3}{2}\\sin\\theta$, and the denominator becomes $D(\\theta) = (1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta) - i\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta$.\nThe squared magnitude of the denominator is $|D(\\theta)|^2 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\cos\\theta$.\nAfter multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we find the real and imaginary parts of the numerator of the resulting fraction:\n$\\operatorname{Re}(N D^*) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\cos\\theta)^2$\n$\\operatorname{Im}(N D^*) = \\sin\\theta(2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos\\theta)$\nSo, the semi-discrete symbol is:\n$$\ns(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{h} \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1-\\cos\\theta)^2 + i\\sin\\theta(2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos\\theta)}{\\frac{5}{4} + \\cos\\theta} = -\\frac{1}{h} \\frac{(1-\\cos\\theta)^2 + i\\sin\\theta(8 + \\cos\\theta)}{5 + 4\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThe damping rate is $\\sigma(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Re}(s(\\theta))$ and the dispersion relation is $\\omega(\\theta) = -\\operatorname{Im}(s(\\theta))$.\n$$\n\\sigma(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{h} \\frac{(1-\\cos\\theta)^2}{5 + 4\\cos\\theta}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{h} \\frac{\\sin\\theta(8 + \\cos\\theta)}{5 + 4\\cos\\theta}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Fully Discrete Amplification Factor and Phase Error**\n\nFor a semi-discretization $\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = s(\\theta)\\hat{u}$, the application of the classical RK4 method results in the fully discrete amplification factor $G(\\theta; C) = g(z)$, where $z = \\Delta t s(\\theta)$ and $g(z)$ is the stability polynomial of RK4:\n$$\ng(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\frac{z^3}{3!} + \\frac{z^4}{4!}\n$$\nThe Courant number is $C = \\Delta t / h$, so $z = C h s(\\theta)$. The amplification factor is:\n$$\nG(\\theta; C) = 1 + C h s(\\theta) + \\frac{(C h s(\\theta))^2}{2} + \\frac{(C h s(\\theta))^3}{6} + \\frac{(C h s(\\theta))^4}{24}\n$$\nThe exact solution to the semi-discrete ODE over one time step $\\Delta t$ is $\\exp(s(\\theta)\\Delta t)$, with phase $\\arg(\\exp(s(\\theta)\\Delta t)) = -\\omega(\\theta)\\Delta t$. The numerical phase is $\\arg(G(\\theta; C))$. The phase error is the difference between the numerical phase and the exact semi-discrete phase. For a small argument $z$, the RK4 polynomial is a Taylor approximation of the exponential function: $g(z) = \\exp(z) - \\frac{z^5}{120} + O(z^6)$. The phase error arises from this truncation. For small $C$ and $\\theta$, the scheme is nearly non-dissipative and non-dispersive, with $s(\\theta) \\approx -i\\theta/h$, and $z \\approx -i C \\theta$. The phase error $\\Phi_{err}$ can be shown to be:\n$$\n\\Phi_{err} \\approx \\frac{(C\\theta)^5}{120}\n$$\nThe order of the phase error is $O(C^5 \\theta^5)$, i.e., fifth order in both $C$ and $\\theta$.\n\n**Part 3: CFL Limit $C_{\\max}$**\n\nLinear stability requires that $|G(\\theta; C)| \\le 1$ for all $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. This means that for a given $C$, the locus of points $z(\\theta) = C h s(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ must lie entirely inside the stability region of the RK4 method, $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{RK4}} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |g(z)| \\le 1\\}$. The CFL limit $C_{\\max}$ is the largest $C$ for which this condition holds.\nLet's analyze the locus of $H(\\theta) = h s(\\theta)$.\n$$\nH(\\theta) = -\\frac{(1-\\cos\\theta)^2}{5 + 4\\cos\\theta} - i\\frac{\\sin\\theta(8 + \\cos\\theta)}{5 + 4\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nAt $\\theta=\\pi$, we have $\\cos\\pi=-1$ and $\\sin\\pi=0$.\n$$\nH(\\pi) = -\\frac{(1-(-1))^2}{5 + 4(-1)} - i \\cdot 0 = -\\frac{4}{1} = -4\n$$\nThe locus of $H(\\theta)$ extends along the negative real axis to the point $-4$. The stability of the scheme is therefore constrained by the extent of the RK4 stability region along the negative real axis. For a real argument $z=x<0$, the stability condition is $|g(x)| \\le 1$. The left boundary of the stability interval on the real axis is the root $x^*$ of $1+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x^2}{6}+\\frac{x^3}{24} = 0$. Numerically, this root is $x^* \\approx -2.78528$.\nThe stability condition is that the point $z(\\pi) = C \\cdot H(\\pi) = -4C$ must be within the stability interval $[x^*, 0]$.\n$$\n-4C \\ge x^* \\implies C \\le \\frac{x^*}{-4}\n$$\nThe limiting value $C_{\\max}$ is obtained when equality holds:\n$$\nC_{\\max} = \\frac{-2.78528179...}{-4} = 0.69632044...\n$$\nA check of the full locus of $h s(\\theta)$ confirms that this point at $\\theta=\\pi$ is indeed the most restrictive one. Rounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nC_{\\max} \\approx 0.6963\n$$",

For the roots to be real, the discriminant must be non-negative. If so, the larger root $\\lambda_+$ is positive if its positive part overcomes the negative damping term $-\\frac{1}{2\\tau}$. This occurs if the term under the square root is greater than $\\frac{1}{\\tau^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau^2} - 4k^2c^2 + \\frac{k^2c^2\\Delta t^2}{\\tau^2} > \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\implies -4k^2c^2 + \\frac{k^2c^2\\Delta t^2}{\\tau^2} > 0\n$$\nAssuming $k,c \\neq 0$, we can divide by $k^2c^2$:\n$$\n-4 + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{\\tau^2} > 0 \\implies \\Delta t^2 > 4\\tau^2 \\implies \\Delta t > 2\\tau\n$$\nThe neutral-stability threshold, where the instability first appears, is at the boundary of this condition.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2\\tau\n$$\n\n### Strang Composition Analysis\nThe symmetric Strang composition is $G_{\\mathrm{Strang}}(\\Delta t) = \\exp(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} S) \\exp(\\Delta t H) \\exp(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} S)$. The BCH expansion for this symmetric form is:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(X+Y + \\frac{1}{24}[Y,[X,Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] + \\dots\\right)\n$$\nSetting $X = \\Delta t\\,S$ and $Y = \\Delta t\\,H$, the effective generator is:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{eff,Strang}} = S + H + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{24}\\left([H,[S,H]] - 2[S,[S,H]]\\right) + O(\\Delta t^4)\n$$\nCrucially, the $O(\\Delta t)$ error term, proportional to $[S,H]$, vanishes due to symmetry. The leading-order spurious growth mechanism found for the Lie-Trotter scheme is therefore eliminated, restoring stability at this order.\n\nThe critical time step for the Lie-Trotter composition is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2\\tau$.",
