The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and equations. The questions asked are precise, well-posed, and admit a unique, verifiable solution through established mathematical procedures. The problem is objective and free from ambiguity or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to derive the Fourier symbols, $\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta)$ and $\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta)$, and analyze their properties when used to discretize the linear advection equation.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of Fourier Symbols\n\nThe Fourier symbol $\\widehat{D}(\\theta)$ of a linear, shift-invariant difference operator $D$ is its eigenvalue corresponding to the discrete Fourier eigenfunction $v_{j}(\\theta) = \\exp(i j \\theta)$, where $\\theta = k \\Delta x$ is the dimensionless wavenumber, with $k$ being the physical wavenumber.\n\nFor the forward difference operator $D_{+}$, we apply it to $v_{j}(\\theta)$:\n$$\nD_{+} v_{j}(\\theta) = \\frac{v_{j+1}(\\theta) - v_{j}(\\theta)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\exp(i (j+1) \\theta) - \\exp(i j \\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(i j \\theta) = v_{j}(\\theta)$:\n$$\nD_{+} v_{j}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(i j \\theta) (\\exp(i \\theta) - 1)}{\\Delta x} = \\left(\\frac{\\exp(i \\theta) - 1}{\\Delta x}\\right) v_{j}(\\theta)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $D_{+} v_{j}(\\theta) = \\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta) v_{j}(\\theta)$, we identify the Fourier symbol for $D_{+}$ as:\n$$\n\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(i \\theta) - 1}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nFor the backward difference operator $D_{-}$, we perform the same procedure:\n$$\nD_{-} v_{j}(\\theta) = \\frac{v_{j}(\\theta) - v_{j-1}(\\theta)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\exp(i j \\theta) - \\exp(i (j-1) \\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(i j \\theta) = v_{j}(\\theta)$:\n$$\nD_{-} v_{j}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(i j \\theta) (1 - \\exp(-i \\theta))}{\\Delta x} = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-i \\theta)}{\\Delta x}\\right) v_{j}(\\theta)\n$$\nThus, the Fourier symbol for $D_{-}$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-i \\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: Stability Analysis of the Semi-discrete Scheme\n\nThe semi-discrete approximation to the advection equation is $\\partial_{t} u_{j}(t) + a\\, D u_{j}(t) = 0$. We analyze the evolution of a single Fourier mode by substituting $u_{j}(t) = \\hat{u}(\\theta, t) \\exp(i j \\theta)$ into this equation. The operator $\\partial_t$ acts only on $\\hat{u}(\\theta, t)$ and $D$ acts only on the spatial part $\\exp(i j \\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{u}(\\theta, t)}{dt} \\exp(i j \\theta) + a\\, \\hat{u}(\\theta, t) D \\exp(i j \\theta) = 0\n$$\nUsing the eigenvalue property $D \\exp(i j \\theta) = \\widehat{D}(\\theta) \\exp(i j \\theta)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{u}(\\theta, t)}{dt} \\exp(i j \\theta) + a\\, \\hat{u}(\\theta, t) \\widehat{D}(\\theta) \\exp(i j \\theta) = 0\n$$\nDividing by the non-zero term $\\exp(i j \\theta)$, we obtain an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the amplitude of the Fourier mode:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = -a \\widehat{D}(\\theta) \\hat{u}\n$$\nThe solution to this ODE is $\\hat{u}(\\theta, t) = \\hat{u}(\\theta, 0) \\exp(-a \\widehat{D}(\\theta) t)$. For the scheme to be stable, the amplitude of any mode must not grow unbounded in time, i.e., $|\\exp(-a \\widehat{D}(\\theta) t)| \\le 1$ for all $\\theta$ and for $t  0$. This requires the real part of the exponent to be non-positive:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(-a \\widehat{D}(\\theta)) \\le 0\n$$\nWe analyze this condition for $D=D_{+}$ and $D=D_{-}$. Let's express the symbols in terms of their real and imaginary parts using $\\exp(i\\phi) = \\cos(\\phi) + i\\sin(\\phi)$.\nFor $\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta) - 1}{\\Delta x} + i \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe stability condition is $\\text{Re}(-a \\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta)) = -a \\text{Re}(\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta)) = -a \\frac{\\cos(\\theta) - 1}{\\Delta x} = a \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\Delta x} \\le 0$. Since $\\Delta x  0$ and $1 - \\cos(\\theta) \\ge 0$ for all $\\theta$, this inequality holds if and only if $a \\le 0$. Thus, the forward difference scheme ($D_{+}$) is stable for left-propagating waves ($a \\le 0$). The term $a \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\Delta x}$ represents numerical dissipation, which damps the amplitude of the modes unless $\\theta=0$ (modulo $2\\pi$).\n\nFor $\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - (\\cos(\\theta) - i\\sin(\\theta))}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\Delta x} + i \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe stability condition is $\\text{Re}(-a \\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta)) = -a \\text{Re}(\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta)) = -a \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\Delta x} \\le 0$. This inequality holds if and only if $-a \\le 0$, or $a \\ge 0$. Thus, the backward difference scheme ($D_{-}$) is stable for right-propagating waves ($a \\ge 0$). This scheme is also dissipative.\n\nThis outcome is the core of the upwinding principle: for stability, the one-sided difference must be taken from the direction from which the wave is coming (\"upwind\").\n\n#### Part 3: Analysis of Numerical Dispersion and Phase Speed\n\nThe solution for a Fourier mode is $u_j(t) = \\hat{u}(0) \\exp(-a t \\text{Re}(\\widehat{D})) \\exp(i (j\\theta - a t \\text{Im}(\\widehat{D})))$. The phase of the wave is $j\\theta - a t \\text{Im}(\\widehat{D}(\\theta))$. By writing $j\\theta = (j\\Delta x)(\\theta/\\Delta x) = kx_j$, the phase can be written as $k x_j - \\omega_{num} t$, where $\\omega_{num} = a \\text{Im}(\\widehat{D}(\\theta))$. The numerical phase speed is $c_{num}(\\theta) = \\omega_{num}/k = a \\text{Im}(\\widehat{D}(\\theta)) / (\\theta/\\Delta x)$.\n\nFor both $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$, the imaginary part of the symbol is the same:\n$$\n\\text{Im}(\\widehat{D_{+}}(\\theta)) = \\text{Im}(\\widehat{D_{-}}(\\theta)) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nTherefore, the numerical phase speed for both schemes is:\n$$\nc_{num}(\\theta) = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)/\\Delta x}{\\theta/\\Delta x} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}\n$$\nThe exact phase speed for the PDE $\\partial_{t} u + a\\,\\partial_{x} u = 0$ is $c_{exact} = a$.\n\nWe compare $c_{num}$ with $c_{exact}$ for $0  \\theta  \\pi$. In this interval, it is a known mathematical inequality that $0  \\sin(\\theta)/\\theta  1$. Let's analyze the stable cases:\n1.  **Stable case for $D_{-}$**: $a  0$. We compare $c_{num} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}$ with $c_{exact} = a$. Since $a  0$ and $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}  1$, it follows that $a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}  a$. Thus, $c_{num}  c_{exact}$. The numerical phase speed **underestimates** the exact phase speed.\n2.  **Stable case for $D_{+}$**: $a  0$. We again compare $c_{num} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}$ with $c_{exact} = a$. Since $a  0$, multiplying the inequality $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}  1$ by $a$ reverses the sign: $a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}  a$. Thus, $c_{num}  c_{exact}$. The numerical phase speed **overestimates** the exact phase speed.\n\nWhile the algebraic value of the phase speed is overestimated for $a0$, it is crucial to note that the magnitude of the speed is always underestimated in both stable cases. $|c_{num}| = |a \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}| = |a| \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}  |a| = |c_{exact}|$. This means that for all wavenumbers $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$, the numerical waves travel slower than the true waves, a phenomenon known as phase lag. This is a form of numerical dispersion, as the speed depends on the wavenumber $\\theta$.",

Using Euler's formula, $e^{i\\phi} + e^{-i\\phi} = 2\\cos(\\phi)$, we can group the exponential terms:\n$$\ng = 1 + \\frac{r}{12} \\left( -(e^{i 2\\theta} + e^{-i 2\\theta}) + 16(e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}) - 30 \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{r}{12} \\left( -2\\cos(2\\theta) + 32\\cos(\\theta) - 30 \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression further, we use the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1$:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{r}{12} \\left( -2(2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1) + 32\\cos(\\theta) - 30 \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{r}{12} \\left( -4\\cos^2(\\theta) + 2 + 32\\cos(\\theta) - 30 \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{r}{12} \\left( -4\\cos^2(\\theta) + 32\\cos(\\theta) - 28 \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $-4$ from the parenthesis:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{4r}{12} \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{r}{3} \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\right)\n$$\nThe amplification factor $g(\\theta)$ is a real-valued function. The stability condition is $|g(\\theta)| \\le 1$, which for a real quantity a translates to $-1 \\le a \\le 1$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - \\frac{r}{3} \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\right) \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality can be split into two parts. Subtracting $1$ from all parts gives:\n$$\n-2 \\le - \\frac{r}{3} \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\right) \\le 0\n$$\nSince $r  0$, we can multiply by $-3/r$ and reverse the inequalities:\n$$\n\\frac{6}{r} \\ge \\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\ge 0\n$$\nLet's analyze the polynomial $P(x) = x^2 - 8x + 7$ for $x = \\cos(\\theta)$, where $x \\in [-1, 1]$. We can factor this polynomial as $P(x) = (x-1)(x-7)$.\nSince $x \\le 1$, the term $(x-1) \\le 0$. Since $x \\le 1  7$, the term $(x-7)  0$. Therefore, their product $P(x) = (x-1)(x-7)$ is greater than or equal to $0$ for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe right side of the inequality, $\\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\ge 0$, is thus always satisfied for any $\\theta$.\n\nWe are left with the condition:\n$$\n\\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 7 \\le \\frac{6}{r}\n$$\nTo ensure stability for all Fourier modes, this inequality must hold for the maximum possible value of the expression on the left-hand side. The function $P(x) = x^2 - 8x + 7$ has its vertex at $x = -(-8)/(2 \\cdot 1) = 4$, which is outside the interval $[-1, 1]$. On the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$, $P(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function. Thus, its maximum value on this interval occurs at $x = -1$.\nLet's evaluate $P(-1)$:\n$$\nP(-1) = (-1)^2 - 8(-1) + 7 = 1 + 8 + 7 = 16\n$$\nThis maximum corresponds to the highest frequency modes on the grid, where $\\theta = \\pm \\pi$, so $\\cos(\\theta) = -1$.\nSubstituting this maximum value into the stability inequality gives the most restrictive condition on $r$:\n$$\n16 \\le \\frac{6}{r}\n$$\nSince $r  0$, we can rearrange the inequality to solve for $r$:\n$$\n16r \\le 6\n$$\n$$\nr \\le \\frac{6}{16}\n$$\n$$\nr \\le \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nThe largest admissible value of $r$ for which the scheme is stable for all Fourier modes is therefore $\\frac{3}{8}$.",
