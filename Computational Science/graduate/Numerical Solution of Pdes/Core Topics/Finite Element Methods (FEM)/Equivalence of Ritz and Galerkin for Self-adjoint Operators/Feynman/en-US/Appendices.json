Therefore, its solution must also be $x_1 = \\frac{1}{9}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\n    *   **Equivalence of Galerkin and Ritz Methods**:\n        The equivalence of the two methods for this problem is a direct consequence of the properties of the governing operator and the associated bilinear form. The differential operator $L=-d^2/dx^2$ with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions is self-adjoint with respect to the $L^2(0,1)$ inner product. This self-adjointness implies that the associated bilinear form $a(u,v) = \\int_0^1 u'(x)v'(x) \\,dx$ is symmetric, i.e., $a(u,v) = a(v,u)$.\n\n        The Galerkin method requires the residual to be orthogonal to the trial space $V_h$, which for this problem translates to finding $u_h \\in V_h$ such that $a(u_h, v_h) = F(v_h)$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. By choosing the basis functions $\\phi_i$ as test functions $v_h$, this yields the linear system $\\sum_j x_j a(\\phi_j, \\phi_i) = F(\\phi_i)$, which is $Kx=f$.\n\n        The Ritz method seeks to minimize the quadratic energy functional $J(v) = \\frac{1}{2}a(v,v) - F(v)$ over the space $V_h$. Representing $v \\in V_h$ as $v = \\sum x_i \\phi_i$, the functional becomes a quadratic function of the coefficients $x$, $J(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^T K x - x^T f$. The necessary condition for a minimum of this convex functional is that its gradient with respect to $x$ is zero: $\\nabla J(x) = 0$. The gradient is given by $\\nabla J(x) = Kx - f$. Thus, the minimization problem is equivalent to solving the linear system $Kx=f$.\n\n        In summary, because the bilinear form is symmetric (a consequence of the operator being self-adjoint), the optimality condition for the Ritz energy minimization principle is identical to the orthogonality condition of the Galerkin method. Both methods reduce to solving the same symmetric linear system $Kx=f$.",

Thus, we must solve for $c$ in the equation:\n$$\na(c\\,\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\ell(\\varphi)\n$$\nBy linearity of the arguments of the bilinear form, this becomes:\n$$\nc\\,a(\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\ell(\\varphi)\n$$\nWe compute the terms $a(\\varphi, \\varphi)$ and $\\ell(\\varphi)$.\nThe derivative of the basis function is $\\varphi'(x) = \\pi\\cos(\\pi x)$.\n$$\na(\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\varphi'(x))^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\pi \\cos(\\pi x))^2 dx = \\pi^2 \\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (1 + \\cos(2\\pi x)) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x + \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi x)}{2\\pi} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, $a(\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\pi^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}$.\n\nNext, we compute the linear functional $\\ell(\\varphi)$ with $f(x)=2$:\n$$\n\\ell(\\varphi) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\varphi(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 2 \\sin(\\pi x) dx = 2 \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x)}{\\pi} \\right]_{0}^{1} = -\\frac{2}{\\pi}(\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{2}{\\pi}(-1 - 1) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Galerkin equation $c\\,a(\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\ell(\\varphi)$:\n$$\nc \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\implies c = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3}\n$$\nThe Galerkin solution is therefore $u_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3} \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\n**2. The Ritz Method Construction**\n\nThe Ritz method seeks to find the function in $V_h$ that minimizes the energy functional $J(v) = \\frac{1}{2}a(v,v) - \\ell(v)$. For any $v_h \\in V_h$, we can write $v_h(x) = c\\,\\varphi(x)$. Substituting this into the functional gives a function of the coefficient $c$:\n$$\nJ(c) = J(c\\,\\varphi) = \\frac{1}{2} a(c\\,\\varphi, c\\,\\varphi) - \\ell(c\\,\\varphi) = \\frac{c^2}{2} a(\\varphi, \\varphi) - c\\,\\ell(\\varphi)\n$$\nWe have already computed $a(\\varphi, \\varphi) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}$ and $\\ell(\\varphi) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\nJ(c) = \\frac{c^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\right) - c \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} c^2 - \\frac{4}{\\pi} c\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $c$, and its minimum can be found by setting its derivative with respect to $c$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} c^2 - \\frac{4}{\\pi} c \\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} c - \\frac{4}{\\pi} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $c$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} c = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\implies c = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3}\n$$\nThis gives the same coefficient as the Galerkin method. The Ritz solution is also $u_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3} \\sin(\\pi x)$. This verifies that for this problem, the two methods produce the same discrete solution.\n\n**3. Exact Solution**\n\nWe find the exact solution $u(x)$ by integrating the differential equation $-u''(x) = 2$ twice.\nFirst integration: $-u'(x) = 2x + C_1$.\nSecond integration: $u(x) = -x^2 - C_1 x + C_2$.\nWe use the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n$u(0) = 0 \\implies -0^2 - C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n$u(1) = 0 \\implies -1^2 - C_1(1) + 0 = 0 \\implies -1 - C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -1$.\nSubstituting the constants back, the exact solution is $u(x) = -x^2 - (-1)x = x - x^2 = x(1-x)$.\n\n**4. Energy Norm Error**\n\nWe need to compute $\\|u - u_h\\|_E = \\sqrt{a(u - u_h, u - u_h)}$. A key property that follows from the Galerkin formulation for a symmetric bilinear form is the orthogonality of the error to the subspace, i.e., $a(u - u_h, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. This implies the Pythagorean-like relation:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_E^2 = \\|u_h\\|_E^2 + \\|u - u_h\\|_E^2\n$$\nTherefore, the squared error norm is given by:\n$$\n\\|u - u_h\\|_E^2 = \\|u\\|_E^2 - \\|u_h\\|_E^2\n$$\nWe compute the energy norms of $u$ and $u_h$ separately.\nFor the exact solution $u(x) = x - x^2$, the derivative is $u'(x) = 1 - 2x$.\n$$\n\\|u\\|_E^2 = a(u,u) = \\int_{0}^{1} (u'(x))^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (1-2x)^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (1 - 4x + 4x^2) dx = \\left[ x - 2x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x^3 \\right]_0^1 = 1 - 2 + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nFor the approximate solution $u_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3} \\sin(\\pi x)$, the derivative is $u'_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\cos(\\pi x)$.\n$$\n\\|u_h\\|_E^2 = a(u_h, u_h) = \\int_{0}^{1} (u'_h(x))^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\cos(\\pi x)\\right)^2 dx = \\frac{64}{\\pi^4} \\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx\n$$\nAs calculated before, $\\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\n\\|u_h\\|_E^2 = \\frac{64}{\\pi^4} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}\n$$\nNow we can compute the squared error norm:\n$$\n\\|u - u_h\\|_E^2 = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}\n$$\nThe energy norm of the error is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\|u - u_h\\|_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}}\n$$\n\n**5. Justification of Equivalence and Error Bounds**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the operator $A u = -u''$ is self-adjoint. This property ensures that the corresponding bilinear form $a(u,v)=\\int_0^1 u'v' dx$, derived via integration by parts, is symmetric: $a(u,v) = a(v,u)$. For such symmetric, positive-definite problems, the Galerkin and Ritz methods are equivalent.\n\nThe Galerkin method finds a unique $u_h \\in V_h$ that satisfies the Galerkin orthogonality condition: $a(u-u_h, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. In the Hilbert space $V$ with the inner product defined by $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, this means that $u_h$ is the orthogonal projection of the exact solution $u$ onto the subspace $V_h$. A fundamental property of orthogonal projections is that they represent the best approximation from the subspace. That is, $\\|u-u_h\\|_E = \\min_{v_h \\in V_h} \\|u-v_h\\|_E$.\n\nThe Ritz method finds a unique $u_h \\in V_h$ that minimizes the functional $J(v_h) = \\frac{1}{2}a(v_h, v_h) - \\ell(v_h)$. We can show this is equivalent to finding the best approximation. Consider the squared error $\\|u - v_h\\|_E^2$:\n$$\n\\|u - v_h\\|_E^2 = a(u-v_h, u-v_h) = a(u,u) - 2a(u,v_h) + a(v_h,v_h)\n$$\nSince $u$ is the exact solution, it satisfies the weak formulation $a(u,v) = \\ell(v)$ for all $v \\in V$. As $V_h \\subset V$, this holds for $v_h$: $a(u,v_h) = \\ell(v_h)$. Substituting this into the error expression:\n$$\n\\|u - v_h\\|_E^2 = a(u,u) - 2\\ell(v_h) + a(v_h,v_h)\n$$\nTo minimize $\\|u - v_h\\|_E^2$ over $v_h \\in V_h$, we must minimize the terms that depend on $v_h$. Since $a(u,u)$ is a constant with respect to $v_h$, this is equivalent to minimizing $a(v_h,v_h) - 2\\ell(v_h)$, which is in turn equivalent to minimizing $\\frac{1}{2}(a(v_h,v_h) - 2\\ell(v_h)) = J(v_h)$.\n\nTherefore, both methods are different formulations for finding the same unique element $u_h \\in V_h$: the orthogonal projection of $u$ onto $V_h$ with respect to the energy inner product $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$. Since they produce the same solution $u_h$, the resulting error $u-u_h$ and any standard error estimate, such as Céa's Lemma ($\\|u-u_h\\|_E \\le \\inf_{v_h \\in V_h} \\|u-v_h\\|_E$ for SPD problems), are identical. This equivalence is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the bilinear form, which originates from the self-adjointness of the underlying differential operator.",

It is self-contained, scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and serves as a canonical illustration of fundamental principles in numerical analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\n**2.1. Weak Formulation**\nThe eigenvalue problem is $-u'' = \\lambda u$ in $(0,1)$ with $u(0)=u(1)=0$. To derive the weak form, we multiply by a test function $v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$ and integrate over the domain:\n$$-\\int_{0}^{1} u''(x)v(x) \\,dx = \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} u(x)v(x) \\,dx$$\nIntegrating the left-hand side by parts yields:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\,dx - [u'(x)v(x)]_{0}^{1} = \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} u(x)v(x) \\,dx$$\nSince $v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$, we have $v(0)=v(1)=0$, so the boundary term $[u'(x)v(x)]_{0}^{1}$ vanishes. Using the given definitions of the bilinear forms, the weak formulation of the problem is:\nFind $(\\lambda, u) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$, with $u \\neq 0$, such that\n$$a(u,v) = \\lambda m(u,v) \\quad \\forall v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$$\n\n**2.2. Equivalence of Rayleigh–Ritz and Galerkin Methods**\nThe operator $L = -\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is self-adjoint with respect to the $L^2$ inner product $m(u,v)$. This is verifiable as $a(u,v)$ is symmetric. For such self-adjoint and positive-definite operators, the Rayleigh–Ritz and Galerkin methods are equivalent.\n\n-   **Rayleigh–Ritz Method:** This variational method seeks to find the stationary values of the Rayleigh quotient, $R(u) = \\frac{a(u,u)}{m(u,u)}$, over the finite-dimensional subspace $V_h$. Let $u_h(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_j \\phi_j(x)$ be an arbitrary function in $V_h$, with its coefficients represented by the vector $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\end{pmatrix}^T$. The Rayleigh quotient becomes a function of $\\mathbf{c}$:\n    $$R(u_h) = \\frac{a(\\sum_i c_i \\phi_i, \\sum_j c_j \\phi_j)}{m(\\sum_i c_i \\phi_i, \\sum_j c_j \\phi_j)} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j c_i c_j a(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)}{\\sum_i \\sum_j c_i c_j m(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)} = \\frac{\\mathbf{c}^T K \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{c}^T M \\mathbf{c}}$$\n    Finding the stationary values of $R(u_h)$ with respect to the coefficients $c_k$ ($\\nabla_{\\mathbf{c}} R = 0$) leads to the generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem $K\\mathbf{c} = \\lambda_h M\\mathbf{c}$.\n\n-   **Galerkin Method:** This projection method seeks an approximate solution $(\\lambda_h, u_h) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times V_h$ that satisfies the weak formulation on the subspace $V_h$:\n    $$a(u_h, v_h) = \\lambda_h m(u_h, v_h) \\quad \\forall v_h \\in V_h$$\n    We substitute $u_h = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_j \\phi_j$. Since $\\{\\phi_i\\}$ forms a basis for $V_h$, it is sufficient to require the equation to hold for each basis function $v_h = \\phi_i$ ($i=1, 2$):\n    $$a\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_j \\phi_j, \\phi_i\\right) = \\lambda_h m\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_j \\phi_j, \\phi_i\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2$$\n    By the linearity of the bilinear forms, we get:\n    $$\\sum_{j=1}^{2} a(\\phi_j, \\phi_i) c_j = \\lambda_h \\sum_{j=1}^{2} m(\\phi_j, \\phi_i) c_j \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2$$\n    Recognizing that $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$ and $M_{ij} = m(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$, and accounting for the symmetry of the forms ($K_{ij}=K_{ji}$, $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$), this system of equations can be written in matrix form as $K\\mathbf{c} = \\lambda_h M\\mathbf{c}$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the identical discrete problem. The equivalence is a direct consequence of the fact that the weak formulation (Galerkin's starting point) represents the Euler-Lagrange equations for the Rayleigh quotient functional (Ritz's starting point) when the operator is self-adjoint.\n\n**2.3.
