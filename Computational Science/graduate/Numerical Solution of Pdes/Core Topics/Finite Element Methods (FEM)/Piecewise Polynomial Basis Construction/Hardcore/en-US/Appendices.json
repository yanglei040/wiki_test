On each element, a piecewise polynomial basis of degree at most $p$ is used, i.e., the local trial/test space is $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, the space of polynomials of degree at most $p$ on $K$. For the purpose of assembling element-wise contributions that require exact integration of basis functions in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, you are asked to construct a moment-fitting quadrature rule on $K$ that integrates exactly every polynomial in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, and to analyze the minimal number of quadrature points needed per element.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational bases:\n- The definition of exactness of a quadrature rule: a quadrature rule with nodes $\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}\\subset K$ and weights $\\{w_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ integrates a function $q$ exactly if $\\int_{K} q(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}\\,q(x_{i})$.\n- The definition of the moment-fitting condition: exactness for all polynomials in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$ means the quadrature must satisfy the above identity for every $q\\in\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$.\n- The existence of families of orthogonal polynomials on $[-1,1]$ with respect to the unit weight (the Legendre polynomials), with the well-tested properties of orthogonality and real, simple roots strictly inside $(-1,1)$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed question in the field of numerical analysis, specifically concerning the theory of numerical integration required for finite element methods. The premises are scientifically sound, and the terminology is precise.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested:\n1.  Formulation of the moment-fitting equations and construction of a suitable quadrature rule.\n2.  Derivation of a necessary lower bound on the number of quadrature points and determination of the minimal number.\n3.  The final expression for this minimal number.\n\nLet $K = [-1, 1]$ be the reference element. We seek a quadrature rule with $n$ nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ that is exact for all polynomials in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, the space of polynomials of degree at most $p$. This means the rule must satisfy\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} q(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i q(x_i) \\quad \\forall q \\in \\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)\n$$\n\n**1. Formulation and Construction of the Quadrature Rule**\n\nTo enforce exactness for the entire space $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, it is necessary and sufficient to enforce it for a basis of this space. A convenient basis for this formulation is the monomial basis $\\{x^k\\}_{k=0}^{p}$. This leads to a system of $p+1$ nonlinear equations, known as the moment-fitting equations, for the $2n$ unknowns ($n$ nodes $x_i$ and $n$ weights $w_i$):\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} x^k \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^k \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\ldots, p\n$$\n\nThe problem statement directs us to use the properties of orthogonal polynomials on $[-1, 1]$, which are the Legendre polynomials, denoted here by $L_k(x)$ for degree $k$. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the unit weight function, i.e., $\\int_{-1}^{1} L_j(x) L_k(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = c_k \\delta_{jk}$ for some normalization constants $c_k > 0$.\n\nWe construct an $n$-point quadrature rule. The key idea of Gaussian quadrature is to choose the nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ as the $n$ roots of the Legendre polynomial of degree $n$, $L_n(x)$. From the provided properties, these roots are real, distinct, and lie strictly within the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nWith these $n$ nodes fixed, we determine the $n$ weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ by requiring the rule to be exact for polynomials of degree up to $n-1$. This gives a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ weights:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^k = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^k \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix form as $V \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{m}$, where $V$ is the Vandermonde matrix with entries $V_{jk} = x_k^j$ for $j,k \\in \\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of weights, and $\\mathbf{m}$ is the vector of moments $\\int_{-1}^{1} x^j \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Since the nodes $x_i$ (the roots of $L_n(x)$) are distinct, the Vandermonde matrix is non-singular, guaranteeing a unique solution for the weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$.\n\nNow, we establish the degree of exactness of this constructed rule. Let $q(x)$ be any polynomial of degree at most $2n-1$. We can perform polynomial division of $q(x)$ by the Legendre polynomial $L_n(x)$, which has degree $n$. This gives:\n$$\nq(x) = s(x) L_n(x) + r(x)\n$$\nwhere the quotient $s(x)$ and remainder $r(x)$ are polynomials of degree at most $n-1$.\n\nIntegrating $q(x)$ over $K$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} q(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} s(x) L_n(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe Legendre polynomial $L_n(x)$ is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree less than $n$. Since $\\deg(s) \\le n-1$, $s(x)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $\\{L_0(x), \\ldots, L_{n-1}(x)\\}$. By the property of orthogonality, the first integral on the right-hand side is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} s(x) L_n(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nThus, we have $\\int_{-1}^{1} q(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$.\n\nNext, we apply the quadrature rule to $q(x)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i q(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\left( s(x_i) L_n(x_i) + r(x_i) \\right)\n$$\nBy construction, the nodes $x_i$ are the roots of $L_n(x)$, so $L_n(x_i) = 0$ for all $i = 1, \\ldots, n$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i q(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i r(x_i)\n$$\nSince $\\deg(r) \\le n-1$, and the rule was constructed to be exact for all polynomials in $\\mathbb{P}_{n-1}(K)$, we have:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i r(x_i) = \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nCombining our findings, we see that for any polynomial $q(x)$ of degree at most $2n-1$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} q(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i r(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i q(x_i)\n$$\nThis proves that the constructed $n$-point rule (the Gaussian quadrature rule) has a degree of exactness of $2n-1$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Minimal Number of Quadrature Points**\n\nFirst, we derive a necessary lower bound on $n$. The problem requires the quadrature rule to be exact for all polynomials in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$. This means the degree of exactness of the rule must be at least $p$. Let us establish the maximum possible degree of exactness for any $n$-point rule. Consider a polynomial $q(x)$ of degree $2n$ constructed as follows:\n$$\nq(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (x-x_i)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are the nodes of our arbitrary $n$-point rule. The degree of $q(x)$ is $2n$. Since $q(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$ except at the nodes, its integral over $K$ is strictly positive:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} q(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x > 0\n$$\nHowever, applying the quadrature rule to $q(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i q(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSince the integral and the quadrature sum do not match, no $n$-point rule can be exact for this polynomial of degree $2n$. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of exactness for any $n$-point rule is $2n-1$.\n\nFor our quadrature rule to be exact for all polynomials in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$, its degree of exactness, $2n-1$ at best, must be greater than or equal to $p$:\n$$\n2n - 1 \\ge p\n$$\nThis yields a necessary condition on the number of points $n$:\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{p+1}{2}\n$$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the number of quadrature points must satisfy:\n$$\nn \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{p+1}{2} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nThis establishes a necessary lower bound on $n$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that for any integer $n$, we can construct a Gaussian quadrature rule with $n$ points that has a degree of exactness of $2n-1$. To satisfy the problem's requirement (exactness on $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$), we need to choose $n$ such that $2n-1 \\ge p$. The smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality is precisely $n = \\lceil \\frac{p+1}{2} \\rceil$.\n\nSince this number of points is both necessary (from the lower bound analysis) and sufficient (from the existence of Gaussian quadrature), it is the minimal number of quadrature points required.\n\n**3. Final Expression**\n\nThe minimal number of quadrature points per element, $n_{min}$, needed to integrate exactly every polynomial in $\\mathbb{P}_{p}(K)$ is given by the smallest integer $n$ satisfying $n \\ge \\frac{p+1}{2}$. This is expressed using the ceiling function.\nThe final result is an analytic expression for $n_{min}$ in terms of the polynomial degree $p$.\n$$\nn_{min}(p) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{p+1}{2} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nFor instance, for linear elements ($p=1$), we need $n_{min} = \\lceil \\frac{1+1}{2} \\rceil = 1$ point. For quadratic elements ($p=2$), we need $n_{min} = \\lceil \\frac{2+1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil = 2$ points. For cubic elements ($p=3$), we need $n_{min} = \\lceil \\frac{3+1}{2} \\rceil = 2$ points. This aligns with the theory of Gaussian quadrature.",

The problem is well-defined within the context of the Finite Element Method for elliptic PDEs. All necessary information is provided: the governing equation, the element geometry, the basis functions, and the diffusion tensor. The concepts are scientifically sound and the objective is clear. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by defining the problem specifics. The domain is the triangle $T$ with vertices $v_1=(0,0)$, $v_2=(2,0)$, and $v_3=(1,1)$. The basis consists of piecewise linear (P1) Lagrange shape functions $\\{\\varphi_i\\}_{i=1}^3$ associated with these vertices. A linear function on the plane has the form $\\varphi(x,y) = c_1 + c_2x + c_3y$. The basis function $\\varphi_i$ is defined by the condition $\\varphi_i(v_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nWe construct the three basis functions:\nFor $\\varphi_1(x,y)$ corresponding to $v_1=(0,0)$:\n$\\varphi_1(0,0) = c_1 = 1$\n$\\varphi_1(2,0) = c_1 + 2c_2 = 0 \\implies 1 + 2c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = -1/2$\n$\\varphi_1(1,1) = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 \\implies 1 - 1/2 + c_3 = 0 \\implies c_3 = -1/2$\nThus, $\\varphi_1(x,y) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}y$. The gradient is $\\nabla \\varphi_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $\\varphi_2(x,y)$ corresponding to $v_2=(2,0)$:\n$\\varphi_2(0,0) = c_1 = 0$\n$\\varphi_2(2,0) = c_1 + 2c_2 = 1 \\implies 2c_2 = 1 \\implies c_2 = 1/2$\n$\\varphi_2(1,1) = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 \\implies 1/2 + c_3 = 0 \\implies c_3 = -1/2$\nThus, $\\varphi_2(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}y$.

The gradient is $\\nabla \\varphi_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThese functions are the barycentric coordinates of the triangle $T$. A point $(x,y) \\in T$ is a convex combination of the vertices, so the barycentric coordinates are non-negative.

The diffusion tensor is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\eta \\end{pmatrix}$.

For an isotropic medium ($A=I$), this corresponds to the requirement that the triangle be non-obtuse (all angles $\\le \\pi/2$). For an anisotropic medium, the condition is that the triangle must be non-obtuse in the metric induced by the diffusion tensor. This is equivalent to requiring that the triangle formed by transforming the vertices as $v'_i = A^{-1/2}v_i$ is non-obtuse. The condition $\\nabla\\varphi_i^\\top A \\nabla\\varphi_j \\le 0$ means the vectors $\\nabla\\varphi_i$ and $\\nabla\\varphi_j$ are $A$-obtuse.\n\nThe conditions for the discrete maximum principle are that all off-diagonal entries are non-positive:\n1. $K_{12} \\le 0 \\implies \\frac{\\eta-1}{4} \\le 0 \\implies \\eta - 1 \\le 0 \\implies \\eta \\le 1$.\n2. $K_{13} \\le 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\eta}{2} \\le 0 \\implies \\eta \\ge 0$.\n3. $K_{23} \\le 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\eta}{2} \\le 0 \\implies \\eta \\ge 0$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\eta > 0$. The second and third conditions are therefore satisfied for any valid $\\eta$. The only restrictive condition is the first one, $\\eta \\le 1$.\nCombining the given condition $\\eta > 0$ with our derived condition $\\eta \\le 1$, we find that the set of all possible values for $\\eta$ that satisfy the non-positive off-diagonal requirement is the interval $(0, 1]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the supremum of the parameter $\\eta$. The supremum of the set $(0, 1]$ is the least upper bound, which is $1$.",

Thus, $v_e'(x)$ is an odd function and $v_o'(x)$ is an even function.\n\nThe bilinear form is $a_h(u,v) = \\int_{-1}^1 \\left( a(x)\\, u'(x)\\, v'(x) + c(x)\\, u(x)\\, v(x) \\right)\\, dx$. The coefficients $a(x)$ and $c(x)$ are given to be even functions. Let us evaluate $a_h(v_e, v_o)$. The integrand is $I(x) = a(x) v_e'(x) v_o'(x) + c(x) v_e(x) v_o(x)$.\n- The term $v_e(x) v_o(x)$ is a product of an even and an odd function, which is odd. Since $c(x)$ is even, the product $c(x) v_e(x) v_o(x)$ is odd.\n- The term $v_e'(x) v_o'(x)$ is a product of an odd and an even function, which is odd. Since $a(x)$ is even, the product $a(x) v_e'(x) v_o'(x)$ is odd.\n- The sum of two odd functions is odd, so the integrand $I(x)$ is an odd function.\n- The integral of any odd function over the symmetric domain $[-1,1]$ is identically zero.\nTherefore, we have the crucial orthogonality property:\n$$a_h(v_e, v_o) = 0 \\quad \\forall v_e \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}, \\forall v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$$\nThis means the even and odd subspaces are orthogonal with respect to the energy inner product defined by $a_h(\\cdot, \\cdot)$.\n\nSimilarly, for the linear functional $\\ell_f(v) = \\int_{-1}^1 f(x) v(x) dx$:\n- If $f(x)$ is even and $v_o(x) \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$, the integrand $f(x) v_o(x)$ is odd, so $\\ell_f(v_o) = 0$.\n- If $f(x)$ is odd and $v_e(x) \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$, the integrand $f(x) v_e(x)$ is odd, so $\\ell_f(v_e) = 0$.\n\nNow we analyze the discrete problem: Find $u_h \\in V_h$ such that $a_h(u_h, v_h) = \\ell_f(v_h)$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. We can uniquely decompose the solution $u_h = u_h^{\\mathrm{even}} + u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ where $u_h^{\\mathrm{even}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ and $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. By choosing test functions from the even and odd subspaces separately, the problem decouples into two independent subproblems:\n1. Find $u_h^{\\mathrm{even}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ such that $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{even}}, v_e) = \\ell_f(v_e)$ for all $v_e \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$.\n2. Find $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ such that $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, v_o) = \\ell_f(v_o)$ for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on this framework.\n\n**A. In the elliptic problem with $f$ even, assembling and solving in $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ yields the same finite element solution as assembling in $V_h$ and then projecting onto $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$, while reducing the number of global degrees of freedom by approximately a factor of $2$ (up to an $O(1)$ correction due to the $x=0$ node). In the parity-adapted basis, the stiffness and load matrices are block-diagonal with respect to the even/odd split.**\n\nIf $f$ is an even function, then $\\ell_f(v_o) = 0$ for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. The second subproblem becomes: Find $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ such that $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, v_o) = 0$ for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. Choosing $v_o = u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$, we get $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}) = 0$. The bilinear form $a_h(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is coercive on $V_h \\subset H_0^1(\\Omega)$, meaning $a_h(v,v) \\ge C\\|v\\|_{H^1}^2$ for some $C > 0$. Thus, $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}) = 0$ implies $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} = 0$.\nThe full solution is therefore $u_h = u_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$, which is found by solving the first subproblem in $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$. This is exactly what \"assembling and solving in $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$\" means. As the full solution $u_h$ already lies in $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$, projecting it onto $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ changes nothing. The dimension of $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ is approximately half that of $V_h$, confirming the reduction in degrees of freedom. The \"parity-adapted basis\" partitions the basis into even and odd functions. Due to the orthogonality property $a_h(v_e, v_o)=0$, the stiffness matrix assembled in this basis will be block diagonal $\\begin{pmatrix} K_{ee} & 0 \\\\ 0 & K_{oo} \\end{pmatrix}$. The load vector $b_i = \\ell_f(\\psi_i)$ will have zero entries for all odd basis functions $\\psi_i$, giving a block structure $\\begin{pmatrix} b_e \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to a block-diagonal system.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the elliptic problem with $f$ even, if one assembles and solves in the odd subspace $V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$, the unique Galerkin solution is $u_h \\equiv 0$.**\n\nThis refers to solving the second subproblem described above: Find $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ such that $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, v_o) = \\ell_f(v_o)$ for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. As established in the analysis for option A, when $f$ is even, the right-hand side $\\ell_f(v_o)$ is zero for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. The problem reduces to $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, v_o) = 0$. By coercivity of $a_h(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, the only solution is $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}} = 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For the elliptic problem on a symmetric mesh with exact quadrature and even coefficients, the parity-adapted local construction $\\psi_i^{\\mathrm{even}}$ and $\\psi_i^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ produces a global mass matrix and stiffness matrix that exactly decouple the even and odd subspaces, i.e., off-diagonal even–odd coupling blocks vanish identically.**\n\nThis statement formalizes the matrix structure. A parity-adapted basis is one of the form $\\{\\psi_i^{\\mathrm{even}}\\} \\cup \\{\\psi_j^{\\mathrm{odd}}\\}$.\nThe stiffness matrix entry between an even basis function $\\psi_i^{\\mathrm{even}}$ and an odd basis function $\\psi_j^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ is $K_{ij} = a_h(\\psi_i^{\\mathrm{even}}, \\psi_j^{\\mathrm{odd}})$. As proven in our initial analysis, this is zero.\nThe mass matrix entry is $M_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^1 \\psi_i^{\\mathrm{even}}(x) \\psi_j^{\\mathrm{odd}}(x) dx$. The integrand is an odd function, so its integral over $[-1,1]$ is zero.\nThus, any matrix entry coupling an even basis function with an odd one is zero for both the stiffness and mass matrices. This means the matrices are block-diagonal with respect to the even/odd partition. Exact quadrature is crucial to ensure these integrals evaluate to exactly zero.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For the parabolic Neumann problem with initial data $u_h(\\cdot,0) \\in W_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ and consistent mass matrix, the semidiscrete solution $u_h(\\cdot,t)$ remains in $W_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ for all $t \\ge 0$, and its discrete total mass $\\int_{-1}^1 u_h(x,t)\\, dx$ is exactly zero for all $t \\ge 0$, independent of the particular choice of time-integration method applied to the semidiscrete system.**\n\nThe semidiscrete system is $M \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} + K_0 \\mathbf{u} = 0$, where $M_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^1 \\psi_i \\psi_j dx$ and $(K_0)_{ij} = \\int_{-1}^1 a(x) \\psi_i' \\psi_j' dx$. As established in C, both matrices are block diagonal in a parity-adapted basis. The system decouples into two independent systems of ODEs for the even coefficients $\\mathbf{u}_e$ and odd coefficients $\\mathbf{u}_o$:\n$M_{ee} \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_e}{dt} + K_{ee} \\mathbf{u}_e = 0$\n$M_{oo} \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_o}{dt} + K_{oo} \\mathbf{u}_o = 0$\nThe initial condition is $u_h(\\cdot,0) \\in W_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$, which means $\\mathbf{u}_e(0) = 0$. The first ODE is a homogeneous linear system with a zero initial condition. Its unique solution is $\\mathbf{u}_e(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This implies that the solution $u_h(\\cdot,t)$ has no even component and remains in $W_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$ for all time. This conclusion depends only on the structure of the semi-discrete system, not on how it is integrated in time.\nThe total mass is the integral $\\int_{-1}^1 u_h(x,t) dx$. Since we have proven that $u_h(x,t)$ is an odd function for all $t \\ge 0$, its integral over the symmetric domain $[-1,1]$ is identically zero for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization with central numerical fluxes on the full domain and the same symmetric mesh, even if coefficients are even and quadrature is exact, the even/odd decoupling is destroyed at the symmetry plane $x=0$ by flux coupling, so no degree-of-freedom reduction via parity is possible without loss of accuracy.**\n\nThe SIPG bilinear form includes face integrals. Let's analyze the contribution from the face at $x=0$ when coupling an even function $u \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ and an odd function $v \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. At $x=0$:\n- The jump of an even function is $[u](0) = u(0^+) - u(0^-) = 0$.\n- The average of the flux of an even function is $\\{a u'\\}(0) = \\frac{1}{2}( a(0^+)u'(0^+) + a(0^-)u'(0^-) )$. Since $a$ is even and $u'$ is odd, this is $\\frac{1}{2}( a(0)u'(0^+) + a(0)(-u'(0^+)) ) = 0$.\nThe SIPG face integral terms are of the form $\\{a u'\\} [v]$, $[u] \\{a v'\\}$, and $\\frac{\\eta}{h}[u][v]$. At the face $x=0$, for the pair $(u,v)$, the terms become:\n- $\\{a u'\\}(0) [v](0) = 0 \\cdot [v](0) = 0$.\n- $[u](0) \\{a v'\\}(0) = 0 \\cdot \\{a v'\\}(0) = 0$.\n- $\\frac{\\eta}{h}[u](0) [v](0) = \\frac{\\eta}{h} \\cdot 0 \\cdot [v](0) = 0$.\nAll coupling terms at the central face are zero. The standard volume terms also result in zero coupling, as seen previously. Therefore, the even/odd decoupling is perfectly preserved in a standard SIPG method. The statement is factually incorrect.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. In the elliptic problem with $f$ odd, using only the even subspace $V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ on the full domain produces the same solution as restricting the problem to the half-domain $[0,1]$ with a homogeneous Dirichlet condition at $x=0$ and then reflecting antisymmetrically.**\n\nIf $f$ is an odd function, then for any $v_e \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$, the right-hand side is $\\ell_f(v_e) = \\int_{-1}^1 f(x)v_e(x) dx = 0$. The problem for the even part of the solution is: find $u_h^{\\mathrm{even}} \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$ such that $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{even}}, v_e) = 0$ for all $v_e \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{even}}$. By coercivity, the unique solution is $u_h^{\\mathrm{even}}=0$. So, the procedure \"using only the even subspace\" produces the zero function.\nThe true solution to the problem is purely odd, $u_h = u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$, found by solving $a_h(u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}, v_o) = \\ell_f(v_o)$ for all $v_o \\in V_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. An odd function that is continuous must be zero at $x=0$. The procedure of solving on the half-domain $[0,1]$ with a homogeneous Dirichlet condition at $x=0$ and reflecting antisymmetrically is the standard, correct method for computing this odd solution $u_h^{\\mathrm{odd}}$. Unless $f$ is identically zero, this solution will be non-zero.\nThe statement asserts that the zero function (from the first procedure) is equal to the non-zero odd solution (from the second procedure). This is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
