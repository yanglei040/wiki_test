By explicitly computing both the volume integral of a vector field's divergence and the corresponding flux integral over the boundary, you will confirm their equality in a general $n$-dimensional setting. This practice reinforces the theorem's core concept of balancing internal sources with boundary flux, a critical idea for understanding conservation laws and numerical schemes like the Finite Volume Method .",

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in vector calculus with a clear connection to the principles of numerical methods for partial differential equations. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe will now proceed with the solution by computing the two integrals separately and then verifying their equality.\n\nFirst, we compute the volume integral $\\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} \\, dx$.\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{F}(x) = x$, which in Cartesian coordinates is $\\mathbf{F}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. The components of $\\mathbf{F}$ are $F_i(x) = x_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe divergence of $\\mathbf{F}$ is defined as the trace of its Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix $J_{\\mathbf{F}}$ has entries $(J_{\\mathbf{F}})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial x_j}$. In this case, $\\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The Jacobian is thus the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_n$.\nThe divergence is the trace of the Jacobian:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} = \\operatorname{tr}(J_{\\mathbf{F}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n\n$$\nSince the divergence is a constant, the volume integral is straightforward to compute:\n$$\n\\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} \\, dx = \\int_{B_{1}(0)} n \\, dx = n \\int_{B_{1}(0)} 1 \\, dx = n \\cdot \\operatorname{Volume}(B_{1}(0))\n$$\nThe volume of an $n$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ is given by the formula $V_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)} R^n$. For the unit ball $B_{1}(0)$, we have $R=1$, so its volume is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Volume}(B_{1}(0)) = V_n(1) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our integral expression, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} \\, dx = n \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the surface integral $\\int_{\\partial B_{1}(0)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS$.\nThe boundary of the unit ball $B_1(0)$ is the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\|x\\| = 1\\}$. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ at a point $x$ on its surface is parallel to the position vector $x$. It is given by $\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$.\nSince our surface is the unit sphere, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, $\\|x\\|=1$. Thus, the outward unit normal is simply $\\mathbf{n} = x$.\n\nThe integrand is the dot product $\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. With $\\mathbf{F}(x)=x$ and $\\mathbf{n}=x$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(x) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(x) = x \\cdot x = \\|x\\|^2\n$$\nAs we are integrating over the surface of the unit sphere, $\\|x\\|=1$ for all points on the surface. Therefore, the integrand is constant and equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nThe surface integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial B_{1}(0)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} 1 \\, dS = \\operatorname{Area}(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1})\n$$\nThis is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere. The formula for the surface area of an $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $R$ is $A_{n-1}(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}R^{n-1}$. For the unit sphere, $R=1$, so its area is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Area}(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}) = A_{n-1}(1) = \\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}\n$$\nThus, the value of the surface integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial B_{1}(0)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}\n$$\n\nAs stipulated by the divergence theorem, these two integrals must be equal. We now verify this by explicit evaluation of the expressions.\nThe volume integral result is $n \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}$.\nThe surface integral result is $\\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}$.\nWe use the fundamental recurrence relation for the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$. Let $z = \\frac{n}{2}$. Then we have:\n$$\n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{n}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the volume integral:\n$$\nn \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)} = n \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\frac{n}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})} = \\frac{n \\cdot 2}{n} \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})} = \\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}\n$$\nThis result is identical to the value of the surface integral. The equality is therefore verified by direct computation. The common value of the two integrals is $\\frac{2\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}$.\n\nIn the context of the numerical solution of PDEs, this equality is a manifestation of a fundamental conservation law. Finite volume methods are built upon the integral form of conservation laws. For a PDE of the form $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\operatorname{div}\\mathbf{J} = s$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is a flux vector and $s$ is a source term, integrating over a control volume (a cell) $\\Omega_i$ and applying the divergence theorem yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{\\Omega_i} u \\, dx + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_i} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{\\Omega_i} s \\, dx\n$$\nThis equation states that the rate of change of the total amount of $u$ in the cell is balanced by the net flux of $\\mathbf{J}$ across the cell's boundary and the total source/sink activity within the cell.\nThe problem demonstrates this for a steady-state situation (no time dependence) where the vector field is $\\mathbf{F}$, the \"source\" term is $\\operatorname{div}\\mathbf{F}$, and the cell is the unit ball $B_1(0)$. The equality $\\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial B_{1}(0)} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS$ is the analytical expression of this exact balance. A finite volume discretization approximates the volume integral (source term) using values inside the cell and the surface integral (flux term) using values on the cell faces. The fact that these two forms are analytically equivalent is a crucial consistency condition. A robust numerical scheme must respect this property, ensuring that the discrete divergence operator and the discrete flux calculation are compatible. This cell-wise balance is what makes finite volume methods locally and globally conservative, a highly desirable property in simulations of physical transport phenomena. Verifying this identity for a simple case confirms the validity of the underlying principle before implementing a more complex numerical approximation.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the outward conormal flux density for a given diffusion operator, domain, and function. The process begins with a formal derivation of the conormal derivative from fundamental principles, as stipulated by the problem statement.\n\nThe divergence theorem in three dimensions states that for a continuously differentiable vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ on a domain $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with a piecewise smooth boundary $\\partial D$, the following holds:\n$$\n\\iiint_D (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) \\, dV = \\oiint_{\\partial D} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary $\\partial D$.\n\nWe are given the linear operator $L u = -\\nabla \\cdot (A \\nabla u)$. To derive Green's first identity for this operator, we consider the integral of $v(Lu)$ over the domain $D$ for a scalar function $v$.\n$$\n\\iiint_D v (L u) \\, dV = \\iiint_D v \\left( -\\nabla \\cdot (A \\nabla u) \\right) \\, dV\n$$\nTo proceed, we use the product rule for the divergence of a scalar-multiplied vector field, $\\nabla \\cdot (v \\mathbf{G}) = (\\nabla v) \\cdot \\mathbf{G} + v (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{G})$. Let $\\mathbf{G} = A \\nabla u$.

This quantity is the conormal derivative, often denoted $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mathbf{n}_A}$. The problem asks us to evaluate this specific quantity on the face $\\Gamma$. The task is therefore to compute the value of $(A \\nabla u) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of the function $u(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = 2 x_{1} - x_{2} + 3 x_{3} + 5$.\n$$\n\\nabla u = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{1}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{3}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gradient is a constant vector field.\n\nNext, we compute the product of the matrix $A$ and the gradient vector $\\nabla u$.\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA \\nabla u = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(2) + 1(-1) + 0(3) \\\\ 1(2) + 3(-1) + 1(3) \\\\ 0(2) + 1(-1) + 2(3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 1 \\\\ 2 - 3 + 3 \\\\ -1 + 6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThen, we determine the unit outward normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ for the face $\\Gamma$. The face $\\Gamma$ is the part of the plane $x_{1} + 2 x_{2} + 2 x_{3} = 6$ that bounds the domain $D$. The domain $D$ is defined by the inequality $x_{1} + 2 x_{2} + 2 x_{3} \\le 6$ (along with non-negativity constraints). A normal vector to the plane is given by the gradient of the function $\\phi(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_{1} + 2 x_{2} + 2 x_{3}$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the domain $D$ is where $\\phi \\le 6$, the vector $\\nabla \\phi$ points in the direction of increasing $\\phi$, which is out of the domain. Therefore, $\\nabla \\phi$ is an outward normal vector. To obtain the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$, we normalize $\\nabla \\phi$:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla \\phi\\| = \\sqrt{1^{2} + 2^{2} + 2^{2}} = \\sqrt{1+4+4} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{\\|\\nabla \\phi\\|} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dot product $(A \\nabla u) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ to find the value of the outward conormal flux density.\n$$\n(A \\nabla u) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix} = (7)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (2)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + (5)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n(A \\nabla u) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{7}{3} + \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{7 + 4 + 10}{3} = \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n$$\nSince both $A \\nabla u$ and $\\mathbf{n}$ are constant vectors, the conormal flux density is constant across the entire face $\\Gamma$ and its value is $7$.",

Quadrature point $P_L = (0,0)$.\n\nThe approximate boundary integral is the sum of the integrand values at these four points (since each edge has length $1$):\n$$ A_{Q,ij} = [(\\nabla \\phi_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\phi_{j}](P_B) + [(\\nabla \\phi_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\phi_{j}](P_R) + [(\\nabla \\phi_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\phi_{j}](P_T) + [(\\nabla \\phi_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\phi_{j}](P_L) $$\nWe evaluate the term $\\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ on each edge:\n-   $E_B$: $\\nabla \\phi_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0$, $\\nabla \\phi_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=-1$.\n-   $E_R$: $\\nabla \\phi_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=1$, $\\nabla \\phi_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0$.\n-   $E_T$: $\\nabla \\phi_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0$, $\\nabla \\phi_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=1$.\n-   $E_L$: $\\nabla \\phi_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=-1$, $\\nabla \\phi_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0$.\n\nNow we compute the entries of $\\mathbf{A}_{Q}$:\n-   $A_{Q,11} = (0)\\phi_1(P_B) + (1)\\phi_1(P_R) + (0)\\phi_1(P_T) + (-1)\\phi_1(P_L) = \\phi_1(1,1) - \\phi_1(0,0) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n-   $A_{Q,12} = (0)\\phi_2(P_B) + (1)\\phi_2(P_R) + (0)\\phi_2(P_T) + (-1)\\phi_2(P_L) = \\phi_2(1,1) - \\phi_2(0,0) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n-   $A_{Q,21} = (-1)\\phi_1(P_B) + (0)\\phi_1(P_R) + (1)\\phi_1(P_T) + (0)\\phi_1(P_L) = -\\phi_1(1,0) + \\phi_1(0,1) = -1 + 0 = -1$.\n-   $A_{Q,22} = (-1)\\phi_2(P_B) + (0)\\phi_2(P_R) + (1)\\phi_2(P_T) + (0)\\phi_2(P_L) = -\\phi_2(1,0) + \\phi_2(0,1) = -0 + 1 = 1$.\n\nThe quadrature-assembled stiffness matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{A}_{Q} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is not symmetric, which is a consequence of the \"variational crime\" committed by the inconsistent boundary quadrature.\n\n### Part 2: Variational Crime Estimator $\\eta$\n\nThe estimator is defined as:\n$$ \\eta := \\sup_{u_{h},v_{h} \\in V_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\left|a(u_{h},v_{h}) - a_{Q}(u_{h},v_{h})\\right|}{\\sqrt{a(u_{h},u_{h})} \\, \\sqrt{a(v_{h},v_{h})}} $$\nLet $u_h = c_1 \\phi_1 + c_2 \\phi_2$ and $v_h = d_1 \\phi_1 + d_2 \\phi_2$, with coefficient vectors $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2)^T$ and $\\mathbf{d} = (d_1, d_2)^T$. The terms in the definition can be written in matrix form:\n-   $a(u_h, v_h) = \\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{c}$\n-   $a_Q(u_h, v_h) = \\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A}_Q \\mathbf{c}$\n-   $a(u_h, u_h) = \\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{c}$\n-   $a(v_h, v_h) = \\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{d}$\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\sup_{\\mathbf{c}, \\mathbf{d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}} \\frac{|\\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A}_Q \\mathbf{c}|}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{c}} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{d}}} = \\sup_{\\mathbf{c}, \\mathbf{d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}} \\frac{|\\mathbf{d}^T (\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}_Q) \\mathbf{c}|}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|_{\\mathbf{A}} \\|\\mathbf{d}\\|_{\\mathbf{A}}} $$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathbf{A}}$ is the energy norm induced by the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. This expression is the operator norm of the matrix $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}_Q$ with respect to the energy norm, which is equivalent to $\\|\\mathbf{A}^{-1/2} (\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}_Q) \\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}\\|_2$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ is the standard spectral norm.\n\nIn our case, the exact stiffness matrix is the identity matrix, $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{I}$. This greatly simplifies the expression:\n$$ \\eta = \\|\\mathbf{I}^{-1/2} (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A}_Q) \\mathbf{I}^{-1/2}\\|_2 = \\|\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A}_Q\\|_2 $$\nLet the error matrix be $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}_Q = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A}_Q$.\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe loss of symmetry is captured by the skew-symmetric part of $\\mathbf{A}_Q$. Let $\\mathbf{A}_Q = \\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{K}$, where $\\mathbf{S}$ is symmetric and $\\mathbf{K}$ is skew-symmetric.\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{A}_Q + \\mathbf{A}_Q^T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{A} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{A}_Q - \\mathbf{A}_Q^T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe error is entirely due to the skew-symmetric part introduced by the quadrature: $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}_Q = \\mathbf{S} - (\\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{K}) = -\\mathbf{K}$.\nThus, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe numerator of $\\eta$ is $|a(u_h,v_h) - a_Q(u_h,v_h)| = |\\mathbf{d}^T(-\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{c}|$. This explicitly relates the estimator to the loss of symmetry.\n\nTo compute $\\eta$, we find the spectral norm of $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\eta = \\|\\mathbf{E}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{E})} $$\nFirst, compute $\\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 & 0 \\cdot (-1) + 1 \\cdot 0 \\\\ -1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 & (-1) \\cdot (-1) + 0 \\cdot 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I} $$\nThe eigenvalues of the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$ are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. The largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max} = 1$.\nThe value of the estimator $\\eta$ is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\eta = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$",
