            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional reactive event modeled within the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) framework, in which the potential energy surface is represented by a two-state diabatic Hamiltonian. Each diabatic state is described by a harmonic potential of identical curvature, centered at distinct positions along the reaction coordinate. Specifically, let the diabatic energies be given by $E_{i}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}k\\left(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+E_{i}^{0}$ for $i\\in\\{1,2\\}$, where $k0$ is the curvature (force constant), $x$ is the reaction coordinate, $x_{i}$ are the diabatic minima positions with $x_{1}\\neq x_{2}$, and $E_{i}^{0}$ are constant energy offsets. The EVB Hamiltonian in the diabatic basis is a $2\\times 2$ symmetric matrix with diagonal elements $E_{1}(x)$ and $E_{2}(x)$ and a constant off-diagonal coupling $H_{12}$ (assumed real), so that $H(x)=\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}(x)  H_{12} \\\\ H_{12}  E_{2}(x)\\end{pmatrix}$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the standard theoretical framework of the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) model, is mathematically well-posed, and an objective solution can be derived from the provided information. The directive to express final results in specific units, while given symbolic parameters without units, is interpreted as contextual guidance for the physical interpretation of the results rather than a literal constraint on the symbolic expressions. The derived symbolic expressions will be dimensionally consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the position of the diabatic crossing, $x_c$, and the minimum energy splitting between the two adiabatic potential energy surfaces.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Diabatic Crossing Position, $x_c$**\n\nThe crossing of the diabatic potential energy surfaces is defined as the point $x_c$ on the reaction coordinate $x$ where the energies of the two diabatic states are equal. This condition is expressed as $E_1(x_c) = E_2(x_c)$.\nThe diabatic energies are given by the expressions:\n$$E_1(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x-x_1)^2 + E_1^0$$\n$$E_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x-x_2)^2 + E_2^0$$\nSetting these equal at $x = x_c$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}k(x_c-x_1)^2 + E_1^0 = \\frac{1}{2}k(x_c-x_2)^2 + E_2^0$$\nTo solve for $x_c$, we first expand the squared binomials:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}k(x_c^2 - 2x_c x_1 + x_1^2) + E_1^0 = \\frac{1}{2}k(x_c^2 - 2x_c x_2 + x_2^2) + E_2^0$$\nMultiplying through by $2$ and expanding the terms involving the constant $k$ yields:\n$$k x_c^2 - 2k x_c x_1 + k x_1^2 + 2E_1^0 = k x_c^2 - 2k x_c x_2 + k x_2^2 + 2E_2^0$$\nThe term $k x_c^2$ appears on both sides of the equation and can be cancelled. We then rearrange the equation to isolate the terms containing $x_c$:\n$$2k x_c x_2 - 2k x_c x_1 = k x_2^2 - k x_1^2 + 2E_2^0 - 2E_1^0$$\nFactoring out $2k x_c$ on the left side and $k$ and $2$ on the right side:\n$$2k x_c (x_2 - x_1) = k (x_2^2 - x_1^2) + 2(E_2^0 - E_1^0)$$\nRecognizing the difference of squares, $x_2^2 - x_1^2 = (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1)$, we substitute this into the equation:\n$$2k x_c (x_2 - x_1) = k (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) + 2(E_2^0 - E_1^0)$$\nThe problem specifies that $x_1 \\neq x_2$ and $k0$, so a division by $2k(x_2-x_1)$ is permissible. This isolates $x_c$:\n$$x_c = \\frac{k(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1)}{2k(x_2 - x_1)} + \\frac{2(E_2^0 - E_1^0)}{2k(x_2 - x_1)}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the position of the diabatic crossing:\n$$x_c = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2) + \\frac{E_2^0 - E_1^0}{k(x_2 - x_1)}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Minimum Adiabatic Energy Splitting**\n\nThe adiabatic potential energy surfaces, denoted $E_{\\pm}(x)$, are the eigenvalues of the EVB Hamiltonian matrix $H(x)$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H(x) - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$H(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} E_1(x)  H_{12} \\\\ H_{12}  E_2(x) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} E_1(x) - \\lambda  H_{12} \\\\ H_{12}  E_2(x) - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$(E_1(x) - \\lambda)(E_2(x) - \\lambda) - H_{12}^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda^2 - (E_1(x) + E_2(x))\\lambda + E_1(x)E_2(x) - H_{12}^2 = 0$$\nThe solutions for $\\lambda$, which represent the adiabatic energies $E_{\\pm}(x)$, are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$E_{\\pm}(x) = \\frac{(E_1(x) + E_2(x)) \\pm \\sqrt{(E_1(x) + E_2(x))^2 - 4(E_1(x)E_2(x) - H_{12}^2)}}{2}$$\nLet us simplify the discriminant:\n$$(E_1(x) + E_2(x))^2 - 4E_1(x)E_2(x) + 4H_{12}^2 = E_1(x)^2 + 2E_1(x)E_2(x) + E_2(x)^2 - 4E_1(x)E_2(x) + 4H_{12}^2$$\n$$= E_1(x)^2 - 2E_1(x)E_2(x) + E_2(x)^2 + 4H_{12}^2 = (E_1(x) - E_2(x))^2 + 4H_{12}^2$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the eigenvalues gives the adiabatic energies:\n$$E_{\\pm}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(E_1(x) + E_2(x)) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(E_1(x) - E_2(x))^2 + 4H_{12}^2}$$\nThe energy splitting, or gap, between the two adiabatic surfaces at any position $x$ is $\\Delta E(x) = E_+(x) - E_-(x)$:\n$$\\Delta E(x) = \\sqrt{(E_1(x) - E_2(x))^2 + 4H_{12}^2}$$\nTo find the minimum energy splitting, we must find the minimum of $\\Delta E(x)$. The term $4H_{12}^2$ is a positive constant (since $H_{12}$ is real). The term $(E_1(x) - E_2(x))^2$ is a non-negative function of $x$. The minimum value of $\\Delta E(x)$ will occur at the position $x$ where $(E_1(x) - E_2(x))^2$ is minimized. The minimum possible value of a squared real number is $0$, which occurs when $E_1(x) = E_2(x)$.\nThis condition, $E_1(x) = E_2(x)$, is precisely the definition of the diabatic crossing point, $x_c$. Therefore, the minimum energy splitting occurs at $x=x_c$.\nAt this point, the minimum splitting $\\Delta E_{min}$ is:\n$$\\Delta E_{min} = \\Delta E(x_c) = \\sqrt{(E_1(x_c) - E_2(x_c))^2 + 4H_{12}^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 4H_{12}^2} = \\sqrt{4H_{12}^2}$$\nSince the energy splitting must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$\\Delta E_{min} = 2|H_{12}|$$\nThis demonstrates that the off-diagonal coupling $H_{12}$ directly determines the magnitude of the avoided crossing gap. If $H_{12}=0$, the gap is zero, and the adiabatic surfaces cross at $x_c$. If $H_{12} \\neq 0$, the degeneracy is lifted, and the surfaces exhibit an avoided crossing with a minimum separation of $2|H_{12}|$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are thus the crossing position $x_c$ and the minimum energy splitting $\\Delta E_{min}$.",

Note that $r_{AB} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_A - \\mathbf{r}_B\\|$, $r_{BC} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_C - \\mathbf{r}_B\\|$, and $\\theta$ all depend on $\\mathbf{r}_{B}$.\n\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} E_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{\\theta} \\left[ \\left(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} b_{AB}\\right) b_{BC} (\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} + b_{AB} \\left(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} b_{BC}\\right) (\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} + b_{AB} b_{BC} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} \\left( (\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nUsing the chain rule for the last term, and noting that the reference angle $\\theta_{0}$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} \\left( (\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} \\right) = 2 (\\theta - \\theta_{0}) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} (\\theta - \\theta_{0}) = 2 (\\theta - \\theta_{0}) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta\n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the gradient of the energy yields:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} E_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{\\theta}(\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} \\left[ (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB}) b_{BC} + b_{AB} (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{BC}) \\right] + k_{\\theta}\\,b_{AB}\\,b_{BC}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})\\,\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta\n$$\n\nThe force on atom $B$ is the negative of this gradient:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{\\theta}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} \\left[ b_{BC} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB} + b_{AB} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{BC} \\right] - k_{\\theta}\\,b_{AB}\\,b_{BC}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})\\,\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta\n$$\n\nThis expression provides the force on atom $B$ in terms of $k_{\\theta}$, $b_{AB}$, $b_{BC}$, their gradients with respect to $\\mathbf{r}_{B}$, and the gradient of the angle $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta$, as required by the first part of the problem.\n\n### Part 2: Limiting Behavior of the Force\n\nTo evaluate the limit of $\\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)}$ as the bond order $b_{AB}(r_{AB})$ approaches zero (which occurs as $r_{AB} \\to \\infty$), we must analyze the behavior of each term in the force expression. To do this, we first need explicit expressions for the gradients.\n\nThe bond order functions are $b_{AB}(r_{AB}) = \\exp(-\\alpha(r_{AB} - r_{0}))$ and $b_{BC}(r_{BC}) = \\exp(-\\alpha(r_{BC} - r_{0}))$. Their gradients with respect to $\\mathbf{r}_{B}$ are found using the chain rule:\n$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} b_{AB} = \\frac{db_{AB}}{dr_{AB}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} r_{AB}$.\nThe derivative with respect to bond length is $\\frac{db_{AB}}{dr_{AB}} = -\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha(r_{AB} - r_{0})) = -\\alpha b_{AB}$.\nThe gradient of the bond length $r_{AB} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_{A} - \\mathbf{r}_{B}\\|$ is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}} r_{AB} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{B} - \\mathbf{r}_{A}}{r_{AB}} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{r_{AB}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$ is the unit vector along the bond from $B$ to $A$.\nSo, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB} = (-\\alpha b_{AB})(-\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}) = \\alpha b_{AB} \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$.\nBy an identical argument, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{BC} = \\alpha b_{BC} \\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$ is the unit vector from $B$ to $C$.\n\nThe gradient of the angle $\\theta$ with respect to $\\mathbf{r}_{B}$ is a standard result in molecular mechanics:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta} \\left[ \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{c}} - (\\hat{\\mathbf{a}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{c}})\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}}{r_{AB}} + \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{a}} - (\\hat{\\mathbf{a}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{c}})\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}}{r_{BC}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta} \\left[ \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{c}} - \\cos(\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}}{r_{AB}} + \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{a}} - \\cos(\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}}{r_{BC}} \\right]\n$$\n\nNow we analyze the limit of $\\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)}$ as $r_{AB} \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)} = \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{\\theta}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} b_{BC} (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB})}_{\\text{Term 1}} \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{\\theta}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2} b_{AB} (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{BC})}_{\\text{Term 2}} \\underbrace{-k_{\\theta}\\,b_{AB}\\,b_{BC}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_{0})\\,(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta)}_{\\text{Term 3}}\n$$\n\n1.  **Behavior of core components**:\n    -   As $r_{AB} \\to \\infty$, since $\\alpha  0$, the bond order $b_{AB} = \\exp(-\\alpha(r_{AB} - r_{0}))$ decays to $0$.\n    -   The gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB} = \\alpha b_{AB} \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$ also approaches $\\mathbf{0}$, as it is proportional to $b_{AB}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$ is a unit vector.\n    -   The quantities related to the $B$-$C$ bond, $r_{BC}$ and $b_{BC}$, are independent of $\\mathbf{r}_{A}$ and remain constant. The gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{BC}$ is also constant with respect to $r_{AB}$.\n    -   The angle $\\theta$ approaches a limiting value $\\theta_{\\infty}$ defined by $\\cos\\theta_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{c}}{r_{BC}}$. This limit is well-defined, and thus $\\theta_{\\infty}$ is a finite angle.\n    -   The gradient of the angle, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta$, approaches a finite vector limit. As $r_{AB} \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{c}} - \\cos(\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}}{r_{AB}}$ vanishes. The remaining part approaches a constant vector, and the prefactor $1/\\sin\\theta$ is not singular (its numerator would also vanish in the case of a collinear limit, making the fraction well-behaved). Therefore, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}\\theta$ is bounded.\n\n2.  **Limit of each term**:\n    -   **Term 1**: This term contains the factor $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB}$. Since $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{B}}b_{AB} = \\mathbf{0}$ and all other factors in Term 1 approach finite limits, we have $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} \\text{Term 1} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n    -   **Term 2**: This term contains the factor $b_{AB}$. Since $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} b_{AB} = 0$ and all other factors are bounded, we have $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} \\text{Term 2} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n    -   **Term 3**: This term also contains the factor $b_{AB}$. Since $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} b_{AB} = 0$ and all other factors are bounded, we have $\\lim_{r_{AB}\\to\\infty} \\text{Term 3} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    The limit of the sum is the sum of the limits. Therefore, the total force on atom $B$ vanishes:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{r_{AB} \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)} = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}\n    $$\n    This result demonstrates a key feature of reactive force fields. The angle interaction is modulated by bond orders, such that when one of the constituent bonds breaks (i.e., its length goes to infinity), the corresponding bond order vanishes. This causes the entire energy term and all forces derived from it to vanish smoothly. The exponential decay of the bond order function $b_{AB}(r_{AB})$ ensures that the force and all its derivatives with respect to $r_{AB}$ also go to zero, confirming the smoothness of this cutoff mechanism.\n\nThe limiting expression for the force $\\mathbf{F}_{B}^{(\\theta)}$ is the zero vector.",

Most simulation codes compute the force as $F = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial R}\\big|_{q}$, neglecting the Pulay correction which would be non-zero for the non-converged charges. The error in the instantaneous force is therefore:\n$$\n\\delta F = F - F_0 = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U(R,q)}{\\partial R} - \\frac{\\partial U(R,q_0)}{\\partial R}\\right)\n$$\nWe can relate the error in force $\\delta F$ to the error in charges $\\delta q = q - q_0$ by a first-order Taylor expansion of the force expression around $q_0$:\n$$\n\\delta F \\approx - \\frac{\\partial^2 U(R,q_0)}{\\partial R \\partial q} \\delta q\n$$\nThe problem provides the mixed partial derivative operator $J(R) = \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{\\mathrm{QEq}}}{\\partial R \\partial q}$. We assume the charge-dependence of $U$ is wholly contained in $E_{\\mathrm{QEq}}$, so $\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial R \\partial q} = J(R)$. Thus, $\\delta F \\approx -J(R)\\,\\delta q$.\n\nNext, we relate the charge error $\\delta q$ to the residual $r$. The residual is defined as $r = \\nabla_q E_{\\mathrm{QEq}}(q;R) = H(R)q - b(R)$. The exact solution $q_0$ satisfies $0 = H(R)q_0 - b(R)$. Subtracting these two equations gives $H(R)(q-q_0) = r$, which means the charge error is $\\delta q = H(R)^{-1}r$.\nSubstituting this into the force error expression yields:\n$$\n\\delta F(R) \\approx -J(R) H(R)^{-1} r\n$$\nThis fictitious force error performs work on the system, causing a drift in the total energy. The instantaneous power input due to this error is $P_{\\mathrm{err}} = (\\delta F)^{\\mathsf{T}} v$, where $v = \\dot{R}$ is the vector of atomic velocities. The total energy drift over the simulation time $\\tau$ is the time integral of this power:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}} = \\int_0^{\\tau} P_{\\mathrm{err}}(t) \\, dt = -\\int_0^{\\tau} \\left(J(R(t)) H(R(t))^{-1} r(t)\\right)^{\\mathsf{T}} v(t) \\, dt\n$$\nTo find a rigorous bound, we use the properties of vector and matrix norms. The absolute value of the drift is bounded as:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}}| \\leq \\int_0^{\\tau} \\left| \\left(J H^{-1} r\\right)^{\\mathsf{T}} v \\right| dt\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|x^{\\mathsf{T}}y| \\le \\|x\\|_2 \\|y\\|_2$:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}}| \\leq \\int_0^{\\tau} \\|J H^{-1} r\\|_2 \\|v(t)\\|_2 \\, dt\n$$\nUsing the property of the induced $L_2$-norm for matrices, $\\|Ax\\|_2 \\le \\|A\\|_2 \\|x\\|_2$, we have $\\|J H^{-1} r\\|_2 \\leq \\|J\\|_2 \\|H^{-1}\\|_2 \\|r\\|_2$. The problem provides uniform bounds $\\|H(R)^{-1}\\|_{2} \\leq C_H = 0.1~\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$ and $\\|J(R)\\|_{2} \\leq C_J = 4.0~\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{\\AA}$. We seek a tolerance $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ such that $\\|r\\|_2 \\leq r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ at all times. The bound becomes:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}}| \\leq C_J C_H r_{\\mathrm{tol}} \\int_0^{\\tau} \\|v(t)\\|_2 \\, dt\n$$\nThe integral term represents the total path length traversed by all atoms. We can estimate it using statistical mechanics. By the ergodic hypothesis for a system in the canonical ensemble, the time average is equal to the ensemble average: $\\int_0^{\\tau} \\|v(t)\\|_2 dt = \\tau \\langle \\|v\\|_2 \\rangle$. By Jensen's inequality, $\\langle \\|v\\|_2 \\rangle \\le \\sqrt{\\langle \\|v\\|_2^2 \\rangle}$. The term $\\langle \\|v\\|_2^2 \\rangle$ is the mean-squared norm of the velocity vector.\n$$\n\\langle \\|v\\|_2^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{j=1}^{N} |v_j|^2 \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (v_{j,x}^2 + v_{j,y}^2 + v_{j,z}^2) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} \\langle v_{j,\\alpha}^2 \\rangle\n$$\nFrom the equipartition theorem, the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$, so $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}m_j v_{j,\\alpha}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T$, which implies $\\langle v_{j,\\alpha}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{m_j}$.\nTherefore, $\\langle \\|v\\|_2^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} 3 \\frac{k_B T}{m_j} = 3 k_B T \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{m_j}$.\nThe sum is over all $N=100$ atoms, which consists of $N_C=60$ carbon atoms and $N_H=40$ hydrogen atoms.\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{m_j} = \\frac{N_C}{m_C} + \\frac{N_H}{m_H}\n$$\nCombining these results, the bound on the energy drift is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}}| \\leq C_J C_H r_{\\mathrm{tol}} \\tau \\sqrt{3 k_B T \\left(\\frac{N_C}{m_C} + \\frac{N_H}{m_H}\\right)}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units (eV, Å, ps).\n$C_J = 4.0~\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{\\AA}$\n$C_H = 0.1~\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$\n$\\tau = 1~\\mathrm{ns} = 1000~\\mathrm{ps}$\n$T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$\n$k_B = 8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{eV/K} \\implies k_B T = 0.025852~\\mathrm{eV}$\nMasses: $m_C = 12~\\mathrm{amu}$, $m_H = 1~\\mathrm{amu}$.\nMass conversion: $1~\\mathrm{amu} = 1.0364 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{ps}^2/\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$.\n$m_C = 12 \\times 1.0364 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.24368 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{ps}^2/\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n$m_H = 1 \\times 1.0364 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.0364 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{ps}^2/\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\nNow we compute the sum over inverse masses:\n$$\n\\frac{N_C}{m_C} + \\frac{N_H}{m_H} = \\frac{60}{1.24368 \\times 10^{-3}} + \\frac{40}{1.0364 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 48243.5 + 385951.4 = 434194.9~\\frac{\\mathrm{\\AA}^2}{\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{ps}^2}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the estimated velocity term:\n$$\n\\tau \\sqrt{3 k_B T \\left(\\frac{N_C}{m_C} + \\frac{N_H}{m_H}\\right)} = 1000~\\mathrm{ps} \\times \\sqrt{3 \\times 0.025852~\\mathrm{eV} \\times 434194.9~\\frac{\\mathrm{\\AA}^2}{\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{ps}^2}}\n$$\n$$\n= 1000~\\mathrm{ps} \\times \\sqrt{33674.8}~\\mathrm{\\AA}/\\mathrm{ps} \\approx 1000 \\times 183.507~\\mathrm{\\AA} = 1.83507 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\nThe overall dimensionless multiplier for $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ is:\n$$\nK = C_J C_H \\times 1.83507 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{\\AA} = (4.0~\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{\\AA}) \\times (0.1~\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}) \\times (1.83507 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{\\AA}) \\approx 73403\n$$\nThe bound on energy drift is $|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{drift}}| \\leq K \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{tol}} \\approx 73403 \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. Note that $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ has units of energy (eV).\n\nFinally, we apply the constraint that the drift must not exceed $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{max}} = 10~\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.
