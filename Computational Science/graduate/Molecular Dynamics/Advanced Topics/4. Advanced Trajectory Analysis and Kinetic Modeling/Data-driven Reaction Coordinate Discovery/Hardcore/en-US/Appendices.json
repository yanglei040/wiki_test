The reversibility condition (detailed balance) states that $\\pi_i P_{ij} = \\pi_j P_{ji}$ for all $i,j$.

Do not round; provide the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The provided stationary distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ and transition matrix $P$ are consistent with the definitions of a reversible Markov chain. Specifically, $P$ is row-stochastic, $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top P = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top$, and the detailed balance condition $\\pi_i P_{ij} = \\pi_j P_{ji}$ holds for all $i, j$.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the operator whose spectrum encodes the slow dynamics of the system and the computation of its nontrivial spectrum. In the context of a reversible Markov State Model (MSM), the slow dynamics are described by the eigenvalues of the transition operator, which is represented by the matrix $P$. While $P$ itself is not generally symmetric, the detailed balance condition implies that it is self-adjoint with respect to the weighted inner product $\\langle \\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{g} \\rangle_{\\pi} = \\sum_i \\pi_i f_i g_i$, where $\\mathbf{f}$ and $\\mathbf{g}$ are functions on the state space represented as vectors.\n\nLet $\\Pi = \\text{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi})$ be the diagonal matrix with the stationary probabilities on its diagonal. The detailed balance condition can be written in matrix form as $\\Pi P = (\\Pi P)^\\top$. This property ensures that $P$ is similar to a symmetric matrix. Consider the matrix $T = \\Pi^{1/2} P \\Pi^{-1/2}$. The similarity transformation preserves the eigenvalues. $T$ is symmetric because\n$$\nT^\\top = (\\Pi^{1/2} P \\Pi^{-1/2})^\\top = (\\Pi^{-1/2})^\\top P^\\top (\\Pi^{1/2})^\\top = \\Pi^{-1/2} P^\\top \\Pi^{1/2}.\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\Pi^{1/2}$ on the left and right, we have $\\Pi^{1/2} T^\\top \\Pi^{1/2} = P^\\top \\Pi$. Since $\\Pi P = (\\Pi P)^\\top = P^\\top \\Pi$, we get $\\Pi^{1/2} T^\\top \\Pi^{1/2} = \\Pi P$. This leads to $T^\\top = \\Pi^{-1/2} (\\Pi P) \\Pi^{-1/2} = \\Pi^{1/2} P \\Pi^{-1/2} = T$.\nBecause $T$ is a symmetric matrix, its eigenvalues are real. As $T$ and $P$ are similar, they share the same spectrum. This operator $T$ (or equivalently, $P$ in the appropriate inner product space) is the operator whose spectrum describes the dynamics. The eigenvalues of $P$ correspond to the relaxation timescales of the system via $\\tau_k = -\\tau / \\ln(|\\lambda_k|)$ for eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$.\n\nThe problem further links this to Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (tICA). The tICA method solves the generalized eigenproblem $C(\\tau) \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda^{\\text{tICA}} C(0) \\mathbf{v}$, where $C(0)$ and $C(\\tau)$ are the zero-lag and time-lagged covariance matrices of a chosen feature vector. For a feature vector of indicator functions $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}(x)$ on the discrete states, which is made zero-mean, the covariance matrices are $C(0) = \\Pi - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top$ and $C(\\tau) = \\Pi P - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{w}_k$ be a right eigenvector of $P$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$. For a stochastic matrix, there is always an eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ with eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}_1 = \\mathbf{1}$ (a vector of ones). For any other eigenvalue $\\lambda_k \\neq 1$, the corresponding eigenvector is orthogonal to the stationary distribution, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top \\mathbf{w}_k = 0$. For such an eigenvector, we can evaluate its action by the covariance matrices:\n$$\nC(0) \\mathbf{w}_k = (\\Pi - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top) \\mathbf{w}_k = \\Pi \\mathbf{w}_k - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top \\mathbf{w}_k) = \\Pi \\mathbf{w}_k\n$$\n$$\nC(\\tau) \\mathbf{w}_k = (\\Pi P - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top) \\mathbf{w}_k = \\Pi P \\mathbf{w}_k - \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^\\top \\mathbf{w}_k) = \\Pi (P \\mathbf{w}_k) = \\Pi (\\lambda_k \\mathbf{w}_k) = \\lambda_k (\\Pi \\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the tICA eigenproblem, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda_k (\\Pi \\mathbf{w}_k) = \\lambda^{\\text{tICA}}_k (\\Pi \\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the tICA eigenvalues $\\lambda^{\\text{tICA}}_k$ are identical to the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ of the transition matrix $P$. Thus, the task reduces to computing the eigenvalues of the given matrix $P$.\n\nThe transition matrix is:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.83 & 0.16 & 0.01 \\\\\n0.20 & 0.79 & 0.01 \\\\\n0.05 & 0.04 & 0.91\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0$.

If two top tICA components share exactly the same numerical measure of slowness due to an underlying symmetry, then any orthonormal rotation within their two-dimensional span produces an alternative pair of components that optimizes the same tICA objective equally well.**\n\nLet $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two tICA components that form a basis for the degenerate eigenspace $S_\\lambda$. Any linear combination $v = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$ is also in $S_\\lambda$ and is therefore an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The value of the tICA objective for any such vector is $\\lambda$. An orthonormal rotation of the basis vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ produces a new basis $\\{v'_1, v'_2\\}$ for the same subspace $S_\\lambda$. For example, $v'_1 = \\cos\\theta \\, v_1 + \\sin\\theta \\, v_2$ and $v'_2 = -\\sin\\theta \\, v_1 + \\cos\\theta \\, v_2$. Since $v'_1$ and $v'_2$ are also in $S_\\lambda$, they are also eigenvectors with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. Thus, they optimize the tICA objective equally well and constitute a valid alternative pair of tICA components. This non-uniqueness is a key feature of degeneracy and is often exploited in post-processing (e.g., via varimax rotation) to find a more physically interpretable basis.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B.

The sign of a tICA component is arbitrary and does not affect the physical timescale, though one might adopt a sign convention for consistent interpretation of the projected coordinate $v^\\top x$.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Degenerate tICA components necessarily represent redundant linear encodings of the same slow physical process and should therefore be discarded to avoid overparameterization.**\n\nDegeneracy typically arises from physical symmetries in the system. For instance, a system with $C_3$ rotational symmetry may have two distinct, but energetically equivalent, slow motions. The degenerate tICA components capture these different spatial directions of slow dynamics. They are not redundant; they span a multi-dimensional slow subspace. Discarding one of the components would result in losing information about a crucial slow degree of freedom of the system. The degeneracy indicates that the slow dynamics are not confined to a single line, but occur in a higher-dimensional manifold.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In diffusion maps, when the Markov operator on the data admits an eigenvalue of multiplicity greater than one due to symmetry, the eigenfunctions spanning the corresponding invariant subspace are not unique; any orthonormal rotation within that subspace is also an eigenbasis, analogous to the tICA degeneracy.**\n\nThis statement draws a correct and important analogy. tICA provides a linear approximation to the eigenfunctions of the system's propagator (transfer operator). Diffusion maps provide a non-linear (kernel-based) method to approximate the same eigenfunctions. Both are spectral methods. In any spectral problem, if an operator $T$ has an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ with multiplicity $m > 1$, the corresponding eigenspace is $m$-dimensional. Any set of $m$ linearly independent vectors (or functions) that spans this space is a valid eigenbasis. An orthonormal rotation is a standard way to transform one such basis into another. The situation in tICA is a direct manifestation of this general principle from linear algebra and operator theory.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E. In the infinite-sampling limit under exact symmetry, increasing the lag $ \\tau $ slightly will generally break the exact degeneracy of the top tICA components.**\n\nIn the continuous-time limit, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of the lag-$\\tau$ transfer operator $T_\\tau$ are related to the eigenvalues $\\kappa_i$ of the generator of the dynamics $L$ by $\\lambda_i(\\tau) = e^{\\kappa_i \\tau}$. An exact physical symmetry of the system implies a degeneracy in the eigenvalues of the generator $L$. If $\\kappa_i = \\kappa_j$ due to symmetry, then for any $\\tau > 0$, $\\lambda_i(\\tau) = e^{\\kappa_i \\tau} = e^{\\kappa_j \\tau} = \\lambda_j(\\tau)$. The degeneracy in the transfer operator eigenvalues (and thus in the tICA eigenvalues in the infinite-sampling, complete-basis limit) is a consequence of the underlying symmetry of the dynamics and will persist for all lag times $\\tau$. Changing $\\tau$ does not break the symmetry.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Whitening the features using the instantaneous covariance $ \\Sigma_0 $ to form $ y_t = \\Sigma_0^{-1/2} x_t $ eliminates degeneracies in the eigenvalues associated with the slow modes identified by tICA.**\n\nWhitening is a standard technique to transform the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\Sigma_\\tau v = \\lambda \\Sigma_0 v$ into a standard eigenvalue problem. Let $y_t = \\Sigma_0^{-1/2} x_t$. The new covariance matrices are $\\mathbb{E}[y_t y_t^\\top] = I$ and $C_\\tau = \\mathbb{E}[y_t y_{t+\\tau}^\\^\\top] = \\Sigma_0^{-1/2} \\Sigma_\\tau \\Sigma_0^{-1/2}$. The new problem is $C_\\tau u = \\lambda u$. By substituting $u = \\Sigma_0^{1/2} v$ into this equation, we recover the original generalized eigenvalue problem: $(\\Sigma_0^{-1/2} \\Sigma_\\tau \\Sigma_0^{-1/2}) (\\Sigma_0^{1/2} v) = \\lambda (\\Sigma_0^{1/2} v)$, which simplifies to $\\Sigma_0^{-1/2} \\Sigma_\\tau v = \\lambda \\Sigma_0^{1/2} v$, and finally $\\Sigma_\\tau v = \\lambda \\Sigma_0 v$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the standard problem for the whitened data are identical to the generalized eigenvalues of the original problem. Whitening is a numerical transformation; it does not alter the spectrum of the operator. Therefore, it does not eliminate degeneracies.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**G. The span of the degenerate tICA components defines a unique slow subspace that is invariant under the action of the lag-$\\tau$ operator on the chosen feature space; any unit vector in this span achieves the same optimal time-lagged autocorrelation value associated with the shared slowness measure.**\n\nThis statement is a conjunction of several true claims.\n1.  \"The span of the degenerate tICA components defines a unique slow subspace\": The eigenspace corresponding to a specific eigenvalue is unique. Correct.\n2.  \"...that is invariant under the action of the lag-$\\tau$ operator on the chosen feature space...\": This means that if $v$ is in the subspace, the operator applied to $v$ yields a vector also in the subspace. The relevant operator is effectively $\\Sigma_0^{-1}\\Sigma_\\tau$. For any $v$ in the eigenspace $S_\\lambda$, $(\\Sigma_0^{-1}\\Sigma_\\tau)v = \\lambda v$, which is in $S_\\lambda$. So the subspace is invariant. Correct.\n3.  \"...any unit vector in this span achieves the same optimal time-lagged autocorrelation value...\": The \"time-lagged autocorrelation value\" is the Rayleigh quotient $\\frac{v^\\top \\Sigma_\\tau v}{v^\\top \\Sigma_0 v}$. For any non-zero vector $v \\in S_\\lambda$, this quotient is equal to $\\lambda$. The qualifier \"unit vector\" is superfluous (the ratio is independent of vector norm) but does not render the statement false. Since $\\lambda$ is the degenerate eigenvalue of the slowest components, it is the optimal value. Correct.\nAll parts of the statement are logically and scientifically correct.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.",
