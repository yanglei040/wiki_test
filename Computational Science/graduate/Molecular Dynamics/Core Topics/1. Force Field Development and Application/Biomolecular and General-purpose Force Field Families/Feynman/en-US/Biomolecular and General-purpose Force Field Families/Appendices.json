Force fields treat bonds not as rigid rods, but as springs that vibrate around an equilibrium length. This exercise  demonstrates how to calculate the energy cost of stretching a bond using the harmonic approximation, a foundational concept for the bonded terms in nearly all major force field families.",

Express your answer in $\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$ and round your final result to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in intramolecular bonded energy for a single carbon-hydrogen bond in a methane molecule when it is stretched from its equilibrium length. The problem specifies that this calculation should be based on the second-order Taylor expansion of the potential energy, which is equivalent to the harmonic approximation.\n\nLet the potential energy associated with the bond length, $b$, be denoted by the function $V(b)$. The Taylor series expansion of $V(b)$ around the equilibrium bond length, $b_0$, is given by:\n$$V(b) = V(b_0) + \\frac{dV}{db}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0) + \\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{d^2V}{db^2}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{3!} \\frac{d^3V}{db^3}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0)^3 + \\dots$$\n\nThe problem states to use the second-order Taylor expansion, which means we truncate the series after the term quadratic in the displacement $(b - b_0)$.\n$$V(b) \\approx V(b_0) + \\frac{dV}{db}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2V}{db^2}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0)^2$$\n\nBy definition, the equilibrium position $b_0$ is a point of minimum potential energy. Therefore, the force on the bond is zero at this position, which implies that the first derivative of the potential energy with respect to the bond length is zero at $b_0$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{db}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} = 0$$\n\nSubstituting this condition into the truncated Taylor expansion simplifies the expression for the potential energy:\n$$V(b) \\approx V(b_0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2V}{db^2}\\bigg|_{b=b_0} (b - b_0)^2$$\n\nThe problem provides the value for the curvature, which is the second derivative of the potential at equilibrium. This is the harmonic force constant for the bond stretch, denoted as $k_b$:\n$$k_b = \\frac{d^2V}{db^2}\\bigg|_{b=b_0}$$\n\nWith this notation, the potential energy is:\n$$V(b) \\approx V(b_0) + \\frac{1}{2} k_b (b - b_0)^2$$\n\nWe are asked to find the change in the intramolecular bonded energy, $\\Delta E$, when the bond is stretched from its equilibrium length $b_0$ to a new length $b$. This change is the difference between the potential energy at the stretched length and the potential energy at equilibrium:\n$$\\Delta E = V(b) - V(b_0)$$\n\nSubstituting the harmonic approximation for $V(b)$:\n$$\\Delta E = \\left( V(b_0) + \\frac{1}{2} k_b (b - b_0)^2 \\right) - V(b_0)$$\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} k_b (b - b_0)^2$$\n\nThis equation represents the energy stored in a harmonic oscillator displaced from its equilibrium position. The problem provides the necessary values:\nThe equilibrium bond length is $b_0 = 1.09~\\text{\\AA}$.\nThe stretched bond length is $b = 1.12~\\text{\\AA}$.\nThe curvature (force constant) is $k_b = 340~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{\\AA}^{-2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the displacement from equilibrium, $(b - b_0)$:\n$$b - b_0 = 1.12~\\text{\\AA} - 1.09~\\text{\\AA} = 0.03~\\text{\\AA}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $k_b$ and $(b - b_0)$ into the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} (340~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{\\AA}^{-2}) (0.03~\\text{\\AA})^2$$\n$$\\Delta E = (170~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{\\AA}^{-2}) (0.0009~\\text{\\AA}^2)$$\n$$\\Delta E = 0.153~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$$\n\nThe units of $\\text{\\AA}^2$ cancel, leaving the energy in the desired units of $\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$. The problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.153$ is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe assumption that other internal coordinates remain at their equilibrium values and that cross-coupling terms are negligible is consistent with the use of a simple harmonic potential for a single internal coordinate, as is standard in many additive force fields.",
