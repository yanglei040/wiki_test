            "problem": "Consider the tert-butyl group, which consists of a central carbon atom bonded to three methyl groups. In an all-atom representation, there are $4$ carbon atoms and $9$ hydrogen atoms, for a total of $13$ atoms. Let the atomic masses be $m_{\\text{C}}$ for carbon and $m_{\\text{H}}$ for hydrogen. You will construct a united-atom representation that preserves the center-of-mass positions of heavy-atom-centered groups by replacing each methyl group with a single united-atom site located at the center of mass of the $\\text{CH}_{3}$ group, and leaving the central carbon as its own site. Thus, the united-atom model has $4$ sites.\n\nUse the fundamental definition of the center of mass: for any group $g$ of atoms with positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}$ and masses $\\{m_{i}\\}$, the center-of-mass position is $\\mathbf{R}_{g} = \\left(\\sum_{i \\in g} m_{i} \\mathbf{r}_{i}\\right)\\big/\\left(\\sum_{i \\in g} m_{i}\\right)$. Treat the mapping from all-atom to united-atom coordinates as a linear transformation.\n\nAdopt the following explicit all-atom indexing and coordinate stacking convention. Label the atoms as:\n$1$: central carbon $\\text{C}_{0}$; $2$: methyl carbon $\\text{C}_{1}$; $3$: methyl carbon $\\text{C}_{2}$; $4$: methyl carbon $\\text{C}_{3}$; $5,6,7$: hydrogens $\\text{H}_{11}, \\text{H}_{12}, \\text{H}_{13}$ attached to $\\text{C}_{1}$; $8,9,10$: hydrogens $\\text{H}_{21}, \\text{H}_{22}, \\text{H}_{23}$ attached to $\\text{C}_{2}$; $11,12,13$: hydrogens $\\text{H}_{31}, \\text{H}_{32}, \\text{H}_{33}$ attached to $\\text{C}_{3}$. Stack the all-atom Cartesian coordinates as the $39 \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{13}, y_{1}, y_{2}, \\dots, y_{13}, z_{1}, z_{2}, \\dots, z_{13}\\right)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, and stack the united-atom coordinates as the $12 \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{UA}} = \\left(X_{0}, X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, Y_{0}, Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}, Z_{0}, Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}\\right)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, where index $0$ denotes the central carbon site and $1,2,3$ denote the methyl-group sites.\n\nStarting only from the center-of-mass definition and linearity of coordinate mappings, derive the unique linear transformation matrix $A$ such that $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{UA}} = A\\,\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ and the united-atom site positions are exactly the specified centers of mass of their associated groups. Express $A$ in closed form using a Kronecker product with an explicit $4 \\times 13$ weight matrix whose entries are rational functions of $m_{\\text{C}}$ and $m_{\\text{H}}$.

In the AA model, each carbon and hydrogen carries a partial charge. In the UA model for nonpolar alkanes, CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ sites are taken to be neutral, which removes intra-group electrostatics while keeping van der Waals interactions unchanged. The goal is to derive, from first principles, a charge-redistribution procedure that enforces neutrality of UA CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ sites, and then to quantify the resulting change in the molecular dipole moment.\n\nConsider the following AA geometry and RESP charges for propane:\n- Carbon atoms are placed along the $x$-axis at positions $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{C1}} = (-1.54, 0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{C2}} = (0, 0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{C3}} = (1.54, 0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n- Carbon-hydrogen bond length is $d_{\\mathrm{CH}} = 1.09\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n- The terminal CH$_3$ hydrogens (around C1 and C3) are arranged tetrahedrally relative to the respective C–C bond axis.

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part solution: first, to derive a general charge-redistribution procedure; second, to calculate the all-atom (AA) dipole moment for a given propane molecule; and third, to determine the change in dipole moment magnitude when transitioning to a united-atom (UA) model.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Charge-Redistribution Procedure**\n\nThe goal is to derive a procedure that enforces neutrality on each functional group (e.g., $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ or $\\mathrm{CH}_2$) within the molecule, starting from an initial set of atomic partial charges $q_i$. The procedure must act locally within each group and preserve the total molecular charge.\n\nLet a specific group consist of $N_{\\mathrm{group}}$ atoms, indexed by $i$. The initial charge of this group is the sum of its constituent atomic charges:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{group}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} q_i\n$$\nWe seek a new set of charges, $q_i'$, such that the new group charge, $Q'_{\\mathrm{group}}$, is zero:\n$$\nQ'_{\\mathrm{group}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} q_i' = 0\n$$\nThe problem suggests a minimally invasive transformation of the form $q_{i}' = q_{i} - \\Delta q_i$, where the adjustment $\\Delta q_i = w_{i} Q_{\\mathrm{group}}$ is proportional to the group's total charge. The weights $w_i$ are constrained by the condition $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} w_i = 1$. This ensures that the total charge removed from the group equals its initial charge:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} \\Delta q_i = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} w_i Q_{\\mathrm{group}} = Q_{\\mathrm{group}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{group}} w_i = Q_{\\mathrm{group}} \\cdot 1 = Q_{\\mathrm{group}}\n$$\nThus, the new group charge becomes $Q'_{\\mathrm{group}} = \\sum q_i' = \\sum (q_i - \\Delta q_i) = \\sum q_i - \\sum \\Delta q_i = Q_{\\mathrm{group}} - Q_{\\mathrm{group}} = 0$, as required.\n\nThe problem further suggests an \"equal-weight constraint\". The most direct interpretation for a minimally invasive procedure is that the charge redistribution is spread evenly across all atoms within the group. For a group containing $N_{\\mathrm{group}}$ atoms, this means each atom has an equal weight, $w_i = 1/N_{\\mathrm{group}}$.\n\nTherefore, the charge-redistribution procedure is as follows: For each atom $i$ belonging to a specific group with initial total charge $Q_{\\mathrm{group}}$ and containing $N_{\\mathrm{group}}$ atoms, the new charge $q_i'$ is given by:\n$$\nq_i' = q_i - \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{group}}}{N_{\\mathrm{group}}}\n$$\nThis procedure, when applied to all groups in a molecule that is initially charge-neutral, will preserve the total molecular charge, since the sum of all group charges $\\sum Q_{\\mathrm{group}}$ is zero.\n\n**Part 2 & 3: Calculation of Dipole Moments and their Difference**\n\nThe molecular dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is the vector sum of all charge-position products:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\sum_{i} q_{i} \\,\\mathbf{r}_{i}\n$$\nIn the context of this problem, the total change in dipole magnitude is $\\Delta \\mu = \\left|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AA}}\\right| - \\left|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{UA}}\\right|$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dipole moment for the specified UA model. The problem states, \"In the UA model for nonpolar alkanes, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ sites are taken to be neutral\". This means that each pseudo-atom representing a group has a charge of zero. The UA dipole moment is the sum over these pseudo-atoms:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{UA}} = \\sum_{\\mathrm{groups}} Q'_{\\mathrm{group}} \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{group}}\n$$\nwhere $Q'_{\\mathrm{group}} = 0$ for all groups. Consequently, the UA dipole moment is zero:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{UA}} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{UA}}\\right| = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the change in dipole magnitude simplifies to the magnitude of the AA dipole moment:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu = \\left|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AA}}\\right|\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ by summing the contributions from all $11$ atoms using the provided AA geometry and charges. We can group the atoms by their functional sites ($\\mathrm{C1}$-group, $\\mathrm{C2}$-group, $\\mathrm{C3}$-group).\nThe total AA dipole moment is $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{C1-group}} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{C2-group}} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{C3-group}}$.\n\nContribution from the left $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ group (atoms $\\mathrm{C1, H1, H2, H3}$):\nThe positions of the hydrogens are $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}k} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{C1}} + d_{\\mathrm{CH}}\\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{L}}_{k}$ for $k=1,2,3$.

This advanced coding exercise immerses you in this process by tasking you with calibrating a united-atom (UA) torsional potential to match the conformer populations of an all-atom (AA) model. After finding the optimal barrier height $k_3$ that aligns the UA model with AA data for several linear alkanes, you will use your calibrated model to predict a macroscopic polymer property—the persistence length . This practice demonstrates the full workflow of parameterization: calibrating microscopic energetic terms to match ensemble properties and then using the resulting model for prediction.",

            "problem": "You are given a simplified rotational isomeric state calibration task for linear alkanes in the context of all-atom and united-atom parameterizations. The goal is to recalibrate the united-atom (UA) torsional barrier to reproduce all-atom (AA) conformer populations for the three primary dihedral states of saturated hydrocarbons and then predict the chain persistence length relative to AA. United-atom models collapse explicit hydrogen atoms into their parent carbon sites, while all-atom models treat each atom explicitly. The calibration must be performed at a fixed temperature, using a single UA torsional barrier parameter that is shared across all chains considered.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Statistical mechanics equilibrium: the Boltzmann probability density of a dihedral angle $\\phi$ is $p(\\phi) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\beta V(\\phi)\\right)$, where $V(\\phi)$ is the torsional potential energy and $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$ with $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature.\n- Conformer populations in AA representation: for discrete conformers indexed by $i$ with free energies $F_i$, the populations satisfy $\\pi_i \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\beta F_i\\right)$.\n- Persistence length in the discrete worm-like chain approximation: if successive bond orientations decorrelate by an independent turn angle $\\theta$ with distribution $p(\\theta)$, then the correlation per step is $\\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle$ and the persistence length $l_p$ follows $\\exp\\left(-b/l_p\\right) = \\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle$, where $b$ is the step length. Thus $l_p = -b / \\ln \\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle$.\n\nModel and assumptions:\n1. UA torsional potential: assume the torsional potential depends only on the dihedral angle through the trigonometric form\n   $$V(\\phi; k_3) = k_3 \\left(1 + \\cos(3\\phi)\\right),$$\n   where $k_3$ is the single UA barrier parameter to be calibrated and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the dihedral angle in radians. This form yields minima near the trans and gauche regions in accordance with typical alkane torsional energetics.\n2. Conformer windows (all angles in radians): define the trans window as $\\phi \\in [5\\pi/6, 7\\pi/6]$, the positive gauche window as $\\phi \\in [\\pi/6, \\pi/2]$, and the negative gauche window as $\\phi \\in [3\\pi/2, 11\\pi/6]$. Probabilities for each conformer are obtained by integrating the Boltzmann density over the corresponding window and normalizing by the total over all three windows.\n3. AA target populations: for each chain, assume the AA free energies are $F_{\\mathrm{t}}$ for trans and $F_{\\mathrm{g}}$ for each gauche state (symmetric for positive and negative). The AA target probabilities are\n   $$p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{t}}}}{Z}, \\quad p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{g}}}}{Z}, \\quad p_{\\mathrm{g}^-}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{g}}}}{Z},$$\n   with\n   $$Z = e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{t}}} + 2 e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{g}}}.$$\n4.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and polymer physics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and presented in an objective, quantitative manner.

Subsequently, this calibrated parameter will be used to predict the persistence length of the UA model relative to the AA model for each alkane.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main stages: calibration of the parameter $k_3$ and prediction of the persistence length ratio.\n\n**Stage 1: Calibration of the Torsional Barrier Parameter $k_3$**\n\nThe core of the calibration is to find the value of $k_3$ that minimizes the discrepancy between the conformer populations predicted by the UA model and the target populations derived from the AA model.\n\nFirst, we define the physical constants and the inverse temperature $\\beta$.\n- Temperature $T = 298 \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.987204 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\, \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Inverse temperature $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} = \\frac{1}{(1.987204 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\, \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298 \\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 1.6883 \\,\\mathrm{mol/kcal}$.\n\nNext, we process the data for each of the three chains $j \\in \\{\\text{butane, hexane, decane}\\}$.\n\n**1.1. Calculation of All-Atom (AA) Target Probabilities**\nFor each chain $j$, given the free energies for the trans ($F_{\\mathrm{t},j}$) and gauche ($F_{\\mathrm{g},j}$) states, we calculate the target probabilities. The partition function for the three states is $Z_j = e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{t},j}} + 2 e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{g},j}}$. The probabilities are:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{t},j}}}{Z_j} $$\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = p_{\\mathrm{g}^-,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta F_{\\mathrm{g},j}}}{Z_j} $$\nThese probabilities sum to unity: $p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} + p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} + p_{\\mathrm{g}^-,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = 1$. Due to symmetry in the free energies, $p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = p_{\\mathrm{g}^-,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}$.\n\n**1.2. Calculation of United-Atom (UA) Probabilities**\nThe UA probabilities depend on the torsional potential $V(\\phi; k_3) = k_3 \\left(1 + \\cos(3\\phi)\\right)$. The probability of a conformer is found by integrating the unnormalized Boltzmann density, $w(\\phi; k_3) = \\exp(-\\beta V(\\phi; k_3))$, over the specified dihedral angle window and normalizing by the sum of integrals over all three windows.\n\nThe windows are:\n- Trans (t): $\\phi \\in [\\frac{5\\pi}{6}, \\frac{7\\pi}{6}]$\n- Gauche-plus (g+): $\\phi \\in [\\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$\n- Gauche-minus (g-): $\\phi \\in [\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{11\\pi}{6}]$\n\nWe define the unnormalized integrals for a given $k_3$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{t}}(k_3) = \\int_{5\\pi/6}^{7\\pi/6} w(\\phi; k_3) d\\phi $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{g}^+}(k_3) = \\int_{\\pi/6}^{\\pi/2} w(\\phi; k_3) d\\phi $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{g}^-}(k_3) = \\int_{3\\pi/2}^{11\\pi/6} w(\\phi; k_3) d\\phi $$\nThe total normalization factor is $I_{\\text{total}}(k_3) = I_{\\mathrm{t}}(k_3) + I_{\\mathrm{g}^+}(k_3) + I_{\\mathrm{g}^-}(k_3)$.\nThe UA probabilities, which are independent of the specific chain, are:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{t}}(k_3)}{I_{\\text{total}}(k_3)}, \\quad p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{g}^+}(k_3)}{I_{\\text{total}}(k_3)}, \\quad p_{\\mathrm{g}^-}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{g}^-}(k_3)}{I_{\\text{total}}(k_3)} $$\nThe potential $V(\\phi; k_3)$ and the integration windows for g+ and g- are symmetric, which implies $I_{\\mathrm{g}^+}(k_3) = I_{\\mathrm{g}^-}(k_3)$ and thus $p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) = p_{\\mathrm{g}^-}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3)$. These integrals must be computed numerically. We use a fine grid of $\\phi$ values and approximate the integrals by sums.\n\n**1.3. The Objective Function and Minimization**\nThe goal is to find the single parameter $k_3$ that minimizes the sum of squared differences (SSD) between UA and AA probabilities across all three chains and all three conformers. The objective function $\\mathcal{L}(k_3)$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(k_3) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{\\text{chains}\\}} \\left[ (p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + (p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + (p_{\\mathrm{g}^-}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{g}^-,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 \\right] $$\nGiven the symmetries $p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{UA}}=p_{\\mathrm{g}^-}^{\\mathrm{UA}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}=p_{\\mathrm{g}^-,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(k_3) = \\sum_{j} \\left[ (p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + 2(p_{\\mathrm{g}^+}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{g}^+,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 \\right] $$\nUsing the normalization condition $p_{\\mathrm{t}} + 2p_{\\mathrm{g}^+} = 1$, we have $p_{\\mathrm{g}^+} = (1 - p_{\\mathrm{t}})/2$. Substituting this into the error for the gauche states gives:\n$$ 2 \\left(\\frac{1 - p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}}{2} - \\frac{1 - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} - p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}} - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 $$\nThus, the total objective function simplifies remarkably:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(k_3) = \\sum_{j} \\left[ (p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 \\right] = \\frac{3}{2} \\sum_{j} (p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3) - p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 $$\nMinimizing $\\mathcal{L}(k_3)$ is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared errors for only the trans probabilities. We perform a bounded scalar minimization for $k_3 \\in [0, 5]$ kcal/mol to find the optimal value, $k_3^{\\text{opt}}$.\n\n**Stage 2: Prediction of Persistence Length Ratios**\n\nWith the calibrated $k_3^{\\text{opt}}$, we compute the final UA probabilities and then proceed to calculate the persistence length for both AA and UA models.\n\n**2.1. Calculation of $\\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle$**\nThe persistence length $l_p$ depends on the average cosine of the turn angle, $\\langle \\cos\\theta \\rangle$. Using the given mapping (turn angle $\\theta=0$ for trans, $\\theta=\\pi/3$ for gauche), we have:\n$$ \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle = p_{\\mathrm{t}}\\cos(0) + (p_{\\mathrm{g}^+} + p_{\\mathrm{g}^-})\\cos(\\pi/3) = p_{\\mathrm{t}} + (1 - p_{\\mathrm{t}})\\cos(\\pi/3) $$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi/3) = 0.5$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle = p_{\\mathrm{t}} + 0.5(1 - p_{\\mathrm{t}}) = 0.5(1 + p_{\\mathrm{t}}) $$\nThis relation holds for both AA and UA models. For each chain $j$, we have:\n$$ \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle_{j}^{\\mathrm{AA}} = 0.5(1 + p_{\\mathrm{t},j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}) $$\n$$ \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle^{\\mathrm{UA}} = 0.5(1 + p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}(k_3^{\\text{opt}})) $$\nNote that $\\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle^{\\mathrm{UA}}$ is the same for all chains as it depends only on the globally calibrated $p_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{UA}}$.\n\n**2.2. Calculation of Persistence Length Ratio**\nThe persistence length is given by $l_p = -b / \\ln \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle$, where $b = 0.154 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is the bond length. The ratio $r_j = l_p^{\\mathrm{UA}} / l_p^{\\mathrm{AA}}$ for each chain is:\n$$ r_j = \\frac{l_{p,j}^{\\mathrm{UA}}}{l_{p,j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}} = \\frac{-b / \\ln \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle^{\\mathrm{UA}}}{-b / \\ln \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle_{j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}} = \\frac{\\ln \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle_{j}^{\\mathrm{AA}}}{\\ln \\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle^{\\mathrm{UA}}} $$\nThis final ratio is dimensionless, as the bond length constant $b$ cancels. We compute this ratio for each of the three alkanes.\n\nThe entire procedure is implemented numerically in the following Python code, adhering to the specified numerical methods and constants.",
