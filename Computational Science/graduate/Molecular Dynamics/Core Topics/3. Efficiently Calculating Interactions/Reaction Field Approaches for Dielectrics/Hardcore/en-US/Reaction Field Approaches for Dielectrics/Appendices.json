A polynomial with six constraints must have at least six coefficients, corresponding to a degree of $5$. To simplify the algebra, we define a normalized coordinate $x$ that maps the interval $[r_s, r_c]$ to $[0, 1]$:\n$$\nx(r) = \\frac{r - r_s}{r_c - r_s}\n$$\nThe conditions on $s(r)$ translate to conditions on a new polynomial $P(x) = s(r(x))$:\n$P(0) = 1$, $P'(0) = 0$, $P''(0) = 0$\n$P(1) = 0$, $P'(1) = 0$, $P''(1) = 0$\nThe derivatives are related by the chain rule, e.g., $s'(r) = P'(x) \\frac{dx}{dr} = P'(x) \\frac{1}{r_c - r_s}$. Since $\\frac{1}{r_c - r_s}$ is a non-zero constant, $s^{(n)}(r)|_{r=r_{s,c}} = 0$ implies $P^{(n)}(x)|_{x=0,1} = 0$.\n\nWe propose a fifth-degree polynomial for $P(x)$:\n$$\nP(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0\n$$\nApplying the conditions at $x=0$:\n- $P(0) = c_0 = 1$\n- $P'(x) = 5c_5 x^4 + 4c_4 x^3 + 3c_3 x^2 + 2c_2 x + c_1 \\implies P'(0) = c_1 = 0$\n- $P''(x) = 20c_5 x^3 + 12c_4 x^2 + 6c_3 x + 2c_2 \\implies P''(0) = 2c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$\n\nSo far, $P(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + 1$. Applying the conditions at $x=1$:\n- $P(1) = c_5 + c_4 + c_3 + 1 = 0$\n- $P'(1) = 5c_5 + 4c_4 + 3c_3 = 0$\n- $P''(1) = 20c_5 + 12c_4 + 6c_3 = 0$\n\nThis forms a system of three linear equations for the remaining coefficients $c_3, c_4, c_5$. Solving this system yields:\n$$\nc_3 = -10, \\quad c_4 = 15, \\quad c_5 = -6\n$$\nThus, the polynomial in the normalized coordinate is:\n$$\nP(x) = -6x^5 + 15x^4 - 10x^3 + 1\n$$\nThe final switching function $s(r)$ is obtained by substituting back $x = (r-r_s)/(r_c-r_s)$.\n\n### Part 2: Simulation Methodology\n\nThe dynamics of the two-particle system are reduced to a one-dimensional problem governed by the equation of motion for the relative coordinate $r(t)$:\n$$\n\\mu \\ddot{r}(t) = F^{\\mathrm{tot}}(r)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$ is the reduced mass and $F^{\\mathrm{tot}}(r)$ is the total one-dimensional force. The total force is a sum of the harmonic bond force $F_{\\mathrm{bond}}(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr} U_{\\mathrm{bond}} = -k_b(r-r_0)$ and the electrostatic force, which is defined differently for the two models.\n\n**Model A (Coulomb-only switching):**\nThe electrostatic force $F_A(r)$ is the bare Coulomb force $F_{\\mathrm{C}}(r) = k_e \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$ smoothly switched to zero at the cutoff $r_c$. The total force is:\n$$\nF^{\\mathrm{tot}}_A(r) =\n\\begin{cases}\nF_{\\mathrm{C}}(r) - k_b(r-r_0),  r \\le r_s \\\\\ns(r) F_{\\mathrm{C}}(r) - k_b(r-r_0),  r_s  r  r_c \\\\\n-k_b(r-r_0),  r \\ge r_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Model B (Coulomb to Reaction Field Blending):**\nThe electrostatic force $F_B(r)$ is a blend of the Coulomb force and the reaction field force, $F_{\\mathrm{RF}}(r) = k_e q_1 q_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{r^2} - \\frac{r}{r_c^3}\\right)$. The total force is:\n$$\nF^{\\mathrm{tot}}_B(r) =\n\\begin{cases}\nF_{\\mathrm{C}}(r) - k_b(r-r_0),  r \\le r_s \\\\\n\\left[ s(r)F_{\\mathrm{C}}(r) + (1-s(r))F_{\\mathrm{RF}}(r) \\right] - k_b(r-r_0),  r_s  r  r_c \\\\\n-k_b(r-r_0),  r \\ge r_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNote that for $r \\ge r_c$, the electrostatic force is zero because $F_{\\mathrm{RF}}(r) = 0$ for $r \\ge r_c$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe equation of motion is integrated numerically using the velocity Verlet algorithm, a time-reversible and symplectic integrator widely used in molecular dynamics. For a time step $\\Delta t$, the positions $r$ and velocities $v$ are updated as:\n1.  $v(t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) = v(t) + \\frac{1}{2} a(t) \\Delta t$\n2.  $r(t + \\Delta t) = r(t) + v(t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) \\Delta t$\n3.  $a(t + \\Delta t) = F^{\\mathrm{tot}}(r(t + \\Delta t)) / \\mu$\n4.  $v(t + \\Delta t) = v(t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2} a(t + \\Delta t) \\Delta t$\n\nThe simulation is performed using SI units for all quantities to ensure physical consistency and avoid conversion errors.\n\n### Part 3: Spectral Analysis\n\nThe vibrational spectrum is extracted from the time series of the interparticle distance, $r(t_n)$. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Mean Removal:** The mean value of the trajectory, $\\langle r \\rangle$, is subtracted from the signal to isolate the oscillatory component: $r'(t_n) = r(t_n) - \\langle r \\rangle$. This removes the large zero-frequency (DC) component from the spectrum.\n2.  **Windowing:** The mean-removed signal is multiplied by a Hann window function. This tapers the signal to zero at the beginning and end, reducing spectral leakage artifacts that arise from the finite-time nature of the signal.\n3.  **Fourier Transform:** The one-sided power spectrum of the windowed signal is computed using the real-valued Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n4.  **Peak Identification:** The dominant vibrational frequency, $f_{\\max}$, is identified as the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the power spectrum, excluding the zero-frequency bin.\n\nThis process is performed for the trajectories generated by both Model A and Model B, yielding frequencies $f_{\\max}^{(A)}$ and $f_{\\max}^{(B)}$. The final reported quantity is the frequency shift $\\Delta f = f_{\\max}^{(B)} - f_{\\max}^{(A)}$, reported in terahertz (THz).",
