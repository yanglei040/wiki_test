This polynomial can also be factored as $S(t) = (1-t)^3 (1 + 3t + 6t^2)$, which makes it clear that $S(1)$, $S'(1)$, and $S''(1)$ are all zero. Specifically, the factor $(1-t)^3$ ensures that the function and its first two derivatives vanish at $t=1$.",

            "problem": "In Molecular Dynamics (MD), a common strategy to mitigate artifacts when truncating a pair interaction with radial separation $r$ is to multiply the pair potential $V(r)$ by a switching function $S(r)$ that transitions smoothly from $1$ to $0$ across a window $[r_{\\mathrm{on}}, r_{\\mathrm{off}}]$, with $r_{\\mathrm{on}}  r_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Consider two choices for $S(r)$ within this window: (i) a polynomial switching function that enforces continuity of the potential, force, and curvature at the endpoints by satisfying $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) = 1$, $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0$, $S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) = S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0$, and $S''(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) = S''(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0$; and (ii) a logistic switching function $S(r) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{a(r - r_0)}}$ with steepness parameter $a > 0$ and center $r_0$. Suppose the logistic is centered at $r_0 = \\dfrac{r_{\\mathrm{on}} + r_{\\mathrm{off}}}{2}$, and define the window width $w = r_{\\mathrm{off}} - r_{\\mathrm{on}}$. Assume $V(r)$ is twice continuously differentiable on $[r_{\\mathrm{on}}, r_{\\mathrm{off}}]$ and outside the window.\n\nStarting from first principles (force equals minus the radial derivative of the potential energy), and using the definitions above, answer the following by selecting all correct statements. Assume a symmetric tolerance $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1/2)$ is used to define the effective onset and cutoff for the logistic by the conditions $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) = 1 - \\varepsilon$ and $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) = \\varepsilon$.\n\nA. The force error relative to the unswitched interaction induced by any switching function $S(r)$ is $\\delta F(r) = - S'(r) \\, V(r) + \\bigl(1 - S(r)\\bigr) \\, V'(r)$.\n\nB. Under the symmetric tolerance condition with $r_0 = \\dfrac{r_{\\mathrm{on}} + r_{\\mathrm{off}}}{2}$, the steepness parameter that places $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$ and $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})$ at $1 - \\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon$ respectively is $a = \\dfrac{2 \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{1 - \\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}{w}$.\n\nC.

Equating this with the logistic’s maximum slope $\\dfrac{a}{4}$ yields $a = \\dfrac{7.5}{w}$.\n\nD. Because the potential is merely scaled by $S(r)$, the only contribution of switching to the force is $- V(r) S'(r)$; the term involving $V'(r)$ cancels for any $S(r)$.\n\nE.

The critical points in $[0, 1]$ are $x=0$, $x=1/2$, and $x=1$.\n    The values of the derivative at these points are $S'(0)=0$, $S'(1)=0$, and $S'(1/2) = -30(1/2)^2(1/2-1)^2 = -30(1/4)(-1/2)^2 = -30/16 = -1.875$.\n    The maximum magnitude of $S'(x)$ on $[0, 1]$ is $|-1.875| = 1.875$.\n    Using the chain rule, $\\dfrac{dS}{dr} = \\dfrac{dS}{dx}\\dfrac{dx}{dr} = S'(x) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{w}$.\n    The maximum magnitude of $\\dfrac{dS}{dr}$ is $\\dfrac{1}{w} \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} |S'(x)| = \\dfrac{1.875}{w}$.

The term involving $V'(r)$ is $-S(r)V'(r)$. This term is non-zero for $r \\in [r_{\\mathrm{on}}, r_{\\mathrm{off}})$ where $S(r) \\neq 0$. It does not cancel out. The statement is a misinterpretation of the product rule.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Option E Analysis\n\nThis option makes two claims.\n\n1.  **Guarantees of the polynomial switch.**\n    We need to check continuity of the potential $U(r)$, force $-U'(r)$, and curvature $U''(r)$ at the boundaries $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n    - **Potential $U(r)$**: At $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $U(r) \\to V(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$ from below. From above, $U(r) \\to S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Since $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=1$, potential is continuous. At $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $U(r) \\to S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V(r_{\\mathrm{off}})$ from below. Since $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$, this is $0$. From above, $U(r)=0$. Potential is continuous.\n    - **Force $-U'(r)$**: At $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $U'(r) \\to V'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$ from below. From above, $U'(r) \\to S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) + S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Using $S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=0$ and $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=1$, this becomes $V'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Force is continuous. At $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $U'(r) \\to S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) + S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})$. Using $S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$ and $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$, this is $0$. From above, $U'(r)=0$. Force is continuous.\n    - **Curvature $U''(r)$**: At $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $U''(r) \\to V''(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$ from below. From above, $U''(r) \\to S''(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) + 2S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V'(r_{\\mathrm{on}}) + S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})V''(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Using $S''(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=0$, $S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=0$, and $S(r_{\\mathrm{on}})=1$, this becomes $V''(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$. Curvature is continuous. At $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $U''(r) \\to S''(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) + 2S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V'(r_{\\mathrm{off}}) + S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})V''(r_{\\mathrm{off}})$. Using $S''(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$, $S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$, and $S(r_{\\mathrm{off}})=0$, this is $0$. From above, $U''(r)=0$. Curvature is continuous.\n    The first claim is correct.\n\n2.  **Limitations of the logistic switch.**\n    The derivative is $S'(r) = \\dfrac{-a e^{a(r - r_0)}}{(1 + e^{a(r - r_0)})^2}$. For $S'(r)$ to be zero, the numerator must be zero. Since $a0$ and $e^x  0$ for all real $x$, the numerator $-a e^{a(r - r_0)}$ can never be zero for any finite value of $r$. The derivative $S'(r)$ only approaches $0$ as $r \\to \\pm\\infty$. As $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$ are finite points, it is impossible for $S'(r_{\\mathrm{on}})$ or $S'(r_{\\mathrm{off}})$ to be exactly $0$ for any finite steepness $a$. The second claim is also correct.\n\nSince both claims in the statement are correct, the option is correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in satisfying the criterion of consistency in reduced variables, often related to the principle of corresponding states.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Pure Component Interaction in Reduced Units**\nFor a pure component $k$, the LJ potential is $u_{kk}(r) = 4 \\varepsilon_k \\left[ \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma_k}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma_k}{r} \\right)^6 \\right]$. We can define a reduced distance $r_k^* = r/\\sigma_k$ and a reduced potential $u_{kk}^* = u_{kk}/\\varepsilon_k$. In these variables, the potential becomes:\n$$u_{kk}^*(r_k^*) = 4 \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{r_k^*} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{1}{r_k^*} \\right)^6 \\right]$$\nThis reduced potential function is universal for all species described by the LJ potential.\n\nThe switching distances for species $k$ are given as $r_{s,kk} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_k$ and $r_{c,kk} = \\alpha_c \\sigma_k$. In reduced units, these become:\n$$r_{s,kk}^* = \\frac{r_{s,kk}}{\\sigma_k} = \\alpha_s$$\n$$r_{c,kk}^* = \\frac{r_{c,kk}}{\\sigma_k} = \\alpha_c$$\nThis means that for any pure component, the switching always occurs over the same reduced distance interval $[\\alpha_s, \\alpha_c]$. To maintain this universality, the switching function $s_{kk}(r)$ must itself be a function of the reduced distance, i.e., $s_{kk}(r) = S(r/\\sigma_k) = S(r_k^*)$, where $S$ is a universal shape function.\n\nThe switched potential in reduced units is $u_{kk}^{\\text{sw},*}(r_k^*) = \\frac{u_{kk}^{\\text{sw}}(r)}{\\varepsilon_k} = S(r_k^*) u_{kk}^*(r_k^*)$. This entire expression is universal for any pure component $k$.\n\n**2. Application to the Cross Interaction**\nThe problem demands that the cross interaction $u_{ij}(r)$ follows the same construction in its own reduced variable framework. The characteristic length and energy scales for the cross interaction are $\\sigma_{ij}$ and $\\varepsilon_{ij}$, respectively. We define the reduced distance as $r_{ij}^* = r/\\sigma_{ij}$.\n\nThe \"consistency\" criterion means that the switching for the $ij$ interaction must also occur over the reduced interval $[\\alpha_s, \\alpha_c]$. That is, the switching start and end points in reduced units for the cross-interaction, $r_{s,ij}^* = r_{s,ij}/\\sigma_{ij}$ and $r_{c,ij}^* = r_{c,ij}/\\sigma_{ij}$, must be equal to $\\alpha_s$ and $\\alpha_c$.\nThis leads directly to the definitions for the absolute switching distances:\n$$r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij}$$\n$$r_{c,ij} = \\alpha_c \\sigma_{ij}$$\n\n**3. Analysis of the Smoothness Criterion**\nThe second criterion requires continuity of the potential $u_{ij}^{\\text{sw}}(r) = s_{ij}(r)u_{ij}(r)$ and the force $F_{ij}^{\\text{sw}}(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr}u_{ij}^{\\text{sw}}(r)$.\n\n-   The potential for $r \\le r_{s,ij}$ is simply $u_{ij}(r)$. At $r = r_{s,ij}$, continuity requires $s_{ij}(r_{s,ij})u_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = u_{ij}(r_{s,ij})$, which implies $s_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 1$.\n-   The potential for $r \\ge r_{c,ij}$ is $0$. At $r = r_{c,ij}$, continuity requires $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij})u_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, which implies $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$.\n\n-   The force is $F_{ij}^{\\text{sw}}(r) = - \\left[ s_{ij}'(r)u_{ij}(r) + s_{ij}(r)u_{ij}'(r) \\right]$.\n-   The force for $r \\le r_{s,ij}$ is $F_{ij}(r) = -u_{ij}'(r)$. At $r = r_{s,ij}$, continuity requires $-\\left[ s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij})u_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) + s_{ij}(r_{s,ij})u_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) \\right] = -u_{ij}'(r_{s,ij})$. Substituting $s_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 1$, we get $-s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij})u_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) - u_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) = -u_{ij}'(r_{s,ij})$, which simplifies to $s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij})u_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 0$. As $u_{ij}(r_{s,ij})$ is generally non-zero, this requires $s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) = 0$.\n-   The force for $r \\ge r_{c,ij}$ is $0$. At $r = r_{c,ij}$, continuity requires $-\\left[ s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij})u_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) + s_{ij}(r_{c,ij})u_{ij}'(r_{c,ij}) \\right] = 0$. Substituting $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, this becomes $-s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij})u_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, which requires $s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij}) = 0$.\n\nIn summary, the smoothness criterion requires the switching function $s_{ij}(r)$ to satisfy four boundary conditions:\n1.  $s_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 1$\n2.  $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$\n3.  $s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) = 0$\n4.  $s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij}) = 0$\n\nA spline function constructed to satisfy these conditions, defined over a normalized variable $y = \\dfrac{r - r_{s,ij}}{r_{c,ij} - r_{s,ij}}$, ensures that the *shape* of the switching function is universal, thus satisfying the consistency criterion for the function itself.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Choose $r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij}$ and $r_{c,ij} = \\alpha_c \\sigma_{ij}$, and construct $s_{ij}(r)$ over $\\left[r_{s,ij}, r_{c,ij}\\right]$ using a spline that enforces $s_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 1$, $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, and $s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) = s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, with the spline variable defined by the reduced coordinate $y = \\dfrac{r - r_{s,ij}}{r_{c,ij} - r_{s,ij}}$.**\n\n-   **Distances**: The choice $r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij}$ and $r_{c,ij} = \\alpha_c \\sigma_{ij}$ is exactly what is required for consistency in reduced variables, as derived above.\n-   **Smoothness**: The specified spline conditions ($s_{ij}(r_{s,ij}) = 1$, $s_{ij}(r_{c,ij}) = 0$, $s_{ij}'(r_{s,ij}) = 0$, $s_{ij}'(r_{c,ij}) = 0$) are precisely the conditions needed for continuity of potential and force.\n-   **Spline Variable**: The use of the normalized coordinate $y$ ensures the shape of the switching function is universal and correctly maps the physical distance interval $[r_{s,ij}, r_{c,ij}]$ to the mathematical interval $[0, 1]$ over which the spline is defined.\nThis option correctly and fully satisfies all stated criteria.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Choose $r_{s,ij} = \\dfrac{r_{s,i} + r_{s,j}}{2}$ and $r_{c,ij} = \\dfrac{r_{c,i} + r_{c,j}}{2}$, and reuse the pure component switching functions without modifying the spline variable.**\n\n-   **Distances**: Let's analyze the proposed distances. $r_{s,i} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_i$ and $r_{s,j} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_j$. Therefore, $r_{s,ij} = \\dfrac{\\alpha_s \\sigma_i + \\alpha_s \\sigma_j}{2} = \\alpha_s \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2} \\right)$. Given the Lorentz-Berthelot rule $\\sigma_{ij} = \\dfrac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2}$, this becomes $r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij}$. Similarly, $r_{c,ij} = \\alpha_c \\sigma_{ij}$. The proposed distances are mathematically identical to those in option A and are therefore correct.\n-   **Function Construction**: The phrase \"reuse the pure component switching functions without modifying the spline variable\" is problematic. It is ambiguous which function to reuse ($s_{ii}(r)$ or $s_{jj}(r)$ or some combination). Furthermore, if we reuse, for instance, $s_{ii}(r)$, its definition depends on the spline variable $y_i = \\dfrac{r - r_{s,ii}}{r_{c,ii} - r_{s,ii}}$. This function is non-trivial only on the interval $[r_{s,ii}, r_{c,ii}]$, which in general is not the same as the required interval $[r_{s,ij}, r_{c,ij}]$ unless $\\sigma_i = \\sigma_j$. Using a function defined on the wrong interval is incorrect. This part of the proposal is inconsistent and ill-defined.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Choose $r_{s,ij} = \\min\\{r_{s,i}, r_{s,j}\\}$ and $r_{c,ij} = \\min\\{r_{c,i}, r_{c,j}\\}$, and define $s_{ij}(r)$ by mapping the shorter window to the cross interaction to ensure more conservative truncation.**\n\n-   **Distances**: Let's assume $\\sigma_i \\le \\sigma_j$ without loss of generality. Then $r_{s,i} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_i \\le \\alpha_s \\sigma_j = r_{s,j}$. So, $r_{s,ij} = \\min\\{r_{s,i}, r_{s,j}\\} = r_{s,i} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_i$. The consistency principle requires $r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij} = \\alpha_s \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2} \\right)$. These are not equal unless $\\sigma_i = \\sigma_j$. The reduced switching start distance would be $r_{s,ij}/\\sigma_{ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_i / \\sigma_{ij}$, which is not the constant $\\alpha_s$. This violates the consistency criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Choose $r_{s,ij} = \\sqrt{r_{s,i} r_{s,j}}$ and $r_{c,ij} = \\sqrt{r_{c,i} r_{c,j}}$, and define $s_{ij}(r)$ in terms of the absolute distance $r$ so that the spline variable is $y = \\dfrac{r - r_{s,ij}}{r_{c,ij} - r_{s,ij}}$ but without reference to $\\sigma_{ij}$.**\n\n-   **Distances**: The proposed rule is $r_{s,ij} = \\sqrt{(\\alpha_s \\sigma_i)(\\alpha_s \\sigma_j)} = \\alpha_s \\sqrt{\\sigma_i \\sigma_j}$. The consistency principle requires $r_{s,ij} = \\alpha_s \\sigma_{ij} = \\alpha_s \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2} \\right)$. By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_i \\sigma_j} \\le \\dfrac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2}$, with equality holding only if $\\sigma_i = \\sigma_j$. Thus, this \"geometric mean\" rule for the switching distances is inconsistent with the \"arithmetic mean\" rule used for the underlying $\\sigma_{ij}$ parameter, violating the consistency criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
