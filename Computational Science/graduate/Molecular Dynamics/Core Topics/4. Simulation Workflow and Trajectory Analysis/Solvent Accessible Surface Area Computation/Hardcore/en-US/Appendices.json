            "problem": "Consider a three-dimensional molecular dynamics setting in which the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of an atom is modeled by the surface of a sphere of radius $R_i = r_i + r_p$ centered at the atom, where $r_i$ is the atom’s van der Waals radius and $r_p$ is the spherical probe radius. A neighboring atom $j$ with van der Waals radius $r_j$ occludes part of the SASA of atom $i$ via its own exclusion sphere of radius $R_j = r_j + r_p$, whose center is separated from atom $i$ by a center-to-center distance $d_{ij}$.

            "solution": "The problem is dissected into three parts: a geometric derivation, a numerical calculation, and a conceptual explanation regarding the inclusion-exclusion principle in the context of Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) computation.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the height and area of the occluded spherical cap on atom $i$ due to a neighboring atom $j$.\nLet sphere $i$ be centered at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, with radius $R_i$. Let sphere $j$, with radius $R_j$, be centered at $(d_{ij}, 0, 0)$ on the x-axis, where $d_{ij}$ is the center-to-center distance. The equations for the two spheres are:\nSphere $i$: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_i^2$\nSphere $j$: $(x-d_{ij})^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_j^2$\n\nThe intersection of these two spheres is a circle that lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting their centers (the x-axis). To find the position of this plane, we can subtract the second equation from the first, which yields an equation for points $(x,y,z)$ that lie on both surfaces:\n$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - ((x-d_{ij})^2 + y^2 + z^2) = R_i^2 - R_j^2$\n$x^2 - (x^2 - 2xd_{ij} + d_{ij}^2) = R_i^2 - R_j^2$\n$2xd_{ij} - d_{ij}^2 = R_i^2 - R_j^2$\nSolving for $x$, we find the position of the intersection plane:\n$$x = \\frac{R_i^2 - R_j^2 + d_{ij}^2}{2d_{ij}}$$\nThis value of $x$ represents the distance from the center of sphere $i$ to the flat base of the spherical cap. The height of the spherical cap, denoted by $h$, is the distance from the pole of the sphere (at $x=R_i$) to this base. Thus, the height $h$ of the cap on sphere $i$ is:\n$$h = R_i - x = R_i - \\frac{R_i^2 - R_j^2 + d_{ij}^2}{2d_{ij}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the area of this spherical cap using calculus, as requested. The area of a surface of revolution generated by a curve $y=f(x)$ for $x \\in [a,b]$ revolved around the x-axis is given by the integral $A = \\int_a^b 2\\pi y \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} dx$.\nFor sphere $i$, the generating curve is the semicircle $y = \\sqrt{R_i^2 - x^2}$. The derivative is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y' = \\frac{-x}{\\sqrt{R_i^2 - x^2}}$.\nThe term $\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$ is:\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{-x}{\\sqrt{R_i^2 - x^2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{x^2}{R_i^2 - x^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i^2 - x^2 + x^2}{R_i^2 - x^2}} = \\frac{R_i}{\\sqrt{R_i^2 - x^2}} = \\frac{R_i}{y}$$\nThe integrand $2\\pi y \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$ simplifies to $2\\pi y \\left(\\frac{R_i}{y}\\right) = 2\\pi R_i$, which is a constant.\nThe spherical cap extends from the base at $x = R_i - h$ to the pole at $x=R_i$. We integrate over this interval:\n$$A_{cap} = \\int_{R_i - h}^{R_i} 2\\pi R_i dx = 2\\pi R_i [x]_{R_i - h}^{R_i} = 2\\pi R_i (R_i - (R_i - h))$$\nThis gives the well-known formula for the area of a spherical cap:\n$$A_{cap} = 2\\pi R_i h$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $h$, the occluded area on atom $i$ is:\n$$A_{cap} = 2\\pi R_i \\left(R_i - \\frac{R_i^2 - R_j^2 + d_{ij}^2}{2d_{ij}}\\right)$$\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value of the occluded area for the given parameters.\nThe givens are: $r_i = 1.6 \\, \\text{Å}$, $r_j = 1.7 \\, \\text{Å}$, $r_p = 1.4 \\, \\text{Å}$, and $d_{ij} = 4.8 \\, \\text{Å}$.\nFirst, we calculate the radii of the exclusion spheres, $R_i$ and $R_j$:\n$R_i = r_i + r_p = 1.6 + 1.4 = 3.0 \\, \\text{Å}$\n$R_j = r_j + r_p = 1.7 + 1.4 = 3.1 \\, \\text{Å}$\nWe verify that the spheres intersect: $|R_i - R_j| = |3.0 - 3.1| = 0.1 \\, \\text{Å}$, and $R_i + R_j = 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1 \\, \\text{Å}$. Since $0.1  d_{ij} = 4.8  6.1$, a circle of intersection exists.\nNow, we calculate the height $h$ of the cap on sphere $i$:\n$$h = R_i - \\frac{R_i^2 - R_j^2 + d_{ij}^2}{2d_{ij}} = 3.0 - \\frac{(3.0)^2 - (3.1)^2 + (4.8)^2}{2(4.8)}$$\n$$h = 3.0 - \\frac{9.0 - 9.61 + 23.04}{9.6} = 3.0 - \\frac{22.43}{9.6}$$\n$$h = 3.0 - 2.3364583... \\approx 0.6635417 \\text{ Å}$$\nThe occluded area on atom $i$ is:\n$$A_{cap} = 2\\pi R_i h = 2\\pi (3.0)(0.6635417...) = 6\\pi(0.6635417...) \\approx 12.50854 \\, \\text{Å}^2$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the occluded area is $12.51 \\, \\text{Å}^2$.\n\nThird, we explain the failure of a naively truncated inclusion-exclusion principle for SASA computation.\nThe total occluded area on a central atom $i$ by a set of neighboring atoms $\\{j, k, l, \\dots\\}$ is the measure (area) of the union of the individual occluded caps, $|\\cup_n C_n|$, where $C_n$ is the cap occluded by neighbor $n$. The principle of inclusion-exclusion provides an exact expression for this area:\n$$|\\cup_n C_n| = \\sum_j |C_j| - \\sum_{jk} |C_j \\cap C_k| + \\sum_{jkl} |C_j \\cap C_k \\cap C_l| - \\dots$$\nHere, $|C_j|$ is the area of a single cap, which we calculated in the first part. The terms $|C_j \\cap C_k|$, $|C_j \\cap C_k \\cap C_l|$, etc., represent the areas of higher-order intersections of these caps on the spherical surface of atom $i$.\nA \"naive application that truncates at pairwise overlaps\" attempts to approximate the total occluded area by computing only the first two terms:\n$$|\\cup_n C_n| \\approx \\sum_j |C_j| - \\sum_{jk} |C_j \\cap C_k|$$\nThis truncation fails because it is not a general identity; it is an approximation that is only valid if all higher-order intersection areas are zero. In a realistic molecular context, it is common for the exclusion spheres of three or more neighbors (e.g., $j$, $k$, and $l$) to overlap simultaneously on the surface of atom $i$. This creates a region of triple occlusion, $C_j \\cap C_k \\cap C_l$, which has a non-zero area. This region is a curvilinear \"spherical triangle\" on the surface of sphere $i$.\nThe failure of the truncated formula can be understood from a set-measure perspective. A point located in the triple-overlap region $C_j \\cap C_k \\cap C_l$ is counted three times in the sum $\\sum_j |C_j|$ and subtracted three times in the sum $\\sum_{jk} |C_j \\cap C_k|$. Its net contribution to the truncated sum is $3 - 3 = 0$. However, as part of the total occluded region $\\cup_n C_n$, its area should be counted exactly once. The full inclusion-exclusion principle correctly accounts for this by adding back the triply-counted area in the third term, $+|C_j \\cap C_k \\cap C_l|$.\nTherefore, truncating the series at the pairwise term systematically ignores the contributions from regions occluded by three or more neighbors, leading to an incorrect result (specifically, an underestimation of the total occluded area and thus an overestimation of the final SASA). The geometric complexity of calculating the areas of these higher-order intersections (spherical polygons with circular arcs) on a curved surface is precisely what makes accurate analytical SASA computation a non-trivial algorithmic challenge.",

            "problem": "Consider a single atom labeled $i$ of van der Waals radius $r_{i}$ immersed in solvent. The Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) is the area of the surface traced by the center of a spherical solvent probe of radius $r_{p}$ as it rolls over the atom. In the standard “rolling probe” construction, the set of points reached by the probe center on atom $i$ is the surface of the expanded sphere of radius $R_{i} = r_{i} + r_{p}$ centered at atom $i$. A planar slice at signed distance $d$ from the center of atom $i$ intersects this expanded sphere in a circle of radius $a(d)$. \n\nFirst, starting from the geometry of the intersection of a sphere and a plane, derive the expression for the slice circle radius $a(d)$ and show that it is $a(d) = \\sqrt{(r_{i} + r_{p})^{2} - d^{2}}$. Next, suppose there is a single neighboring atom $j$ of the same van der Waals radius $r_{j} = r_{i}$ whose center lies a distance $S$ from the center of atom $i$. Assume the neighbor’s expanded sphere also has radius $R_{j} = r_{j} + r_{p} = R_{i}$, and that its center lies in the equatorial plane of atom $i$ (so that the line joining the centers is perpendicular to the slice normal and at zero height, $d = 0$, relative to atom $i$’s center). In each slice at distance $d$, the neighbor induces an occluding circle whose intersection with the $i$-circle removes an angular arc from exposure. Using circle–circle intersection geometry on that slice, express the exposed-arc half-angle $\\phi(d)$ on the $i$-circle in terms of the projected center separation and the two slice radii. Then, by connecting this slice-wise occlusion to the global spherical geometry on the expanded sphere, show how the union of occluded arcs across all slices corresponds to a spherical cap and determine the total occluded area on the expanded sphere as a function of $S$ and $R_{i}$. \n\nFinally, for the numerical values $r_{i} = 1.50 \\, \\text{Å}$, $r_{p} = 1.40 \\, \\text{Å}$, and $S = 4.00 \\, \\text{Å}$, compute the SASA of atom $i$. This is equal to the accessible surface area on the expanded sphere. Express the final SASA in square ångströms and round your answer to four significant figures. The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation of the Slice Circle Radius $a(d)$**\nLet the center of the expanded sphere of atom $i$ be at the origin of a coordinate system. The equation of this sphere is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_i^2$, where $R_i = r_i + r_p$. A planar slice at a signed distance $d$ from the center can be represented by the plane $z=d$ without loss of generality. The intersection of the sphere and the plane is a circle. For any point on this circle, its $z$-coordinate is $d$. Substituting this into the sphere's equation gives $x^2 + y^2 + d^2 = R_i^2$, which can be rewritten as $x^2 + y^2 = R_i^2 - d^2$. This is the equation of a circle in the plane $z=d$, centered on the $z$-axis, with a radius squared of $R_i^2 - d^2$. The radius of this circle, denoted $a(d)$, is therefore $\\sqrt{R_i^2 - d^2}$. Substituting $R_i = r_i + r_p$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$a(d) = \\sqrt{(r_i + r_p)^2 - d^2}$$\nThis is valid for $|d| \\le R_i$. If $|d| > R_i$, the plane does not intersect the sphere.\n\n**Part 2: Exposed-Arc Half-Angle $\\phi(d)$**\nConsider a slice at distance $d$. This slice contains two circles corresponding to the intersections with the expanded spheres of atoms $i$ and $j$. Since $R_i = R_j$, both circles have the same radius, $a(d)$. The line joining the centers of the atoms, of length $S$, lies in the $d=0$ plane and is perpendicular to the slice normal (the $z$-axis). This means that in any slice plane $z=d$, the centers of the two circles are separated by the same distance $S$.\nLet the center of circle $i$ be at the origin $(0,0)$ of the slice plane, and the center of circle $j$ be at $(S,0)$. The intersection of these two circles defines the occluded arc on circle $i$. Let an intersection point be $P$. The triangle formed by the two centers and $P$ is an isosceles triangle with side lengths $a(d)$, $a(d)$, and $S$.\nThe half-angle of the occluded arc, let's call it $\\alpha_{occ}(d)$, can be found by considering the right-angled triangle formed by the center of circle $i$, the midpoint of the segment connecting the centers, and the intersection point $P$. From this geometry, we have:\n$$\\cos(\\alpha_{occ}(d)) = \\frac{S/2}{a(d)} = \\frac{S}{2a(d)}$$\nThus, the occluded half-angle is $\\alpha_{occ}(d) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{S}{2a(d)}\\right)$. The problem asks for the exposed-arc half-angle, $\\phi(d)$. The total exposed angle is $2\\pi - 2\\alpha_{occ}(d)$. The exposed-arc half-angle is therefore $\\pi - \\alpha_{occ}(d)$.\n$$\\phi(d) = \\pi - \\arccos\\left(\\frac{S}{2a(d)}\\right) = \\pi - \\arccos\\left(\\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{R_i^2 - d^2}}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 3: Total Occluded Area on the Expanded Sphere**\nThe union of all occluded arcs on all slices from $d = -R_i$ to $d = +R_i$ forms the total occluded surface area on the expanded sphere of atom $i$. This area is the portion of sphere $i$'s surface that lies inside sphere $j$.\nLet the center of expanded sphere $i$ be at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and the center of expanded sphere $j$ be at $(S,0,0)$. The surfaces are given by:\nSphere $i$: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_i^2$\nSphere $j$: $(x-S)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_j^2$\nSince $R_i = R_j$, we find the intersection by subtracting the equations:\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - ((x-S)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = R_i^2 - R_j^2 \\implies 2Sx - S^2 = 0 \\implies x = S/2$.\nThe intersection of the two spheres is a circle lying in the plane $x = S/2$. The occluded area on sphere $i$ is the part of its surface for which $x > S/2$. This is a spherical cap.\nThe area of a spherical cap is given by the formula $A_{cap} = 2\\pi R h$, where $R$ is the sphere's radius and $h$ is the cap's height.\nFor sphere $i$, the radius is $R_i$. The height of the cap, $h_{cap}$, is the distance from the pole of the cap (point $(R_i, 0, 0)$) to the base plane of the cap (plane $x=S/2$).\n$$h_{cap} = R_i - \\frac{S}{2}$$\nThis is valid provided the spheres intersect, i.e., $S  2R_i$, which ensures $h_{cap} > 0$. The total occluded area on the expanded sphere of atom $i$ is:\n$$A_{occ, exp} = 2\\pi R_i h_{cap} = 2\\pi R_i \\left(R_i - \\frac{S}{2}\\right) = \\pi R_i (2R_i - S)$$\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Calculation of SASA**\nThe SASA is the accessible area on the expanded sphere, $A_{acc, exp}$. The total surface area of the expanded sphere is $A_{total, exp} = 4\\pi R_i^2$. The accessible area is the total area minus the occluded area:\n$$A_{SASA} = A_{acc, exp} = A_{total, exp} - A_{occ, exp} = 4\\pi R_i^2 - \\pi R_i (2R_i - S)$$\n$$A_{SASA} = 2\\pi R_i^2 + \\pi R_i S = \\pi R_i (2R_i + S)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$r_i = 1.50 \\, \\text{Å}$\n$r_p = 1.40 \\, \\text{Å}$\n$S = 4.00 \\, \\text{Å}$\n\nFirst, calculate the expanded radius $R_i$:\n$R_i = r_i + r_p = 1.50 + 1.40 = 2.90 \\, \\text{Å}$.\n\nCheck the intersection condition: $2R_i = 2 \\times 2.90 = 5.80 \\, \\text{Å}$. Since $S=4.00 \\, \\text{Å}  5.80 \\, \\text{Å}$, the spheres intersect and there is occlusion.\n\nNow compute the SASA:\n$$A_{SASA} = \\pi R_i (2R_i + S) = \\pi (2.90) (2 \\times 2.90 + 4.00)$$\n$$A_{SASA} = \\pi (2.90) (5.80 + 4.00) = \\pi (2.90) (9.80)$$\n$$A_{SASA} = 28.42\\pi \\approx 89.284... \\, \\text{Å}^2$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $89.28$.

The sign convention used here is that curvatures are positive for a convex surface like a sphere, when viewed from the exterior.\n\nThe total area of the parallel surface is the integral over the base surface:\n$$\nS(r_p) = \\int_{\\Sigma_0} (1 + \\kappa_1 r_p)(1 + \\kappa_2 r_p) dA_0\n$$\nThis can be expanded in terms of the mean curvature $H = (\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2)/2$ and the Gaussian curvature $K = \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2$:\n$$\nS(r_p) = \\int_{\\Sigma_0} (1 + 2H r_p + K r_p^2) dA_0\n$$\nThe problem states that the base surface (the van der Waals surface) has uniform principal curvature radii, both equal to $R_c$. This implies the principal curvatures are constant over the entire surface:\n$$\n\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = \\frac{1}{R_c}\n$$\nTherefore, the mean and Gaussian curvatures are also constant:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1/R_c + 1/R_c}{2} = \\frac{1}{R_c}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_c}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{R_c}\\right) = \\frac{1}{R_c^2}\n$$\nSince $H$ and $K$ are constant, we can take the term $(1 + 2H r_p + K r_p^2)$ outside the integral:\n$$\nS(r_p) = (1 + 2H r_p + K r_p^2) \\int_{\\Sigma_0} dA_0\n$$\nLet $S_0 = \\int_{\\Sigma_0} dA_0$ be the area of the base van der Waals surface. Substituting the expressions for $H$ and $K$:\n$$\nS(r_p) = S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{2r_p}{R_c} + \\frac{r_p^2}{R_c^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is a perfect square:\n$$\nS(r_p) = S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_p}{R_c}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we can compute the SASA for the two probe radii, $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$\nS(r_1) = S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_1}{R_c}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nS(r_2) = S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_2}{R_c}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe fractional change $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{S(r_2) - S(r_1)}{S(r_1)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S(r_1)$ and $S(r_2)$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_2}{R_c}\\right)^2 - S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_1}{R_c}\\right)^2}{S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{r_1}{R_c}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThe base area $S_0$ cancels out, which is expected as it was not provided:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{r_2}{R_c}\\right)^2}{\\left(1 + \\frac{r_1}{R_c}\\right)^2} - 1 = \\left(\\frac{1 + r_2/R_c}{1 + r_1/R_c}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by combining terms within the parentheses:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{R_c + r_2}{R_c}}{\\frac{R_c + r_1}{R_c}}\\right)^2 - 1 = \\left(\\frac{R_c + r_2}{R_c + r_1}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the fractional change in SASA under the given assumptions.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the values:\n- $r_1 = 0.14\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $r_2 = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $R_c = 0.28\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{0.28 + 0.20}{0.28 + 0.14}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{0.48}{0.42}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\nThe ratio can be simplified:\n$$\n\\frac{0.48}{0.42} = \\frac{48}{42} = \\frac{8 \\times 6}{7 \\times 6} = \\frac{8}{7}\n$$\nNow, substitute this simplified fraction back into the equation for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{8}{7}\\right)^2 - 1 = \\frac{64}{49} - 1 = \\frac{64 - 49}{49} = \\frac{15}{49}\n$$\nTo obtain the final answer, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{15}{49} \\approx 0.30612244...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx 0.3061\n$$\nThis is the fractional change in the solvent accessible surface area.",
