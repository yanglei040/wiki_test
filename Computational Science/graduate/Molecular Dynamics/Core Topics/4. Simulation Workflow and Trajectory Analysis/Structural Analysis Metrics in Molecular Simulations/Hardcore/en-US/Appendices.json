            "problem": "In a homogeneous and isotropic molecular fluid at equilibrium, the radial distribution function (RDF) $g(r)$ is defined as the ratio of the conditional pair number density at a separation $r$ to the bulk number density $\\rho$. Starting from this probabilistic definition and elementary geometric considerations, derive an expression for the expected number of neighbors within a sphere of radius $R$ centered on a tagged particle in terms of $g(r)$, $\\rho$, and $R$.\n\nThen, consider a monatomic Lennard–Jones-like fluid simulated in reduced units in which distances are measured in units of a characteristic length $\\sigma$ (so that $r$ is expressed in units of $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$ is expressed in units of $\\sigma^{-3}$).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of an expression for the expected number of neighbors, $N(R)$, within a sphere of radius $R$ centered on a tagged particle.\n\nThe radial distribution function, $g(r)$, provides the ratio of the local number density of particles at a distance $r$ from a central particle, let's call it $\\rho(r)$, to the average bulk number density, $\\rho$. This is expressed as:\n$$\ng(r) = \\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\rho}\n$$\nFrom this definition, the local number density at a distance $r$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\rho g(r)\n$$\nTo find the number of particles in a thin, spherical shell of radius $r$ and infinitesimal thickness $dr$ around the central particle, we multiply the local density $\\rho(r)$ by the volume of this shell, $dV$.

Using the derived formula:\n$$\nN(1.5) = 4\\pi\\rho \\int_0^{1.5} g(r) r^2 dr\n$$\nDue to the piecewise nature of $g(r)$, we split the integral at $r=1$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{1.5} g(r) r^2 dr = \\int_0^1 g(r) r^2 dr + \\int_1^{1.5} g(r) r^2 dr\n$$\nFor the interval $0 \\le r < 1$, $g(r) = 0$, so the first integral is zero:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (0) r^2 dr = 0\n$$\nFor the interval $1 \\le r \\le 1.5$, we first simplify the expression for $g(r)$ with $a=1.5$:\n$$\ng(r) = 1 + 1.5(1 - 2(r - 1)) = 1 + 1.5(1 - 2r + 2) = 1 + 1.5(3 - 2r) = 1 + 4.5 - 3r = 5.5 - 3r\n$$\nNow we evaluate the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_1^{1.5} (5.5 - 3r) r^2 dr = \\int_1^{1.5} (5.5r^2 - 3r^3) dr\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\left[ 5.5 \\frac{r^3}{3} - 3 \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_1^{1.5} = \\left[ \\frac{11}{6}r^3 - \\frac{3}{4}r^4 \\right]_1^{1.5}\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at the upper limit $r=1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$ and the lower limit $r=1$.\nAt $r = 1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{11}{6}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 - \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{11}{6}\\left(\\frac{27}{8}\\right) - \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{81}{16}\\right) = \\frac{11 \\cdot 9}{16} - \\frac{243}{64} = \\frac{99}{16} - \\frac{243}{64} = \\frac{396}{64} - \\frac{243}{64} = \\frac{153}{64}\n$$\nAt $r=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{11}{6}(1)^3 - \\frac{3}{4}(1)^4 = \\frac{11}{6} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{22-9}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}\n$$\nThe value of the definite integral is the difference between these two results:\n$$\n\\int_1^{1.5} g(r) r^2 dr = \\frac{153}{64} - \\frac{13}{12} = \\frac{153 \\cdot 3}{192} - \\frac{13 \\cdot 16}{192} = \\frac{459 - 208}{192} = \\frac{251}{192}\n$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $N(1.5)$ along with the given value $\\rho = 0.85$:\n$$\nN(1.5) = 4\\pi\\rho \\left( \\frac{251}{192} \\right) = 4\\pi(0.85)\\left(\\frac{251}{192}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nN(1.5) = \\pi(0.85)\\left(\\frac{251}{48}\\right)\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\nN(1.5) \\approx (3.14159265...)(0.85)\\left(\\frac{251}{48}\\right) \\approx (2.6703537...)(5.2291666...) \\approx 13.963836\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nN(1.5) \\approx 13.96\n$$\nThis value represents the expected number of particles within a radius of $1.5\\sigma$ from a central particle.",

            "problem": "Consider a classical equilibrium atomistic simulation of $N$ identical particles of number density $\\rho$ in a cubic periodic simulation cell of side length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Interparticle separations are computed using the minimum image convention (MIC), meaning that for any pair of particles with displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij}$ in the primary box, the separation used for structural metrics is the unique vector in the set $\\{\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} + L \\boldsymbol{n} : \\boldsymbol{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\}$ with each Cartesian component confined to the interval $\\left[-\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}\\right)$.

No numerical evaluation or units are required. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the maximum radius, $r_{\\max}$, for which a radial distribution function (RDF), $g(r)$, can be accurately computed in a cubic simulation box of side length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and the minimum image convention (MIC), using the standard spherical shell normalization.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the geometry of the problem. The simulation is conducted in a primary cubic cell. A reference particle can be considered to be at the origin. The positions of all other particles are represented by their displacement vectors relative to this reference particle. The minimum image convention (MIC) ensures that for any pair of particles, the displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{r}$ used for calculations is the one with the shortest length among all periodic images. For a cubic box of side length $L$ centered at the origin, the MIC maps any displacement vector into a unique vector whose Cartesian components $(x, y, z)$ are each confined to the interval $\\left[-\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThis means that the domain from which all interparticle separations are sampled is a cube, let's call it the MIC domain $\\mathcal{D}$, centered at the origin with side length $L$. Mathematically, this domain is:\n$$ \\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid -\\frac{L}{2} \\le x < \\frac{L}{2}, \\quad -\\frac{L}{2} \\le y < \\frac{L}{2}, \\quad -\\frac{L}{2} \\le z < \\frac{L}{2} \\right\\} $$\n\nThe radial distribution function $g(r)$ measures the probability of finding a particle at a radial distance $r$ from a reference particle, relative to that of an ideal gas at the same density. In a simulation, it is estimated by histogramming pair distances into bins of width $\\Delta r$. The number of pairs found in a shell between $r$ and $r + \\Delta r$, denoted $N(r, \\Delta r)$, is normalized by the volume of that shell and the average number of particles expected in that volume.\n\nThe problem states that the normalization is done using the \"nominal spherical shell volume,\" which is $V_{\\text{shell}} = 4 \\pi r^{2} \\Delta r$. The use of this formula is predicated on the assumption that the sampling volume is a complete, untruncated spherical shell. An RDF estimate is free from geometric artifacts only if this assumption holds true.\n\nThis assumption is valid only as long as the entire sphere of radius $r$, centered on the reference particle (at the origin of the MIC domain), is fully contained within the MIC domain $\\mathcal{D}$. If any part of the sphere extends beyond the boundaries of $\\mathcal{D}$, the actual volume being sampled is smaller than $4 \\pi r^2 \\Delta r$, and the sampling is no longer isotropic (directionally uniform).\n\nTo find the maximum radius $r_{\\max}$ for which this condition holds, we must find the largest sphere that can be inscribed within the cubic MIC domain $\\mathcal{D}$. A sphere of radius $r$ centered at the origin will be fully contained within $\\mathcal{D}$ if and only if its radius is less than or equal to the shortest distance from the origin to the boundary of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nThe boundaries of the MIC domain $\\mathcal{D}$ are the six planes defined by $x = \\pm \\frac{L}{2}$, $y = \\pm \\frac{L}{2}$, and $z = \\pm \\frac{L}{2}$. The points on the boundary closest to the origin are the centers of these faces, for example, the point $\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, 0, 0\\right)$. The distance from the origin to this point is:\n$$ d_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nAny point on a face is at least this far from the origin. The corners of the cube, such as $\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}\\right)$, are the farthest points on the boundary, at a distance of $\\sqrt{3 \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}L}{2}$.\n\nFor the sampling sphere to be entirely contained within the MIC domain, its radius $r$ must not exceed the shortest distance to the boundary. Therefore, the maximum radius for a geometrically unbiased RDF measurement is:\n$$ r_{\\max} = \\frac{L}{2} $$\n\nNow, we must explain why RDF estimates for radii $r > r_{\\max}$ are biased if one continues to use the normalization factor $4 \\pi r^{2} \\Delta r$.\n\nWhen $r > r_{\\max} = \\frac{L}{2}$, the sphere of radius $r$ is no longer entirely contained within the MIC domain $\\mathcal{D}$. The sphere is truncated by the faces of the cubic box. The actual volume being sampled for pair counting, $V_{\\text{actual}}(r, \\Delta r)$, is the volume of the intersection of the spherical shell with the cube $\\mathcal{D}$. This volume is strictly less than the volume of a full spherical shell, i.e., $V_{\\text{actual}}(r, \\Delta r) < 4 \\pi r^2 \\Delta r$.\n\nThe calculated RDF is of the form:\n$$ g(r) \\approx \\frac{N(r, \\Delta r)}{N_{\\text{pairs}} \\cdot (\\text{Volume of shell}) / V_{\\text{box}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{box}}}{N_{\\text{pairs}}} \\frac{N(r, \\Delta r)}{4 \\pi r^2 \\Delta r} $$\nwhere $N(r, \\Delta r)$ is the number of pairs counted, which are, by construction, only pairs found *inside* the truncated volume $V_{\\text{actual}}(r, \\Delta r)$. Since we are dividing the observed pair count by a normalization volume ($4 \\pi r^2 \\Delta r$) that is larger than the volume from which the pairs were actually sampled ($V_{\\text{actual}}(r, \\Delta r)$), the resulting value of $g(r)$ is systematically and artificially underestimated. This bias becomes more severe as $r$ increases, causing $g(r)$ to erroneously tend toward zero for $r > L/2$.\n\nThe geometric origin of the bias is twofold:\n1.  **Shell Truncation**: As explained, the sampled volume is smaller than the nominal normalization volume. This leads to an incorrect magnitude for $g(r)$.\n2.  **Directional Anisotropy**: The truncation is not uniform in all directions. For $r > L/2$, pair vectors directed along the Cartesian axes are \"cut off,\" while those directed towards the corners of the cube can still be observed up to a distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}L}{2}$. This means the orientational averaging implicit in the RDF is corrupted. The sampled space is not spherically symmetric, so reducing the pair correlation information to a purely radial function $g(r)$ becomes geometrically inconsistent. The very definition of a \"radial\" distribution function is compromised because the sampling geometry is no longer isotropic.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the ensemble-averaged Centrosymmetry Parameter (CSP), $\\langle P \\rangle$, for a central atom in a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal. The derivation should be based on the Einstein model of thermal vibrations in the classical limit.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the definition of the CSP and its value in a perfect, static lattice (at absolute zero temperature, $T=0$). The central atom is located at a lattice site, which we can define as the origin, so its equilibrium position is $\\mathbf{L}_{0} = \\mathbf{0}$. The $12$ nearest neighbors are at equilibrium positions $\\mathbf{L}_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, 12$. The problem specifies that the neighbors are indexed such that for $i=1, \\ldots, 6$, the pair of neighbors $i$ and $i+6$ are inversion-symmetric with respect to the central atom. This implies $\\mathbf{L}_{i+6} = -\\mathbf{L}_{i}$.\n\nIn the absence of thermal motion, the instantaneous position vector $\\mathbf{R}_{i}$ from the central atom to neighbor $i$ is simply the equilibrium lattice vector, $\\mathbf{R}_{i} = \\mathbf{L}_{i}$. The CSP is defined as:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\| \\mathbf{R}_{i} + \\mathbf{R}_{i+6} \\right\\|^{2}\n$$\nFor the static lattice, we substitute $\\mathbf{R}_{i} = \\mathbf{L}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{i+6} = \\mathbf{L}_{i+6}$:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\| \\mathbf{L}_{i} + \\mathbf{L}_{i+6} \\right\\|^{2}\n$$\nUsing the inversion-symmetry property $\\mathbf{L}_{i+6} = -\\mathbf{L}_{i}$, each term in the summation becomes:\n$$\n\\left\\| \\mathbf{L}_{i} + (-\\mathbf{L}_{i}) \\right\\|^{2} = \\left\\| \\mathbf{0} \\right\\|^{2} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, for a perfect static lattice, the CSP is $P = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} 0 = 0$. This confirms that the CSP is a measure of deviation from perfect centrosymmetry.\n\nNext, we introduce thermal vibrations as described by the Einstein model. In this model, each atom $j$ undergoes harmonic motion about its equilibrium lattice site $\\mathbf{L}_{j}$. The instantaneous position of atom $j$ is given by $\\mathbf{r}_{j} = \\mathbf{L}_{j} + \\mathbf{u}_{j}$, where $\\mathbf{u}_{j}$ is the thermal displacement vector. The central atom is indexed by $j=0$, so its instantaneous position is $\\mathbf{r}_{0} = \\mathbf{L}_{0} + \\mathbf{u}_{0} = \\mathbf{u}_{0}$.\n\nThe instantaneous vector from the central atom to neighbor $i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{i} = \\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{r}_{0} = (\\mathbf{L}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i}) - \\mathbf{u}_{0}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the inversion-symmetric partner $i+6$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{i+6} = \\mathbf{r}_{i+6} - \\mathbf{r}_{0} = (\\mathbf{L}_{i+6} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6}) - \\mathbf{u}_{0}\n$$\nWe compute the sum $\\mathbf{R}_{i} + \\mathbf{R}_{i+6}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{i} + \\mathbf{R}_{i+6} = (\\mathbf{L}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i} - \\mathbf{u}_{0}) + (\\mathbf{L}_{i+6} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - \\mathbf{u}_{0})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{L}_{i+6} = -\\mathbf{L}_{i}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{i} + \\mathbf{R}_{i+6} = \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0}\n$$\nThe CSP is then given by:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the ensemble average $\\langle P \\rangle$. Using the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\n\\langle P \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\langle \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nLet's expand the squared norm term before taking the average:\n$$\n\\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} = (\\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0})\n$$\n$$\n= \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} \\right\\|^{2} + \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} \\right\\|^{2} + 4\\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} + 2\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 4\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{0} - 4\\mathbf{u}_{i+6}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{0}\n$$\nNow we take the ensemble average. The problem states that the displacements have zero mean ($\\langle \\mathbf{u}_{j} \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$) and are uncorrelated for different atoms ($j \\neq k$). This implies that for $j \\neq k$, $\\langle \\mathbf{u}_{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{k} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha=x,y,z} \\langle u_{j\\alpha} u_{k\\alpha} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\langle u_{j\\alpha} \\rangle \\langle u_{k\\alpha} \\rangle = 0$. Since the indices $0$, $i$, and $i+6$ refer to three distinct atoms, all the cross-term averages are zero: $\\langle \\mathbf{u}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{i+6} \\rangle = 0$, $\\langle \\mathbf{u}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\rangle = 0$, and $\\langle \\mathbf{u}_{i+6}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\rangle = 0$.\nThe expectation of the squared norm term becomes:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} + \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} - 2\\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} \\right\\rangle = \\langle \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i} \\right\\|^{2} \\rangle + \\langle \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{i+6} \\right\\|^{2} \\rangle + 4\\langle \\left\\| \\mathbf{u}_{0} \\right\\|^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nIn the Einstein model, all atoms are identical, so their mean-squared displacements are equal. Let's denote this common value by $\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle + \\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle + 4\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle = 6\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nThis result is independent of the index $i$. To find $\\langle P \\rangle$, we sum this identical term $6$ times:\n$$\n\\langle P \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} 6\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle = 36\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nThe next step is to relate $\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle$ to the temperature $T$ using the equipartition theorem. The potential energy of a single atom oscillating around its lattice site is $V = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_E^2 \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_E^2(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + u_z^2)$. This potential energy has three quadratic terms corresponding to the three Cartesian coordinates. According to the classical equipartition theorem, each quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian has an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$. Applying this to the potential energy term for the x-component:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_E^2 u_x^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T\n$$\n$$\nm\\omega_E^2 \\langle u_x^2 \\rangle = k_B T \\quad \\implies \\quad \\langle u_x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{m\\omega_E^2}\n$$\nSince the vibrations are isotropic, $\\langle u_x^2 \\rangle = \\langle u_y^2 \\rangle = \\langle u_z^2 \\rangle$. The total mean-squared displacement is the sum of the components:\n$$\n\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle = \\langle u_x^2 \\rangle + \\langle u_y^2 \\rangle + \\langle u_z^2 \\rangle = 3\\langle u_x^2 \\rangle = 3 \\frac{k_B T}{m\\omega_E^2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\langle \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\rangle$ into our equation for $\\langle P \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle P \\rangle = 36 \\left( 3 \\frac{k_B T}{m\\omega_E^2} \\right) = 108 \\frac{k_B T}{m\\omega_E^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the ensemble-averaged CSP. Regarding its sensitivity to temperature, the expression shows that $\\langle P \\rangle$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. The sensitivity, $\\frac{d\\langle P \\rangle}{dT} = \\frac{108 k_B}{m\\omega_E^2}$, is a positive constant. This linear relationship is characteristic of the classical treatment of harmonic oscillators and indicates that the structural deviation from perfect centrosymmetry, as measured by the CSP, increases linearly with temperature in this model. The units of the expression are $[L^2]$, which corresponds to m$^2$ in the SI system, as requested.",
