            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  A classical many-particle system in the canonical ensemble at absolute temperature $T$.\n2.  The microcanonical density of states is approximated by the model $g(E) = A E^{s}$ for an energy domain $E \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n3.  The constant prefactor is given as $A > 0$.\n4.  The real exponent is given as $s > -1$.\n5.  The energy spectrum is continuous.\n6.  The system is assumed to be ergodic.\n7.  The canonical ensemble is assumed to be well defined.\n8.  The objective is to derive closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function $Z(T)$, the internal energy $U(T)$, and the constant-volume heat capacity $C(T)$.\n9.  The derivation must start from the definitions of the canonical ensemble and the Boltzmann factor.\n10. The derivation must justify the mathematical conditions on $s$ required for convergence.\n11. The results are to be expressed as functions of $T$, $A$, $s$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.\n\nThis problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical statistical mechanics and uses a standard, solvable model for the density of states. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($g(E)$, constraints on parameters) to derive the requested quantities. The terminology is precise and objective. The constraints, such as $s > -1$, are physically and mathematically justified. The problem constitutes a standard exercise in connecting microcanonical and canonical ensemble descriptions and is free from the flaws listed in the validation protocol.\n\nWe now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe canonical partition function, $Z(T)$, for a system with a continuous energy spectrum is defined as the integral of the density of states $g(E)$ weighted by the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-\\beta E)$, over all possible energies. Here, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n\n$$Z(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\n\nSubstituting the given model for the density of states, $g(E) = A E^s$, we obtain:\n\n$$Z(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (A E^s) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE = A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E^s \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\beta E$. This implies $E = \\frac{u}{\\beta}$ and $dE = \\frac{1}{\\beta} du$. The limits of integration remain unchanged, from $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$.\n\n$$Z(T) = A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{u}{\\beta}\\right)^s \\exp(-u) \\frac{1}{\\beta} du$$\n$$Z(T) = A \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)^s \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^s \\exp(-u) du$$\n$$Z(T) = A \\beta^{-(s+1)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^s \\exp(-u) du$$\n\nThe integral is the definition of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt$. To match this form, we write $u^s$ as $u^{(s+1)-1}$.\n\n$$Z(T) = A \\beta^{-(s+1)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{(s+1)-1} \\exp(-u) du = A \\beta^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1)$$\n\nFor this integral to converge, the argument of the Gamma function must be greater than zero. That is, $s+1 > 0$, which implies $s > -1$. This condition is necessary because the behavior of the integrand near $u=0$ is approximately $u^s$. The integral $\\int_0^\\epsilon u^s du$ converges only if $s > -1$. The exponential term $\\exp(-u)$ ensures convergence as $u \\to \\infty$. The condition $s > -1$, given in the problem statement, is thus the precise mathematical requirement for the partition function to be finite.\n\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$ back into the expression for $Z(T)$:\n\n$$Z(T) = A \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) = A (k_B T)^{s+1} \\Gamma(s+1)$$\n\nNext, we derive the internal energy $U(T)$, which is the average energy of the system in the canonical ensemble. It is calculated from the partition function as:\n\n$$U(T) = \\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta}$$\n\nTo simplify the differentiation, we use the expression for $Z$ in terms of $\\beta$:\n$Z(\\beta) = A \\Gamma(s+1) \\beta^{-(s+1)}$.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n\n$$\\ln Z(\\beta) = \\ln(A \\Gamma(s+1)) + \\ln(\\beta^{-(s+1)})$$\n$$\\ln Z(\\beta) = \\ln(A \\Gamma(s+1)) - (s+1) \\ln \\beta$$\n\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\beta$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta} = 0 - (s+1) \\frac{1}{\\beta} = -\\frac{s+1}{\\beta}$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $U(T)$:\n\n$$U(T) = -\\left(-\\frac{s+1}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{s+1}{\\beta}$$\n\nFinally, replacing $\\beta$ with $\\frac{1}{k_B T}$:\n\n$$U(T) = (s+1) k_B T$$\n\nThe units of $k_B$ are Joules per Kelvin (J/K) and $T$ are Kelvin (K), so the units of $U(T)$ are Joules, as required.\n\nLastly, we derive the constant-volume heat capacity, $C(T)$, which is defined as the partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature at constant volume. The setup implicitly assumes constant volume as $g(E)$ is not given as a function of volume.\n\n$$C(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$$\n\nUsing the derived expression for $U(T)$:\n\n$$C(T) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left((s+1) k_B T\\right)$$\n\nSince $s$ and $k_B$ are constants, the differentiation yields:\n\n$$C(T) = (s+1) k_B$$\n\nThe units of $k_B$ are J/K, so the units of $C(T)$ are Joules per Kelvin, as required. The heat capacity for this model is a constant, independent of temperature.\n\nThe three derived quantities are:\n1.  Canonical Partition Function: $Z(T) = A (k_B T)^{s+1} \\Gamma(s+1)$\n2.  Internal Energy: $U(T) = (s+1) k_B T$\n3.  Constant-Volume Heat Capacity: $C(T) = (s+1) k_B$",

We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Exact Quantum Counting ($N_{\\mathrm{exact}}$)**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a single particle of mass $m$ in a 2D square box of side $L$ are given by:\n$$ E_{n_x, n_y} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2) $$\nwhere $n_x$ and $n_y$ are positive integers ($1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\nLet's define a fundamental energy unit $\\epsilon_0 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The single-particle energy is $E_{n_x, n_y} = \\epsilon_0 (n_x^2 + n_y^2)$. The total energy cutoff is given as $E_c = 12\\epsilon_0$.\n\nThe total energy of the two-boson system is the sum of the energies of the two occupied single-particle states, $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.

A two-boson microstate is defined by the unordered set of two occupied single-particle states, $\\{ (n_{x1}, n_{y1}), (n_{x2}, n_{y2}) \\}$.\n\nFirst, we list the low-lying single-particle states and their energies in units of $\\epsilon_0$:\n- State $(1,1)$: Energy $1^2+1^2 = 2$.\n- States $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$: Energy $1^2+2^2 = 5$.

It presents a standard problem in statistical thermodynamics, requiring the derivation of the entropy change due to a change in molecular symmetry. All necessary data and foundational equations are provided. The idealizations made—such as identical moments of inertia and vibrational spectra for two different isomers—are explicitly stated as assumptions to isolate the specific effect of rotational symmetry, which is a valid and common approach in theoretical problems. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the canonical partition function, $Z$, for a system of $N$ non-interacting, indistinguishable molecules at a fixed temperature $T$ and volume $V$:\n$$Z = \\frac{z^N}{N!}$$\nwhere $z$ is the single-molecule partition function.

Since the spectra are identical, $z_{\\text{vib}, A} = z_{\\text{vib}, B}$.\n-   $z_{\\text{elec}}$ depends on electronic energy levels and $T$. With identical ground-state energies and assuming negligible population of excited states, $z_{\\text{elec}, A} = z_{\\text{elec}, B}$.\n-   The rotational partition function for a non-linear molecule is given by $z_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{z'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma}$, where $z'_{\\text{rot}}$ is the part dependent on the moments of inertia and temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the rotational symmetry number.

Then:\n$$F_A = F_{\\text{common}}(T) + N k_B T \\ln(\\sigma_A)$$\n$$F_B = F_{\\text{common}}(T) + N k_B T \\ln(\\sigma_B)$$\n\nNow, we derive the entropy, $S = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$.\nFor isomer $A$:\n$$S_A = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_A}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = -\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{common}}(T)}{\\partial T} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left( N k_B T \\ln(\\sigma_A) \\right)$$\nSince $\\sigma_A$ is a constant, the derivative of the second term is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(C T) = C$. So,\n$$S_A = -\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{common}}(T)}{\\partial T} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_A)$$\nSimilarly, for isomer $B$:\n$$S_B = -\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{common}}(T)}{\\partial T} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_B)$$\nLet $S_{\\text{common}} = -\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{common}}(T)}{\\partial T}$. The entropies are:\n$$S_A = S_{\\text{common}} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_A)$$\n$$S_B = S_{\\text{common}} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_B)$$\n\nThe entropy change, $\\Delta S$, for the transformation from isomer $A$ to isomer $B$ is $\\Delta S = S_B - S_A$.\n$$\\Delta S = (S_{\\text{common}} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_B)) - (S_{\\text{common}} - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_A))$$\n$$\\Delta S = - N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_B) + N k_B \\ln(\\sigma_A)$$\n$$\\Delta S = N k_B \\left( \\ln(\\sigma_A) - \\ln(\\sigma_B) \\right) = N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B}\\right)$$\n\nTo find the molar entropy change, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}}$, we set $N$ to Avogadro's constant, $N_A$, and use the relationship for the molar gas constant, $R = N_A k_B$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} = N_A k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B}\\right) = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\sigma_B}\\right)$$\nThis is the required analytic expression. The transformation from $A$ to $B$ is a reduction in symmetry ($\\sigma_A = 6$ to $\\sigma_B = 3$), which corresponds to an increase in the number of distinct rotational states, and therefore an increase in entropy. The derived expression, with $\\sigma_A > \\sigma_B$, correctly yields a positive $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n$\\sigma_A = 6$\n$\\sigma_B = 3$\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right) = R \\ln(2)$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times \\ln(2)$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 8.314462618 \\times 0.69314718\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5.76281014\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5.763\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$",
