A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires computing the Jacobian determinants for two specified coordinate transformations. The Jacobian determinant of a transformation measures the factor by which volume elements are stretched or compressed.\n\n**Part 1: Jacobian of the Momentum Rescaling**\n\nLet the initial coordinates be denoted by $X = (\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{p})$ and the transformed coordinates by $X' = (\\mathbf{q}', \\mathbf{p}')$. The transformation is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{q}' = \\mathbf{q} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{p}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{p} $$\nThe phase space is $6N$-dimensional, with coordinates $(q_{1,1}, \\dots, q_{N,3}, p_{1,1}, \\dots, p_{N,3})$. The Jacobian matrix of the transformation, $J_1$, is a $6N \\times 6N$ matrix whose elements are $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial X'_i}{\\partial X_j}$. Due to the structure of the transformation, this matrix is block-diagonal:\n$$ J_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe evaluate each block:\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}$: Since $\\mathbf{q}' = \\mathbf{q}$, this is the $3N \\times 3N$ identity matrix, $I_{3N}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}$: Since $\\mathbf{q}'$ has no dependence on $\\mathbf{p}$, this is the $3N \\times 3N$ zero matrix, $0_{3N \\times 3N}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}$: Since $\\mathbf{p}'$ has no dependence on $\\mathbf{q}$, this is the $3N \\times 3N$ zero matrix, $0_{3N \\times 3N}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}$: Since $\\mathbf{p}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{p}$, the derivative of the $i$-th component of $\\mathbf{p}'$ with respect to the $j$-th component of $\\mathbf{p}$ is $\\frac{\\partial (\\alpha p_i)}{\\partial p_j} = \\alpha \\delta_{ij}$. Thus, this block is $\\alpha$ times the $3N \\times 3N$ identity matrix, $\\alpha I_{3N}$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore:\n$$ J_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} I_{3N} & 0_{3N \\times 3N} \\\\ 0_{3N \\times 3N} & \\alpha I_{3N} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of a block-diagonal matrix is the product of the determinants of its diagonal blocks:\n$$ \\det(J_1) = \\det(I_{3N}) \\cdot \\det(\\alpha I_{3N}) $$\nThe determinant of an identity matrix is $1$. The determinant of a scalar multiple of the identity matrix $cI_k$ is $c^k$. Therefore:\n$$ \\det(J_1) = 1 \\cdot \\alpha^{3N} = \\alpha^{3N} $$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, the determinant is positive, and its magnitude is $|\\det(J_1)| = \\alpha^{3N}$.\n\n**Part 2: Jacobian of the Combined Scaling in Extended Space**\n\nLet the initial coordinates in the extended space be $Y = (\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{m})$ and the transformed coordinates be $Y' = (\\mathbf{q}', \\mathbf{p}', \\mathbf{m}')$. The transformation is defined by:\n$$ \\mathbf{q}' = \\beta \\mathbf{q} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{p}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{p} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{m}' = \\gamma \\mathbf{m} $$\nThe dimension of this extended space is $3N + 3N + N = 7N$. The Jacobian matrix of this transformation, $J_2$, is a $7N \\times 7N$ matrix. As the transformations on $\\mathbf{q}$, $\\mathbf{p}$, and $\\mathbf{m}$ are mutually independent, the Jacobian matrix is block-diagonal:\n$$ J_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{m}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{m}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the determinant of each block:\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{q}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}$: This is the $3N \\times 3N$ matrix $\\beta I_{3N}$. Its determinant is $\\det(\\beta I_{3N}) = \\beta^{3N}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}$: This is the $3N \\times 3N$ matrix $\\alpha I_{3N}$. Its determinant is $\\det(\\alpha I_{3N}) = \\alpha^{3N}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{m}'}{\\partial \\mathbf{m}}$: This is the $N \\times N$ matrix $\\gamma I_{N}$. Its determinant is $\\det(\\gamma I_{N}) = \\gamma^{N}$.\n\nThe determinant of the full Jacobian $J_2$ is the product of the determinants of these blocks:\n$$ \\det(J_2) = \\det(\\beta I_{3N}) \\cdot \\det(\\alpha I_{3N}) \\cdot \\det(\\gamma I_{N}) = \\beta^{3N} \\alpha^{3N} \\gamma^{N} $$\nThe problem requires the magnitude of the Jacobian to be unity, which enforces the invariance of the extended volume element $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{q}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{p}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{m}$. Since $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma > 0$, the determinant is positive, so we set $\\det(J_2) = 1$:\n$$ \\alpha^{3N} \\beta^{3N} \\gamma^{N} = 1 $$\nTo find the condition on $\\gamma$, we solve for it:\n$$ \\gamma^{N} = (\\alpha^{3N} \\beta^{3N})^{-1} = \\alpha^{-3N} \\beta^{-3N} = (\\alpha \\beta)^{-3N} $$\nTaking the $N$-th root of both sides (and knowing $\\gamma > 0$):\n$$ \\gamma = \\left( (\\alpha \\beta)^{-3N} \\right)^{1/N} = (\\alpha \\beta)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{(\\alpha \\beta)^3} $$\nThis is the required condition on $\\gamma$ to ensure the transformation is volume-preserving in the extended space.\n\nThe final results are $|\\det(J_1)| = \\alpha^{3N}$ for part 1, and the expression $\\gamma = (\\alpha \\beta)^{-3}$ for part 2.",

            "solution": "The goal is to assess phase-space volume preservation properties of two numerical integrators for a one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator by estimating the determinant of the Jacobian of the numerical flow map with respect to the initial condition. The starting point is Hamilton's equations derived from the Hamiltonian $$H(q,p)=\\frac{p^2}{2m}+\\frac{k}{2}q^2+\\frac{\\alpha}{4}q^4.$$ The canonical equations of motion are $$\\dot{q}=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}=\\frac{p}{m},\\quad \\dot{p}=-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}=-k\\,q-\\alpha\\,q^3.$$ The exact flow generated by these equations is volume-preserving in the phase space $(q,p)$ according to Liouville's theorem.

Velocity Verlet, derived by Strang splitting of the separable Hamiltonian $H=T(p)+V(q)$.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations. We will proceed step by step.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Extended Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$**\n\nWe are seeking an autonomous Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}(q,p,\\theta,\\pi)$ for the extended phase space with coordinates $(q,p,\\theta,\\pi)$. The dynamics of this system are governed by Hamilton's equations:\n$$ \\dot{q}_{i} = \\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial p_{i}}, \\quad \\dot{p}_{i} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial q_{i}} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\pi}, \\quad \\dot{\\pi} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\theta} $$\n\nWe use the given requirements to determine the functional form of $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n\n- **Requirement 1a**: $\\dot{q}_{i} = p_{i}/m_{i}(\\theta)$.\nComparing with Hamilton's equation $\\dot{q}_{i} = \\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}/\\partial p_{i}$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{p_{i}}{m_{i}(\\theta)} $$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $p_i$ for each $i=1, \\dots, N$ yields:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{ext}}(q,p,\\theta,\\pi) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2\\,m_{i}(\\theta)} + f(q,\\theta,\\pi) $$\nwhere $f$ is an arbitrary function that does not depend on the momenta $p$.\n\n- **Requirement 1b**: $\\dot{p}_{i} = -\\partial V(q,\\theta)/\\partial q_{i}$.\nComparing with Hamilton's equation $\\dot{p}_{i} = -\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}/\\partial q_{i}$, we get:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial q_{i}} = -\\frac{\\partial V(q,\\theta)}{\\partial q_{i}} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{j}^{2}}{2\\,m_{j}(\\theta)} + f(q,\\theta,\\pi) \\right) = \\frac{\\partial V(q,\\theta)}{\\partial q_{i}} $$\nSince the first term is independent of $q$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f(q,\\theta,\\pi)}{\\partial q_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial V(q,\\theta)}{\\partial q_{i}} $$\nIntegrating with respect to the coordinates $q$ implies that $f$ must take the form:\n$$ f(q,\\theta,\\pi) = V(q,\\theta) + g(\\theta,\\pi) $$\nwhere $g$ is an arbitrary function independent of $q$ and $p$. Combining these results, the extended Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{ext}}(q,p,\\theta,\\pi) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2\\,m_{i}(\\theta)} + V(q,\\theta) + g(\\theta,\\pi) = H(q,p,\\theta) + g(\\theta,\\pi) $$\nHere, $H(q,p,\\theta)$ is the original Hamiltonian with time $t$ formally replaced by the coordinate $\\theta$.\n\n- **Requirement 2**: $\\dot{\\theta} = 1$.\nFrom Hamilton's equation $\\dot{\\theta} = \\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}/\\partial \\pi$, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\pi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\pi} \\left( H(q,p,\\theta) + g(\\theta,\\pi) \\right) = \\frac{\\partial g(\\theta,\\pi)}{\\partial \\pi} = 1 $$\nIntegrating with respect to $\\pi$ gives:\n$$ g(\\theta,\\pi) = \\pi + h(\\theta) $$\nwhere $h(\\theta)$ is an arbitrary function of $\\theta$ only. So, the extended Hamiltonian must be of the form:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{ext}}(q,p,\\theta,\\pi) = H(q,p,\\theta) + \\pi + h(\\theta) $$\nThe remaining equation of motion, for $\\dot{\\pi}$, is unconstrained by the problem statement. Any choice of the function $h(\\theta)$ yields a valid Hamiltonian system that satisfies the dynamics for $q$, $p$, and $\\theta$. The function $h(\\theta)$ can be absorbed into the definition of the momentum $\\pi$ via a canonical transformation. Specifically, a transformation to a new momentum $\\Pi = \\pi + h(\\theta)$ leaves the canonical structure for $(q,p)$ and $(\\theta, \\Pi)$ intact and transforms the Hamiltonian to $H(q,p,\\theta) + \\Pi$. Therefore, the simplest and most fundamental form is obtained by setting $h(\\theta) = 0$ (or any constant, which can be absorbed into the total energy level). The problem specifies derivation \"up to an irrelevant additive constant,\" which supports setting $h(\\theta)$ to a constant (e.g., zero). We choose $h(\\theta)=0$.\n\nThus, the required extended Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{ext}}(q,p,\\theta,\\pi) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2\\,m_{i}(\\theta)} + V(q,\\theta) + \\pi $$\n\n**2. Extended Phase-Space Compressibility**\n\nThe phase-space compressibility $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the divergence of the vector field of the flow in the extended phase space. The state vector is $z = (q_1, \\dots, q_N, p_1, \\dots, p_N, \\theta, \\pi)$, and the vector field is $\\dot{z}$.\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\nabla_{z} \\cdot \\dot{z} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}_{i}}{\\partial q_{i}} + \\frac{\\partial \\dot{p}_{i}}{\\partial p_{i}} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\pi}}{\\partial \\pi} $$\nFor any autonomous Hamiltonian system, the components of the vector field are given by Hamilton's equations. Substituting these into the definition of divergence:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial p_{i}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{i}}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial q_{i}}\\right) \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\pi}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\pi}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) $$\nThis can be rewritten using mixed partial derivatives:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial q_{i} \\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial p_{i} \\partial q_{i}} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\pi} - \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\pi \\partial \\theta} \\right) $$\nAssuming the extended Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$), which is a standard assumption for physical Hamiltonians (requiring $m_i$ and $V$ to be sufficiently smooth), Clairaut's theorem on the equality of mixed partial derivatives applies. This means:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial q_{i} \\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial p_{i} \\partial q_{i}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\pi} = \\frac{\\partial^2 H_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\partial \\pi \\partial \\theta} $$\nConsequently, each term in the sum for $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ vanishes identically.\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (0) + 0 = 0 $$\nThis result, known as Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems, confirms that the flow generated by our derived autonomous Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is indeed incompressible (volume-preserving) in the extended phase space, a general property of all Hamiltonian flows.\n\n**3. Construction of a Trotter-Strang Splitting**\n\nA time-reversible, volume-preserving (i.e., symplectic) integrator can be constructed by applying a symmetric splitting scheme, such as the Trotter-Strang splitting, to the extended Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Split the Hamiltonian**: Decompose $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ into a sum of parts, $H_{\\mathrm{ext}} = H_{A} + H_{B} + H_{C} + \\dots$, such that the dynamics generated by each part alone are analytically solvable. A natural splitting for our $H_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is:\n    $$ H_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\underbrace{V(q,\\theta)}_{H_{A}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2\\,m_{i}(\\theta)}}_{H_{B}} + \\underbrace{\\pi}_{H_{C}} $$\n2.  **Solve Subproblems**: For each part, the corresponding Hamilton's equations are simple and can be integrated exactly over a small time step $\\Delta s$.\n    - **Flow under $H_A$**: $q$ and $\\theta$ are constant. $p$ and $\\pi$ are updated by a step proportional to the gradients of $V$.\n    - **Flow under $H_B$**: $p$ and $\\theta$ are constant. $q$ is updated by a step proportional to $p/m(\\theta)$, and $\\pi$ is updated by a step from the $\\theta$-derivative of $H_B$.\n    - **Flow under $H_C$**: $q$, $p$, and $\\pi$ are constant. $\\theta$ is updated as $\\theta \\rightarrow \\theta + \\Delta s$.\n3.  **Symmetric Composition**: A second-order, symmetric integrator for the full dynamics over a step $\\Delta s$ is constructed by composing the exact flows of the subproblems. For the three-part split $A+B+C$, a common Strang splitting is:\n    $$ \\Phi_{\\Delta s} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{2}\\mathcal{L}_{A}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{2}\\mathcal{L}_{B}\\right) \\exp(\\Delta s\\,\\mathcal{L}_{C}) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{2}\\mathcal{L}_{B}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{2}\\mathcal{L}_{A}\\right) $$\n    where $\\exp(\\tau \\mathcal{L}_X)$ denotes the exact flow for time $\\tau$ under Hamiltonian $X$. Because this numerical map is a composition of exact Hamiltonian flows (which are volume-preserving) and the composition is symmetric, the resulting integrator $\\Phi_{\\Delta s}$ is both volume-preserving (symplectic) and time-reversible. This provides the desired integrator for the original non-autonomous system.\n\nThe final answer required is the explicit expression for the extended Hamiltonian.",
