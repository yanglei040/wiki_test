            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical statistical mechanics that requests the derivation of an average property for a system in a canonical ensemble, starting from fundamental definitions. All necessary information is provided, and the setup is free from contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe canonical ensemble average of the potential energy, $\\langle U\\rangle$, is defined as the integral of the potential energy $U(q)$ weighted by the Boltzmann probability density function $p(q)$, integrated over all possible configurations of the coordinate $q$. The probability density is given by $p(q) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\exp(-\\beta U(q))$, where $\\beta = (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)^{-1}$ is the inverse temperature and $Z$ is the partition function, which normalizes the distribution.\n\nThe partition function $Z$ for this one-dimensional system is defined by the integral over the configurational coordinate $q$, which we assume ranges from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$:\n$$ Z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\,dq $$\nGiven the potential energy $U(q) = \\alpha q^{4}$, the partition function is:\n$$ Z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\alpha q^{4}) \\,dq $$\nThe ensemble average of the potential energy is then:\n$$ \\langle U \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} U(q) p(q) \\,dq = \\frac{1}{Z} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} U(q) \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\,dq $$\nSubstituting the expression for $U(q)$:\n$$ \\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (\\alpha q^{4}) \\exp(-\\beta \\alpha q^{4}) \\,dq $$\nA fundamental relation in statistical mechanics allows us to express $\\langle U \\rangle$ in terms of a derivative of the partition function with respect to $\\beta$. We observe that:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\,dq = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\,dq = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} -U(q) \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\,dq $$\nFrom this, it follows that the numerator in the expression for $\\langle U \\rangle$ is equal to $-\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta}$. Therefore, we can write $\\langle U \\rangle$ as:\n$$ \\langle U \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta} $$\nTo use this powerful relation, we must first evaluate the partition function $Z$ as a function of $\\beta$. The integral for $Z$ is a generalized Gaussian integral. We perform a change of variables to evaluate it. Let $x = (\\beta \\alpha)^{1/4} q$. This implies that $q = (\\beta \\alpha)^{-1/4} x$ and the differential element is $dq = (\\beta \\alpha)^{-1/4} dx$. The limits of integration remain from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\n$$ Z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^{4}) (\\beta \\alpha)^{-1/4} \\,dx = (\\beta \\alpha)^{-1/4} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^{4}) \\,dx $$\nThe integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^{4}) \\,dx$ is a definite integral whose value is a constant. We can express this constant using the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z-1} \\exp(-t) \\,dt$. Since the integrand $\\exp(-x^{4})$ is an even function, the integral from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ is twice the integral from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^4) \\,dx = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^4) \\,dx $$\nTo evaluate this, we make another substitution: let $t = x^4$. Then $x = t^{1/4}$ and $dx = \\frac{1}{4} t^{-3/4} \\,dt$. The integral becomes:\n$$ 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t) \\left(\\frac{1}{4} t^{-3/4}\\right) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{1/4 - 1} \\exp(-t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) $$\nLet the constant value of this integral be $C = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$. The partition function can now be written as:\n$$ Z = (\\beta \\alpha)^{-1/4} C = C \\alpha^{-1/4} \\beta^{-1/4} $$\nThe terms $C$ and $\\alpha^{-1/4}$ are constants with respect to $\\beta$. Let us define a new constant $K = C \\alpha^{-1/4}$ which encapsulates all factors independent of $\\beta$.\n$$ Z = K \\beta^{-1/4} $$\nNow we can compute $\\ln Z$:\n$$ \\ln Z = \\ln(K \\beta^{-1/4}) = \\ln K + \\ln(\\beta^{-1/4}) = \\ln K - \\frac{1}{4} \\ln \\beta $$\nFinally, we compute the average energy $\\langle U \\rangle$ by taking the negative partial derivative with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$ \\langle U \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( \\ln K - \\frac{1}{4} \\ln \\beta \\right) = - \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\beta} $$\nSubstituting back the definition of $\\beta = (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{-1}$, we arrive at the final expression for the canonical ensemble average of the potential energy:\n$$ \\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{4} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nThis derivation provides the exact, closed-form expression for $\\langle U \\rangle$.\n\nRegarding the second part of the problem, we must explain the failure of the naive equipartition expectation. The equipartition theorem states that, in thermal equilibrium, the average energy associated with each degree of freedom that appears as a quadratic term in the total energy is $\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. For a configurational coordinate $q$, if the potential energy were quadratic, i.e., $U(q) = c q^2$, the theorem would predict $\\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$.\n\nThe naive expectation fails here because the potential energy is $U(q) = \\alpha q^4$, which is a quartic (fourth-power) term, not a quadratic term. The mathematical derivation of the equipartition theorem relies on the properties of Gaussian integrals that arise from quadratic energy terms. Our derivation, which handles the non-Gaussian integral arising from the quartic potential, yields $\\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. This result is manifestly different from the $\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ expected for a quadratic potential, thereby confirming the inapplicability of the standard equipartition theorem.\n\nThe correct scaling relation can be found by generalizing our derivation for a potential of the form $U(q) \\propto |q|^n$. Following the same procedure, the partition function would be found to be proportional to $\\beta^{-1/n}$. The average energy would then be $\\langle U \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(\\ln Z) \\propto -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(-\\frac{1}{n} \\ln\\beta) = \\frac{1}{n\\beta} = \\frac{1}{n}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. Thus, for a potential energy contribution proportional to the $n$-th power of a coordinate, the correct scaling relation for the average potential energy is $\\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{n}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. For the given quartic potential ($n=4$), this general relation correctly gives $\\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$, replacing the quadratic ($n=2$) relation $\\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$.",

The probability of finding the energy between $K$ and $K+dK$ is obtained by integrating $P(\\mathbf{p})$ over the region of momentum space corresponding to this energy range. Since $P(\\mathbf{p})$ depends only on $K = \\sum p_i^2 / (2m)$, it is constant on the surface defined by a fixed $K$.

Since there are $n_{B_2} = 50$ such molecules, there are $50$ independent constraints of this type. The number of constraints from rigid bonds is $c_{\\text{bonds}} = 50$.\n\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Momentum Constraint**: The total linear momentum of the system, $\\mathbf{P}$, is fixed to zero. The total momentum is the sum of the individual particle momenta:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{P} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\mathbf{v}_i = \\mathbf{0}\n    $$\n    This is a vector equation in three dimensions, which is equivalent to three independent scalar equations for the Cartesian components of the total momentum:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    P_x &= \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_{ix} = 0 \\\\\n    P_y &= \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_{iy} = 0 \\\\\n    P_z &= \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_{iz} = 0\n    \\end{align*}\n    These three equations represent three linear constraints on the velocities of the particles. The number of constraints from fixing the center-of-mass momentum is $c_{\\text{COM}} = 3$.\n\nThe problem states that all constraints are independent. Therefore, the total number of constraints, $c_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the constraints from the bonds and the center-of-mass momentum.\n$$\nc_{\\text{total}} = c_{\\text{bonds}} + c_{\\text{COM}} = 50 + 3 = 53\n$$\n\nThe effective number of independent quadratic degrees of freedom, $f$, is the initial number of degrees of freedom minus the total number of constraints:\n$$\nf = f_{\\text{initial}} - c_{\\text{total}} = 900 - 53 = 847\n$$\n\nThis value, $f=847$, is the number of independent squared standard normal variables that sum to form the quantity $X = 2K/(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$. By definition, $X$ follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $f$ degrees of freedom, denoted $\\chi^2(f)$. The parameter of this distribution is its number of degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the parameter of the $\\chi^2$ distribution for $X$ is $847$.",
