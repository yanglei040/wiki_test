It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. All necessary data are provided, and the task is clearly defined.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single electron of mass $m_e$ and charge $-e$ in the Coulomb potential of a stationary proton (charge $+e$):\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\nabla^{2} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) - \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector of the electron, $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ is its distance from the proton, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity. The operator on the left-hand side is the Hamiltonian, $H$.\n\nThe goal is to non-dimensionalize this equation. We introduce a characteristic length scale $a$ and define a dimensionless position vector $\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}$ such that $\\mathbf{r} = a\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}$. Consequently, the magnitude scales as $r = a\\tilde{r}$.\n\nWe must transform the differential operator $\\nabla^2$ (the Laplacian) to the new coordinate system. The chain rule for partial derivatives gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i} = \\frac{1}{a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i}$$\nThe second partial derivative becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i^2}$$\nThus, the Laplacian operator transforms as:\n$$\\nabla^2 = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i^2} = \\frac{1}{a^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\nabla}^2$ is the Laplacian with respect to the dimensionless coordinates $\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}$.\n\nSubstituting $r = a\\tilde{r}$ and $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{a^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2$ into the TISE, and letting the wavefunction in the new coordinates be $\\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}})$:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^{2}\\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) - \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} (a\\tilde{r})} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) = E \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}})$$\nTo simplify, let us multiply the entire equation by the factor $\\frac{2 m_e a^2}{\\hbar^2}$:\n$$-\\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) - \\left(\\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} a\\tilde{r}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2 m_e a^2}{\\hbar^2}\\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) = \\left(\\frac{2 m_e a^2 E}{\\hbar^2}\\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}})$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of the potential energy term:\n$$-\\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) - \\left(\\frac{2 m_e a e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\hbar^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}) = \\tilde{E} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}})$$\nwhere $\\tilde{E} = \\frac{2 m_e a^2 E}{\\hbar^2}$ is the dimensionless energy eigenvalue.\n\nThe problem requires that the Hamiltonian in dimensionless form be $\\tilde{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} - \\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}}$.

It also requires an analysis of the stability of this timestep by comparing it to the period of the fastest motion in the system, which arises from a harmonic bond.\n\nFirst, we determine the physical time unit corresponding to the reduced unit system. In a Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, reduced units are defined by a characteristic mass $m_0$, a characteristic length $\\sigma$, and a characteristic energy $\\epsilon$. The characteristic time, $\\tau$, can be derived by dimensional analysis.

We transform the derivatives using the chain rule.\nFirst, the time derivatives of $r = \\ell r^*$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\ell r^*)}{d(t^* \\tau)} = \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau} \\frac{dr^*}{dt^*}$$\n$$\\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{\\tau} \\frac{dr^*}{dt^*}\\right) = \\frac{d}{d(t^*\\tau)}\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{\\tau} \\frac{dr^*}{dt^*}\\right) = \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau^2} \\frac{d^2 r^*}{dt^{*2}}$$\nNext, the spatial derivative of the potential $U = \\varepsilon U^*$:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dr} = \\frac{d(\\varepsilon U^*)}{d(\\ell r^*)} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\ell} \\frac{dU^*}{dr^*}$$\nSubstituting these transformed derivatives into the equation of motion yields:\n$$m \\left( \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau^2} \\frac{d^2 r^*}{dt^{*2}} \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\ell} \\frac{dU^*}{dr^*} \\right)$$\nRearranging for the second derivative of $r^*$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d^2 r^*}{dt^{*2}} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon \\tau^2}{m \\ell^2} \\frac{dU^*}{dr^*}$$\nSubstituting the definition of the time scale, $\\tau^2 = (\\ell\\sqrt{m/\\varepsilon})^2 = \\ell^2 m/\\varepsilon$, we find that the prefactor becomes unity:\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon \\tau^2}{m \\ell^2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon (\\ell^2 m/\\varepsilon)}{m \\ell^2} = 1$$\nThis confirms the dimensionless equation of motion provided in the problem statement:\n$$\\frac{d^2 r^*}{dt^{*2}} = -\\frac{dU^*}{dr^*}$$\nNow, we linearize this equation around the potential minimum $r_{\\min}$. The potential is approximated by a quadratic expansion:\n$$U(r) \\approx U(r_{\\min}) + \\frac{1}{2}U''(r_{\\min})(r-r_{\\min})^2$$\nThe corresponding force is $F(r) = -dU/dr \\approx -U''(r_{\\min})(r-r_{\\min})$. The linearized equation of motion in physical units is:\n$$m \\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} \\approx -U''(r_{\\min})(r - r_{\\min})$$\nLet's define the displacement from the minimum as $q(t) = r(t) - r_{\\min}$. Since $r_{\\min}$ is a constant, $d^2q/dt^2 = d^2r/dt^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$m \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} = -U''(r_{\\min})q$$\nWe now non-dimensionalize this linearized equation. The problem specifies using the length scale $\\ell = r_{\\min}$ and the energy scale $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}} = |U(r_{\\min})|$. We use $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}$ to avoid confusion with potential parameters also named $\\varepsilon$. The dimensionless displacement is $q^* = q/\\ell = (r-r_{\\min})/r_{\\min} = r/r_{\\min} - 1 = r^* - 1$.\nUsing the relations $q = \\ell q^*$ and $t = \\tau t^*$, we transform the linearized equation:\n$$m \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau^2} \\frac{d^2 q^*}{dt^{*2}} = -U''(r_{\\min}) (\\ell q^*)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2 q^*}{dt^{*2}} = -\\frac{\\tau^2 U''(r_{\\min})}{m} q^*$$\nSubstituting $\\tau^2 = \\ell^2 m / \\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$\\frac{d^2 q^*}{dt^{*2}} = -\\frac{(\\ell^2 m / \\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}) U''(r_{\\min})}{m} q^* = -\\left(\\frac{\\ell^2 U''(r_{\\min})}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) q^*$$\nThe term in parentheses is precisely the definition of the dimensionless curvature, $\\kappa^* = \\ell^2 U''(r_{\\min})/\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}}$. With the specified choices $\\ell = r_{\\min}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}} = |U(r_{\\min})|$, this is $\\kappa^* = r_{\\min}^2 U''(r_{\\min}) / |U(r_{\\min})|$. Thus, we arrive at the linearized dimensionless equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\\frac{d^2 q^*}{dt^{*2}} = -\\kappa^* q^*$$\nThis completes the first task. The reduced angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega^* = \\sqrt{\\kappa^*}$.\n\n**2. Störmer-Verlet Integrator Stability Analysis**\n\nThe Störmer-Verlet algorithm, in its velocity Verlet form, for an equation $\\ddot{x} = a(x)$ is given by the three steps:\n1. $v(t + \\Delta t/2) = v(t) + a(x(t)) \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n2. $x(t + \\Delta t) = x(t) + v(t + \\Delta t/2) \\Delta t$\n3. $v(t + \\Delta t) = v(t + \\Delta t/2) + a(x(t + \\Delta t)) \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$\n\nApplying this to our linearized system, $\\ddot{q}^* = -\\kappa^* q^*$, we have the acceleration $a(q^*) = -\\kappa^* q^*$. Let $q_n^* = q^*(n\\Delta t^*)$ and $v_n^* = \\dot{q}^*(n\\Delta t^*)$. The update from state $(q_n^*, v_n^*)$ to $(q_{n+1}^*, v_{n+1}^*)$ can be written as a matrix transformation. The combined update for position and velocity is:\n$$q_{n+1}^* = q_n^* + v_n^* \\Delta t^* + \\frac{1}{2} a(q_n^*) (\\Delta t^*)^2 = q_n^* + v_n^* \\Delta t^* - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa^* q_n^* (\\Delta t^*)^2$$\n$$v_{n+1}^* = v_n^* + \\frac{1}{2} [a(q_n^*) + a(q_{n+1}^*)] \\Delta t^* = v_n^* - \\frac{\\kappa^* \\Delta t^*}{2} (q_n^* + q_{n+1}^*)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q_{n+1}^*$ into the equation for $v_{n+1}^*$ and collecting terms for $q_n^*$ and $v_n^*$ gives the one-step update matrix $M$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} q_{n+1}^* \\\\ v_{n+1}^* \\end{pmatrix} = M \\begin{pmatrix} q_n^* \\\\ v_n^* \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwhere\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \\frac{\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2}{2}  \\Delta t^* \\\\ -\\kappa^* \\Delta t^* \\left(1 - \\frac{\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2}{4}\\right)  1 - \\frac{\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe stability of the integrator is determined by the spectral radius $\\rho(M)$ (the largest magnitude of the eigenvalues of $M$). For linear stability, we require $\\rho(M) \\le 1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\text{Tr}(M)\\lambda + \\det(M) = 0$.\nThe trace and determinant of $M$ are:\n$$\\text{Tr}(M) = 2 - \\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2$$\n$$\\det(M) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2}{2}\\right)^2 + \\Delta t^* \\left(\\kappa^* \\Delta t^* \\left(1 - \\frac{\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2}{4}\\right)\\right) = 1 - \\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2 + \\frac{(\\kappa^*)^2(\\Delta t^*)^4}{4} + \\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2 - \\frac{(\\kappa^*)^2(\\Delta t^*)^4}{4} = 1$$\nThe fact that $\\det(M)=1$ indicates that the integrator is symplectic for this linear system.\nLet $\\alpha = \\Delta t^* \\sqrt{\\kappa^*}$. Then $\\kappa^*(\\Delta t^*)^2 = \\alpha^2$. The characteristic equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda^2 - (2 - \\alpha^2)\\lambda + 1 = 0$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{(2-\\alpha^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(2-\\alpha^2)^2 - 4}}{2} = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\alpha^4 - 4\\alpha^2}$.\nFor the solution to be stable (non-divergent), the eigenvalues must not have a magnitude greater than $1$.\n- If the discriminant is negative, $\\alpha^4 - 4\\alpha^2  0 \\implies \\alpha^2  4 \\implies \\alpha  2$, the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. Their magnitude is $|\\lambda|^2 = (1-\\alpha^2/2)^2 + ((\\alpha/2)\\sqrt{4-\\alpha^2})^2 = 1$. The spectral radius is $1$, so the system is stable.\n- If the discriminant is zero, $\\alpha^2 = 4 \\implies \\alpha = 2$, the eigenvalues are real and equal: $\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1 - 4/2 = -1$. The spectral radius is $1$. This is the stability boundary.\n- If the discriminant is positive, $\\alpha^2  4 \\implies \\alpha  2$, the eigenvalues are real and distinct. Since their product is $1$, one must have magnitude greater than $1$. For instance, $|\\lambda_-| = |1 - \\alpha^2/2 - (\\alpha/2)\\sqrt{\\alpha^2-4}|  1$. The solution is unstable.\nThe stability condition is therefore $\\alpha \\le 2$, which translates to $\\Delta t^* \\sqrt{\\kappa^*} \\le 2$. This can be written as a CFL-like condition:\n$$\\Delta t^* \\le \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\kappa^*}}$$\nComparing this to the form $\\Delta t^* \\lesssim C/\\sqrt{\\kappa^*}$, we identify the constant $C=2$. The critical value is $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$.\n\n**3. Computation of Dimensionless Curvature $\\kappa^*$**\n\nIn all cases, $\\kappa^*$ is computed as $\\kappa^* = r_{\\min}^2 U''(r_{\\min}) / |U(r_{\\min})|$.\na) **Lennard-Jones 12-6**: $U(r) = 4\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}\\left[(\\sigma/r)^{12} - (\\sigma/r)^6\\right]$.\nThe minimum is found by setting $U'(r)=0$, which yields $r_{\\min} = 2^{1/6}\\sigma$.\nAt this minimum, $U(r_{\\min}) = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}$.\nThe second derivative is $U''(r) = 4\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}[156\\sigma^{12}r^{-14} - 42\\sigma^6 r^{-8}]$.\nEvaluating at $r_{\\min}$: $U''(r_{\\min}) = 72\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}/r_{\\min}^2$.\nThe reference scales are $\\ell = r_{\\min}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}} = |U(r_{\\min})| = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}$.\n$$\\kappa^* = \\frac{r_{\\min}^2 U''(r_{\\min})}{|U(r_{\\min})|} = \\frac{r_{\\min}^2(72\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}/r_{\\min}^2)}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{LJ}}} = 72$$\n\nb) **Morse**: $U(r) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}\\left[\\left(1 - e^{-a(r-r_e)}\\right)^2 - 1\\right]$.\nThe minimum is at $r_{\\min} = r_e$.\nAt this minimum, $U(r_{\\min}) = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}$.\nThe second derivative is $U''(r) = 2a^2\\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}[2e^{-2a(r-r_e)} - e^{-a(r-r_e)}]$.\nEvaluating at $r_{\\min}=r_e$: $U''(r_{\\min}) = 2a^2\\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}$.\nThe reference scales are $\\ell = r_e$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ref}} = |U(r_{\\min})| = \\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}$.\n$$\\kappa^* = \\frac{r_e^2 U''(r_{\\min})}{|U(r_{\\min})|} = \\frac{r_e^2(2a^2\\varepsilon_{\\text{M}})}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{M}}} = 2a^2r_e^2$$\n\nc) **Buckingham**: $U(r) = A e^{-B r} - C r^{-6}$.\nThe minimum $r_{\\min}$ is the root of $U'(r) = -ABe^{-Br} + 6Cr^{-7} = 0$, which requires numerical root-finding.\nThe second derivative is $U''(r) = AB^2 e^{-Br} - 42Cr^{-8}$. At the minimum, we substitute $ABe^{-Br_{\\min}} = 6Cr_{\\min}^{-7}$ into the expression for $U''(r_{\\min})$:\n$U''(r_{\\min}) = B(AB e^{-Br_{\\min}}) - 42Cr_{\\min}^{-8} = B(6Cr_{\\min}^{-7}) - 42Cr_{\\min}^{-8} = (6BCr_{\\min} - 42C)r_{\\min}^{-8}$.\n$U(r_{\\min})$ is also expressed in terms of $r_{\\min}$: $U(r_{\\min}) = \\frac{6C}{B}r_{\\min}^{-7} - Cr_{\\min}^{-6}$.\nThe value of $\\kappa^* = r_{\\min}^2 U''(r_{\\min})/|U(r_{\\min})|$ is then computed using the numerically determined $r_{\\min}$.\n\n**4. Numerical Determination of $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$**\n\nThe analytical derivation shows that the stability boundary is at $\\alpha = 2$, independent of $\\kappa^*$. The problem requires a numerical confirmation of this fact. The procedure is to construct the update matrix $M(\\alpha, \\kappa^*)$ and find the value of $\\alpha$ for which its spectral radius, $\\rho(M)$, first exceeds $1$. For $\\alpha \\le 2$, $\\rho(M)=1$. For $\\alpha  2$, $\\rho(M)1$. The critical value $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$ is the boundary, $2$. A numerical root-finding algorithm can be used to solve $\\rho(M(\\alpha, \\kappa^*)) - 1 - \\delta = 0$ for a small positive $\\delta$, which robustly finds a value of $\\alpha$ negligibly larger than $2$. Repeating this for each potential's $\\kappa^*$ value will yield $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 2.000000$ in all cases, confirming its independence from the potential shape.",
