            "problem": "You are asked to construct and analyze a parallel-safe velocity initialization strategy for molecular dynamics that generalizes to Message Passing Interface (MPI) environments. The task must be solved from first principles consistent with Newtonian mechanics, the equipartition theorem, and the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and it must be numerically demonstrable by a single, complete, runnable program. The core requirements are: (i) design a deterministic, rank-indexed random seeding method that yields statistically independent velocity samples for non-overlapping particle subsets assigned to different ranks, and (ii) prove that exact global linear momentum constraints are satisfied after performing center-of-mass velocity removal. The program must simulate multiple MPI ranks in a single process by partitioning particles into disjoint subsets indexed by a rank label; it must not actually use MPI, but it must model the independence and gathering steps that would occur across Message Passing Interface (MPI) ranks.\n\nFundamental base to use: the definition of velocity as $v = dx/dt$, Newton’s Second Law $F = m a$ for the interpretation of linear momentum, the equipartition theorem stating that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ to the average energy at temperature $T$, and the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for a classical particle of mass $m$. No shortcut formulas are to be assumed; you must derive any sampling variance and any center-of-mass removal transformation starting only from these foundations in your solution.\n\nDesign constraints and goals:\n- Define a seeding scheme that takes a base integer seed $S$ and a rank index $r \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,R-1\\}$ and produces independent pseudorandom streams, one per rank, in a manner that is parallel-safe and reproducible. Independence here means no shared internal state and no overlap of generated subsequences across ranks, given fixed $S$ and disjoint rank labels.\n- Sample initial velocities for particle $i$ of mass $m_i$ at temperature $T$ from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution consistent with the equipartition theorem. You must reason to determine the component-wise distribution and its variance strictly from the fundamental base specified above.\n- After sampling, perform a single global center of mass (COM) velocity removal step that enforces the physical constraint of zero total linear momentum. In your solution, you must derive why subtracting the appropriate constant vector from every particle’s velocity achieves zero total momentum.\n- Units: masses must be in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$), temperature in Kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$), velocities in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$), and momentum in kilogram-meters per second ($\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$). Boltzmann’s constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ must be used in joules per Kelvin, where $1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2/s^2}$.\n- Your program must validate the independence of rank-local velocity streams and the satisfaction of the momentum constraint after COM removal. Independence validation must be deterministic: for each rank, compute a digest of the raw, pre-COM-removal velocities and confirm that all rank digests are distinct for non-empty rank assignments. Momentum validation must compute the global total momentum after COM removal and check that its components are within a specified absolute tolerance $\\epsilon$.\n\nTest suite and parameters:\nUse the following physically consistent constants and masses derived from atomic mass units. Let the atomic mass unit be $u = 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, Boltzmann’s constant be $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$. Define species masses\n- Argon: $m_{\\mathrm{Ar}} = 39.948\\,u$,\n- Hydrogen: $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.00784\\,u$,\n- Xenon: $m_{\\mathrm{Xe}} = 131.293\\,u$.\n\nImplement three test cases:\n1. Happy path: $N = 1000$ particles, $R = 4$ ranks, uniform mass $m_i = m_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ for all $i$, temperature $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, base seed $S = 123456789$, tolerance $\\epsilon = 1\\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$.\n2. Boundary case: $N = 1$ particle, $R = 1$ rank, mass $m_1 = m_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$, temperature $T = 500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, base seed $S = 987654321$, tolerance $\\epsilon = 1\\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$.\n3. Heterogeneous masses: $N = 100$ particles, $R = 3$ ranks, temperature $T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, base seed $S = 192837465$, tolerance $\\epsilon = 1\\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$. Mass assignment: $m_i = m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,50\\}$ and $m_i = m_{\\mathrm{Xe}}$ for $i \\in \\{51,52,\\dots,100\\}$.\n\nProgram requirements:\n- Partition the $N$ particles into $R$ contiguous subsets (as evenly sized as possible) to represent rank-local ownership; for each rank $r$, sample its local velocities from its independent pseudorandom stream.\n- Perform one global COM removal step on the concatenated velocity field across all ranks.\n- Validate and return, per test case: (a) a boolean indicating whether all per-rank digests of raw velocities are distinct, (b) a boolean indicating whether the post-COM-removal total momentum satisfies the tolerance $\\epsilon$, and (c) the maximum absolute component of the total momentum vector after COM removal in $\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$ as a float.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case contributes a nested list of the form $[b_1,b_2,x]$ with $b_1$ and $b_2$ booleans and $x$ a float in $\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s}$. Concretely, the output must be of the form $[[b_{1}^{(1)},b_{2}^{(1)},x^{(1)}],[b_{1}^{(2)},b_{2}^{(2)},x^{(2)}],[b_{1}^{(3)},b_{2}^{(3)},x^{(3)}]]$ printed on a single line, with no additional text.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a parallel-safe velocity initialization strategy for molecular dynamics simulations. The solution must be derived from first principles, specifically the equipartition theorem and the definition of linear momentum, and must be demonstrable in a single-process program that models a multi-rank MPI environment.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts:\n1.  Derivation of the single-particle velocity sampling distribution from the equipartition theorem.\n2.  Design of a deterministic and parallel-safe random number generation scheme.\n3.  Derivation of the center-of-mass (COM) velocity removal transformation to enforce zero total linear momentum.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Velocity Sampling Distribution**\n\nThe equipartition theorem is a cornerstone of classical statistical mechanics. It states that for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, every quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian contributes an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a single particle of mass $m_i$ with velocity vector $\\vec{v}_i = (v_{ix}, v_{iy}, v_{iz})$ in three dimensions, the kinetic energy is given by:\n$$ E_{k,i} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_i (v_{ix}^2 + v_{iy}^2 + v_{iz}^2) $$\nThis expression can be separated into three independent terms, one for each spatial dimension:\n$$ E_{k,i} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{ix}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{iy}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{iz}^2 $$\nEach of these terms ($ \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{i\\alpha}^2 $ for $\\alpha \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$) is a quadratic degree of freedom. Applying the equipartition theorem, the average energy for each component is:\n$$ \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{i\\alpha}^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the ensemble average. This simplifies to:\n$$ m_i \\langle v_{i\\alpha}^2 \\rangle = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\implies \\langle v_{i\\alpha}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{m_i} $$\nThe velocities of particles in a thermalized system are described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. For a single velocity component, say $v_{ix}$, this distribution takes the form of a Gaussian (normal) distribution, $f(v_{ix})$, with a mean of zero, $\\langle v_{ix} \\rangle = 0$, as there is no preferred direction of motion. The variance of this distribution, $\\sigma_{i\\alpha}^2$, is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{i\\alpha}^2 = \\langle (v_{i\\alpha} - \\langle v_{i\\alpha} \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = \\langle v_{i\\alpha}^2 \\rangle - \\langle v_{i\\alpha} \\rangle^2 $$\nSince $\\langle v_{i\\alpha} \\rangle = 0$, the variance is simply $\\sigma_{i\\alpha}^2 = \\langle v_{i\\alpha}^2 \\rangle$. From our result from the equipartition theorem, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{i\\alpha}^2 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{m_i} $$\nThis holds for each component $\\alpha \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. Therefore, to initialize the velocity of particle $i$, we must sample each of its three velocity components ($v_{ix}$, $v_{iy}$, $v_{iz}$) independently from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu=0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / m_i}$.\n\n**2. Parallel-Safe Random Number Generation**\n\nIn a parallel MPI environment, each process (rank) must generate random numbers independently without collaborating with other ranks after initial setup. This requires a seeding mechanism that guarantees that the sequences of random numbers generated by different ranks are statistically independent and do not overlap.\n\nA robust method for achieving this is to use a master seed to spawn independent seed sequences for each rank. Given a single base integer seed $S$ and the total number of ranks $R$, we can initialize a master `SeedSequence` object. This object can then `spawn` $R$ new, independent `SeedSequence` objects. Rank $r$ (where $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, R-1\\}$) then uses the $r$-th spawned seed sequence to initialize its own private pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This approach ensures reproducibility (the same $S$ and $R$ always yield the same set of streams) and statistical independence across ranks. This is the strategy implemented in the accompanying code using `numpy.random.SeedSequence`.\n\nTo validate this independence deterministically, we can compute a digest for the set of raw velocities generated by each rank before any global operations. A secure hash of the raw velocity data for each rank provides a reliable digest. If the seeding mechanism is correct, each rank will generate a unique sequence of velocities, resulting in a unique digest for each non-empty rank partition.\n\n**3. Derivation of Center-of-Mass Velocity Removal**\n\nIn many molecular dynamics simulations, particularly for isolated systems (NVE ensemble), the total linear momentum of the system should be a conserved quantity. It is common practice to initialize the system with zero total linear momentum. The initial sampling from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution generates velocities with a zero mean on average, but for any finite sample of $N$ particles, the net momentum will be non-zero due to statistical fluctuations.\n\nThe total linear momentum of the system, $\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}}$, is the vector sum of the individual momenta:\n$$ \\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{p}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{v}_i $$\nThe center-of-mass (COM) velocity, $\\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}}$, is defined as the total momentum divided by the total mass, $M_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i$:\n$$ \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}}}{M_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{v}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i} $$\nOur goal is to find a corrected set of velocities, $\\vec{v}'_i$, such that the new total momentum, $\\vec{P}'_{\\text{total}}$, is the zero vector, $\\vec{0}$. The standard procedure is to shift the system into the COM reference frame by subtracting $\\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}}$ from each particle's velocity:\n$$ \\vec{v}'_i = \\vec{v}_i - \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} $$\nWe now prove that this transformation correctly nullifies the total momentum. The new total momentum is:\n$$ \\vec{P}'_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{v}'_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i (\\vec{v}_i - \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}}) $$\nDistributing the sum:\n$$ \\vec{P}'_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{v}_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} $$\nThe first term is the original total momentum, $\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}}$. In the second term, $\\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}}$ is a constant vector with respect to the sum over particles, so it can be factored out:\n$$ \\vec{P}'_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} - \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\\right) = \\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} - \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} M_{\\text{total}} $$\nSubstituting the definition $\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} M_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$ \\vec{P}'_{\\text{total}} = (\\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} M_{\\text{total}}) - \\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}} M_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{0} $$\nThis confirms that subtracting the center-of-mass velocity from each particle velocity sets the total linear momentum of the system to zero. In a simulated MPI context, this requires a global communication step: each rank computes its local contribution to the total momentum ($ \\sum_{i \\in \\text{rank}} m_i \\vec{v}_i $) and total mass. These are then summed across all ranks (a global reduction) to compute the global $\\vec{V}_{\\text{COM}}$, which is then broadcast back to all ranks to perform the subtraction. The provided program models this by performing the calculation on the concatenated global velocity array.",

The practitioner's first step is to rescale these velocities to obtain a new set $\\{\\mathbf{v}_i^{(1)}\\}$ such that the total kinetic energy $K^{(1)}$ is no longer a statistical variable but a fixed quantity:\n$$K^{(1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i^{(1)}|^2 = \\frac{3N}{2} k_B T_0$$\nThis step imposes a microcanonical-like constraint on the system's kinetic energy.\n\nAccording to Koenig's theorem, the total kinetic energy can be decomposed as:\n$$K^{(1)} = K' + K_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)}$$\nwhere $K' = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i^{(1)} - \\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)}|^2$ is the kinetic energy relative to the COM (the quantity used to calculate $T_{\\mathrm{naive}}$), and $K_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} M |\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)}|^2$ is the kinetic energy of the COM, with $M = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i$ being the total mass.\n\nThe initial sampling from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution ensures that, on average, energy is distributed equally among all quadratic degrees of freedom (equipartition). The uniform rescaling in the second step does not alter this relative distribution. Therefore, the fixed total kinetic energy $K^{(1)}$ is, on average, partitioned equally among the $3N$ available degrees of freedom.\n\nThe expected energy per degree of freedom is:\n$$\\langle E_{\\mathrm{dof}} \\rangle = \\frac{K^{(1)}}{3N} = \\frac{1}{3N} \\left(\\frac{3N}{2} k_B T_0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T_0$$\n\nThe COM motion accounts for $3$ degrees of freedom. The expected kinetic energy associated with the COM is:\n$$\\langle K_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)} \\rangle = 3 \\times \\langle E_{\\mathrm{dof}} \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_0$$\n\nThe remaining kinetic energy, $K'$, is associated with the internal motion relative to the COM, which has $3N-3$ degrees of freedom. Its expected value is:\n$$\\langle K' \\rangle = (3N-3) \\times \\langle E_{\\mathrm{dof}} \\rangle = \\frac{3(N-1)}{2} k_B T_0$$\nWe can verify this: $\\langle K^{(1)} \\rangle = \\langle K' \\rangle + \\langle K_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)} \\rangle = \\frac{3(N-1)}{2} k_B T_0 + \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_0 = \\frac{3N}{2} k_B T_0$, which is consistent with the fixed total energy.\n\nNow, we quantify the effect of the naive COM removal on the temperature. The practitioner calculates a \"naive\" temperature using $K'$ but incorrectly assumes $3N$ degrees of freedom:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{naive}} = \\frac{2K'}{3N k_B}$$\nThe expected value of this naive temperature is:\n$$\\langle T_{\\mathrm{naive}} \\rangle = \\frac{2 \\langle K' \\rangle}{3N k_B} = \\frac{2}{3N k_B} \\left(\\frac{3(N-1)}{2} k_B T_0\\right) = \\frac{N-1}{N} T_0$$\nThis shows that the procedure systematically results in a lower temperature than the target $T_0$, with the expected temperature being reduced by a factor of $(N-1)/N$.\n\nThe final part of the problem is to find a single multiplicative factor $s$ to correct this. The COM-removed velocities $\\{\\mathbf{v}_i^{(2)}\\}$ (where $\\mathbf{v}_i^{(2)} = \\mathbf{v}_i^{(1)} - \\mathbf{V}_{\\mathrm{CM}}^{(1)}$) are to be rescaled to $\\{\\mathbf{v}_i^{(3)}\\} = \\{s \\mathbf{v}_i^{(2)}\\}$. The new total kinetic energy will be $K''$:\n$$K'' = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m_i |s \\mathbf{v}_i^{(2)}|^2 = s^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i^{(2)}|^2 = s^2 K'$$\nThe practitioner will then calculate a final temperature $T_{final}$ using the same naive formula:\n$$T_{final} = \\frac{2 K''}{3N k_B} = \\frac{2 s^2 K'}{3N k_B}$$\nWe require that the *expected* value of this final temperature equals the target temperature $T_0$:\n$$\\langle T_{final} \\rangle = T_0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{final}$ and $\\langle K' \\rangle$:\n$$\\left\\langle \\frac{2 s^2 K'}{3N k_B} \\right\\rangle = s^2 \\frac{2 \\langle K' \\rangle}{3N k_B} = T_0$$\n$$s^2 \\frac{2}{3N k_B} \\left(\\frac{3(N-1)}{2} k_B T_0\\right) = T_0$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$s^2 \\left(\\frac{N-1}{N}\\right) T_0 = T_0$$\nAssuming $T_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $T_0$:\n$$s^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1}$$\nSince the scaling factor $s$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{N-1}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytical expression for the rescaling factor.",

            "solution": "The user has requested a solution to a problem in classical mechanics relevant to molecular dynamics simulations. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: first, a general expression for the change in kinetic energy, $\\Delta K$, when subtracting a rigid-body rotational velocity field to nullify the total angular momentum of a particle system; and second, the numerical value of this change for a specific three-particle system.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for $\\Delta K$. The initial state of the system is defined by particle masses $m_i$, positions $\\mathbf{r}_i$, and velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i$. The total angular momentum $\\mathbf{L}$ and kinetic energy $K$ are given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i} m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\mathbf{v}_i $$\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i|^2 $$\nA rigid-body rotational velocity field, characterized by an angular velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, is subtracted from the particle velocities to yield new velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i'$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_i' = \\mathbf{v}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i $$\nThe new angular momentum, $\\mathbf{L}'$, must be zero. We express $\\mathbf{L}'$ in terms of the initial quantities:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}' = \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\mathbf{v}_i' = \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times (\\mathbf{v}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{L}' = \\sum_i m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\mathbf{v}_i) - \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) $$\nThe first term is the initial angular momentum $\\mathbf{L}$. Using the vector triple product identity $\\mathbf{a} \\times (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c})\\mathbf{b} - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})\\mathbf{c}$, the second term becomes:\n$$ \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) = \\sum_i m_i [(\\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_i)\\boldsymbol{\\omega} - (\\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\mathbf{r}_i] $$\nThis expression is the result of the moment of inertia tensor, $I$, acting on the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$. The tensor $I$ is defined as $I = \\sum_i m_i (|\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{r}_i \\mathbf{r}_i^\\top)$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the identity tensor. Thus, the expression is equivalent to $I\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\nThe new angular momentum is therefore $\\mathbf{L}' = \\mathbf{L} - I\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$. Setting $\\mathbf{L}' = \\mathbf{0}$ yields the condition for the required angular velocity:\n$$ \\mathbf{L} = I\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\implies \\boldsymbol{\\omega} = I^{-1}\\mathbf{L} $$\nThis assumes the tensor $I$ is invertible, which is true for any non-collinear arrangement of masses.\n\nNext, we calculate the change in kinetic energy, $\\Delta K = K' - K$. The new kinetic energy $K'$ is:\n$$ K' = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i'|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i|^2 $$\n$$ K' = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i \\left( \\mathbf{v}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{v}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i \\right) $$\n$$ K' = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i \\left( |\\mathbf{v}_i|^2 - 2 \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) + |\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\right) $$\n$$ K' = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i |\\mathbf{v}_i|^2\\right) - \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i |\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i|^2 $$\nThe first term is the initial kinetic energy $K$. Using the cyclic property of the scalar triple product, the second term becomes:\n$$ \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_i) = \\sum_i m_i \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\mathbf{v}_i) = \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\left( \\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\mathbf{v}_i \\right) = \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{L} $$\nThe third term represents the rotational kinetic energy component, which can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\top I \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$. So, the new kinetic energy is:\n$$ K' = K - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{L} + \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\top I \\boldsymbol{\\omega} $$\nThe change in kinetic energy is $\\Delta K = K' - K = - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{L} + \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\top I \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{L} = I\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ (and $\\mathbf{L}^\\top = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\top I$ since $I$ is symmetric), we find:\n$$ \\Delta K = - \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{L} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\omega} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{L} $$\nTo express $\\Delta K$ solely in terms of $\\mathbf{L}$ and $I$, we substitute $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = I^{-1}\\mathbf{L}$:\n$$ \\Delta K = - \\frac{1}{2} (I^{-1}\\mathbf{L}) \\cdot \\mathbf{L} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{L}^\\top I^{-1} \\mathbf{L} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given system. The parameters are $m = 3.0 \\times 10^{-26}~\\mathrm{kg}$, $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}~\\mathrm{m}$, and $v = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.
