            "problem": "In classical molecular dynamics parameterization, the out-of-plane bending associated with an improper torsion angle is often modeled near a planar minimum by a harmonic term whose parameters must be obtained from the Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface. Consider a model system such as acetamide, and let the out-of-plane angle $\\chi$ be the improper torsion constructed on four atoms $(i,j,k,l)$ such that atom $j$ is the atom whose deviation from the reference plane is penalized. Your goal is to select a protocol that, starting from the fundamental fact that small displacements from a minimum are governed by the second-order Taylor expansion of the potential energy with respect to the displacement coordinate, produces physically meaningful estimates of the curvature parameter $k_{\\chi}$ and the reference angle $\\chi_{0}$ for a planarity term. The protocol must be scientifically realistic: it should map the electronic potential energy surface in a neighborhood of the planar minimum, isolate the coordinate $\\chi$ by an appropriate constraint, handle unit consistency, and choose a sampling range and step that keep the deformation within the harmonic regime while providing enough data for a stable fit.\n\nWhich of the following protocols most appropriately achieves these aims for acetamide?\n\nA. Constrain the improper out-of-plane angle $\\chi$ about the planar amide group and perform a symmetric scan with $\\chi \\in [-25\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}, +25\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}]$ in $2.5\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}$ increments. At each value of $\\chi$, carry out a full geometry optimization of all other internal coordinates under the fixed-$\\chi$ constraint on the Born–Oppenheimer surface (for example, using Density Functional Theory (DFT) at $0\\ \\mathrm{K}$), record relative energies, convert $\\chi$ to radians, and fit the resulting energy profile to a quadratic function of $\\chi$ via least squares to obtain $k_{\\chi}$ (with units of energy per $\\mathrm{rad}^{2}$) and $\\chi_{0}$. Validate harmonicity by checking that adding a cubic term does not significantly improve the fit within the chosen range.\n\nB. Run an unconstrained molecular dynamics trajectory of acetamide for $1\\ \\mathrm{ns}$ at $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, compute the histogram of $\\chi$ over the trajectory, and estimate $k_{\\chi}$ from the variance of $\\chi$ using equipartition, treating $\\chi$ in degrees. Take $\\chi_{0}$ as the mean of the distribution. No constraints or geometry optimizations are needed.\n\nC. Define the torsional dihedral $\\omega$ around the amide bond and scan $\\omega \\in [-90\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}, +90\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}]$ in $10\\mathrm{^{\\circ}}$ increments. At each $\\omega$, compute single-point energies without geometry optimization, and fit a sinusoidal function to determine $k_{\\chi}$ and $\\chi_{0}$.\n\nD.

This term must accurately represent the \"true\" potential energy landscape, as described by the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES), for small displacements from the equilibrium geometry. The correct procedure involves a \"relaxed surface scan\" where the coordinate of interest is systematically varied while all other coordinates are allowed to relax to their minimum energy configuration.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Correct.** This protocol describes the scientifically standard and rigorous method for parameterizing such a term.\n1.  **Constrained Scan**: It correctly proposes to constrain the coordinate of interest, $\\chi$.\n2.  **Relaxed Scan**: It specifies a \"full geometry optimization of all other internal coordinates\" at each step. This is crucial for obtaining the true potential energy profile for the $\\chi$ deformation, as it allows the rest of the molecule to adjust to the strain. A rigid scan (without relaxation) would yield an artificially high energy and an overestimated force constant.\n3.  **Appropriate Range**: The scan range $\\chi \\in [-25^\\circ, +25^\\circ]$ is physically reasonable for sampling the harmonic region of an improper torsion without going into highly anharmonic regions. The step size provides enough data points for a stable fit.\n4.  **Unit Consistency**: It correctly mentions converting angles to radians before fitting to obtain $k_{\\chi}$ in standard units of energy/$\\mathrm{rad}^2$. This is mathematically necessary for the harmonic potential form.\n5.  **Validation**: It includes a check for harmonicity, which is a sign of a robust protocol.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** This method is circular. To run a classical molecular dynamics trajectory, one already needs a force field with a value for $k_{\\chi}$. Thus, this protocol cannot be used to derive the parameter in the first place. While one could use *ab initio* MD, it's an inefficient and indirect way to map a potential surface for parameterization compared to a constrained scan. Furthermore, using the equipartition theorem, $\\langle \\chi^2 \\rangle = k_B T / k_\\chi$, is a method for *analyzing* fluctuations in a simulation, not for *defining* the underlying potential from scratch.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** This protocol has multiple fundamental flaws. It scans the wrong coordinate; it scans the proper dihedral angle $\\omega$ (torsion around the C-N bond) instead of the improper dihedral angle $\\chi$ (out-of-plane bend). It also incorrectly suggests a \"rigid scan\" (single-point energies) and fitting to a sinusoidal function, which is appropriate for a proper torsion, not a harmonic planarity term.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** The sampling points ($\\chi = 0^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 120^\\circ, 180^\\circ$) are far too large and deep into the non-harmonic, high-energy region. Parameterizing a potential for small-amplitude fluctuations near the minimum requires sampling points near that minimum. Using such extreme and sparse points would give a completely incorrect value for the curvature at the minimum.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** While the scan range is good, this protocol critically fails by proposing to compute single-point energies, meaning a \"rigid scan.\" As explained for option A, failing to relax the rest of the molecular geometry at each constrained value of $\\chi$ leads to an inaccurate potential energy profile and a significant overestimation of the force constant.\n\nTherefore, protocol A is the only one that is methodologically sound and scientifically rigorous for the stated purpose.",

            "solution": "This problem requires relating the harmonic force constant $k_{\\chi}$ of an out-of-plane bending mode to its experimentally observed vibrational wavenumber $\\nu$.

Comparing this to the simple harmonic oscillator form $k_{\\chi} = \\mu_{\\text{eff}} \\omega^2$, we correctly identify the effective mass as $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = 1/G_{\\chi\\chi}$. This is a fundamental identity in vibrational analysis. The conversion $\\omega = 2\\pi c \\nu$ is also correct.
