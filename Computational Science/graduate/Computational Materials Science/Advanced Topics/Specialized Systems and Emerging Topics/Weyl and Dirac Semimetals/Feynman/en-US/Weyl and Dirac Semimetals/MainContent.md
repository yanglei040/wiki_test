## Introduction
In the vast landscape of materials science, our understanding has long been built on the simple dichotomy of metals and insulators, defined by the behavior of their electronic bands. However, a more exotic class of materials emerges when these bands touch at isolated points in momentum space, challenging our traditional classifications. These materials, known as Weyl and Dirac semimetals, host quasiparticles that behave like massless relativistic particles, governed by profound principles of symmetry and topology. This article bridges the gap between fundamental theory and observable phenomena, exploring how these strange particles are born and what unique properties they bestow upon a crystal.

This journey will unfold across three main sections. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of band theory and symmetry that protect and define Dirac and Weyl points, uncovering their topological nature as monopoles of Berry curvature. Next, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will reveal how these theoretical ideas manifest as tangible experimental signatures, such as Fermi arcs and [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) effects, and explore the deep connections to [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260). Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide a glimpse into the computational workflows used by researchers to identify, characterize, and manipulate these fascinating topological states. Let us begin by exploring the music of the bands, where these new particles are born from simple crossings.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Music of the Bands: Where Particles are Born from Crossings

Imagine you are flying through the intricate, crystalline landscape of a solid. The periodic arrangement of atoms creates a majestic architecture, and for an electron navigating this world, not all paths are created equal. The electron's allowed energies are not continuous but are organized into distinct "bands," separated by forbidden "gaps." For decades, we understood materials primarily through this lens: insulators have large gaps that electrons cannot cross, while metals have bands that overlap, creating a sea of mobile electrons. The story seemed simple enough.

But what happens in the curious case where two bands, instead of overlapping or avoiding each other, come to touch at a single, [isolated point](@entry_id:146695) in momentum space? These touching points, or **nodes**, are not mere curiosities; they are portals. They are points where the very nature of the electron's existence is redefined, giving birth to new, exotic quasiparticles that behave unlike anything you'd find in free space.

To understand these points, we can zoom in on the region of [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), $\mathbf{k}$, around the node. The physics is often captured by a deceptively simple effective Hamiltonian, a $2 \times 2$ matrix of the form $H(\mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ are the famous Pauli matrices. The two [energy bands](@entry_id:146576) are given by the eigenvalues $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = \pm |\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|$. A [band crossing](@entry_id:161733) occurs precisely when the energy gap closes, which means we must have $|\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})| = 0$. This requires satisfying three independent mathematical conditions simultaneously: $d_x(\mathbf{k})=0$, $d_y(\mathbf{k})=0$, and $d_z(\mathbf{k})=0$.

In the three-dimensional world of [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), trying to satisfy three independent equations is like trying to find where three distinct surfaces intersect. The generic solution is not a line or a surface, but a set of isolated points. This is a question of **codimension**: the dimension of the space (3) minus the number of constraints (3) gives the dimension of the solution (0). Thus, without any special circumstances, band crossings in 3D crystals are zero-dimensional points . This simple argument from first principles explains why we speak of Weyl and Dirac *points*, the fundamental building blocks of these topological materials.

### The Double Life of the Electron: Symmetry and the Birth of a Dirac Point

Now, let's add the profound influence of symmetry. Two of the most [fundamental symmetries](@entry_id:161256) in physics are **time-reversal symmetry** ($\mathcal{T}$), the idea that the laws of physics run the same forwards and backwards, and **inversion symmetry** ($\mathcal{P}$), where the crystal looks identical when viewed from a point $\mathbf{r}$ as from $-\mathbf{r}$.

For an electron, which has spin, the time-reversal operator has a peculiar property: applying it twice gives you back not the original state, but its negative ($\mathcal{T}^2 = -1$). This leads to a famous result known as Kramers' theorem, which guarantees that in a time-reversal symmetric system, every energy state has a degenerate partner. However, this only forces degeneracy at special points in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) that are mapped onto themselves by time reversal.

The real magic happens when a crystal possesses *both* inversion and [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094). The combination of these two, the $\mathcal{PT}$ operator, is an anti-unitary symmetry that, like $\mathcal{T}$, also squares to $-1$. Crucially, unlike $\mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{P}$ alone, the $\mathcal{PT}$ operator leaves the momentum $\mathbf{k}$ unchanged. The consequence is astonishing: every single energy band is forced to be at least two-fold degenerate at *every single point* in the Brillouin zone  . The bands effectively travel in pairs, a universal "stickiness" imposed by these fundamental symmetries.

A **Dirac point** is born when two of these already-paired bands happen to cross each other. This creates a remarkable four-fold degenerate point in the electronic structure. But why would they cross? Why not just repel each other and open a gap, as bands usually do? The answer, once again, lies in symmetry. The crossing can be "protected" if the two pairs of bands belong to different irreducible representations of the crystal's symmetry group. For example, along an axis with four-fold rotation ($C_4$) symmetry, the two band-pairs might have different rotational eigenvalues, acting like different name tags that forbid them from mixing and hybridizing . In some exotic crystals with so-called nonsymmorphic symmetries (involving fractional translations), a four-fold degeneracy can be forced by a single four-dimensional representation, a testament to the deep and sometimes strange relationship between crystal structure and electronic topology .

### Shattering Dirac: The Emergence of Weyl Monopoles

The Dirac point, protected by the combined might of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries, is a robust and beautiful thing. But what happens if we shatter its protection? Let's take our pristine Dirac semimetal and break one of its parent symmetries, for instance, by applying a magnetic field to break [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094).

The moment $\mathcal{T}$ is broken, the universal $\mathcal{PT}$ degeneracy vanishes. Bands are no longer required to travel in pairs. The four-fold Dirac point, its protection gone, becomes unstable and splits apart. It shatters into a pair of two-fold degenerate points that move away from each other in momentum space. These new, more fundamental particles are **Weyl points**  .

We can see this beautifully in a minimal mathematical model . A simple [tight-binding](@entry_id:142573) Hamiltonian for a Dirac semimetal can host a Dirac point at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\mathbf{k}=0$). When we introduce a term representing a magnetic field of strength $b$ (breaking $\mathcal{T}$), the Dirac point vanishes. In its place, two Weyl points appear, separated along the $k_z$ axis by a distance given by the elegant relation $\cos(k_z) = 1 - b^2/2$. As we increase the magnetic field, the Weyl points move further apart, finally meeting and annihilating each other at the Brillouin zone boundary when $b=2$. This simple model provides a perfect picture of the birth of Weyl points from the "mother" Dirac state.

### Chirality: The Soul of a Weyl Particle

These Weyl points are far more than simple two-band crossings. They are topologically protected objects with a definite personality, a property called **chirality**. Near a Weyl point, the Hamiltonian takes the universal form $H(\mathbf{k}) \approx v \chi \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{q}$, where $\mathbf{q}$ is the momentum deviation from the node. The parameter $\chi$, which can be $+1$ or $-1$, is the [chirality](@entry_id:144105). It tells us whether the quasiparticle is "right-handed" or "left-handed," behaving like a massless relativistic particle with a definite [spin projection](@entry_id:184359) along its momentum.

This handedness is not just a label; it's a profound [topological property](@entry_id:141605) encoded in the geometry of the quantum wavefunctions. To see it, we must introduce the concept of the **Berry curvature**, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$. You can think of it as an effective "magnetic field" that lives not in real space, but in the abstract space of crystal momentum. The Berry curvature dictates how an electron's wavefunction subtly twists and turns as it moves through the Brillouin zone.

A Weyl point is a source or a sink of this momentum-space magnetic field—it is a **monopole of Berry curvature**. Near a node of chirality $\chi$, the Berry curvature takes the form $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k}) = \chi \frac{\mathbf{q}}{2|\mathbf{q}|^3}$ . This is mathematically identical to the magnetic field of a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) in real space! The total "flux" of this curvature through a small sphere enclosing the Weyl node is a quantized integer, which is none other than its chirality $\chi$. This monopole charge is a topological invariant, meaning it cannot be removed by small perturbations; it is as robust as the number of holes in a donut. This chirality is fundamentally linked to the way the bands twist around each other, and it can be calculated directly from the Hamiltonian's velocity matrix $\mathbf{v}$: the [chirality](@entry_id:144105) is simply the sign of the determinant of this matrix, $\chi = \mathrm{sgn}(\det(\mathbf{v}))$ .

### The Nielsen-Ninomiya Theorem: Monopoles Can't Live Alone

In our universe, isolated magnetic monopoles are famously elusive. It turns out a similar rule applies inside a crystal. The **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**, a deep and fundamental constraint of lattice physics, states that the total chirality of all Weyl points within the entire Brillouin zone must sum to zero . You cannot have a net monopole charge in a crystal.

This simple rule has profound consequences. It means Weyl points must always be created in pairs of opposite chirality. The consequences depend on the underlying symmetries:
- In a crystal that breaks time-reversal but preserves inversion ($\mathcal{P}$), a Weyl node at momentum $\mathbf{k}$ with chirality $\chi$ must be accompanied by a partner at $-\mathbf{k}$ with the opposite chirality $-\chi$. A minimal configuration of just two nodes is possible.
- In a crystal that breaks inversion but preserves time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$), a node at $\mathbf{k}$ with [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $\chi$ has a partner at $-\mathbf{k}$ with the *same* chirality $\chi$. To satisfy the no-go theorem and make the total charge zero, there must be at least one more such pair with the opposite chirality. Therefore, the minimum number of Weyl nodes in these systems is four .

### The Edge of the World: Fermi Arcs

The existence of these monopoles in the "bulk" of the momentum space has an unmissable consequence at the crystal's surface. This is the celebrated **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)**: the topology of the bulk dictates the properties of the edge.

Imagine slicing the 3D Brillouin zone into a stack of 2D planes. Any slice that passes between a Weyl node of [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $+1$ and one of [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $-1$ will itself behave like a 2D [topological insulator](@entry_id:137103), carrying a non-zero topological invariant (a Chern number). This number guarantees the existence of protected states that live only at the boundary—the surface of the crystal.

These are no ordinary [surface states](@entry_id:137922). They form strange, disjointed lines of energy states in the 2D surface Brillouin zone known as **Fermi arcs**. A Fermi arc is an open contour that emerges from the projection of a bulk Weyl node of one chirality and dives back into the bulk at the projection of a node with the opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) . They are the definitive experimental fingerprint of a Weyl semimetal.

The appearance of these arcs depends critically on how the bulk monopoles are projected onto the surface. For a given material:
- One surface termination might cause projections of opposite-chirality nodes to land on top of each other. Their projected charges cancel out, and no Fermi arcs are topologically required. The surface can look boring.
- A different surface termination on the same crystal might keep the projections separate. In this case, arcs are guaranteed to exist, stitching together the [sources and sinks](@entry_id:263105) of Berry curvature .

While the exact shape and path of a Fermi arc can be changed by modifying the surface (e.g., by adding a potential or through [surface reconstruction](@entry_id:145120)), its endpoints are locked onto the projections of the bulk Weyl nodes, a beautiful manifestation of a deeply hidden topological rule .

### Epilogue: The Malleable Topology of Crystals

One might think that these topological properties, being so robust, are immutable features of a material. But the story has one last twist. The topology is fundamentally tied to the crystal lattice itself. By changing the [periodic structure](@entry_id:262445) of the crystal—for instance, by creating a **supercell** where the unit cell is doubled in size—we effectively fold the Brillouin zone back upon itself .

This folding process remaps the Weyl nodes to new locations in the smaller, reduced Brillouin zone. If we are clever in how we design the supercell, we can arrange for a Weyl node of chirality $+1$ and a partner of chirality $-1$ to be folded to the exact same point in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). When they meet, they can **annihilate** each other, opening a gap in the energy spectrum and destroying the topological state entirely . This reveals a tantalizing prospect: the ability to engineer and control these profound topological states not just by choosing materials, but by manipulating the very fabric of the crystal lattice. The world of Weyl and Dirac semimetals is not just a catalog of new particles, but a dynamic playground where the fundamental rules of symmetry and topology can be explored, and perhaps even rewritten.
