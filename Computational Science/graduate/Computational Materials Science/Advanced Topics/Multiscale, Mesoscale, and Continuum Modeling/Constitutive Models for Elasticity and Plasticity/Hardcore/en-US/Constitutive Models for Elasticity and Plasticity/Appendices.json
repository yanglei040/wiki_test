By deriving the stress-strain relationships for a simple uniaxial tension case directly from the general isotropic constitutive law, you will solidify your understanding of how engineering constants like Young's modulus ($E$) and Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$) emerge from the underlying tensorial framework. This practice is essential for building a robust intuition for elastic material response before moving on to more complex plastic phenomena.",

            "problem": "A slender, homogeneous, isotropic bar aligned with the $z$-axis is loaded in uniaxial tension under small strain. The lateral surfaces normal to the $x$- and $y$-directions are traction-free, so the only nonzero Cauchy stress (true stress) component is $\\sigma_{zz}$. The material is linear elastic with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$. Let the axial strain be $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ and the lateral strains be $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ and $\\varepsilon_{yy}$. Assume that the total volumetric (dilatational) strain $\\varepsilon_{v} = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ is prescribed by the loading.\n\nStarting from the definitions of the small strain tensor and the general isotropic linear elastic constitutive law expressed with Lamé parameters, derive the relationships among $\\varepsilon_{zz}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, and $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ implied by the traction-free lateral condition, and then obtain the axial Cauchy stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ required to achieve a given volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_{v}$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem describes a standard scenario in linear elasticity: a homogeneous, isotropic bar under uniaxial tension. The provided material properties, $E = 73.1\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ and $\\nu = 0.33$, are realistic (e.g., for an aluminum alloy), and the prescribed volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_{v} = 9.10 \\times 10^{-4}$ is small, consistent with the small strain assumption. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution for the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principles of linear elasticity. The general isotropic linear elastic constitutive law relates the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the small strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ using the Lamé parameters, the first Lamé parameter $\\lambda$ and the second Lamé parameter (or shear modulus) $G$. In indicial notation, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2G\\varepsilon_{ij}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22} + \\varepsilon_{33}$ is the trace of the strain tensor, representing the volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_v$, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe problem states that the bar is loaded in uniaxial tension along the $z$-axis, and the lateral surfaces (normal to the $x$- and $y$-axes) are traction-free. This implies a state of uniaxial stress, where the only non-zero stress component is $\\sigma_{zz}$. Thus, the stress tensor components are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{yy} = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{zz} \\neq 0\n$$\nAnd all shear stress components are zero: $\\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{yz} = \\sigma_{zx} = 0$. The zero shear stresses imply zero shear strains: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zx} = 0$.\n\nWe write out the constitutive equations for the normal stress components:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{yy} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\n\nFrom the first two equations, setting $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy}$ gives:\n$$\n\\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{yy}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $2G\\varepsilon_{xx} = 2G\\varepsilon_{yy}$. Since for any elastic solid $G > 0$, we must have $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy}$. This result is expected due to the transverse isotropy of the response to axial loading.\n\nNow, we substitute $\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\varepsilon_{xx}$ into the equation for $\\sigma_{xx} = 0$:\n$$\n\\lambda(2\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ in terms of $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$\n(2\\lambda + 2G)\\varepsilon_{xx} = -\\lambda\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2(\\lambda + G)} \\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nPoisson's ratio, $\\nu$, is defined for uniaxial loading as the negative ratio of transverse strain to axial strain. For loading along the $z$-axis, this is $\\nu = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\varepsilon_{zz}}$. Comparing this definition with our derived relationship, we explicitly quantify the lateral contraction through Poisson's ratio:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\lambda}{2(\\lambda + G)}\n$$\nTherefore, the relationship between the strain components is $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = -\\nu\\varepsilon_{zz}$.\n\nThe problem prescribes the total volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_{v}$, which is the trace of the strain tensor:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{v} = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nSubstituting the strain relationships into this definition:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{v} = (-\\nu\\varepsilon_{zz}) + (-\\nu\\varepsilon_{zz}) + \\varepsilon_{zz} = (1 - 2\\nu)\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nThis equation relates the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ to the prescribed volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_{v}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{v}}{1 - 2\\nu}\n$$\n\nOur final goal is to find the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$. We can use the definition of Young's modulus, $E$, which for uniaxial stress is $\\sigma_{zz} = E\\varepsilon_{zz}$. Substituting the expression for $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = E \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{v}}{1 - 2\\nu}\\right) = \\frac{E}{1 - 2\\nu} \\varepsilon_{v}\n$$\nThis formula expresses the required axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ in terms of the given quantities $E$, $\\nu$, and $\\varepsilon_{v}$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- Young's modulus $E = 73.1\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 73.1 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Poisson's ratio $\\nu = 0.33$\n- Prescribed volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_{v} = 9.10 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\nThe denominator is calculated first:\n$$\n1 - 2\\nu = 1 - 2(0.33) = 1 - 0.66 = 0.34\n$$\nNow we compute the stress $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\frac{73.1 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{0.34} \\times (9.10 \\times 10^{-4})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\left(\\frac{73.1 \\times 9.10}{0.34}\\right) \\times 10^{9-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\left(\\frac{665.21}{0.34}\\right) \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 1956.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1.9565 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = 195.65\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = 195.7\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$",

The deviatoric stress is $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\mathrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 2G \\mathrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^e)$.\n\nPlastic flow is governed by the von Mises yield criterion with linear isotropic hardening:\n$$ f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\alpha) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha) \\le 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}}$, $\\sigma_{y0}$ is the initial yield stress, $H$ is the hardening modulus, and $\\alpha$ is the accumulated equivalent plastic strain.\n\nThe plastic flow is associative, meaning the plastic strain rate is normal to the yield surface:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} $$\nThe plastic multiplier $\\dot{\\lambda}$ must satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions: $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$, $f \\le 0$, $\\dot{\\lambda}f = 0$.\n\nThe evolution of the hardening variable $\\alpha$ is given by the non-standard relation:\n$$ \\dot{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\dot{\\lambda} $$\nThis differs from the standard work-conjugate definition, which would yield $\\dot{\\alpha} = \\dot{\\lambda}$.\n\n### Derivation of the Radial Return Algorithm\nWe use an implicit backward-Euler scheme to integrate the flow rules over a time step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$. All rates $\\dot{(\\cdot)}$ are approximated as increments $\\Delta(\\cdot) = (\\cdot)_{n+1} - (\\cdot)_n$.\n\n#### 1. Elastic Predictor\nFirst, we assume the entire strain increment $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_n$ is elastic. This gives a trial stress state, denoted by a `trial` superscript.\nThe trial elastic strain at step $n+1$ is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n $$\nThe trial stress is computed from Hooke's law:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}} = \\mathbb{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n) $$\nThis relation can be decomposed into volumetric and deviatoric parts:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}) = 3\\kappa \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} = 2G \\, \\mathrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n) $$\nThe trial equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} : \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}}$.\n\n#### 2. Yield Check\nWe check if this trial stress state violates the yield condition. The yield surface at the beginning of the step is defined by $\\alpha_n$.\n$$ f^{\\text{trial}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n) $$\n- If $f^{\\text{trial}} \\le 0$, the assumption was correct. The step is elastic. The state variables are updated trivially:\n  $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n$, and $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n$.\n- If $f^{\\text{trial}} > 0$, the trial stress lies outside the elastic domain. Plastic deformation occurs, and a corrector step is needed.\n\n#### 3. Plastic Corrector\nFor a plastic step, the state at $n+1$ must satisfy a discrete version of the constitutive laws.\nThe stress is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\mathbb{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{n+1}) = \\mathbb{C} : (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n - \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}} - \\mathbb{C} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p $$\nThe plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p$ is deviatoric, so its product with $\\mathbb{C}$ only affects the deviatoric part of stress. The volumetric/hydrostatic stress is preserved from the trial state.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} - 2G \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p $$\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}) $$\nThe backward-Euler discrete flow rule is:\n$$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\left. \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\right|_{n+1} = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the consistency parameter. Substituting this into the deviatoric stress update:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} - 2G \\left( \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} - 3G \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}} $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3G \\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} $$\nThis equation shows that $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}$ are coaxial. This means the stress is returned \"radially\" toward the origin in the deviatoric stress space.\nTaking the Frobenius norm of both sides and converting to equivalent stress ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{3/2} \\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|$):\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3G \\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}} \\right) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} \\implies \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} + 3G \\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} $$\nThis is the first equation for our unknowns $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}$ and $\\Delta\\lambda$. The second comes from the consistency condition, $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_{n+1}) = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_{n+1} $$\nThe discrete hardening law is $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_n + \\sqrt{2/3} \\Delta\\lambda$. Substituting this into the yield condition:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} = \\sigma_{y0} + H(\\alpha_n + \\sqrt{2/3} \\Delta\\lambda) = (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n) + H\\sqrt{2/3} \\Delta\\lambda $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}$ and $\\Delta\\lambda$. Substituting for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}$:\n$$ (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n) + H\\sqrt{2/3} \\Delta\\lambda + 3G \\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda (3G + H\\sqrt{2/3}) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n) $$\nThe right-hand side is precisely $f^{\\text{trial}}$. So, the plastic multiplier is:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{f^{\\text{trial}}}{3G + H\\sqrt{2/3}} $$\nSince we are in the plastic case, $f^{\\text{trial}} > 0$. As $G > 0$ and $H \\ge 0$, we have $\\Delta\\lambda > 0$.\n\nWith $\\Delta\\lambda$ known, all variables at step $n+1$ can be determined:\n1.  $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_n)}{3G + H\\sqrt{2/3}}$\n2.  $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\sqrt{2/3}\\Delta\\lambda$\n3.  $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}}} \\right)$\n4.  $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}) \\boldsymbol{I}$\n5.  $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}$ is coaxial with $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}$, we can also write $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p = \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}}}$.\n6.  $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_n + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p$\n\n### Proof of Yield Condition Satisfaction\nThe problem requires proof that the updated stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ lies on the yield surface, i.e., $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})=0$, in a plastic step. This is satisfied by construction. The derivation for $\\Delta\\lambda$ was based on simultaneously enforcing the stress-strain relation and the yield condition. By substituting the expression for $\\Delta\\lambda$ back into the update rules, we can verify this.\nWe have $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - 3G\\Delta\\lambda$.\nThe updated yield stress is $\\sigma_y(\\alpha_{n+1}) = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) + H\\sqrt{2/3}\\Delta\\lambda$.\nWe must show $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_{n+1})$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - 3G\\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) + H\\sqrt{2/3}\\Delta\\lambda $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_y(\\alpha_n) = (3G + H\\sqrt{2/3})\\Delta\\lambda $$\n$$ f^{\\text{trial}} = (3G + H\\sqrt{2/3})\\Delta\\lambda $$\nThis is precisely the equation from which $\\Delta\\lambda$ was derived. Thus, the algorithm guarantees that $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ lies on the updated yield surface $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})=0$ to within numerical precision.\n\n### Proof of Maximum Plastic Dissipation\nThe problem asks to prove that the plastic increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p$ maximizes the dissipation increment $\\Delta D = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p$ among all admissible deviatoric plastic increments of a fixed norm. This is a statement of the principle of maximum plastic dissipation, which is a key feature of associative plasticity.\nThe theory of plasticity postulates (Drucker's stability postulate) that for any external agency that starts from a zero state and applies and then removes a set of forces, the work done by the external agency is non-negative. This leads to the principle of maximum plastic dissipation, which states that for any admissible stress state $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^*$ (i.e., $f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^*, \\alpha) \\le 0$), the following inequality holds:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^*) : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p \\ge 0 $$\nwhere $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p$ is the plastic strain rate corresponding to the stress state $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. For an associative flow rule, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$. Since the yield surface $f$ is a convex function of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, this inequality is naturally satisfied.\n\nSpecializing to our problem, we want to show that for our computed $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p = \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}$, the dissipation $\\Delta D = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}$ is maximal.\nSince the plastic strain increment is deviatoric, $\\Delta D = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}$.\nFrom the associative flow rule, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}$ is proportional to $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}$, i.e., $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}} = c \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}$ for some positive scalar $c = \\frac{3 \\Delta\\lambda}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}}$.\nSo, $\\Delta D = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} : (c \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}) = c \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\|^2$.\nNow consider any other admissible deviatoric increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}}$ with the same norm: $\\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}}\\| = \\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}\\|$.\nThe dissipation for this other increment is $\\Delta D_{\\text{other}} = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}}$.\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n$$ \\Delta D_{\\text{other}} = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}} \\le \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\| \\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}}\\| $$\nSince $\\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{other}}\\| = \\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^p_{\\text{calc}}\\| = \\|c \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\|_F = c \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\|$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta D_{\\text{other}} \\le \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\| (c \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\|) = c \\|\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}\\|^2 = \\Delta D $$\nThis proves that the dissipation is maximized by the strain increment collinear with the deviatoric stress, which is exactly what the associative flow rule provides. The numerical part of the task will verify this property by sampling random directions.",
