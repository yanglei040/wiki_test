It is therefore deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe stationary states of the particle are described by the time-independent Schrödinger equation in one dimension:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \\psi(x) = E \\psi(x) $$\nSubstituting the potential $V(x) = \\lambda \\delta(x)$, we have:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + \\lambda \\delta(x) \\psi(x) = E \\psi(x) $$\nFor any region where $x \\neq 0$, the potential is zero, and the equation simplifies to that of a free particle:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(x) = -k^2 \\psi(x) $$\nwhere the wave number $k$ is defined as $k = \\sqrt{2mE}/\\hbar$.\n\nThe general solution is a superposition of plane waves. We model the scattering process for a particle incident from the left (region $x<0$). The wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ can be written as:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\begin{cases} \\psi_L(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx} & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ \\psi_R(x) = C e^{ikx} & \\text{for } x > 0 \\end{cases} $$\nHere, $A e^{ikx}$ is the incident wave, $B e^{-ikx}$ is the reflected wave, and $C e^{ikx}$ is the transmitted wave. Without loss of generality, we set the incident amplitude $A=1$. The coefficients $B$ and $C$ then become the reflection amplitude $r$ and the transmission amplitude $t$, respectively.\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\begin{cases} e^{ikx} + r e^{-ikx} & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ t e^{ikx} & \\text{for } x > 0 \\end{cases} $$\nTo find $r$ and $t$, we apply boundary conditions at the location of the scatterer, $x=0$.\nFirst, the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ must be continuous at $x=0$:\n$$ \\psi_L(0) = \\psi_R(0) $$\n$$ e^{ik(0)} + r e^{-ik(0)} = t e^{ik(0)} $$\n$$ 1 + r = t \\quad (1) $$\nSecond, the derivative of the wavefunction, $\\psi'(x)$, has a specific discontinuity at the location of the delta potential. To find this condition, we integrate the Schrödinger equation over a small interval $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ around $x=0$ and then take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$ \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + \\lambda \\delta(x) \\psi(x) \\right) dx = \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} E \\psi(x) dx $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left[ \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} + \\lambda \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) \\psi(x) dx = E \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\psi(x) dx $$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the right-hand side vanishes because $E$ is finite and $\\psi(x)$ is continuous (and thus bounded) in the interval. The integral of the delta function yields $\\psi(0)$. The equation becomes:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\psi'(0^+) - \\psi'(0^-) \\right) + \\lambda \\psi(0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\psi'(0^+) - \\psi'(0^-) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(0) $$\nThe derivatives are $\\psi'_L(x) = ik(e^{ikx} - r e^{-ikx})$ and $\\psi'_R(x) = ikt e^{ikx}$. Evaluating at $x=0$:\n$$ \\psi'(0^-) = ik(1-r) $$\n$$ \\psi'(0^+) = ikt $$\nAnd $\\psi(0) = t$. Substituting these into the discontinuity condition:\n$$ ikt - ik(1-r) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t \\quad (2) $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $r$ and $t$. From equation ($1$), $r = t-1$. Substituting this into equation ($2$):\n$$ ikt - ik(1-(t-1)) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t $$\n$$ ikt - ik(2-t) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t $$\n$$ 2ikt - 2ik = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t $$\n$$ ikt - ik = \\frac{m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t $$\n$$ t \\left(ik - \\frac{m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2}\\right) = ik $$\nSolving for the transmission amplitude $t$:\n$$ t(E) = \\frac{ik}{ik - \\frac{m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2}} = \\frac{ik\\hbar^2}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda} $$\nSolving for the reflection amplitude $r$ using $r=t-1$:\n$$ r(E) = \\frac{ik\\hbar^2}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda} - 1 = \\frac{ik\\hbar^2 - (ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda)}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda} = \\frac{m\\lambda}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda} $$\n\nThe $S$-matrix relates the outgoing wave amplitudes ($b_1, b_2$) to the incoming wave amplitudes ($a_1, a_2$) for the two leads (lead $1$: $x<0$, lead $2$: $x>0$). For a single channel, the wavefunctions in the leads are:\n$\\psi_1(x) = a_1 e^{ikx} + b_1 e^{-ikx}$\n$\\psi_2(x) = a_2 e^{-ikx} + b_2 e^{ikx}$\nThe S-matrix is defined by $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix} = S \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor incidence from the left, $a_1=1$ and $a_2=0$. The outgoing amplitudes are $b_1=r$ and $b_2=t$. This gives $S_{11}=r$ and $S_{21}=t$.\nFor incidence from the right, $a_1=0$ and $a_2=1$. By symmetry of the problem under spatial reflection ($x \\to -x$), the reflection and transmission amplitudes are the same, denoted $r'$ and $t'$. We find $S_{22}=r'$ and $S_{12}=t'$. The physics of the point scatterer is identical from both sides, so $r'=r$ and $t'=t$.\nTherefore, the $S$-matrix is:\n$$ S(E) = \\begin{pmatrix} r(E) & t(E) \\\\ t(E) & r(E) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda} \\begin{pmatrix} m\\lambda & ik\\hbar^2 \\\\ ik\\hbar^2 & m\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe transmission probability $T(E)$ and reflection probability $R(E)$ are the squared moduli of the respective amplitudes:\n$$ T(E) = |t(E)|^2 = t(E)t^*(E) = \\left(\\frac{ik\\hbar^2}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda}\\right) \\left(\\frac{-ik\\hbar^2}{-ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{k^2\\hbar^4}{(m\\lambda)^2 - (ik\\hbar^2)^2} = \\frac{k^2\\hbar^4}{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4} $$\n$$ R(E) = |r(E)|^2 = r(E)r^*(E) = \\left(\\frac{m\\lambda}{ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m\\lambda}{-ik\\hbar^2 - m\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{m^2\\lambda^2}{(m\\lambda)^2 - (ik\\hbar^2)^2} = \\frac{m^2\\lambda^2}{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4} $$\nConservation of probability current requires $R(E) + T(E) = 1$:\n$$ R(E) + T(E) = \\frac{m^2\\lambda^2}{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4} + \\frac{k^2\\hbar^4}{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4} = \\frac{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4}{m^2\\lambda^2 + k^2\\hbar^4} = 1 $$\nThis condition is satisfied. Using $k^2 = 2mE/\\hbar^2$, we can express $T(E)$ in terms of energy $E$:\n$$ T(E) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\right)\\hbar^4}{m^2\\lambda^2 + \\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\right)\\hbar^4} = \\frac{2mE\\hbar^2}{m^2\\lambda^2 + 2mE\\hbar^2} $$\n\nTo verify the unitarity of $S(E)$, we must show $S^\\dagger S = I$:\n$$ S^\\dagger S = \\begin{pmatrix} r^* & t^* \\\\ t^* & r^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r & t \\\\ t & r \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} |r|^2+|t|^2 & r^*t+t^*r \\\\ t^*r+r^*t & |t|^2+|r|^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe diagonal elements are $|r|^2+|t|^2 = R+T=1$.\nThe off-diagonal elements are $r^*t+t^*r$. Let $D = ik\\hbar^2-m\\lambda$.\n$$ r^*t+t^*r = \\left(\\frac{m\\lambda}{D^*}\\right)\\left(\\frac{ik\\hbar^2}{D}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-ik\\hbar^2}{D^*}\\right)\\left(\\frac{m\\lambda}{D}\\right) = \\frac{ik\\hbar^2 m\\lambda}{|D|^2} - \\frac{ik\\hbar^2 m\\lambda}{|D|^2} = 0 $$\nThus, $S^\\dagger S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, confirming that $S(E)$ is unitary.\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of $T(E)$ and $R(E)$ in the specified limits:\n1. Low-energy limit ($E \\to 0$):\nAs $E \\to 0$, the numerator $2mE\\hbar^2 \\to 0$.\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to 0} T(E) = \\lim_{E \\to 0} \\frac{2mE\\hbar^2}{m^2\\lambda^2 + 2mE\\hbar^2} = \\frac{0}{m^2\\lambda^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to 0} R(E) = 1 - T(E) = 1 $$\nInterpretation: At very low energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the particle is very large. The sharply localized delta potential acts as a strong scatterer, causing perfect reflection. In the Landauer-Büttiker framework, the two-terminal conductance is $G = (2e^2/h) T$ (including spin degeneracy). As $T \\to 0$, the conductance vanishes, and the system behaves as an insulator.\n\n2. High-energy limit ($E \\to \\infty$):\nAs $E \\to \\infty$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $2mE\\hbar^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} T(E) = \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{m^2\\lambda^2}{2mE\\hbar^2} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0+1} = 1 $$\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} R(E) = 1 - T(E) = 0 $$\nInterpretation: At very high energies, the de Broglie wavelength is very short. The particle is insensitive to the infinitesimally narrow potential barrier and passes through with perfect transmission. In the LB picture, as $T \\to 1$, the conductance approaches the ideal quantized value, $G \\to 2e^2/h$. The conductor behaves like a perfect, ballistic wire.",

The single-particle Schrödinger equation for an electron with effective mass $m^*$ is separable. The wavefunction can be written as $\\Psi(x, y) = \\phi(y) \\exp(i k_x x)$, where $k_x$ is the longitudinal wavevector.\n\nThe confinement in the $y$-direction is described by a one-dimensional \"particle in a box\" problem with hard-wall boundary conditions at $y=0$ and $y=W$. The transverse wavefunction $\\phi(y)$ must satisfy $\\phi(0) = 0$ and $\\phi(W) = 0$. The solutions are standing waves of the form:\n$$\n\\phi_n(y) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{W}} \\sin(k_y y)\n$$\nwhere the transverse wavevector $k_y$ is quantized to satisfy the boundary conditions:\n$$\nk_{y,n} = \\frac{n \\pi}{W}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nEach integer $n$ corresponds to a transverse mode, or \"subband\".

The surface Green’s function of the semi-infinite one-dimensional lead must be used to construct the retarded self-energies for the left and right contacts.\n\n2) Improper finite-box leads:\n   - Replace each semi-infinite lead by a finite chain of $N_\\mathrm{f}$ sites with the same tight-binding parameters, terminated by a hard wall at the far end. Use the surface Green’s function of this finite chain to construct an energy-dependent self-energy acting on the device end site. This “finite-box” self-energy approximates the true open boundary poorly for small $N_\\mathrm{f}$ and produces reflections and Fabry–Pérot-like interference in the transmission.\n\nTasks you must implement:\n- Build the device Hamiltonian for the specified $N_\\mathrm{d}$ and $U$.\n- For each energy $E$ on the grid, compute the retarded device Green’s function for case (1) using correct semi-infinite self-energies for left and right contacts, and calculate the energy-resolved coherent transmission $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$.\n- For each energy $E$ on the grid, compute the retarded device Green’s function for case (2) using finite-chain self-energies for four different finite chain lengths $N_\\mathrm{f}$, and calculate the corresponding $T_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$.\n- For each $N_\\mathrm{f}$ in the test suite below, quantify the spurious interference by computing two scalar diagnostics over the energy grid:\n  - The root-mean-square deviation $D_\\mathrm{rms}(N_\\mathrm{f})$ between $T_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$ and $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$.\n  - The maximum absolute deviation $D_\\mathrm{max}(N_\\mathrm{f})$ between $T_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$ and $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following four finite-chain lengths for the improper finite-box lead model:\n  - $N_\\mathrm{f}^{(1)} = 200$ (near-converged reference for the finite approximation),\n  - $N_\\mathrm{f}^{(2)} = 40$,\n  - $N_\\mathrm{f}^{(3)} = 10$,\n  - $N_\\mathrm{f}^{(4)} = 3$.\n\nProgram requirements and final output:\n- Your program must compute $D_\\mathrm{rms}$ and $D_\\mathrm{max}$ for each of the four $N_\\mathrm{f}$ values.\n- Each result must be a pair of floats $[D_\\mathrm{rms}, D_\\mathrm{max}]$, each rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the test suite and with each test case formatted as its own bracketed two-float list. For example: \"[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],[x3,y3],[x4,y4]]\".\n- No physical units are involved; all quantities are dimensionless in the tight-binding convention used here.\n- Angles are not used.\n- The program must be self-contained and produce the output with no user input.\n\nNote: You must start from fundamental definitions of the retarded Green’s function, contact-induced self-energies, and the Landauer–Büttiker transmission in coherent, phase-preserving transport. You must not assume or use any pre-quoted “shortcut” formulas not derivable from these fundamentals within this context.",
            "solution": "The user wants to model ballistic quantum transport through a one-dimensional tight-binding device using the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, specifically within the Landauer-Büttiker framework. The core task is to compare two different treatments for the boundary conditions imposed by the contacts (leads): an exact treatment using semi-infinite leads and an approximate treatment using finite-sized leads (a \"finite box\"). The spurious interference introduced by the finite-box approximation must be quantified.\n\n### 1. Problem Validation\nThe problem statement is validated against the required criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Device Model**: $N_\\mathrm{d} = 7$ sites, 1D tight-binding chain.\n- **Device Hamiltonian**: Nearest-neighbor hopping magnitude $t = 1$. On-site energies are zero, except for a barrier $U = 0.5$ at the central site.\n- **Leads**: Two identical semi-infinite 1D tight-binding chains (left and right).\n- **Leads Hamiltonian**: Nearest-neighbor hopping magnitude $t = 1$.

Retarded Green's function infinitesimal broadening $\\eta = 10^{-9}$.\n- **Boundary Condition Cases**:\n  1.  **Proper (Open)**: Leads are semi-infinite, modeled by an exact self-energy.\n  2.  **Improper (Finite-Box)**: Leads are finite chains of length $N_\\mathrm{f}$, modeled by a corresponding approximate self-energy.\n- **Task**: For each $N_\\mathrm{f}$ in the test suite $\\{200, 40, 10, 3\\}$, compute the root-mean-square deviation ($D_\\mathrm{rms}$) and maximum absolute deviation ($D_\\mathrm{max}$) between the transmission functions $T_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$ and $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$.\n- **Output**: A list of $[D_\\mathrm{rms}, D_\\mathrm{max}]$ pairs, with values rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard, well-established principles of quantum transport theory (NEGF, Landauer-Büttiker formalism, tight-binding model). All aspects are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary parameters provided. The objective is to perform a standard numerical experiment comparing two computational methods, for which a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. All terms are standard in the field of computational condensed matter physics.\n- **Other Criteria**: The problem is formalizable, relevant to the topic, internally consistent, physically plausible (within a model context), and algorithmically solvable. It is a non-trivial problem that requires a correct implementation of the specified physical formalism.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A step-by-step solution will be developed.\n\n### 2. Principle-Based Solution Design\nThe solution is constructed following the fundamental principles of the NEGF formalism.\n\n**A. Device Hamiltonian ($H_\\mathrm{d}$)**\nThe device is a 1D chain of $N_\\mathrm{d} = 7$ sites. The Hamiltonian $H_\\mathrm{d}$ is a $7 \\times 7$ matrix. The matrix elements are $(H_\\mathrm{d})_{i,i} = \\epsilon_i$ and $(H_\\mathrm{d})_{i,i\\pm 1} = -t$. With $t=1$, the on-site energies $\\epsilon_i$ are $0$ everywhere except for the central site (index $3$ for $0$-based indexing), where $\\epsilon_3 = U = 0.5$.\n\n$$\nH_\\mathrm{d} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 0.5 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**B. Lead Self-Energy ($\\Sigma^R$)**\nThe effect of the semi-infinite leads is incorporated through a self-energy term $\\Sigma^R(E)$. For a lead coupled to a single device site, the self-energy is a matrix that is non-zero only at the element corresponding to that site. Here, the left lead couples to site $0$ and the right lead to site $N_\\mathrm{d}-1 = 6$.\nThe self-energy matrix element is given by $\\sigma(E) = t_\\mathrm{c}^2 g_s(E)$, where $g_s(E)$ is the surface Green's function of the isolated lead. The total self-energy is $\\Sigma^R = \\Sigma^R_L + \\Sigma^R_R$.\n\n1.  **Proper Self-Energy (Open Boundaries)**: For a semi-infinite 1D lead with hopping $t$, the surface Green's function $g_s(E)$ is the physical solution to the quadratic equation $t^2 g_s^2 - (E+i\\eta)g_s + 1 = 0$. The solution that ensures causality (retarded Green's function) and corresponds to outgoing waves is:\n    $$\n    g_s(E) = \\frac{(E+i\\eta) - \\sqrt{(E+i\\eta)^2 - 4t^2}}{2t^2}\n    $$\n    The complex square root must be handled carefully to select the correct physical branch, which depends on the sign of the energy $E$. Our implementation will correctly choose the branch that ensures $\\text{Im}[g_s(E)] \\le 0$. With $t=1$ and $t_c=1$, the self-energy matrix element becomes $\\sigma_\\mathrm{open}(E) = g_s(E)$.\n\n2.  **Improper Self-Energy (Finite-Box)**: For a lead approximated by a finite chain of $N_\\mathrm{f}$ sites, the surface Green's function is the $(0,0)$ element of the Green's function of that finite chain. This can be calculated efficiently using a continued fraction expansion derived from the recursive definition of the Green's function:\n    $$\n    g_1(E) = \\frac{1}{E+i\\eta}, \\quad g_n(E) = \\frac{1}{(E+i\\eta) - t^2 g_{n-1}(E)}\n    $$\n    We compute $g_{N_\\mathrm{f}}(E)$ iteratively. The self-energy element is then $\\sigma_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f}) = t_\\mathrm{c}^2 g_{N_\\mathrm{f}}(E)$.\n\n**C. Device Green's Function ($G^R$) and Transmission ($T(E)$)**\nThe retarded Green's function of the device, including the influence of the leads, is:\n$$\nG^R(E) = \\left[ (E+i\\eta)I - H_\\mathrm{d} - \\Sigma^R_L(E) - \\Sigma^R_R(E) \\right]^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\Sigma^R_{L/R}$ are the self-energy matrices for the left/right leads.\n\nThe transmission probability from the left to the right lead is given by the Landauer-Büttiker formula:\n$$\nT(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\Gamma_R(E) G^R(E) \\Gamma_L(E) G^A(E) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $G^A(E) = [G^R(E)]^\\dagger$ is the advanced Green's function, and $\\Gamma_{L,R}(E)$ are the broadening matrices, defined as $\\Gamma_{L,R}(E) = i[\\Sigma^R_{L,R}(E) - \\Sigma^A_{L,R}(E)] = -2\\mathrm{Im}[\\Sigma^R_{L,R}(E)]$. For single-site coupling, this simplifies to the Fisher-Lee relation:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_L(E) \\Gamma_R(E) |G^R_{N_\\mathrm{d}-1, 0}(E)|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{L,R}$ are the scalar broadening values at the coupling sites, and $G^R_{N_\\mathrm{d}-1, 0}$ is the matrix element of the device Green's function connecting the first and last sites.\n\n**D. Algorithm**\n1.  Construct the device Hamiltonian $H_\\mathrm{d}$.\n2.  Define the energy grid.\n3.  Calculate the benchmark transmission array $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$ by iterating over the energy grid. In each step, compute $\\sigma_\\mathrm{open}(E)$, then $G^R(E)$, and finally $T_\\mathrm{open}(E)$.\n4.  For each finite length $N_\\mathrm{f}$ in the test suite:\n    a. Calculate the transmission array $T_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$ similarly, using $\\sigma_\\mathrm{box}(E; N_\\mathrm{f})$.\n    b. Compute the Root-Mean-Square Deviation: $D_\\mathrm{rms}(N_\\mathrm{f}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_E} \\sum_{i} [T_\\mathrm{box}(E_i; N_\\mathrm{f}) - T_\\mathrm{open}(E_i)]^2}$.\n    c. Compute the Maximum Absolute Deviation: $D_\\mathrm{max}(N_\\mathrm{f}) = \\max_i |T_\\mathrm{box}(E_i; N_\\mathrm{f}) - T_\\mathrm{open}(E_i)|$.\n5.  Collect and format the results $[D_\\mathrm{rms}, D_\\mathrm{max}]$ for each $N_\\mathrm{f}$ as specified.\n\nThis systematic procedure ensures that the solution is built from first principles and correctly implements the required physics.",
