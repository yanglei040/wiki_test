            "solution": "The problem as stated is a valid, well-posed, and fundamental exercise in solid-state physics. It provides all necessary information and relies on established physical principles. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional chain of identical atoms of mass $M$ with an equilibrium lattice spacing of $a$. We consider only nearest-neighbor interactions modeled by harmonic springs of constant $K$. Let $u_n(t)$ be the displacement of the $n$-th atom from its equilibrium position $x_n = na$.\n\nWithin the harmonic approximation, the total potential energy $V$ of the crystal lattice can be written as a sum over the potential energies of the individual springs:\n$$\nV = \\frac{1}{2} K \\sum_n (u_{n+1} - u_n)^2\n$$\nThe force on the $n$-th atom, $F_n$, is given by the negative gradient of the potential energy with respect to its displacement $u_n$:\n$$\nF_n = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial u_n} = - \\frac{1}{2} K \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_n} (u_n - u_{n-1})^2 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_n} (u_{n+1} - u_n)^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF_n = - \\frac{1}{2} K \\left[ 2(u_n - u_{n-1})(1) + 2(u_{n+1} - u_n)(-1) \\right] = -K [(u_n - u_{n-1}) - (u_{n+1} - u_n)]\n$$\n$$\nF_n = K (u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1})\n$$\nApplying Newton's second law, $F_n = M \\ddot{u}_n$, we obtain the equation of motion for the $n$-th atom:\n$$\nM \\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = K (u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1})\n$$\nThis set of coupled differential equations describes the lattice vibrations. The problem directs a solution via the dynamical matrix formalism. The equation of motion can be generally written in terms of the interatomic force constants $\\Phi(n, n')$ as:\n$$\nM \\ddot{u}_n = -\\sum_{n'} \\Phi(n, n') u_{n'}\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(n, n') = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial u_n \\partial u_{n'}}$. By comparing this form with our derived equation of motion, we can identify the force constants. Let's compute them directly from the potential energy:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial u_n} = K(2u_n - u_{n-1} - u_{n+1})\n$$\nThe second derivatives yield the force constants:\nFor $n' = n$:\n$$\n\\Phi(n, n) = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial u_n^2} = 2K\n$$\nFor $n' = n+1$:\n$$\n\\Phi(n, n+1) = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial u_n \\partial u_{n+1}} = -K\n$$\nFor $n' = n-1$:\n$$\n\\Phi(n, n-1) = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial u_n \\partial u_{n-1}} = -K\n$$\nFor $|n - n'| > 1$, the force constants are zero, consistent with nearest-neighbor interactions.\n\nThe dynamical matrix in real space is defined as $D(n, n') = \\frac{1}{M}\\Phi(n,n')$.

Analysis of Limiting Cases\n\n**(i) Monatomic limit: $M_1 \\to M_2 \\equiv M$**\n\nIn this limit, the secular equation becomes:\n$$\nM^2 \\omega^4 - 4KM\\omega^2 + 4K^2\\sin^2(qa/2) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{4KM \\pm \\sqrt{16K^2M^2 - 16K^2M^2\\sin^2(qa/2)}}{2M^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{4KM \\pm \\sqrt{16K^2M^2\\cos^2(qa/2)}}{2M^2} = \\frac{4KM \\pm 4KM|\\cos(qa/2)|}{2M^2}\n$$\nGiven the restriction $q\\in[-\\pi/a,\\pi/a]$, we have $qa/2 \\in [-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$, so $\\cos(qa/2) \\ge 0$.\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{2K}{M}(1 \\pm \\cos(qa/2))\n$$\nAcoustic branch ($\\omega^2 \\to 0$ as $q \\to 0$):\n$\\omega_{ac}^2(q) = \\frac{2K}{M}(1 - \\cos(qa/2))$. Using the half-angle identity $1-\\cos(x) = 2\\sin^2(x/2)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\omega_{ac}^2(q) = \\frac{4K}{M}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{4}\\right)\n$$\nOptical branch:\n$\\omega_{op}^2(q) = \\frac{2K}{M}(1 + \\cos(qa/2))$. Using the half-angle identity $1+\\cos(x) = 2\\cos^2(x/2)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\omega_{op}^2(q) = \\frac{4K}{M}\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{4}\\right)\n$$\n*Interpretation*: Physically, the chain becomes a monatomic lattice with spacing $a/2$. The choice of a two-atom basis in a cell of length $a$ is now artificial, causing the dispersion relation of the true monatomic chain (which exists over a Brillouin zone of $[-2\\pi/a, 2\\pi/a]$) to be folded back into the smaller zone $[-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$. This folding creates the optical branch from the upper half of the monatomic dispersion. The band gap closes at the zone boundary $q=\\pi/a$, where $\\omega_{ac}^2 = \\omega_{op}^2 = 2K/M$, reflecting the true connectivity of the single physical branch.\n\n**(ii) Heavy-mass limit: $M_2 \\to \\infty$ with $M_1, K$ fixed.**\n\nWe analyze the two roots of the secular equation in the limit $M_2 \\to \\infty$. We use Vieta's formulas:\nSum of roots: $\\omega_{op}^2 + \\omega_{ac}^2 = 2K(\\frac{1}{M_1} + \\frac{1}{M_2})$\nProduct of roots: $\\omega_{op}^2 \\omega_{ac}^2 = \\frac{4K^2}{M_1 M_2}\\sin^2(qa/2)$\n\nAs $M_2 \\to \\infty$, the product of roots approaches $0$. This implies one of the roots must go to zero. This is the acoustic branch, $\\omega_{ac}^2 \\to 0$.\nFrom the sum of roots, we can find the limit of the optical branch:\n$$\n\\lim_{M_2 \\to \\infty} (\\omega_{op}^2 + \\omega_{ac}^2) = \\lim_{M_2 \\to \\infty} 2K\\left(\\frac{1}{M_1} + \\frac{1}{M_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{op}^2 + 0 = \\frac{2K}{M_1} \\implies \\omega_{op}^2(q) = \\frac{2K}{M_1}\n$$\nThe optical branch becomes a flat, non-dispersive band.\n\nTo find the form of the acoustic branch, we use the product of roots, substituting the limiting form of $\\omega_{op}^2$:\n$$\n\\omega_{ac}^2 = \\frac{4K^2}{M_1 M_2 \\omega_{op}^2}\\sin^2(qa/2)\n$$\nIn the limit of large $M_2$, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_{ac}^2(q) \\approx \\frac{4K^2}{M_1 M_2 (2K/M_1)}\\sin^2(qa/2) = \\frac{2K}{M_2}\\sin^2(qa/2)\n$$\n*Interpretation*: As $M_2 \\to \\infty$, these atoms become immobile, acting as fixed nodes. The acoustic branch, which corresponds to the collective in-phase motion of the atoms in the unit cell, vanishes as the center of mass of the cell can no longer move. The optical branch now represents the vibrations of the light atoms ($M_1$) against these fixed heavy atoms. Each atom of mass $M_1$ is now effectively isolated, oscillating between two fixed points. This results in a single vibrational frequency $\\omega^2 = 2K/M_1$ that is independent of the wavevector $q$, hence the dispersion relation is flat, and the group velocity is zero.\n\n### 3. Final Analytical Expressions\n\nThe four required functions $\\omega^2(q)$ are:\n1.  Case (i) Acoustic: $\\omega^2_{ac}(q) = \\frac{4K}{M}\\sin^2(\\frac{qa}{4})$\n2.  Case (i) Optical: $\\omega^2_{op}(q) = \\frac{4K}{M}\\cos^2(\\frac{qa}{4})$\n3.  Case (ii) Acoustic: $\\omega^2_{ac}(q) = \\frac{2K}{M_2}\\sin^2(\\frac{qa}{2})$\n4.

If $|\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)|$ decreases monotonically with increasing $L$ and extrapolates to $0$ as $L \\to \\infty$, while being essentially independent of $\\Delta$ when $\\Delta$ is sufficiently small, the imaginary frequency is most consistent with finite-supercell truncation error, i.e., a numerical artifact that vanishes as $L \\to \\infty$.**\n\nThis statement describes a convergence test with respect to the supercell size, $L$. The dynamical matrix calculated using a finite supercell, $D_L(\\mathbf{q})$, is an approximation to the exact dynamical matrix of the infinite crystal, $D_\\infty(\\mathbf{q})$. The error is given by $E_L(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{R}\\notin \\text{supercell}} \\Phi^{(2)}(\\mathbf{R}) e^{i \\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{R}}$, which is a sum over all lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}$ not contained within the supercell. This error term vanishes as $L \\to \\infty$ provided the force constants $\\Phi^{(2)}(\\mathbf{R})$ decay sufficiently rapidly with distance $|\\mathbf{R}|$.\n\nThe observation is that an imaginary frequency is found at finite $L$, meaning a calculated eigenvalue $\\omega^2_L(\\mathbf{q}^*)  0$. The magnitude of this imaginary mode is $|\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)| = -\\omega^2_L(\\mathbf{q}^*)$. The statement says that as $L$ increases, $-\\omega^2_L(\\mathbf{q}^*)$ monotonically decreases and extrapolates to $0$. This implies that in the limit $L \\to \\infty$, the eigenvalue $\\omega^2_\\infty(\\mathbf{q}^*)$ is non-negative. Therefore, the imaginary frequency observed at finite $L$ is a direct consequence of the truncation error $E_L(\\mathbf{q})$ and does not represent a property of the true, infinite crystal. The condition that the behavior is independent of the displacement amplitude $\\Delta$ for sufficiently small $\\Delta$ correctly isolates the finite-supercell size as the dominant source of the numerical error. This is a classic signature of a numerical artifact due to supercell truncation.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $|\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)|$ shows a strong dependence on $\\Delta$ at fixed large $L$, and an extrapolation to $\\Delta \\to 0$ yields $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)  0$, the imaginary frequency at finite $\\Delta$ is most consistent with finite-displacement contamination of the harmonic force constants, i.e., a numerical artifact that vanishes as $\\Delta \\to 0$.**\n\nThis statement describes a convergence test with respect to the displacement amplitude, $\\Delta$. The finite-displacement method estimates the harmonic force constants (second derivatives of the potential energy) using a finite-difference approximation. For any finite $\\Delta$, this approximation includes contributions from higher-order, anharmonic terms of the potential. The true harmonic force constants are only recovered in the limit $\\Delta \\to 0$.\n\nThe scenario describes a calculation at a fixed, large supercell size $L$, which minimizes the truncation error discussed in A. An imaginary frequency, $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)  0$, is observed for a finite $\\Delta$. However, upon systematically reducing $\\Delta$ and extrapolating to $\\Delta \\to 0$, the corresponding eigenvalue becomes positive, $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)  0$. This demonstrates that the negative curvature (the instability) is not a feature of the true harmonic potential but an artifact introduced by anharmonic contamination at finite $\\Delta$. The imaginary mode vanishes in the correct harmonic limit.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)$ remains negative in the double limit $\\Delta \\to 0$ and $L \\to \\infty$, and $|\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*;T)|$ increases in magnitude as $T \\to 0$, the imaginary frequency is most consistent with a genuine lattice instability, i.e., a negative curvature of the harmonic potential that persists and deepens as $T \\to 0$.**\n\nThis statement describes the conditions that confirm a genuine instability. First, the negative eigenvalue $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*)  0$ is shown to persist in the double limit of $\\Delta \\to 0$ and $L \\to \\infty$. This procedure is precisely what is required to eliminate the numerical artifacts discussed in options A and B and to obtain the true harmonic properties of the crystal. If the instability survives this limit, it is a genuine feature of the harmonic potential energy surface.\n\nSecond, the temperature dependence is considered. The problem states that the renormalized frequency $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q},s;T)$ at finite temperature $T$ approaches the bare harmonic value as $T \\to 0$. Anharmonic effects at finite temperature often act to stabilize the lattice (i.e., make $\\omega^2$ more positive). The observation that $|\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*;T)|$ increases as $T \\to 0$ means that the eigenvalue $\\omega^2(\\mathbf{q}^*;T)$ becomes more negative as the temperature is lowered. This behavior is perfectly consistent with the system approaching a true, underlying harmonic instability at $T=0$. The finite-temperature anharmonicity partially mitigates the instability, and removing this thermal effect by cooling reveals the full extent of the harmonic instability.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If imaginary frequencies occur only near $\\mathbf{q} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$ and disappear upon enforcing the acoustic sum rule (translational invariance) on $\\Phi^{(2)}$ or $D(\\mathbf{q})$, this removal indicates the presence of a genuine lattice instability at small $\\mathbf{q}$.**\n\nThe acoustic sum rule (ASR) is a physical constraint derived from the translational invariance of the crystal potential. It dictates that the three acoustic phonon branches must have zero frequency at the Brillouin zone center, $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}$. In numerical calculations, especially those using finite precision and finite supercells, this rule can be slightly violated. This numerical violation often manifests as non-zero frequencies for the acoustic modes at $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}$, which can incorrectly appear as small imaginary frequencies for $\\mathbf{q}$ near $\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nIt is a standard practice to apply a correction to the calculated force constants to enforce the ASR. This procedure is designed to remove these specific numerical artifacts related to the acoustic modes. If applying this correction causes the imaginary frequencies near $\\mathbf{q} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$ to disappear, it proves that they were a direct result of the numerical violation of the ASR. Therefore, these imaginary frequencies were numerical artifacts, not a genuine physical instability. A genuine instability (e.g., a ferroelectric soft mode) would not be removed by a procedure intended solely to restore translational invariance to the acoustic branches. The statement draws the exact opposite conclusion.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
