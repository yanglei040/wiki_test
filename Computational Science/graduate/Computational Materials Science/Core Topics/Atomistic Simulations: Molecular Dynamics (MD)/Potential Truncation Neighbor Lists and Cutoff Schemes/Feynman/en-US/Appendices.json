A smooth truncation over a finite switching shell can prevent non-physical discontinuities in energy, force, and the Hessian of the potential energy surface. Consider a twice continuously differentiable pair potential $U(r)$ that is to be switched off smoothly between a switching radius $r_s$ and a cutoff radius $r_c$ with $0r_sr_c$. Define the switched potential as $U_{\\text{sw}}(r)=S(r)U(r)$, where $S(r)$ is a switching function that satisfies $S(r)=1$ for $r\\le r_s$, $S(r)\\in C^2$ on $[r_s,r_c]$, and $S(r)=0$ for $r\\ge r_c$. To ensure that $U_{\\text{sw}}(r)$ has continuous value, first derivative, and second derivative at $r=r_s$ and $r=r_c$, it is necessary that $S(r)$ satisfy the endpoint conditions $S(r_s)=1$, $S'(r_s)=0$, $S''(r_s)=0$, $S(r_c)=0$, $S'(r_c)=0$, and $S''(r_c)=0$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental requirement that continuity of $U_{\\text{sw}}$, its first derivative $dU_{\\text{sw}}/dr$, and its second derivative $d^2U_{\\text{sw}}/dr^2$ at $r=r_s$ and $r=r_c$ must follow from the product rule for differentiation, construct a minimal-degree polynomial switching function $S(r)$ on $[r_s,r_c]$ that satisfies all six endpoint constraints.

First, we confirm that the given constraints on $S(r)$ are sufficient. Using the product rule for differentiation:\n$U'_{\\text{sw}}(r) = S'(r)U(r) + S(r)U'(r)$\n$U''_{\\text{sw}}(r) = S''(r)U(r) + 2S'(r)U'(r) + S(r)U''(r)$\n\nAt $r=r_s$, for continuity with the region $rr_s$ where $S(r)=1$, $S'(r)=0$, $S''(r)=0$, we require:\n- $U_{\\text{sw}}(r_s) = U(r_s) \\implies S(r_s)U(r_s) = U(r_s) \\implies S(r_s) = 1$.\n- $U'_{\\text{sw}}(r_s) = U'(r_s) \\implies S'(r_s)U(r_s) + S(r_s)U'(r_s) = U'(r_s) \\implies S'(r_s)U(r_s) = 0$, which implies $S'(r_s)=0$ (assuming $U(r_s) \\ne 0$).\n- $U''_{\\text{sw}}(r_s) = U''(r_s) \\implies S''(r_s)U(r_s) + 2S'(r_s)U'(r_s) + S(r_s)U''(r_s) = U''(r_s)$.

Also, $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4/\\pi) \\approx 0.12076$.\nThe equation becomes $y - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(y) \\approx 13.81551 + 0.12076 = 13.93627$.\nThis transcendental equation can be solved numerically, yielding $y \\approx 15.3$.\nLet $a = \\sqrt{k_B T / m}$ be the characteristic thermal speed. We have $y = (v_{\\max, \\text{MB}}/a)^2 / 2$. This gives $v_{\\max, \\text{MB}}/a \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\times 15.3} = \\sqrt{30.6} \\approx 5.5317$.\n\nNow we calculate the speed scale $a$:\n- $m = 39.948 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) = 6.633519 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}$.\n- $T = 120 \\text{ K}$.\n- $k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}$.\n- $k_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 120 = 1.6567788 \\times 10^{-21} \\text{ J}$.\n- $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.6567788 \\times 10^{-21} \\text{ J}}{6.633519 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{2.49754 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2} \\approx 158.036 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nThe speed limit from the MB distribution is:\n$$ v_{\\max, \\text{MB}} \\approx 5.5317 \\times 158.036 \\text{ m/s} \\approx 874.20 \\text{ m/s} $$\nNow, we compare this with the outlier speed:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{out}} = 1500 \\text{ m/s} $$\nThe effective maximum speed to use in our criterion is the larger of the two:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{eff\\_max}} = \\max(874.20 \\text{ m/s}, 1500 \\text{ m/s}) = 1500 \\text{ m/s} $$\nFinally, we compute the minimum skin distance $\\delta_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\delta_{\\min} = 2 v_{\\mathrm{eff\\_max}} N \\Delta t $$\nUsing the given values:\n- $v_{\\mathrm{eff\\_max}} = 1500 \\text{ m/s}$.\n- $N = 100$.\n- $\\Delta t = 2.0 \\text{ fs} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}$.\n\n$$ \\delta_{\\min} = 2 \\times (1500 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 100 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) = 600000 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers ($1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$).\n$$ \\delta_{\\min} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} = 0.60 \\text{ nm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as specified:\n$$ \\delta_{\\min} = 0.6000 \\text{ nm} $$\nThis result indicates that the presence of the single high-speed outlier particle is the determining factor for the required skin thickness, making the statistical considerations of the thermalized bulk fluid secondary in this specific case.",
