For equations that describe wave propagation, like the advection equation, these errors manifest as incorrect wave speeds (dispersion) and artificial amplitude decay (dissipation). This exercise provides a hands-on method to dissect and quantify these fundamental error types for two cornerstone schemes, the centered and upwind differences, by using Fourier analysis to derive their numerical dispersion relations. Understanding these properties is a foundational skill for selecting appropriate numerical methods and correctly interpreting their results.",

This algebraic manipulation cancels the unknown terms $C$ and $h_1$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3} = \\frac{C h_1^{p} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r^p}\\right)}{C \\frac{h_1^{p}}{r^p} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r^p}\\right)} = r^p $$\nWe can now solve for $p$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right) = \\ln(r^p) = p \\ln(r) $$\n$$ p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right)}{\\ln(r)} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$r = 2$\n$Q_1 = 1.24520$\n$Q_2 = 1.23528$\n$Q_3 = 1.23403$\n\nThe differences are:\n$Q_1 - Q_2 = 1.24520 - 1.23528 = 0.00992$\n$Q_2 - Q_3 = 1.23528 - 1.23403 = 0.00125$\n\nNow, we compute $p$:\n$$ p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.00992}{0.00125}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(7.936)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{2.071353}{0.693147} \\approx 2.988353 $$\nAs required, rounding to four significant figures gives $p = 2.988$.\n\nNext, we determine the extrapolated value $Q_{\\text{ext}} = Q_{\\infty}$ using Richardson extrapolation. It is standard practice to use the two finest grids ($h_2$ and $h_3$) for the extrapolation, as they represent the most accurate solutions and are most likely to be in the asymptotic range of convergence. The extrapolation formula is derived from the equations for $Q_2$ and $Q_3$:\n$Q_2 = Q_{\\infty} + C h_2^p$\n$Q_3 = Q_{\\infty} + C h_3^p = Q_{\\infty} + C (h_2/r)^p$\n\nFrom the first equation, the error on the medium grid is $E_2 = Q_2 - Q_{\\infty} = C h_2^p$.\nThe error on the fine grid is $E_3 = Q_3 - Q_{\\infty} = C h_3^p$.\nThe ratio of errors is $\\frac{E_2}{E_3} = \\frac{C h_2^p}{C h_3^p} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$.\nSo, $Q_2 - Q_{\\infty} = r^p (Q_3 - Q_{\\infty})$.\nRearranging to solve for $Q_{\\infty}$:\n$Q_2 - Q_{\\infty} = r^p Q_3 - r^p Q_{\\infty}$\n$Q_{\\infty} (r^p - 1) = r^p Q_3 - Q_2$\n$$ Q_{\\infty} = \\frac{r^p Q_3 - Q_2}{r^p - 1} $$\nThis can be rewritten in the more common and numerically stable form:\n$$ Q_{\\text{ext}} = Q_{\\infty} = Q_3 + \\frac{Q_3 - Q_2}{r^p - 1} $$\nWe can substitute the value of $r^p$ directly from our previous calculation, where $r^p = \\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3} = 7.936$.\nUsing the given values for $Q_2$ and $Q_3$:\n$Q_3 - Q_2 = 1.23403 - 1.23528 = -0.00125$\n$$ Q_{\\text{ext}} = 1.23403 + \\frac{-0.00125}{7.936 - 1} = 1.23403 - \\frac{0.00125}{6.936} $$\n$$ Q_{\\text{ext}} \\approx 1.23403 - 0.000180219146... = 1.2338497808... $$\nAs required, rounding to six significant figures gives $Q_{\\text{ext}} = 1.23385$.\n\nThe observed order of accuracy is $p \\approx 2.988$, and the grid-converged extrapolated value is $Q_{\\text{ext}} \\approx 1.23385$.",
