            "problem": "Consider a steady, axisymmetric, compressible, heated round jet of an ideal gas issuing from a circular nozzle of diameter $D$ into a quiescent ambient at pressure $p$ and temperature $T$. The jet has exit speed $U$. The gas is Newtonian with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, thermal conductivity $k$, and specific heat at constant pressure $c_p$. The gas obeys the ideal gas law with specific gas constant $R$, and the ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma$. Assume the continuum hypothesis holds with a small Knudsen number $Kn \\ll 1$, and that radiative heat transfer is negligible. The governing physics are conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, with conductive heat flux proportional to temperature gradient and viscous stress proportional to strain-rate.\n\nTask 1 (Dimensional Reduction): Using the Buckingham Pi Theorem from first principles, start from a physically complete set of variables describing the problem, including $U$, $D$, $\\rho$, $\\mu$, $k$, $c_p$, $R$, $\\gamma$, $T$, and $p$, with base dimensions mass $M$, length $L$, time $t$, and thermodynamic temperature $\\Theta$. Derive a minimal independent set of dimensionless similarity parameters for the compressible, thermally conducting jet, and show that the minimal independent set includes the Reynolds number $Re$, the Mach number $Ma$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$, and that the Peclet number $Pe$ is not independent. Provide the explicit dependency of $Pe$ on the minimal set. Do not use or quote any shortcut formulas in the derivation; proceed by dimensional analysis and reasoning from the constitutive laws and ideal gas definitions.\n\nTask 2 (Numerical Evaluation): For each baseline case in the test suite below, compute $Re$, $Ma$, $Pr$, and $Pe$ using the definitions implied by the dimensional reduction in Task 1. Use $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$ for the speed of sound and $\\rho = p/(R T)$ for the density. Express $U$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $D$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, $p$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $T$ in $\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mu$ in $\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, $k$ in $\\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}$, $c_p$ in $\\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$, $R$ in $\\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$. All computed $Re$, $Ma$, $Pr$, and $Pe$ are dimensionless.\n\nTask 3 (CFD Run Design for Sensitivity Isolation): For each baseline case, design four modified runs that isolate sensitivity to each parameter as follows. In each design, compute modified physical parameters and then recompute $Re$, $Ma$, $Pr$, and $Pe$ for the modified run. Use the isolation criteria to generate a boolean outcome for each design.\n\n- Run A (Re-only change): Change $Re$ by a factor of $2$ while ensuring the relative changes in $Ma$ and $Pr$ are each less than $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$. You may change only the nozzle diameter $D$ in this run and keep all other quantities fixed.\n\n- Run B (Ma-only change): Change $Ma$ by a factor of $1.5$ while ensuring the relative changes in $Re$ and $Pr$ are each less than $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$. You may change only $U$ and $D$ in this run, and you must choose them so that $Re$ remains effectively unchanged within tolerance.\n\n- Run C (Pr-only change): Change $Pr$ by a factor of $1.5$ while ensuring the relative changes in $Re$ and $Ma$ are each less than $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$. You may change only $k$ (or, equivalently, $c_p$) in this run, keeping all other quantities fixed.\n\n- Run D (Pe-change with $Re$ and $Ma$ held): Change $Pe$ by a factor of $1.5$ while ensuring the relative changes in $Re$ and $Ma$ are each less than $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$. You may change only $k$ (or, equivalently, $c_p$) in this run, keeping $U$ and $D$ fixed. There is no constraint on $Pr$ in this run. Note that $Pe$ is a composite parameter; this run is meant to isolate the effect of advective to diffusive thermal transport while holding momentum similarity fixed.\n\nFor each run, compute the relative changes of the constrained parameters and determine whether the isolation criteria are satisfied. A criterion is satisfied if the absolute value of the relative change is less than $\\epsilon$ for each constrained parameter and the achieved change factor for the target parameter is within $\\delta = 10^{-3}$ of the requested factor. Produce a boolean for each run indicating success or failure.\n\nTest Suite (Baseline Cases):\n- Case $1$ (Subsonic heated air jet): $p = 100000$, $T = 600$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287$, $c_p = 1005$, $k = 0.040$, $\\mu = 3.7 \\times 10^{-5}$, $D = 0.02$, $U = 150$.\n- Case $2$ (Supersonic air jet): $p = 100000$, $T = 300$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287$, $c_p = 1005$, $k = 0.026$, $\\mu = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$, $D = 0.05$, $U = 700$.\n- Case $3$ (Light gas helium jet): $p = 100000$, $T = 800$, $\\gamma = 1.66$, $R = 2077$, $c_p = 5193$, $k = 0.151$, $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$, $D = 0.01$, $U = 300$.\n\nFinal Output Specification:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of three lists, one per case. Each inner list must contain four integers in the order $[$Run A, Run B, Run C, Run D$]$, where each integer is $1$ if the isolation criteria are satisfied and $0$ otherwise. The entire output must be enclosed in square brackets. For example, the format is $[[b_{11},b_{12},b_{13},b_{14}],[b_{21},b_{22},b_{23},b_{24}],[b_{31},b_{32},b_{33},b_{34}]]$.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard but comprehensive exercise in dimensional analysis and sensitivity study design, which is a core topic in fluid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics. All provided data are physically consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is valid and I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks outlined in the problem statement. Task 1 involves a theoretical derivation, while Tasks 2 and 3 are addressed by the numerical implementation in the `final_answer` section.\n\n### Task 1: Dimensional Reduction\n\nThe objective of this task is to derive a minimal independent set of dimensionless similarity parameters for a compressible, thermally conducting jet using the Buckingham Pi theorem, starting from first principles.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Physical Variables and Dimensions**\nThe problem concerns a heated, compressible jet. The relevant physical quantities and their fundamental dimensions in the Mass-Length-Time-Temperature ($M, L, t, \\Theta$) system are:\n1.  Jet exit speed, $U$: $[L t^{-1}]$\n2.  Nozzle diameter, $D$: $[L]$\n3.  Ambient gas density, $\\rho$: $[M L^{-3}]$\n4.  Dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$: $[M L^{-1} t^{-1}]$\n5.  Thermal conductivity, $k$: $[M L t^{-3} \\Theta^{-1}]$\n6.  Specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p$: $[L^2 t^{-2} \\Theta^{-1}]$\n7.  Specific gas constant, $R$: $[L^2 t^{-2} \\Theta^{-1}]$\n8.  Ratio of specific heats, $\\gamma$: Dimensionless $[1]$\n9.  Ambient temperature, $T$: $[\\Theta]$\n10. Ambient pressure, $p$: $[M L^{-1} t^{-2}]$\n\nThere are $n=10$ variables in total. The number of fundamental dimensions is $m=4$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Physical Constraints and Reduce Variable Set**\nThe variables are not all independent. They are related by physical laws, which reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system.\n1.  **Ideal Gas Law**: The variables $p$, $\\rho$, $R$, and $T$ are related by the equation of state for an ideal gas: $p = \\rho R T$. This constitutes one constraint.\n2.  **Thermodynamic Property Relation**: For an ideal gas, the specific heats and the gas constant are related. With $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$ and Mayer's relation $R = c_p - c_v$, we can derive $R = c_p(1 - 1/\\gamma)$. This is a second constraint relating $R$, $c_p$, and $\\gamma$.\n\nBecause of these constraints, the number of independent dimensionless groups will be fewer than what a naive application of the Buckingham Pi theorem on all $10$ variables might suggest. A more robust method is to select a set of independent dimensional variables and then form the Pi groups, or to form known Pi groups by inspection and verify their completeness and independence. We will follow the latter, more physically intuitive approach.\n\n**Step 3: Construct Dimensionless Parameters (Pi Groups)**\nWe seek a set of dimensionless groups that characterize the physics of the flow.\n\n1.  **Ratio of Specific Heats ($\\gamma$)**: The variable $\\gamma$ is already dimensionless. It characterizes the thermodynamic nature of the gas (e.g., monatomic, diatomic). It is our first Pi group:\n    $$ \\Pi_1 = \\gamma $$\n\n2.  **Reynolds Number ($Re$)**: This parameter represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. We can construct it using variables representing these effects: $\\rho, U, D$ for inertia and $\\mu$ for viscosity.\n    $$ \\Pi_2 = Re = \\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 D^2}{\\mu U D} = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu} $$\n    Verifying dimensions: $[\\frac{M L^{-3} \\cdot L t^{-1} \\cdot L}{M L^{-1} t^{-1}}] = [\\frac{M L^{-1} t^{-1}}{M L^{-1} t^{-1}}] = [1]$. This is a valid dimensionless group.\n\n3.  **Mach Number ($Ma$)**: This parameter describes compressibility effects, representing the ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound, $a$. The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$. Using the ideal gas law, we can also write this as $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$.\n    $$ \\Pi_3 = Ma = \\frac{U}{a} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{\\gamma R T}} $$\n    Verifying dimensions: $[\\frac{L t^{-1}}{(1 \\cdot L^2 t^{-2} \\Theta^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta)^{1/2}}] = [\\frac{L t^{-1}}{(L^2 t^{-2})^{1/2}}] = [\\frac{L t^{-1}}{L t^{-1}}] = [1]$. This is a valid dimensionless group.\n\n4.  **Prandtl Number ($Pr$)**: This parameter relates the diffusion of momentum (viscosity) to the diffusion of heat (thermal conductivity). It is a fluid property. It is formed from $\\mu, c_p$, and $k$.\n    $$ \\Pi_4 = Pr = \\frac{\\text{Momentum diffusivity}}{\\text{Thermal diffusivity}} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\mu/\\rho}{k/(\\rho c_p)} = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k} $$\n    Verifying dimensions: $[\\frac{M L^{-1} t^{-1} \\cdot L^2 t^{-2} \\Theta^{-1}}{M L t^{-3} \\Theta^{-1}}] = [\\frac{M L t^{-3} \\Theta^{-1}}{M L t^{-3} \\Theta^{-1}}] = [1]$. This is a valid dimensionless group.\n\n**Step 4: Establish the Minimal Independent Set**\nThe derived set $\\{\\gamma, Re, Ma, Pr\\}$ forms a minimal and complete set of independent dimensionless parameters for this problem.\n-   **Independence**: Each parameter represents a distinct physical ratio: $\\gamma$ (thermodynamic gas property), $Re$ (inertia/viscosity), $Ma$ (compressibility), and $Pr$ (momentum/heat diffusion). None can be formed from the others.\n-   **Completeness**: Any other valid dimensionless group describing this system can be expressed as a function of this set. For instance, the Euler number, $Eu = p/(\\rho U^2)$, is not independent:\n    $$ Eu = \\frac{p}{\\rho U^2} = \\frac{\\gamma p / \\rho}{\\gamma U^2} = \\frac{a^2}{\\gamma U^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma Ma^2} $$\n    Thus, $Eu$ is dependent on $\\gamma$ and $Ma$.\n\nThe minimal independent set of similarity parameters governing the flow is therefore $\\{Re, Ma, Pr, \\gamma\\}$. The problem asks for a minimal set that *includes* $Re$, $Ma$, and $Pr$, which this set satisfies.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Peclet Number ($Pe$)**\nThe Peclet number for heat transfer, $Pe$, compares the advective transport of thermal energy to the diffusive transport of thermal energy.\n$$ Pe = \\frac{\\text{Advective heat transport}}{\\text{Diffusive heat transport}} \\sim \\frac{(\\rho U) c_p T}{k \\nabla T} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U c_p D}{k} $$\nWe can now express $Pe$ in terms of our minimal set:\n$$ Pe = \\frac{\\rho U D c_p}{k} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mu c_p}{k}\\right) $$\nThis reveals the explicit dependency:\n$$ Pe = Re \\cdot Pr $$\nSince the Peclet number is a direct product of two parameters in our minimal independent set, it is not an independent parameter. Its effects are fully described by the combination of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. This completes the dimensional analysis as required. The subsequent tasks will be implemented numerically.",

The momentum equation yields the Reynolds number, $Re_{L} = \\frac{U_{\\infty} L}{\\nu}$, which represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. The energy equation yields both the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, $Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\frac{c_p \\mu}{k}$, which represents the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. The solution to the dimensionless equations, and therefore any derived quantities like the Nusselt number, must be a function of these two similarity parameters.\n\nThe local Nusselt number is defined as $Nu_x = \\frac{h_x x}{k}$. The heat transfer coefficient $h_x$ is related to the temperature gradient at the wall: $h_x = -k \\frac{(\\partial T / \\partial y)_{y=0}}{T_w - T_\\infty}$. This implies that $Nu_x$ is a function of the local Reynolds number, $Re_x = \\frac{\\rho U_{\\infty} x}{\\mu}$, and the Prandtl number, $Pr$.\n\nFor **laminar flow**, the exact solution to the boundary layer equations (the Blasius-Pohlhausen solution) shows that the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ scales as $\\delta \\propto x Re_x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$. The thermal boundary layer thickness $\\delta_T$ is related to $\\delta$ by $\\delta_T \\approx \\delta Pr^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ for $Pr \\gtrsim 0.6$. Since $h_x \\propto k/\\delta_T$, we have $h_x \\propto \\frac{k}{x} Re_x^{\\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. This leads to the local Nusselt number scaling $Nu_x \\propto Re_x^{\\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The exponent on the Reynolds number is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and on the Prandtl number is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor **turbulent flow**, semi-empirical analyses (like the Reynolds-Colburn analogy) predict a different scaling due to enhanced mixing. The local Nusselt number is found to scale as $Nu_x \\propto Re_x^{\\frac{4}{5}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The exponent on the Reynolds number is $\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$.\n\nTo select the correct regime, we must compute the Reynolds number at the end of the plate, $Re_L$.\n$$ Re_L = \\frac{\\rho U_{\\infty} L}{\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ Re_L = \\frac{(0.950 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) (3.00 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) (0.400 \\ \\mathrm{m})}{2.10 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{kg/(m \\cdot s)}} = \\frac{1.14}{2.10 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 54285.7 $$\nThe result is $Re_L \\approx 5.43 \\times 10^4$. The critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence on a smooth flat plate is $Re_{crit} \\approx 5 \\times 10^5$. Since $Re_L  Re_{crit}$, the flow over the entire plate is laminar.\n\nTherefore, we must select the correlation for a laminar boundary layer. The average heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}_L$ is obtained by integrating the local coefficient $h_x \\propto x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ over the plate length $L$.\n$$ \\bar{h}_L = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h_x dx \\propto \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} dx \\propto L^{-\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nThe average Nusselt number $\\overline{Nu}_L = \\frac{\\bar{h}_L L}{k}$ then scales as:\n$$ \\overline{Nu}_L \\propto \\frac{L^{-\\frac{1}{2}} L}{k} \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\rho U_{\\infty}}{\\mu}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} L^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\propto Re_L^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nIncluding the Prandtl number dependence, $\\overline{Nu}_L \\propto Re_L^{\\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The well-established correlation for average Nusselt number for laminar flow over an isothermal flat plate is:\n$$ \\overline{Nu}_L = 0.664 Re_L^{\\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\nThis is the appropriate correlation form.\n\nNext, we compute the Prandtl number, $Pr$, using the provided data.\n$$ Pr = \\frac{c_{p} \\mu}{k} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ Pr = \\frac{(1.012 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}) (2.10 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{kg/(m \\cdot s)})}{2.60 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}} $$\n$$ Pr = \\frac{0.021252}{0.026} \\approx 0.8173846... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the Prandtl number is $Pr = 0.8174$. Since $Pr  0.6$, the use of the selected correlation is justified.\n\nThe final answer consists of two parts: the numerical value of $Pr$ and the analytical expression for the average Nusselt number.\n\n1. Prandtl number, $Pr$: $0.8174$.\n2. Nusselt number correlation: $0.664 Re_L^{\\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\nThese are combined into a two-entry row matrix.",
