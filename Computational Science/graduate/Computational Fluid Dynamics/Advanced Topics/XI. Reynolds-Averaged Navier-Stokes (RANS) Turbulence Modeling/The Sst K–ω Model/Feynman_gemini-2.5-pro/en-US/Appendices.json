The model constants provided ($a_1$, $\\beta^*$, $\\kappa$) are the widely accepted standard values.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated with a set of consistent assumptions and given values.

It is a valid problem. I will proceed with a full, reasoned solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for a three-part analysis of the SST $k$–$\\omega$ turbulence model in the logarithmic layer of a turbulent channel flow.\n\n**Task 1: Analysis of the $k-\\omega$ Branch and its Selection Condition**\n\nIn the equilibrium inner layer, the production of turbulent kinetic energy, $P_k$, is balanced by its dissipation, $\\epsilon$. The modeled form of this balance is given as $P_{k} = \\beta^{*} k \\omega$. The production term is defined as $P_{k} = \\nu_{t} S^{2}$. Equating these two expressions gives:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} S^{2} = \\beta^{*} k \\omega\n$$\nThe problem directs us to consider the branch of the SST model where the eddy viscosity is given by the standard $k$–$\\omega$ formulation, $\\nu_{t} = k/\\omega$. This corresponds to the case where the Wilcox $k$-$\\omega$ model is active, which is the intended behavior of the SST model in the inner part of the boundary layer. Substituting $\\nu_{t} = k/\\omega$ into the production-dissipation balance yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k}{\\omega}\\right) S^{2} = \\beta^{*} k \\omega\n$$\nSince the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ is non-zero in a turbulent flow, we can divide both sides by $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{S^{2}}{\\omega} = \\beta^{*} \\omega\n$$\n$$\nS^{2} = \\beta^{*} \\omega^{2}\n$$\nSince the specific dissipation rate $\\omega$ and the mean shear $S$ are positive quantities in this region, we can take the positive square root of both sides to solve for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of Task 1.\n\nNext, we must derive the condition under which this branch, $\\nu_{t} = k/\\omega$, is selected. The SST model's eddy viscosity is defined by a limiter:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = \\frac{a_{1} k}{\\max\\!\\left(a_{1} \\omega,\\, S F_{2}\\right)}\n$$\nFor $\\nu_t$ to simplify to $k/\\omega$, the first argument in the `max` function must be greater than or equal to the second argument. This is because if $a_1 \\omega \\ge S F_2$, then $\\max(a_1 \\omega, S F_2) = a_1 \\omega$, and the expression becomes $\\nu_t = \\frac{a_1 k}{a_1 \\omega} = \\frac{k}{\\omega}$.\nThus, the condition for selecting this branch is:\n$$\na_{1} \\omega \\ge S F_{2}\n$$\nIn the logarithmic layer, we are given that the blending function $F_{2} \\approx 1$. The condition simplifies to:\n$$\na_{1} \\omega \\ge S\n$$\nNow we substitute the relationship $\\omega = S/\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}$ that we just derived from the equilibrium assumption:\n$$\na_{1} \\left(\\frac{S}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}\\right) \\ge S\n$$\nSince $S > 0$ in the log-layer, we can divide by $S$:\n$$\n\\frac{a_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\ge 1 \\implies a_{1} \\ge \\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}\n$$\nThis is the condition on the model constants for the $k$–$\\omega$ branch to be active in the logarithmic layer.\n\nFinally, we verify this condition numerically using the given constants $a_{1} = 0.31$ and $\\beta^{*} = 0.09$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}} = \\sqrt{0.09} = 0.3\n$$\nThe condition is $0.31 \\ge 0.3$, which is true. The standard model constants are therefore consistent with the SST model operating as a $k$–$\\omega$ model in the equilibrium logarithmic layer.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of $k(y)$ and $\\omega(y)$ Profiles**\n\nWe now derive the wall-normal profiles of $k$ and $\\omega$. In the logarithmic layer, the total shear stress is approximately equal to the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, and is dominated by the Reynolds shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{w} = \\rho u_{\\tau}^{2} \\approx \\tau_{xy}\n$$\nUsing the Boussinesq hypothesis, $\\tau_{xy} = \\rho \\nu_{t} S$, we have:\n$$\n\\rho u_{\\tau}^{2} = \\rho \\nu_{t} S \\implies u_{\\tau}^{2} = \\nu_{t} S\n$$\nFrom Task 1, we know that in this region $\\nu_t = k/\\omega$. Substituting this into the momentum balance gives:\n$$\nu_{\\tau}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{k}{\\omega}\\right) S\n$$\nWe have a system of two algebraic relations for $k$ and $\\omega$:\n1) $u_{\\tau}^{2} = (k/\\omega) S$ (from momentum balance)\n2) $\\omega = S/\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}$ (from $k$-equation equilibrium)\n\nWe are also given the profile for the mean shear in the logarithmic layer:\n$$\nS = \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}\n$$\nFirst, we find the profile for $\\omega(y)$ by substituting the expression for $S$ into relation (2):\n$$\n\\omega(y) = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}\\right) = \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa \\sqrt{\\beta^{*}} y}\n$$\nThis is the predicted profile for the specific dissipation rate $\\omega$ in the logarithmic layer.\n\nNext, we find the profile for the turbulent kinetic energy $k(y)$. From relation (1), we can express $k$ as:\n$$\nk = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{2} \\omega}{S}\n$$\nNow, substitute relation (2), $\\omega = S/\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}$, into this expression for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{2} (S/\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}})}{S} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{2}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}\n$$\nThe model predicts that the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ is constant across the logarithmic layer, and its value depends only on the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ and the model constant $\\beta^{*}$.\n\nThe derived profiles are:\n$$\nk(y) = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{2}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega(y) = \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa \\sqrt{\\beta^{*}} y}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Calculation of the TKE Plateau Level**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the non-dimensional TKE plateau, $C_{k} \\equiv k/u_{\\tau}^{2}$. Using our result for $k$ from Task 2:\n$$\nC_{k} = \\frac{k}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}^{2}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the constant value of $k/u_\\tau^2$ in the log-layer, observed in DNS and experiments, is a direct consequence of the equilibrium assumption in the $k$-equation.\n\nWe are asked to compute this value for $\\beta^{*} = 0.09$.\n$$\nC_{k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.09}} = \\frac{1}{0.3} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nThe numerical value is $3.3333...\\overline{3}$. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nC_{k} \\approx 3.333\n$$\nThis value is in good agreement with the plateau of $k^{+}$ observed in numerical and experimental data for wall-bounded flows.",

The dominant balance is thus:\n$$ \\nu \\frac{d^2\\omega}{dy^2} \\approx \\beta_1 \\omega^2 $$\nSubstituting the power-law form:\n$$ \\nu A n(n-1) y^{n-2} \\approx \\beta_1 (A y^n)^2 = \\beta_1 A^2 y^{2n} $$\nFor this balance to hold for small $y$, the exponents of $y$ must be equal:\n$$ n-2 = 2n \\implies n = -2 $$\nNow, we equate the coefficients:\n$$ \\nu A n(n-1) = \\beta_1 A^2 $$\nSubstituting $n=-2$:\n$$ \\nu A (-2)(-3) = \\beta_1 A^2 $$\n$$ 6 \\nu A = \\beta_1 A^2 $$\nSince $\\omega$ is not zero, $A \\neq 0$. We can divide by $A$ to solve for it:\n$$ A = \\frac{6 \\nu}{\\beta_1} $$\nThus, the leading-order asymptotic form of $\\omega$ near the wall is:\n$$ \\omega(y) \\approx \\frac{6 \\nu}{\\beta_1 y^2} \\quad \\text{for } y \\to 0 $$\nThis relation is used to set a Dirichlet boundary condition for $\\omega$ at the center of the first computational cell adjacent to the wall, located at $y = y_w$. This value is denoted as $\\omega|_w$.\n$$ \\omega|_w = \\frac{6 \\nu}{\\beta_1 y_w^2} $$\nWe are given the numerical values:\n$\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\beta_{1} = 0.075$\n$y_{w} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\omega|_w$:\n$$ \\omega|_w = \\frac{6 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-5})}{(0.075) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2} $$\n$$ \\omega|_w = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.075 \\times (25.0 \\times 10^{-10})} $$\n$$ \\omega|_w = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.875 \\times 10^{-10}} $$\n$$ \\omega|_w = 4.8 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\omega|_w = 4.800 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nThis is the value to be imposed at the first off-wall node to match the correct near-wall asymptotic behavior of the SST $k$-$\\omega$ model. The provided value for $u_{\\tau}$ was not needed for the numerical calculation, but it was essential for the theoretical derivation to establish that the production term is constant and can be neglected in the leading-order balance.",
