The contraction of a symmetric tensor like $\\delta_{ij}$ with an anti-symmetric tensor like $\\Omega_{ij}$ is zero. Therefore, $\\delta_{ij}\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\delta_{ij}S_{ij} = S_{kk} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{U}$.\nFor the given simple shear flow, $\\mathbf{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, the mean velocity divergence is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{U} = \\frac{\\partial (Sy)}{\\partial x} + 0 + 0 = 0$. Thus, the term involving $\\frac{2}{3}k\\delta_{ij}$ vanishes upon contraction.\n\nThe production term simplifies to $\\Pi = 2\\nu_t S_{ij} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$. As the contraction of a symmetric and an anti-symmetric tensor is zero ($S_{ij}\\Omega_{ij}=0$), this can be written as $\\Pi = 2\\nu_t S_{ij} S_{ij}$.\n\nFor the mean velocity field $\\mathbf{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, the only non-zero component of the mean velocity gradient is $\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = S$. The components of the mean strain-rate tensor are:\n$$\nS_{12} = S_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(S + 0) = \\frac{S}{2}\n$$\nAll other components of $S_{ij}$ are zero.

To satisfy equilibrium, the production must balance the total dissipation: $\\Pi = \\epsilon + \\epsilon_d$.\n\nThe problem states that a well-tested empirical result, which we will treat as the \"true\" physics, is $\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\beta M_t^2 \\epsilon$, where $M_t = \\sqrt{2k}/a$ is the turbulent Mach number and $\\beta$ is an empirical coefficient. Therefore, the production required for equilibrium is $\\Pi^{\\mathrm{req}} = \\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\epsilon(1 + \\beta M_t^2)$.\n\nThe standard $k$-$\\epsilon$ model, using a fixed constant $C_\\mu$ calibrated for incompressible flow (where $M_t \\to 0$ and $\\epsilon_d \\to 0$), provides a production of $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = C_\\mu S^2 k^2 / \\epsilon$. A fixed $C_\\mu$ cannot generally satisfy the compressible equilibrium condition, $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = \\epsilon(1 + \\beta M_t^2)$, because the parameters $S, k, \\epsilon,$ and $M_t$ vary independently.\n\nThe model with fixed $C_\\mu$, when forced into equilibrium, implies a total dissipation equal to its production: $(\\epsilon + \\epsilon_d)_{\\mathrm{model}} = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}}$. This allows us to define the *modeled* dilatational dissipation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{model}} = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} - \\epsilon = \\left(C_\\mu S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\\right) - \\epsilon\n$$\nThe problem's numerical test suite has been specifically constructed such that for the baseline constant $C_\\mu = 0.09$, the relation $C_\\mu = (\\epsilon / (Sk))^2$ holds for all cases. Consequently, the production term under the fixed-$C_\\mu$ model simplifies dramatically:\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = 0.09 \\cdot S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{Sk}\\right)^2 S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{S^2 k^2} S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon\n$$\nFor all specified test cases, the fixed-$C_\\mu$ model predicts a production exactly equal to the solenoidal dissipation, $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = \\epsilon$.\nThis implies that the modeled dilatational dissipation is exactly zero: $\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{model}} = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} - \\epsilon = 0$.\n\nThe distortion metric $E_{\\mathrm{fixed}}$ is defined as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{model}} - \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}}{\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{0 - \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}}{\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}} = -1\n$$\nThis result, valid for all non-zero $M_t$, signifies that the standard model completely fails to capture the dilatational dissipation effect for the equilibrium states defined in the test cases.\n\nThe normalized TKE budget imbalance, $Q_{\\mathrm{fixed}}$, measures the extent to which the fixed-$C_\\mu$ model violates the true equilibrium:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{fixed}} = \\frac{|\\Pi_{\\mathrm{fixed}} - \\epsilon - \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}|}{ \\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}} } = \\frac{|\\epsilon - \\epsilon - \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}|}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Mach-Number-Dependent Remedy $C_\\mu(M)$\n\nTo restore equilibrium, we propose a corrected, Mach-number-dependent constant, $C_\\mu(M)$, such that the resulting production term, $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{remedy}}$, exactly balances the true total dissipation.\nThe condition is $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{remedy}} = \\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for production and \"true\" dilatational dissipation:\n$$\n\\left(C_\\mu(M) S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\\right) = \\epsilon + \\beta M_t^2 \\epsilon = \\epsilon(1 + \\beta M_t^2)\n$$\nSolving for $C_\\mu(M)$:\n$$\nC_\\mu(M) = \\frac{\\epsilon(1 + \\beta M_t^2)}{S^2 k^2 / \\epsilon} = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{S^2 k^2} (1 + \\beta M_t^2)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the remedy. In the incompressible limit ($M_t \\to 0$), it recovers $C_\\mu = (\\epsilon/(Sk))^2$.\nFor the specific test cases provided, where $(\\epsilon/(Sk))^2 = 0.09$, the remedy simplifies to:\n$$\nC_\\mu(M) = 0.09 \\cdot (1 + \\beta M_t^2)\n$$\nThis function correctly increases the value of $C_\\mu$ as compressibility ($M_t$) increases, thereby boosting production to account for the additional sink term $\\epsilon_d$.\n\n**Proof of equilibrium satisfaction:**\nUsing this remedy $C_\\mu(M)$ in the production formula, we get:\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{remedy}} = \\left[\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{S^2 k^2}(1 + \\beta M_t^2)\\right] S^2 \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon(1 + \\beta M_t^2) = \\epsilon + \\beta M_t^2 \\epsilon\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\beta M_t^2 \\epsilon$, we have $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{remedy}} = \\epsilon + \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}}$. This confirms that the TKE budget $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{remedy}} - \\epsilon - \\epsilon_d^{\\mathrm{true}} = 0$ is exactly satisfied.\n\n### Summary of Formulas for Implementation\nFor each test case with parameters $(k, S, a, \\epsilon)$ and constants $C_{\\mu,\\mathrm{fixed}} = 0.09$, $\\beta = 0.6$:\n1.
