            "problem": "Consider a fully developed turbulent boundary layer of air over a smooth flat wall in a computational fluid dynamics setting. Let the wall shear stress be known from a high-fidelity near-wall evaluation as $\\tau_{w}=0.5$ Pa, the mass density be $\\rho=1.2$ kg/m$^{3}$, and the kinematic viscosity be $\\nu=1.5\\times 10^{-5}$ m$^{2}$/s, all at the same thermodynamic state.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically turbulent boundary layer theory, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer. The key to this analysis is the use of inner scaling, which normalizes variables based on characteristic scales derived from wall properties.\n\nFirst, we consider the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. This quantity represents the tangential force per unit area exerted by the fluid on the wall. From a dimensional standpoint, its units are force per area, which in base SI units is $\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$. In the context of momentum, $\\tau_w$ can be interpreted as the rate of momentum transfer (flux) per unit area from the flow to the wall. Given the fluid density, $\\rho$, with units of mass per volume ($\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$), the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}$ has units of $(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) / (\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}) = \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$, which corresponds to velocity squared. This leads to the definition of a characteristic velocity scale for the near-wall region, known as the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}}$$\n\nNext, we establish a characteristic length scale. In the region immediately adjacent to the wall (the viscous sublayer), momentum transfer is dominated by viscous diffusion. The parameter governing this diffusion is the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, with units of $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. By balancing the characteristic velocity $u_{\\tau}$ with the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, we can form a length scale. The viscous length scale, $\\delta_{\\nu}$, is defined as:\n$$\\delta_{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}}$$\nThis length scale provides a measure of the thickness of the region where viscous effects are dominant.\n\nUsing these two scales, we can define dimensionless variables, also known as inner coordinates or wall units. The dimensionless wall-normal distance, denoted as $y^+$, is the physical distance $y$ from the wall normalized by the viscous length scale $\\delta_{\\nu}$.\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y}{\\delta_{\\nu}} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of the velocity scale $u_{\\tau}$ and the wall-unit coordinate $y^+$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w} = 0.5 \\text{ Pa} = 0.5 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$\n- Mass density, $\\rho = 1.2 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$\n- Kinematic viscosity, $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Wall-normal distance, $y = 1 \\text{ mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5}{1.2}} = \\sqrt{0.41666...} \\approx 0.64549722 \\text{ m/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the velocity scale is:\n$$u_{\\tau} \\approx 0.6455 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless wall-unit coordinate, $y^+$:\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.64549722)}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}$$\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{0.64549722 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{0.64549722}{1.5} \\times 10^2 \\approx 43.033148$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the wall-unit coordinate is:\n$$y^{+} \\approx 43.03$$\n\nFinally, we discuss whether the computed $y^+$ value lies within the region where the logarithmic law of the wall is valid. The near-wall region of a high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer over a smooth wall is typically stratified based on the value of $y^+$:\n1.  **Viscous Sublayer:** For $y^{+} \\lesssim 5$, viscous stresses dominate over turbulent Reynolds stresses. The mean velocity profile is linear, given by $u^{+} = y^{+}$, where $u^{+}$ is the dimensionless velocity $u/u_{\\tau}$.\n2.  **Buffer Layer:** For $5 \\lesssim y^{+} \\lesssim 30$, both viscous and turbulent stresses are of comparable magnitude. This is a transitional region between the viscous sublayer and the logarithmic region.\n3.  **Logarithmic Region (Log-Law Region):** For $y^{+} \\gtrsim 30$ (and extending to a certain fraction of the total boundary layer thickness, e.g., $y/\\delta  0.2$), turbulent stresses dominate. The mean velocity profile is described by the logarithmic law:\n    $$u^{+} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y^{+}) + B$$\n    where $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$ is the von Kármán constant and $B \\approx 5.0$ is an integration constant for smooth walls.\n\nOur calculated value is $y^{+} \\approx 43.03$. This value is greater than $30$, placing it squarely in the logarithmic region. Therefore, it is physically consistent and appropriate to apply the logarithmic law of the wall to estimate the mean velocity at the specified wall-normal distance of $y = 1$ mm under the given flow conditions.",

            "solution": "The objective is to quantify the inconsistency introduced when the first near-wall node is located at $y^+ \\approx 5$ yet a standard wall function based on the logarithmic law is imposed to infer the wall shear stress. We begin from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts for near-wall turbulent flows.\n\nFirst, define the friction velocity $u_\\tau$ from the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ as $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$. Introduce wall units via the inner scaling $y^+ = y \\, u_\\tau/\\nu$ and $U^+ = U/u_\\tau$. In a statistically steady, fully developed turbulent flow near a wall, the mean momentum equation simplifies in the immediate vicinity of the wall because the Reynolds shear stress is negligible compared to the viscous stress. Therefore, the total stress is approximately viscous, with $\\tau \\approx \\mu \\, \\dfrac{dU}{dy}$, where $\\mu = \\rho \\nu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Integrating this near-wall behavior yields the well-tested viscous sublayer relation $U^+ \\approx y^+$ for $y^+ \\lesssim 5$.\n\nAway from the wall, empirical and theoretical arguments using mixing-length closures (a widely accepted basis in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes modeling) lead to the logarithmic law of the wall in the equilibrium region of the boundary layer, $U^+ \\approx \\dfrac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(y^+) + B$ for $y^+ \\gtrsim 30$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant and $B$ is an empirical intercept. These two well-tested facts form the foundation for many computational fluid dynamics wall treatments.\n\nA typical \"standard wall function\" imposes the logarithmic relation at the first off-wall point to infer $u_\\tau$ (and hence $\\tau_w$) from the computed mean velocity $U$ at distance $y_1$ from the wall. The friction velocity $u_\\tau$ controls the inner scaling $y^+$ itself, which implies a nonlinearity when solving for $u_\\tau$ given $U$ and $y_1$. If the first node lies in the viscous sublayer, replacing the linear relation with the logarithmic one produces an inconsistency. We quantify it by comparing the \"true\" wall shear stress, computed from a consistent near-wall relation, with the \"inferred\" wall shear stress obtained by inverting the logarithmic law.\n\nAlgorithmic steps grounded in these principles:\n\n1. Fix physical constants $\\rho$, $\\nu$, $\\kappa$, $B$, and a \"true\" friction velocity $u_\\tau$ that characterizes the target flow. The true wall shear stress is $\\tau_w = \\rho \\, u_\\tau^2$.\n2. For each target $y_1^+$, compute the grid spacing so that the first cell center is at $y_1 = \\dfrac{y_1^+ \\, \\nu}{u_\\tau}$ and $\\Delta y = 2 y_1$ as per a one-dimensional wall-normal discretization with uniform cells.\n3. Generate a synthetic \"true\" mean velocity $U$ at $y_1$ by selecting the appropriate near-wall relation consistent with the known $u_\\tau$:\n   - If $y_1^+ \\leq 5$, use the viscous sublayer: $U^+ = y_1^+ \\Rightarrow U = u_\\tau \\, y_1^+$.\n   - If $y_1^+ \\geq 30$, use the logarithmic law: $U^+ = \\dfrac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(y_1^+) + B \\Rightarrow U = u_\\tau\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(y_1^+) + B\\right)$.\n4. Emulate the standard wall function by solving for an inferred friction velocity $\\hat{u}_\\tau$ from the logarithmic relation imposed at $y_1$. The equation to solve is\n   $$ g(\\hat{u}_\\tau) = \\frac{U}{\\hat{u}_\\tau} - \\left[\\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_1 \\hat{u}_\\tau}{\\nu}\\right) + B\\right] = 0, $$\n   which is well-posed for $\\hat{u}_\\tau > 0$ since the first term decreases with increasing $\\hat{u}_\\tau$ and the second term increases logarithmically, ensuring a unique root. A robust numerical method such as the Brent bracketing method can be used to find the root in a wide interval (for instance, between a small positive lower bound and a large upper bound) because $g$ exhibits a sign change over such a range for physically plausible inputs.\n5. Compute the inferred wall shear stress $\\hat{\\tau}_w = \\rho \\, \\hat{u}_\\tau^2$ and the relative error\n   $$ e = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w - \\tau_w}{\\tau_w}. $$\n   This error is dimensionless and directly quantifies the inconsistency introduced by using the log-law at the first node.\n6. Apply this procedure to the four test cases designed to probe distinct regions:\n   - $y_1^+ = 0.5$ (deep viscous sublayer, expected large inconsistency),\n   - $y_1^+ = 5$ (near the transition, the case of interest),\n   - $y_1^+ = 30$ (entry to the logarithmic region, consistency expected),\n   - $y_1^+ = 100$ (well within the logarithmic region, consistency expected).\n7. Report the errors $e$ as a list of four decimal numbers rounded to six decimal places, in the specified single-line format.\n\nScientific interpretation: For $y_1^+ \\leq 5$, the true $U^+$ grows linearly with $y^+$, while the logarithmic law grows only as the logarithm. When one inverts the logarithmic relation using a velocity that is actually consistent with the linear law at the same location, the inferred $\\hat{u}_\\tau$ decreases relative to the true $u_\\tau$ to reconcile the larger observed $U/u_\\tau$ with the logarithmic expression, resulting in a substantial underprediction of $\\hat{\\tau}_w$. Conversely, for $y_1^+ \\geq 30$, if $U$ is consistent with the logarithmic law, inverting the same law reproduces the correct $u_\\tau$ and thus yields negligible error in $\\tau_w$. This demonstrates the inconsistency of placing the first node too close to the wall when standard wall functions are used.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    # Physical and model constants (units: rho [kg/m^3], nu [m^2/s], u_tau [m/s])\n    rho = 1000.0\n    nu = 1e-6\n    u_tau_true = 0.2\n    kappa = 0.41\n    B = 5.2\n\n    # Test cases specified by target y1^+ values\n    yplus_targets = [0.5, 5.0, 30.0, 100.0]\n\n    def U_true_at_y1(yplus):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute synthetic 'true' mean velocity U at y1 for a given yplus = y1^+,\n        using viscous sublayer for yplus = 5, and log-law for yplus >= 30.\n        \"\"\"\n        if yplus = 5.0:\n            # Viscous sublayer: U+ = y+\n            return u_tau_true * yplus\n        else:\n            # Log-law: U+ = (1/kappa) ln(y+) + B\n            return u_tau_true * ((1.0 / kappa) * np.log(yplus) + B)\n\n    def infer_u_tau_from_log(U, y1):\n        \"\"\"\n        Infer friction velocity u_tau by inverting the log-law at y1:\n            U/u = (1/kappa) ln(y1 * u / nu) + B\n        Solve g(u) = 0 with a robust bracket.\n        \"\"\"\n        def g(u):\n            return U / u - ((1.0 / kappa) * np.log(y1 * u / nu) + B)\n\n        # Use a wide bracket to ensure a sign change for physically plausible U, y1\n        lower = 1e-8\n        upper = 1e4\n        # Ensure the function is defined in the bracket\n        return brentq(g, lower, upper, maxiter=200, xtol=1e-12)\n\n    results = []\n    for yplus_target in yplus_targets:\n        # Construct grid: y1 = yplus_target * nu / u_tau_true\n        y1 = yplus_target * nu / u_tau_true\n        # Synthetic \"true\" velocity at y1\n        U = U_true_at_y1(yplus_target)\n        # Inferred friction velocity from standard wall function (log-law)\n        u_tau_inferred = infer_u_tau_from_log(U, y1)\n        # Compute wall shear stresses\n        tau_w_true = rho * (u_tau_true ** 2)\n        tau_w_inferred = rho * (u_tau_inferred ** 2)\n        # Relative error as a decimal number\n        error = (tau_w_inferred - tau_w_true) / tau_w_true\n        results.append(error)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format, rounded to six decimals.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{e:.6f}' for e in results)}]\")\n\n# This comment is to show the function call, which is not part of the final text.\n# solve()\n```",
