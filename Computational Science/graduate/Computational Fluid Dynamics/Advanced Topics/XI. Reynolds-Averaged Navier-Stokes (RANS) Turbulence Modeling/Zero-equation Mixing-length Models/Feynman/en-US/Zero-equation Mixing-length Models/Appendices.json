Substituting these into the formula for $\\nu_t$:\n    $$ \\nu_t(y) = (C y)^2 |S_0| = C^2 y^2 |S_0| $$\n4.  **Dimensionless Ratio:** The final step is to create a dimensionless ratio by dividing the eddy viscosity by the molecular kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{\\nu} = \\frac{C^2 y^2 |S_0|}{\\nu} $$\n    This expression shows that for a constant shear, the eddy viscosity grows quadratically with the distance from the wall, rapidly dominating the molecular viscosity as $y$ increases.",

The simple mixing-length hypothesis, $l_m = \\kappa y$, is physically untenable at the wall, as it fails to account for the damping of turbulent fluctuations by viscous effects. This practice introduces the essential concept of a near-wall damping function—specifically, the van Driest model—to make the mixing-length formulation physically realistic and provides a concrete numerical exercise in calculating the damped mixing length and resulting eddy viscosity in the crucial near-wall region .",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the mixing length, $l_m$, and the eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$, within the framework of a zero-equation turbulence model for a boundary layer flow.\n\nFirst, we formulate the expression for the mixing length, $l_m$. According to Prandtl's original hypothesis for the region away from the wall, the mixing length is proportional to the distance from the wall, $y$: $l_m = \\kappa y$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant. To account for the damping of turbulent fluctuations near the solid wall, this expression is modified by a damping function, $D$. The problem specifies a van Driest-type factor, which is given by:\n$$D = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{+}}{A^{+}}\\right)$$\nHere, $A^{+}$ is the van Driest constant, which represents the thickness of the viscous sublayer in inner units, and $y^{+}$ is the dimensionless wall distance, defined as:\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\nwhere $u_{\\tau}$ is the friction velocity and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nCombining these, the complete expression for the mixing length with near-wall damping is:\n$$l_m = (\\kappa y) D = \\kappa y \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{+}}{A^{+}}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nNext, we establish the expression for the eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$.

Given a set of $N$ data points, we can set up a matrix equation $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ in the least-squares sense, where:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(y_1^{+})  1 \\\\\n\\ln(y_2^{+})  1 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots \\\\\n\\ln(y_N^{+})  1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} m \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nU_{1, \\mathrm{DNS}}^{+} \\\\\nU_{2, \\mathrm{DNS}}^{+} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nU_{N, \\mathrm{DNS}}^{+}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ containing the best-fit parameters $(m, c)$ can be reliably computed using standard numerical libraries. Once $m$ and $c$ are found, the physical parameters are recovered as:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1}{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = c\n$$\nThe following code implements this procedure for each of the provided test cases.",
