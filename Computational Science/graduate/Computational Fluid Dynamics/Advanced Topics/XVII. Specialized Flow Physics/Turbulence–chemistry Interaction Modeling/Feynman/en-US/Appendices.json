            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of two characteristic turbulent timescales and the subsequent calculation of the Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary data are provided. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is based on dimensional analysis, grounded in the physical principles of turbulence as specified.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Large-Eddy Turnover Timescale, $\\tau_{flow}$**\n\nThe large-eddy turnover timescale, $\\tau_{flow}$, represents the characteristic time for the large, energy-containing eddies in the turbulent flow. According to the principles of the turbulent kinetic energy budget for statistically stationary, homogeneous turbulence, the rate of turbulent kinetic energy production is balanced by the viscous dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$. The quantity $\\epsilon$ also represents the rate at which energy is transferred from the large eddies through the inertial subrange to the small, dissipative eddies. The dynamics of these large eddies are therefore characterized by their turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, $k$, and the rate of energy cascade, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe seek to find a quantity with the dimension of time, $[\\text{T}]$, using only $k$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-2}]$) and $\\epsilon$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-3}]$). We can express $\\tau_{flow}$ as a product of powers of these quantities:\n$$\n\\tau_{flow} \\propto k^a \\epsilon^b\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless exponents. Matching the dimensions on both sides:\n$$\n[\\text{T}]^1 [\\text{L}]^0 = ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-2})^a ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-3})^b = [\\text{L}]^{2a+2b} [\\text{T}]^{-2a-3b}\n$$\nThis yields a system of two linear equations for the exponents $a$ and $b$:\n1. For length $[\\text{L}]$: $2a + 2b = 0 \\implies a = -b$\n2. For time $[\\text{T}]$: $-2a - 3b = 1$\n\nSubstituting $a = -b$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n-2(-b) - 3b = 1 \\implies 2b - 3b = 1 \\implies -b = 1 \\implies b = -1\n$$\nFrom $a = -b$, we find $a = 1$.\nThus, the large-eddy turnover timescale is directly proportional to $k$ and inversely proportional to $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\tau_{flow} = \\frac{k}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality is taken to be unity by conventional definition.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Kolmogorov Timescale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$**\n\nThe Kolmogorov timescale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, is the characteristic timescale of the smallest eddies in the flow, where kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by viscosity. According to Kolmogorov's first similarity hypothesis, the dynamics at these small scales are universally determined by the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe apply dimensional analysis to find a timescale using only $\\nu$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-1}]$) and $\\epsilon$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-3}]$).\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} \\propto \\nu^c \\epsilon^d\n$$\nwhere $c$ and $d$ are dimensionless exponents. Matching the dimensions:\n$$\n[\\text{T}]^1 [\\text{L}]^0 = ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-1})^c ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-3})^d = [\\text{L}]^{2c+2d} [\\text{T}]^{-c-3d}\n$$\nThis leads to the following system of equations:\n1. For length $[\\text{L}]$: $2c + 2d = 0 \\implies c = -d$\n2. For time $[\\text{T}]$: $-c - 3d = 1$\n\nSubstituting $c = -d$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n-(-d) - 3d = 1 \\implies d - 3d = 1 \\implies -2d = 1 \\implies d = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFrom $c = -d$, we find $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the Kolmogorov timescale is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nAgain, the constant of proportionality is conventionally unity.\n\n**3. Calculation of Damköhler and Karlovitz Numbers**\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $k = 1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$\n- $\\epsilon = 10\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$\n- $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n- $\\tau_{chem} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the characteristic timescales:\n$$\n\\tau_{flow} = \\frac{k}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}}{10\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{10\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{1.5} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the Damköhler number, $Da$, defined as $Da = \\tau_{flow}/\\tau_{chem}$:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.001} = 100\n$$\n\nThen, we compute the Karlovitz number, $Ka$, defined as $Ka = \\tau_{chem}/\\tau_{\\eta}$:\n$$\nKa = \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{\\sqrt{1.5} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.5}} \\approx 0.81649658...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical values of $Da$ and $Ka$ rounded to four significant figures.\n- For $Da = 100$, expressing this with four significant figures gives $100.0$.\n- For $Ka$, rounding $0.81649658...$ to four significant figures gives $0.8165$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(Da, Ka)$.",

Let $f=Z$ and $\\mathbf{A}=\\nabla Z$. Then $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\nabla^2 Z$ and $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\nabla f = (\\nabla Z) \\cdot (\\nabla Z) = |\\nabla Z|^2$.\nThis gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (Z \\nabla Z) = Z \\nabla^2 Z + |\\nabla Z|^2 $$\nRearranging for the term $Z \\nabla^2 Z$:\n$$ Z \\nabla^2 Z = \\nabla \\cdot (Z \\nabla Z) - |\\nabla Z|^2 $$\nSubstituting $Z \\nabla Z = \\nabla(Z^2/2)$ into this expression gives:\n$$ Z \\nabla^2 Z = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\nabla\\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right)\\right) - |\\nabla Z|^2 = \\nabla^2\\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) - |\\nabla Z|^2 $$\nNow we equate the reformulated advection and diffusion terms:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) = D \\left( \\nabla^2\\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) - |\\nabla Z|^2 \\right) $$\nRearranging this equation gives the transport equation for $Z^2/2$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) - D \\nabla^2\\left(\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) = -D |\\nabla Z|^2 $$\nThis equation shows that the quantity $Z^2/2$ is advected and diffused, while being destroyed at a rate of $D |\\nabla Z|^2$. The scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi$, is defined as the rate of dissipation of scalar variance, which is proportional to this destruction term. By convention, it is defined as:\n$$ \\chi \\equiv 2D |\\nabla Z|^2 $$\nThis is the general expression for the local scalar dissipation rate.\n\nNext, we specialize this expression for the given locally one-dimensional strain field. The problem states that the gradient of the mixture fraction, $\\nabla Z$, is aligned with the cross-stream coordinate $y$. This implies that the components of the gradient in the other directions are zero: $\\partial_x Z = 0$ and $\\partial_z Z = 0$.\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient vector, $|\\nabla Z|^2$, is thus:\n$$ |\\nabla Z|^2 = (\\partial_x Z)^2 + (\\partial_y Z)^2 + (\\partial_z Z)^2 = (\\partial_y Z)^2 $$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $\\chi$ yields the specialized expression:\n$$ \\chi = 2D (\\partial_y Z)^2 $$\nWe are asked to compute the stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi_{st}$, which is the value of $\\chi$ evaluated at the stoichiometric surface (where $Z=Z_{st}$).

Substituting $(4)$ into $(2)$:\n$$ \\widetilde{Z'^2} = \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\alpha+\\beta+1} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the sum $\\alpha+\\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha+\\beta+1 = \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} $$\n$$ \\alpha+\\beta = \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} - 1 $$\nLet us define a common factor, $S = \\alpha+\\beta$, for clarity:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} - 1 $$\nNow we can use this expression for $S$ to find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ individually. From equation $(1)$, we have $\\alpha = \\tilde{Z}(\\alpha+\\beta)$, and from equation $(3)$, we have $\\beta = (1-\\tilde{Z})(\\alpha+\\beta)$. Substituting $S$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\tilde{Z} S = \\tilde{Z} \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} - 1 \\right) $$\n$$ \\beta = (1-\\tilde{Z}) S = (1-\\tilde{Z}) \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} - 1 \\right) $$\nThese are the desired expressions for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nFor the Beta distribution to be well-defined, its parameters must be positive, i.e., $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$. Since the mixture fraction mean $\\tilde{Z}$ is defined on the interval $(0,1)$, both $\\tilde{Z}$ and $(1-\\tilde{Z})$ are positive. Therefore, the positivity of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ depends entirely on the term in the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}} - 1  0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})}{\\widetilde{Z'^2}}  1 $$\n$$ \\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})  \\widetilde{Z'^2} $$\nAdditionally, variance must be positive, $\\widetilde{Z'^2}  0$. Combining these gives the realizability constraint $0  \\widetilde{Z'^2}  \\tilde{Z}(1-\\tilde{Z})$, as specified in the problem statement. This derivation confirms the provided constraint from first principles.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Computation of the Filtered Reaction Rate $\\tilde{\\omega}$\n\nThe filtered reaction rate is computed by integrating the product of the reaction rate $\\omega(Z)$ and the Beta PDF $p(Z;\\alpha, \\beta)$ over the mixture fraction space:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} = \\int_0^1 \\omega(Z) p(Z; \\alpha, \\beta) \\, dZ $$\nThe Beta PDF is given by:\n$$ p(Z; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{Z^{\\alpha-1} (1-Z)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} $$\nwhere $B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}$ is the Beta function, and $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function. Direct computation of $\\Gamma(x)$ can lead to numerical overflow for large arguments, and underflow for $B(\\alpha, \\beta)$ if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are small. To ensure robustness, we compute the logarithm of the PDF:\n$$ \\ln p(Z) = (\\alpha-1)\\ln(Z) + (\\beta-1)\\ln(1-Z) - \\ln B(\\alpha, \\beta) $$\nwhere $\\ln B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\ln\\Gamma(\\alpha) + \\ln\\Gamma(\\beta) - \\ln\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)$. The log-gamma function, $\\ln\\Gamma(x)$, is numerically stable and available in standard scientific libraries. The PDF is then recovered by\n$p(Z) = \\exp(\\ln p(Z))$.\n\nThe integration is performed using $N$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature. This method approximates an integral over $[-1, 1]$:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j f(x_j) $$\nwhere $x_j$ are the quadrature nodes (roots of the $N$-th Legendre polynomial) and $w_j$ are the corresponding weights. To apply this to our integral over $[0,1]$, we perform a change of variables:\n$$ Z = \\frac{1}{2}(x+1) \\implies dZ = \\frac{1}{2}dx $$\nThe integral transforms to:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\omega\\left(\\frac{x+1}{2}\\right) p\\left(\\frac{x+1}{2}; \\alpha, \\beta\\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\, dx $$\nThe numerical approximation with $N=200$ points becomes:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{200} w_j \\left[ \\omega\\left(\\frac{x_j+1}{2}\\right) p\\left(\\frac{x_j+1}{2}; \\alpha, \\beta\\right) \\right] \\frac{1}{2} $$\nLet $Z_j = \\frac{1}{2}(x_j+1)$ be the quadrature nodes mapped to $[0,1]$ and $\\hat{w}_j = \\frac{1}{2}w_j$ be the transformed weights. The integral is then:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{200} \\hat{w}_j \\cdot \\omega(Z_j) \\cdot p(Z_j; \\alpha, \\beta) $$\nThe function $\\omega(Z)$ is not given in a closed form but as a table of $(Z, \\omega)$ pairs. The values of $\\omega(Z_j)$ at the quadrature nodes $Z_j$ are obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation between the tabulated points.\n\n### Summary of the Computational Procedure\nFor each given test case $(\\tilde{Z}, \\widetilde{Z'^2})$:\n1.  Calculate $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using the derived formulas.\n2.  Obtain the $N=200$ Gauss-Legendre nodes $x_j$ and weights $w_j$ for the interval $[-1,1]$.\n3.  Transform the nodes and weights to the interval $[0,1]$: $Z_j = (x_j+1)/2$ and $\\hat{w}_j = w_j/2$.\n4.  For each node $Z_j$, calculate the interpolated reaction rate $\\omega(Z_j)$ from the provided table.\n5.  For each node $Z_j$, calculate the Beta PDF value $p(Z_j; \\alpha, \\beta)$ using the log-gamma formulation for stability.\n6.  Compute the filtered reaction rate $\\tilde{\\omega}$ by summing the product of the transformed weights, interpolated reaction rates, and PDF values: $\\tilde{\\omega} = \\sum_{j=1}^{200} \\hat{w}_j \\omega(Z_j) p(Z_j)$.\n7.  Collect the resulting triplet $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\tilde{\\omega})$ for each test case and format the final output as specified.",
