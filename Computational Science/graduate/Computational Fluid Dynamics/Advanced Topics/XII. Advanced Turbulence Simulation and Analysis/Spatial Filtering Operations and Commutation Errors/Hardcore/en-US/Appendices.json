This means that for the specific case of a linear field $f(x)=x$ and a spatially homogeneous top-hat filter, the differentiation operator $\\frac{d}{dx}$ and the filter operator commute exactly.\n\nFinal expressions are:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x$\n$E(x) = 0$",

The integration interval is $[ \\Delta/2 - \\Delta/2, \\Delta/2 + \\Delta/2 ] = [0, \\Delta]$.\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{R}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta} f_e(\\xi) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta} \\xi d\\xi\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{R}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{\\xi^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculation of $\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2)$:\nThe truncated-and-renormalized filtered value is given by:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{T}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\ell(x)} \\int_{\\max(0,\\,x-\\Delta/2)}^{\\min(1,\\,x+\\Delta/2)} f(\\xi)\\,d\\xi, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\ell(x) = \\min(1,\\,x+\\Delta/2)-\\max(0,\\,x-\\Delta/2)\n$$\nWe evaluate this at $x=\\Delta/2$.\nThe lower limit of integration is $\\max(0, \\Delta/2 - \\Delta/2) = \\max(0,0) = 0$.\nThe upper limit of integration is $\\min(1, \\Delta/2 + \\Delta/2) = \\min(1, \\Delta)$. Since the problem states $0 < \\Delta \\le 1$, this simplifies to $\\Delta$.\nThe normalization length is $\\ell(\\Delta/2) = \\Delta - 0 = \\Delta$.\nSo, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta} f(\\xi) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta} \\xi d\\xi\n$$\nThis is the same integral as for the wall-reflected case:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{\\xi^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\n$$\n\nThe difference is then:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{f}(\\Delta/2) = \\bar{f}_{R}(\\Delta/2) - \\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the first component of the final answer.\n\nNext, we compute $\\mathcal{C}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\partial_{x}\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) - \\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(\\Delta/2)$.\nThe problem specifies that for $x=\\Delta/2$, the quantities are evaluated as the limit $x \\uparrow \\Delta/2$, i.e., approaching from the left from within the region $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$.\n\nFor $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$:\nThe integration limits for the truncated filter are:\nLower limit: $\\max(0, x - \\Delta/2) = 0$, since $x < \\Delta/2 \\implies x-\\Delta/2 < 0$.\nUpper limit: $\\min(1, x + \\Delta/2) = x + \\Delta/2$, since $x < \\Delta/2 \\implies x+\\Delta/2 < \\Delta \\le 1$.\nThe normalization length is $\\ell(x) = (x+\\Delta/2) - 0 = x+\\Delta/2$.\n\nCalculation of the first term, $\\partial_{x}\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2)$:\nFirst, we find the expression for $\\bar{f}_{T}(x)$ for $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{T}(x) = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\int_{0}^{x+\\Delta/2} f(\\xi) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\int_{0}^{x+\\Delta/2} \\xi d\\xi\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{T}(x) = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\left[ \\frac{\\xi^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{x+\\Delta/2} = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\frac{(x+\\Delta/2)^2}{2} = \\frac{x+\\Delta/2}{2}\n$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}\\bar{f}_{T}(x) = \\partial_x \\left( \\frac{x+\\Delta/2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis result is constant for all $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$. The limit as $x \\uparrow \\Delta/2$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculation of the second term, $\\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(\\Delta/2)$:\nFirst, we find the derivative of the field, $\\partial_x f(x)$. Given $f(x)=x$, we have $\\partial_x f(x) = 1$.\nWe now apply the truncated filter to this new field, $g(x) = \\partial_x f(x) = 1$. For $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$, we use the same limits and normalization as before:\n$$\n\\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(x) = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\int_{0}^{x+\\Delta/2} 1 d\\xi\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(x) = \\frac{1}{x+\\Delta/2} \\left[ \\xi \\right]_{0}^{x+\\Delta/2} = \\frac{x+\\Delta/2}{x+\\Delta/2} = 1\n$$\nThis result is also constant for all $x \\in (0, \\Delta/2)$. The limit as $x \\uparrow \\Delta/2$ is:\n$$\n\\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = 1\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the commutation error:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\partial_{x}\\bar{f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) - \\overline{\\partial_{x} f}_{T}(\\Delta/2) = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis is the second component of the final answer.\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a two-component row vector $\\big[\\Delta\\bar{f}(\\Delta/2),\\,\\mathcal{C}_{T}(\\Delta/2)\\big]$.\nThe computed values are $\\Delta\\bar{f}(\\Delta/2)=0$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{T}(\\Delta/2)=-1/2$.\n\nThe final result is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.",
