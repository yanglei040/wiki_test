            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The task is to derive the smallest characteristic scales of a turbulent flow, known as the Kolmogorov scales, using dimensional analysis, and then to apply these to determine the required resolution for a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS).\n\nThe fundamental physical quantities provided are the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations govern the fluid motion, and it is within the context of these equations that $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$ find their meaning. The viscosity $\\nu$ is a parameter in the momentum equation, responsible for viscous dissipation of energy. The dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ represents the rate at which kinetic energy is converted into internal energy at the smallest scales of the motion, and it is formally defined from the velocity gradients. In a statistically steady turbulent flow, $\\epsilon$ is also equal to the rate at which energy is supplied at the largest scales.\n\nThe Kolmogorov theory of turbulence postulates that in the inertial range of scales, the statistics of turbulent motions are universally determined by $\\epsilon$ alone, but at the smallest, dissipative scales, the physics must also depend on the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, which governs the dissipation mechanism. We can therefore deduce the characteristic length, time, and velocity scales of these dissipative motions by finding the unique dimensional combinations of $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe physical dimensions of the given quantities are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $[\\nu] = L^2 T^{-1}$\n- Dissipation rate per unit mass, $[\\epsilon] = L^2 T^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we derive the Kolmogorov length scale, denoted by $\\eta$. We assume that $\\eta$ can be expressed as a product of powers of $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\eta = C \\nu^a \\epsilon^b $$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant, conventionally taken as $1$. To find the exponents $a$ and $b$, we match the physical dimensions on both sides of the equation:\n$$ [\\eta] = [\\nu]^a [\\epsilon]^b $$\n$$ L^1 T^0 = (L^2 T^{-1})^a (L^2 T^{-3})^b $$\n$$ L^1 T^0 = L^{2a+2b} T^{-a-3b} $$\nEquating the exponents for the dimension of length ($L$) and time ($T$) gives a system of two linear equations:\n1. For $L$: $1 = 2a + 2b$\n2. For $T$: $0 = -a - 3b \\implies a = -3b$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $a$ from the second equation into the first:\n$$ 1 = 2(-3b) + 2b = -6b + 2b = -4b $$\nThis yields $b = -\\frac{1}{4}$. Substituting this value back into the expression for $a$:\n$$ a = -3 \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThus, the Kolmogorov length scale $\\eta$ is given by:\n$$ \\eta = \\left( \\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/4} $$\n\nNext, we derive the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, using the same dimensional reasoning. We assume:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = K \\nu^c \\epsilon^d $$\nwhere $K$ is another dimensionless constant, also taken as $1$. Matching the dimensions:\n$$ [\\tau_{\\eta}] = [\\nu]^c [\\epsilon]^d $$\n$$ L^0 T^1 = (L^2 T^{-1})^c (L^2 T^{-3})^d $$\n$$ L^0 T^1 = L^{2c+2d} T^{-c-3d} $$\nThis yields another system of linear equations for the exponents $c$ and $d$:\n1. For $L$: $0 = 2c + 2d \\implies c = -d$\n2. For $T$: $1 = -c - 3d$\n\nSubstituting $c = -d$ into the second equation:\n$$ 1 = -(-d) - 3d = d - 3d = -2d $$\nThis yields $d = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, $c = -(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale $\\tau_{\\eta}$ is given by:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/2} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values of these scales using the provided data: $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $\\epsilon = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$.\n\nFor the length scale $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\left( \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})^3}{0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{3.375 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^6/s^3}}{0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} \\right)^{1/4} $$\n$$ \\eta = (3.375 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^4})^{1/4} = (33.75 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^4})^{1/4} $$\nTo facilitate the fourth root, we can write this as:\n$$ \\eta = (337.5 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^4})^{1/4} = (337.5)^{1/4} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe numerical calculation gives:\n$$ \\eta \\approx 4.28689 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\eta = 4.287 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor the time scale $\\tau_{\\eta}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\left( \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} \\right)^{1/2} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^2})^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\sqrt{1.5} \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe numerical calculation gives:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} \\approx 1.22474 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\tau_{\\eta} = 1.225 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the DNS grid spacing $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$ based on the problem's criteria for resolving these smallest scales.\nThe spatial resolution is set to half the Kolmogorov length:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{\\eta}{2} = \\frac{4.28689 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2} \\approx 2.143445 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta x = 2.143 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe temporal resolution is set to one-tenth of the Kolmogorov time:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{10} = \\frac{1.22474 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{10} \\approx 1.22474 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta t = 1.225 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe computed values are:\n- Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta = 4.287 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta} = 1.225 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- DNS grid spacing, $\\Delta x = 2.143 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- DNS time step, $\\Delta t = 1.225 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\nThese values will be presented in the final answer as a row matrix.",

All calculations are performed using the provided values in SI units.\n\n**1) Reynolds Number Calculation**\n\nThe Reynolds number, $Re$, is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid. For a flow characterized by a length scale $L$, a velocity scale $U$, and a kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, it is defined as:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / L}{\\mu U / L^2} = \\frac{UL}{\\mu/\\rho} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\nGiven the values $U = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $L = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $\\nu = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{(0.1\\ \\mathrm{m/s})(0.1\\ \\mathrm{m})}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{0.01}{10^{-6}} = 10000 = 10^4\n$$\nThis value indicates that the flow is in the turbulent regime, as $Re$ is significantly greater than the typical critical values for transition to turbulence.\n\n**2) Kolmogorov Scales Derivation**\n\nAccording to the Kolmogorov 1941 (K41) theory for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, there is an energy cascade where energy is injected at the large scales and dissipated into heat at the smallest scales. The rate of energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$, is a key parameter.\nIt is assumed that in the inertial subrange, the rate of energy transfer is constant and equal to the rate of energy injection at the large scales. The rate of energy injection is dimensionally proportional to $U^3/L$. We adopt the order-of-magnitude assumption:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{U^3}{L}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{(0.1\\ \\mathrm{m/s})^3}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.001}{0.1}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}\n$$\nThe Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$, is the smallest length scale in the flow, where viscosity dominates and kinetic energy is dissipated.

Therefore, the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ must be on the order of $\\eta$. The problem specifies the requirement:\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\eta = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe computational domain is a cube of side length $L = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{m}$. For a uniform Cartesian grid, the number of grid points required in each direction, $N_d$, is:\n$$\nN_d = \\frac{L}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 10^3\n$$\nThe total number of grid control volumes, $N_{\\text{total}}$, for the three-dimensional domain is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = N_d \\times N_d \\times N_d = N_d^3 = (10^3)^3 = 10^9\n$$\n\n**4) Stable Time Step Calculation**\n\nFor an explicit time integration scheme, the time step $\\Delta t$ is limited by stability constraints. We consider both the advective and viscous constraints.\n\nThe advective stability is governed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. For a 1D problem, it is $C = U \\Delta t / \\Delta x \\le C_{\\text{max}}$.  For a 3D flow with characteristic velocity $U$ and uniform grid spacing $\\Delta x$, the advective time step limit, $\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}} \\le \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} \\Delta x}{U}\n$$\nWith the given maximum Courant number $C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} = 0.5$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{(0.5)(10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe viscous stability constraint for an explicit scheme applied to the diffusion term is of the form:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{visc}} \\le \\frac{C_{\\nu} (\\Delta x)^2}{\\nu}\n$$\nThis form is a common simplification; a more rigorous analysis for a 3D central difference scheme yields a denominator of $6\\nu$. However, following the problem's simplified structure with a given coefficient $C_{\\nu}=0.5$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{visc}} = \\frac{(0.5)(10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-8}}{10^{-6}}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe overall stable time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy both conditions. Therefore, we must choose the more restrictive (smaller) of the two:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{visc}}) = \\min(5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}, 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\n**5) Simulation Time and Computational Cost Scaling**\n\nThe characteristic time horizon for the simulation is given by the large-eddy turnover time, $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{0.1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe total number of time steps, $N_{\\text{steps}}$, required to simulate one turnover time is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{steps}} = \\frac{T}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{s}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{0.0005} = 2000\n$$\nThe computational cost of a DNS is proportional to the total number of floating-point operations, which scales with the product of the total number of grid points and the total number of time steps. We can analyze the scaling of this cost with the Reynolds number $Re$.\n\nThe number of grid points per direction scales as $N_d = L/\\eta = L/(L Re^{-3/4}) = Re^{3/4}$.\nThe total number of grid points scales as:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = N_d^3 = (Re^{3/4})^3 = Re^{9/4}\n$$\nThe time step $\\Delta t$ is the minimum of two scalings:\n$\\Delta t_{\\text{adv}} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta x}{U} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{U} = \\frac{L Re^{-3/4}}{U} = T Re^{-3/4}$\n$\\Delta t_{\\text{visc}} \\sim \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{\\nu} \\sim \\frac{\\eta^2}{\\nu} = \\frac{L^2 Re^{-3/2}}{\\nu} = \\frac{L}{U} Re \\cdot Re^{-3/2} = T Re^{-1/2}$\nFor high Reynolds number ($Re \\gg 1$), we have $Re^{-3/4} < Re^{-1/2}$, making the advective CFL condition more restrictive.\nThus, $\\Delta t \\sim T Re^{-3/4}$.\n\nThe number of time steps scales as:\n$$\nN_{\\text{steps}} = \\frac{T}{\\Delta t} \\sim \\frac{T}{T Re^{-3/4}} = Re^{3/4}\n$$\nThe total computational cost, Cost, is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Cost} \\propto N_{\\text{total}} \\times N_{\\text{steps}} \\sim Re^{9/4} \\times Re^{3/4} = Re^{12/4} = Re^3\n$$\nThis cubic scaling with the Reynolds number highlights the prohibitive computational expense of DNS for high-$Re$ flows.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $N_{\\text{total}}$, rounded to two significant figures.

The simulation is to be run for one large-eddy turnover time, `$T$`, which scales as:\n$$T \\sim \\frac{L}{U}$$\nFor an explicit time-marching scheme, the time step, `$\\Delta t$`, is limited by stability constraints. At high Reynolds numbers, the most restrictive constraint is typically the advective Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition, which requires that information does not travel more than one grid cell per time step. With a Courant number of order unity, this means:\n$$\\Delta t \\sim \\frac{\\Delta x}{U}$$\nSince `$\\Delta x \\sim \\eta \\sim L Re^{-3/4}$`, the time step scaling is:\n$$\\Delta t \\sim \\frac{L Re^{-3/4}}{U} = \\frac{L}{U} Re^{-3/4}$$\nThe total number of time steps, `$N_{t}$`, needed to simulate a duration `$T$` is:\n$$N_{t} = \\frac{T}{\\Delta t} \\sim \\frac{L/U}{(L/U)Re^{-3/4}} = Re^{3/4}$$\n\nNow, we can estimate the total required computational work, `$W_{\\mathrm{req}}$`. The work is the product of the number of grid points, the number of time steps, and the number of floating-point operations per grid point per time step, `$c_{\\mathrm{op}} = 100$`.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{req}} = N \\times N_{t} \\times c_{\\mathrm{op}}$$\nUsing the derived scalings for `$N$` and `$N_{t}$`, we arrive at the classic `$Re^3$` scaling law for DNS cost:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{req}} \\sim Re^{9/4} \\times Re^{3/4} \\times c_{\\mathrm{op}} = c_{\\mathrm{op}} Re^{(9/4 + 3/4)} = c_{\\mathrm{op}} Re^3$$\nLet's compute the numerical value for `$W_{\\mathrm{req}}$`:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{req}} \\approx 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{10^7}{3}\\right)^{3} = 100 \\times \\frac{10^{21}}{27} \\approx 3.704 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{FLOP}$$\n\nNext, we compute the total available computational work, `$W_{\\mathrm{avail}}$`. The machine sustains `$R_{\\mathrm{perf}} = 5 \\times 10^{12}$` FLOP/s for a duration of `$T_{\\mathrm{avail}} = 1$` week. First, convert `$1$` week to seconds:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{avail}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{week} \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{days/week} \\times 24\\,\\mathrm{hours/day} \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s/hour} = 604800\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe total available work is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{avail}} = R_{\\mathrm{perf}} \\times T_{\\mathrm{avail}} = (5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{FLOP/s}) \\times (604800\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{avail}} = 5 \\times 6.048 \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{12} = 30.24 \\times 10^{17} = 3.024 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{FLOP}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the feasibility ratio `$\\mathcal{R}$`:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{avail}}}{W_{\\mathrm{req}}} \\approx \\frac{3.024 \\times 10^{18}}{3.704 \\times 10^{21}} \\approx 0.000816$$\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures, we get `$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 8.2 \\times 10^{-4}$`. Since `$\\mathcal{R} \\ll 1$`, the simulation is not feasible under the given conditions and assumptions.",
