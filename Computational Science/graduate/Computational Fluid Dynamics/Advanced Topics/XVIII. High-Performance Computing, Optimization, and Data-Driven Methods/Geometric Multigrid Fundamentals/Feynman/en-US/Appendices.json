A geometric multigrid method with a V-cycle is used as the iterative solver. Suppose that, measured in the discrete $\\ell_{2}$ norm, the observed two-grid convergence factor is $\\rho = 0.2$, and assume that this behavior is uniform across all levels and carries over to a full V-cycle on any grid such that a single V-cycle reduces the error norm by the factor $\\rho$. Starting from an arbitrary initial guess, determine the minimal integer number of V-cycles required so that the error norm is reduced by a factor of $10^{-6}$. Provide the minimal integer number of V-cycles required as your final answer, with no units. No rounding to a specified number of significant figures is needed; report the exact minimal integer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal integer number of V-cycles required to reduce the error norm by a factor of at least $10^{-6}$, given a constant convergence factor per cycle. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, as it describes a standard scenario in the analysis of iterative methods for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.\n\nLet $e_0$ be the initial error vector, where the error is defined as the difference between the exact discrete solution and the current approximate solution. Let $\\|e_0\\|_2$ denote the discrete $\\ell_2$ norm of this initial error.\n\nThe problem states that a single V-cycle reduces the error norm by a factor of $\\rho$. The value of this convergence factor is given as $\\rho = 0.2$. If we denote the error vector after $k$ V-cycles as $e_k$, this relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ \\|e_k\\|_2 \\le \\rho \\|e_{k-1}\\|_2 $$\nThe problem text implies we can model the reduction as an equality for determining the number of cycles:\n$$ \\|e_k\\|_2 = \\rho \\|e_{k-1}\\|_2 $$\nApplying this relation recursively for $n$ V-cycles, we find the relationship between the error norm after $n$ cycles, $\\|e_n\\|_2$, and the initial error norm, $\\|e_0\\|_2$:\n$$ \\|e_n\\|_2 = \\rho \\|e_{n-1}\\|_2 = \\rho (\\rho \\|e_{n-2}\\|_2) = \\dots = \\rho^n \\|e_0\\|_2 $$\nThe goal is to find the minimal integer number of cycles, $n$, such that the total reduction in the error norm is at least a factor of $10^{-6}$. This can be stated as the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\|e_n\\|_2}{\\|e_0\\|_2} \\le 10^{-6} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\|e_n\\|_2$ into this inequality, we get:\n$$ \\rho^n \\le 10^{-6} $$\nWe are given the value of the convergence factor $\\rho = 0.2$. Substituting this value into the inequality yields:\n$$ (0.2)^n \\le 10^{-6} $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$ \\ln((0.2)^n) \\le \\ln(10^{-6}) $$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we can bring the exponent $n$ down:\n$$ n \\ln(0.2) \\le -6 \\ln(10) $$\nNow, we must isolate $n$. It is critical to note that since $0 < 0.2 < 1$, the value of $\\ln(0.2)$ is negative. Therefore, when we divide both sides of the inequality by $\\ln(0.2)$, we must reverse the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{-6 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(0.2)} $$\nTo simplify the expression, we can use the logarithm property $\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(x) - \\ln(y)$ or $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$. We have $\\ln(0.2) = \\ln(1/5) = -\\ln(5)$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{-6 \\ln(10)}{-\\ln(5)} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{6 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(5)} $$\nNow we can evaluate this expression. Using the values $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$ and $\\ln(5) \\approx 1.609438$:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{6 \\times 2.302585}{1.609438} \\approx \\frac{13.81551}{1.609438} \\approx 8.584 $$\nSince the number of V-cycles, $n$, must be an integer, we need to find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $8.584$. This integer is $9$.\n\nTo verify, let's check the reduction for $n=8$ and $n=9$:\nFor $n=8$, the error is reduced by a factor of $(0.2)^8 = (2 \\times 10^{-1})^8 = 2^8 \\times 10^{-8} = 256 \\times 10^{-8} = 2.56 \\times 10^{-6}$. This value is greater than $10^{-6}$, so $8$ cycles are insufficient.\nFor $n=9$, the error is reduced by a factor of $(0.2)^9 = (0.2) \\times (2.56 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.512 \\times 10^{-6}$. This value is less than $10^{-6}$, so $9$ cycles are sufficient.\nThus, the minimal integer number of V-cycles required is $9$.",

The transfer operators are the usual linear interpolation for prolongation and full-weighting for restriction, and one pre-smoothing and one post-smoothing step are used with a weighted Jacobi smoother of damping parameter $\\omega$ such that Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) predicts a per-step high-frequency smoothing factor $\\mu=1/5$.

The spectral radius $\\rho(E)$ is the asymptotic convergence factor per cycle.\n- For a hierarchy with uniform coarsening by $r=2$ in $d=3$, and a level cost proportional to the number of unknowns, the total work per cycle satisfies the recurrences $T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n)=a\\,n+T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n/8)$ for a V-cycle and $T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n)=a\\,n+2\\,T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n/8)$ for a W-cycle, where $a>0$ collects level-dependent costs (smoothing, residual computation, restriction/prolongation) proportional to the degrees of freedom $n$ on that level.\n- When replacing a single coarse-grid visit by two recursive coarse-grid visits (a W-cycle), the coarse-grid correction operator is effectively applied twice within one fine-level cycle.

It is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of data and modeling principles to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the work inflation factor when switching from a V-cycle to a W-cycle, and the expected reduction in the asymptotic convergence factor (spectral radius of the error-propagation operator).\n\nFirst, we calculate the work inflation factor, $\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n)}{T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n)}$. The problem provides the recurrence relations for the computational work of a V-cycle, $T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n)$, and a W-cycle, $T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n)$, on a grid with $n$ degrees of freedom:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n) = a\\,n + T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n/8)$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n) = a\\,n + 2\\,T_{\\mathrm{W}}(n/8)$$\nThese relations hold for a hierarchy of grids where each coarser level has $1/8$ the number of unknowns of the finer level ($d=3$, $r=2$). The term $a\\,n$ represents the work done on the current level (smoothing, residual computation, inter-grid transfers), and the recursive term represents the work done on all coarser levels. We can solve these recurrences by expansion, assuming a deep hierarchy of levels.\n\nFor the V-cycle, we have:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n) = a\\,n + T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n/8) = a\\,n + \\left(a\\frac{n}{8} + T_{\\mathrm{V}}\\left(\\frac{n}{8^2}\\right)\\right) = a\\,n + a\\frac{n}{8} + a\\frac{n}{8^2} + \\dots$$\nThis forms a geometric series:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{V}}(n) = a\\,n \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^k$$\nThe sum of this infinite geometric series is $\\frac{1}{1 - 1/8} = \\frac{1}{7/8} = \\frac{8}{7}$.

Standard multigrid theory models the asymptotic convergence factor, $\\rho(E)$, as the maximum of the smoothing factor for high-frequency error components and the coarse-grid correction factor for low-frequency (smooth) error components.\nWith one pre- and one post-smoothing step, the smoothing is applied twice per cycle, so the effective high-frequency smoothing factor is given by $\\mu^2$. We are given $\\mu = 1/5$, so the high-frequency factor is:\n$$\\mu^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$$\nLet $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{V}}$ be the convergence factor of the coarse-grid correction for smooth modes in a V-cycle. The overall spectral radius for the V-cycle is then approximated by:\n$$\\rho(E_{\\mathrm{V}}) \\approx \\max(\\mu^2, \\gamma_{\\mathrm{V}})$$\nWe are given that $\\rho(E_{\\mathrm{V}}) = 9/10$ and that this is dominated by the coarse-grid correction. This is consistent, as $\\mu^2 = 1/25 = 0.04$, which is much smaller than $9/10 = 0.9$. Therefore, we can deduce the coarse-grid correction factor for the V-cycle:\n$$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{9}{10}$$\n\nFor the W-cycle, the smoothing part remains the same, so the high-frequency factor is still $\\mu^2 = 1/25$. The problem states that the W-cycle improves the coarse-grid correction factor for smooth modes according to the model $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{W}} \\approx \\gamma_{\\mathrm{V}}^2$. Using the value of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{V}}$ we found:\n$$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{W}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{81}{100}$$\nThe expected spectral radius for the W-cycle is then:\n$$\\rho(E_{\\mathrm{W}}) \\approx \\max(\\mu^2, \\gamma_{\\mathrm{W}}) = \\max\\left(\\frac{1}{25}, \\frac{81}{100}\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{4}{100}, \\frac{81}{100}\\right) = \\frac{81}{100}$$\nThe W-cycle convergence is also dominated by the coarse-grid correction, but the factor is significantly improved.\n\nThe reduction in the cycle spectral radius is:\n$$\\rho(E_{\\mathrm{V}}) - \\rho(E_{\\mathrm{W}}) = \\frac{9}{10} - \\frac{81}{100} = \\frac{90}{100} - \\frac{81}{100} = \\frac{9}{100}$$\n\nThe two requested quantities are the work inflation factor, $\\frac{7}{6}$, and the reduction in the spectral radius, $\\frac{9}{100}$. A work increase of $\\frac{7}{6} \\approx 1.167$ (about $17\\%$) leads to a new convergence factor of $0.81$ from $0.9$. The number of iterations to reach a given tolerance is proportional to $1 / |\\ln(\\rho)|$. The ratio of iterations is $\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{\\ln(0.81)} \\approx \\frac{-0.1054}{-0.2107} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$, meaning the W-cycle requires about half the iterations. The total work to solution is proportional to (Work per cycle) $\\times$ (Number of iterations). The ratio of total work is $\\frac{W_W}{W_V} = \\frac{T_W N_W}{T_V N_V} \\approx \\frac{7/6 T_V}{T_V} \\times \\frac{1/2 N_V}{N_V} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.58$. This indicates a substantial reduction in total computational effort, justifying the switch.\nThe final answer is composed of these two computed values.",
