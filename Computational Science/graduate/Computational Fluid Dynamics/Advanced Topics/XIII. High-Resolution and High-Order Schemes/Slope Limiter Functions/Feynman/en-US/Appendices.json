In a finite-volume scheme, conservation is guaranteed if cell-average updates are computed from numerical fluxes evaluated at face states. Thus, if we modify only the interface states used in fluxes while leaving cell averages unchanged, the scheme remains conservative. High-order accuracy in smooth regions requires that any safeguard reduces to the original reconstruction whenever the candidate states are already admissible.\n\nAggressive limiters like superbee produce highly compressive reconstructions to sharply resolve discontinuities. While Total Variation Diminishing properties control spurious oscillations in the sense of total variation, they do not guarantee positivity of reconstructed values, especially for thermodynamic variables where nonlinear couplings matter. In particular, large negative slopes near low-density or low-pressure regions can push interface reconstructions below the physical floors even if cell averages are admissible.\n\nA principled safeguard scales the reconstruction increment from the cell average so that face states remain admissible.

Practically, one computes the real roots of $A_2 \\alpha^2 + A_1 \\alpha + A_0 = 0$; if there is a positive root in $(0,1]$ and the inequality becomes violated beyond that root, choose $\\alpha_p$ as the smallest such positive root; if the polynomial is nonnegative for all $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, set $\\alpha_p = 1$. If $\\Delta \\rho  0$ imposes a stricter bound on $\\alpha$ through $\\alpha_\\rho$, that bound is applied.

This ensures $\\rho^\\star \\ge \\varepsilon$ and $p^\\star \\ge \\varepsilon$ by construction. Because $U^\\star$ reduces to $\\tilde{U}$ when no constraints are active ($\\alpha=1$), the method retains high-order accuracy in smooth regions. Since only face states are altered and cell averages are unchanged, the finite-volume update remains conservative. This safeguard is consistent with positivity-preserving approaches and can be paired with positivity-preserving numerical fluxes and Strong Stability Preserving time integrators to guarantee positivity of cell averages under standard Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy conditions.\n\nWe now analyze the options:\n\nOption A: It proposes reconstructing primitives and clipping $\\tilde{\\rho}$ and $\\tilde{p}$ directly to $\\varepsilon$ while leaving other variables unchanged. This approach is flawed. First, directly altering $\\rho$ and $p$ without consistent adjustment of $E$ and $m$ can violate the thermodynamic relation $p = (\\gamma - 1)\\left(E - \\dfrac{m^2}{2\\rho}\\right)$, leading to inconsistent states. Second, ad hoc clipping at faces does not define a consistent $\\alpha$ nor preserve the high-order correction direction, and it may break conservation if the fluxes do not correspond to a reconstruction derived from the cell averages. Additionally, reconstructing in primitives does not automatically ensure positivity of transformed conservative variables at faces when converting back. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption B: It precisely describes the line-search scaling safeguard $U^\\star = U_i + \\alpha(\\tilde{U} - U_i)$ with $\\alpha = \\min(1, \\alpha_\\rho, \\alpha_p)$, where $\\alpha_\\rho$ enforces $\\rho^\\star \\ge \\varepsilon$ via a linear bound and $\\alpha_p$ enforces $p^\\star \\ge \\varepsilon$ via the quadratic inequality derived from the ideal-gas pressure formula. This method leaves cell averages intact, preserves conservation, guarantees face admissibility by construction, and reduces to the original high-order reconstruction when constraints are inactive ($\\alpha=1$). Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption C: It states that replacing superbee by minmod guarantees positivity because Total Variation Diminishing limiters cannot produce negative density or pressure. This is a common misconception. TVD properties limit oscillations in a scalar quantity but do not guarantee positivity in reconstructed variables, especially in systems with nonlinear constraints coupling $\\rho$, $m$, and $E$. Even with minmod, reconstructed interfaces can violate positivity if the cell averages are near the floor and the local slope points toward lower values. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: It suggests adding artificial viscosity and imposing an energy floor at faces. Setting a fixed floor can force $p^\\star \\ge \\varepsilon$, but this is not a principled safeguard: it breaks the consistency between reconstructed increments and the underlying cell averages and can violate conservation or severely damp accuracy by artificially modifying the physics. Uniform viscosity does not guarantee positivity in general and the proposed energy floor is not computed from a controlled $\\alpha$ scaling tied to the reconstruction direction. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E: Reducing the time step helps positivity of cell averages when using positivity-preserving fluxes and Strong Stability Preserving time integrators, but it does not address the immediate problem that reconstructed interface states themselves may be inadmissible before the flux computation. A stricter Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition cannot fix negative $\\tilde{\\rho}$ or $\\tilde{p}$ at faces produced by reconstruction; a reconstruction-level safeguard is required. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct strategy is the scaling safeguard described in Option B, with the computation of $\\alpha$ as $\\alpha = \\min(1, \\alpha_\\rho, \\alpha_p)$ using the derived constraints.",
