This first exercise provides a quantitative look at the trade-offs involved in uniform h-refinement by exploring how the number of cells—and thus computational cost—scales with refinement, and how the theoretical error is expected to decrease for a given numerical scheme. Understanding this fundamental scaling relationship is the first step toward appreciating the power and cost of mesh adaptation. ",

The spatial discretization is performed using a cell-centered second-order Finite Volume (FV) method on a structured quadrilateral mesh. Assume Dirichlet boundary conditions on the inflow portions of $\\partial \\Omega$, and that the only globally coupled primary unknowns are the cell-averaged values $u_{i}$ per cell; second-order accuracy is achieved through linear reconstruction using least-squares gradients computed from neighboring cell averages. Ignore temporal discretization error and any stabilization parameters; focus solely on the spatial discretization properties.\n\nThe initial mesh is uniform and consists of $N_{x} = 37$ cells in the $x$-direction and $N_{y} = 23$ cells in the $y$-direction, covering $\\Omega$ exactly. Perform two levels of uniform $h$-refinement by subdividing each quadrilateral cell into four congruent quadrilaterals at each level (bisecting once in each coordinate direction per level). Let $N_{0}$ denote the initial number of cells, and let $N_{2}$ denote the number of cells after two refinement levels.

For a second-order FV spatial discretization applied to smooth solutions of linear advection, assume the leading-order spatial discretization error in a global norm $E(h)$ obeys the asymptotic relation $E(h) \\propto h^{2}$, with a refinement-independent constant of proportionality in the asymptotic regime.

            "solution": "The problem involves cell counts under uniform $h$-refinement, the corresponding number of globally coupled degrees of freedom for a cell-centered method, and the asymptotic scaling of the spatial discretization error with mesh size for a second-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme.\n\nFirst, consider the initial mesh. The domain $\\Omega = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ is covered by a structured quadrilateral mesh with $N_{x} = 37$ cells in the $x$-direction and $N_{y} = 23$ cells in the $y$-direction. Therefore, the initial number of cells is\n$$\nN_{0} = N_{x} N_{y} = 37 \\times 23 = 851.\n$$\nNow analyze the effect of uniform $h$-refinement by subdividing each quadrilateral cell into four congruent quadrilaterals per refinement level. Subdividing each quadrilateral into four is achieved by bisecting once in each coordinate direction, which doubles the resolution in both the $x$- and $y$-directions. For each refinement level:\n- The number of cells increases by a factor of $4$ (since each original cell becomes four),\n- The number of cells per direction doubles, i.e., $N_{x} \\mapsto 2 N_{x}$ and $N_{y} \\mapsto 2 N_{y}$.\n\nAfter two refinement levels, the total multiplication factor for the number of cells is\n$$\n4 \\times 4 = 4^{2} = 16.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nN_{2} = 16 N_{0} = 16 \\times 851 = 13{,}616.\n$$\nSince the scheme is cell-centered and the only globally coupled primary unknowns are the cell averages $u_{i}$, the number of degrees of freedom equals the number of cells. There are no additional globally coupled unknowns for faces or nodes in the stated formulation, and Dirichlet boundary conditions do not introduce additional degrees of freedom. Thus,\n$$\n\\text{DOF}_{2} = N_{2} = 13{,}616.\n$$\n\nNext, consider the mesh size and error scaling. For a uniform structured mesh, define the characteristic mesh size as\n$$\nh = \\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y), \\quad \\Delta x = \\frac{1}{N_{x}}, \\quad \\Delta y = \\frac{1}{N_{y}}.\n$$\nUnder one level of uniform refinement, $N_{x}$ and $N_{y}$ each double, so $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are each halved. Hence $h$ is halved. After two levels, $N_{x}$ and $N_{y}$ are multiplied by $4$, so both $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are divided by $4$, and therefore\n$$\n\\frac{h_{2}}{h_{0}} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nFor a second-order FV spatial discretization applied to smooth solutions of linear advection, the leading-order spatial discretization error scales as\n$$\nE(h) \\propto h^{2}.\n$$\nThis scaling follows from Taylor-series analysis of fluxes with linear reconstruction, where the leading truncation error term involves second derivatives of $u$ multiplied by $h^{2}$. Consequently, the error-reduction factor after two levels of refinement is\n$$\nR = \\frac{E(h_{2})}{E(h_{0})} = \\left( \\frac{h_{2}}{h_{0}} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\n\nCollecting the results, we have\n$$\nN_{2} = 13{,}616, \\quad \\text{DOF}_{2} = 13{,}616, \\quad R = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\nThese can be reported as the requested row matrix.",
