            "solution": "The problem asks for a multi-step analysis of particle motion in an unsteady fluid flow, culminating in the quantification of the error of a leading-order model.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The problem is based on Newton's second law and Stokes drag, a well-established model for particle motion in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds numbers. The governing equation is a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The tasks of deriving an approximate model, finding an exact solution for a specific case, and computing the error between them are well-posed and mathematically sound. The provided physical parameters are realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe motion of the particle is governed by the equation:\n$$\nm_{p}\\,\\frac{d v_{p}}{dt} \\;=\\; 6\\pi \\mu a \\,\\big(u(t) - v_{p}(t)\\big)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the particle relaxation time, $\\tau_{p} = m_{p}/(6\\pi \\mu a)$, this equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d v_{p}}{dt} \\;=\\; u(t) - v_{p}(t)\n$$\nWe are interested in the slip velocity, defined as $u_{s}(t) = u(t) - v_{p}(t)$. From this definition, we have $v_{p}(t) = u(t) - u_{s}(t)$. Substituting this into the previous equation yields an equation for the slip velocity:\n$$\n\\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(u(t) - u_{s}(t)\\big) \\;=\\; u_{s}(t)\n$$\nDistributing the derivative and rearranging the terms, we obtain the exact governing equation for the slip velocity:\n$$\nu_{s}(t) + \\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d u_{s}}{dt} \\;=\\; \\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d u}{dt}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{du}{dt}$ represents the local fluid acceleration.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a leading-order model for $u_{s}(t)$ in the asymptotic regime where the Stokes number $\\mathrm{St} = \\tau_{p}/T_{f} \\ll 1$, where $T_{f}$ is the characteristic time scale of the flow. This condition implies that the particle relaxation time is much smaller than the flow time scale. We can find the leading-order model by considering a regular perturbation expansion of $u_{s}$ in powers of the small parameter $\\tau_{p}$.\nLet $u_{s}(t) = u_{s}^{(0)}(t) + \\tau_{p} u_{s}^{(1)}(t) + O(\\tau_{p}^{2})$. Substituting this expansion into the exact equation for $u_{s}$:\n$$\n(u_{s}^{(0)} + \\tau_{p} u_{s}^{(1)} + \\dots) + \\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d}{dt}(u_{s}^{(0)} + \\tau_{p} u_{s}^{(1)} + \\dots) \\;=\\; \\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d u}{dt}\n$$\nCollecting terms of the same order in $\\tau_{p}$:\nAt order $O(1)$:\n$$\nu_{s}^{(0)}(t) = 0\n$$\nThis corresponds to the trivial case where the particle perfectly tracks the fluid. However, the problem asks for a model in terms of the material acceleration. This implies we are looking for the next-order correction which captures the leading-order slip dynamics. A more appropriate scaling is to recognize that $u_{s}$ itself must be small, of order $O(\\tau_{p})$.\nFrom the exact equation, we can see that if $\\tau_p \\to 0$, then $u_s \\to 0$. We can use this to iterate. A first approximation (the leading-order model) is found by neglecting the term $\\tau_{p}\\frac{du_s}{dt}$, which is of a higher order, $O(\\tau_p^2)$, compared to the other terms. This gives the leading-order reduced model:\n$$\nu_{s}^{(0)}(t) \\;=\\; \\tau_{p}\\,\\frac{d u}{dt}\n$$\nThis model states that the leading-order slip velocity is proportional to the particle relaxation time and the fluid acceleration.\n\nNext, we consider the specific imposed flow $u(t) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(\\omega t)$. The characteristic flow time scale is $T_f = 1/\\omega$. The fluid acceleration is $\\frac{du}{dt} = U_{0}\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$.\nThe leading-order model for the slip velocity is:\n$$\nu_{s}^{(0)}(t) \\;=\\; \\tau_{p} (U_{0}\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)) \\;=\\; U_{0}\\omega\\tau_{p}\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nTo find the exact steady periodic solution, $u_{s}^{\\mathrm{exact}}(t)$, we must solve the full ODE for $u_s$ with the given forcing:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_{s}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}} u_{s} \\;=\\; U_{0}\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. We seek the steady periodic particular solution. We use the method of undetermined coefficients, assuming a solution of the form $u_{s}^{\\mathrm{exact}}(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the leading-order streamwise slip velocity for a neutrally buoyant, rigid sphere in a steady plane Poiseuille flow, under creeping-flow conditions. The analysis begins with the fundamental expression for the hydrodynamic force on a spherical particle in a Stokes flow, which incorporates Faxén's laws.\n\nNewton's second law for a force-free particle dictates that the net force on the particle is zero. The primary force acting on the particle is the hydrodynamic drag force, $\\boldsymbol{F}$. For a rigid sphere of radius $a$ in a creeping flow, this force is given by a generalization of Stokes' law:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = 6 \\pi \\mu a \\left( \\langle\\boldsymbol{u}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{S}} - \\boldsymbol{U}_p \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\\boldsymbol{U}_p$ is the translational velocity of the particle's center, and $\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{S}}$ is the undisturbed ambient fluid velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ averaged over the surface of the sphere that would be occupied by the particle.\n\nThe problem states that the particle is force-free, so $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This implies a balance between the particle velocity and the surface-averaged ambient velocity:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U}_p = \\langle\\boldsymbol{u}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{S}}\n$$\nTo evaluate $\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{S}}$, we use the leading-order Faxén correction, which is derived from a Taylor series expansion of the ambient flow field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ about the particle's center, $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$. The problem specifies that the ambient flow varies slowly over the particle scale ($a \\ll H$), justifying the truncation of the series. The leading-order correction is:\n$$\n\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{S}} \\approx \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}_p) + \\frac{a^2}{6} \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}|_{\\boldsymbol{x}_p}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. Combining these equations gives the particle's velocity:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U}_p \\approx \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}_p) + \\frac{a^2}{6} \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}|_{\\boldsymbol{x}_p}\n$$\nThe undisturbed ambient flow is the given plane Poiseuille flow:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = u_x(y) \\boldsymbol{e}_x = U_c \\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{H^2}\\right) \\boldsymbol{e}_x\n$$\nWe must compute the Laplacian of this velocity field. The Laplacian operator is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$. Since $u_x$ depends only on the coordinate $y$, the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $z$ are zero. The Laplacian of the vector field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} = \\left( \\nabla^2 u_x \\right) \\boldsymbol{e}_x = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{e}_x\n$$\nWe compute the second derivative of $u_x(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ U_c \\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{H^2}\\right) \\right] = U_c \\left( -\\frac{2y}{H^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ -\\frac{2 U_c y}{H^2} \\right] = -\\frac{2 U_c}{H^2}\n$$\nThis result is a constant, confirming that higher-order spatial derivatives are zero, consistent with the problem's assumptions.\n\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the particle velocity $\\boldsymbol{U}_p$, and evaluating at the particle's center position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$ (where $y=y_0$), we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U}_p \\approx u_x(y_0)\\boldsymbol{e}_x + \\frac{a^2}{6} \\left( -\\frac{2 U_c}{H^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{e}_x\n$$\nThe particle's translational velocity is purely in the $x$-direction. Its $x$-component, $U_{p,x}$, is:\n$$\nU_{p,x} \\approx u_x(y_0) - \\frac{a^2 U_c}{3 H^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the streamwise slip velocity, defined as $U_{\\text{slip},x} = U_{p,x} - u_x(y_0)$. Using the expression for $U_{p,x}$ we just derived:\n$$\nU_{\\text{slip},x} = \\left( u_x(y_0) - \\frac{a^2 U_c}{3 H^2} \\right) - u_x(y_0)\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{slip},x} = -\\frac{a^2 U_c}{3 H^2}\n$$\nThis expression is of order $\\mathcal{O}(a^2/H^2)$ as required.\n\nThe sign of the slip velocity is negative. This means $U_{p,x}  u_x(y_0)$, indicating that the particle translates horizontally more slowly than the undisturbed fluid at its centerline. This phenomenon is known as \"particle lag\" and is a direct consequence of the curvature of the background flow profile. The Poiseuille profile is concave ($u_x''(y)  0$), so the fluid velocity is greater on the side of the sphere closer to the channel centerline and smaller on the side closer to the wall. This asymmetry in the flow around the particle results in a net drag force that opposes the main flow direction, causing the particle to lag. The Faxén correction term $\\frac{a^2}{6} \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}$ precisely accounts for this effect.\n\nThe implications for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are significant. In many coarse-grid simulations implementing two-way coupling, particles smaller than the grid resolution are modeled as \"point-particles\". A simplified point-particle model might calculate the drag force based only on the local fluid velocity at the particle's center, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{F} \\propto (\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}_p) - \\boldsymbol{U}_p)$. For a force-free particle, this model would incorrectly predict $\\boldsymbol{U}_p = \\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}_p)$, which implies zero slip velocity. Our result shows that the true slip velocity is non-zero and depends on the flow curvature ($\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}$) and particle size ($a$). Neglecting the Faxén correction leads to an overestimation of the particle's velocity and a failure to capture the particle lag. This can lead to significant errors in predicting particle trajectories, dispersion, and concentration distributions in non-uniform flows. Accurate models must incorporate sub-grid scale physics, such as the Faxén correction, to correctly represent the particle-fluid interaction.",

Considering only the interaction with the fluid, we have:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(m_p \\boldsymbol{v}_p) = -\\boldsymbol{F}_p $$\nThe rate of change of the total momentum of all particles is $\\sum_p \\frac{d}{dt}(m_p \\boldsymbol{v}_p) = -\\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p$.\n\nThe source term in the fluid momentum equation is the body-force density $\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) = \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p W(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon)$. The total force exerted on the fluid is the integral of this density over the entire domain. In discrete form, this is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{fluid, total}} = \\sum_i \\boldsymbol{f}_i \\Delta V = \\sum_i \\left( \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\right) \\Delta V $$\nBy swapping the order of summation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{fluid, total}} = \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p \\left( \\sum_i W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V \\right) $$\nFor global linear momentum conservation of the particle-fluid system, the total force on the system must be zero (in the absence of external forces or boundary fluxes). The total force is the sum of the force on the fluid and the forces on all particles: $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{total}} = \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{fluid, total}} + \\sum_p (-\\boldsymbol{F}_p) = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\nThis gives:\n$$ \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p \\left( \\sum_i W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V \\right) - \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis equality must hold for any arbitrary set of particles and forces $\\boldsymbol{F}_p$. This is only possible if the term multiplying each $\\boldsymbol{F}_p$ is unity. Therefore, for each particle $p$, the kernel must satisfy the discrete partition-of-unity condition:\n$$ \\sum_i W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V = 1 $$\nThis is the zeroth-moment condition on the discrete kernel.\n\n**(b) Torque Conservation about Each Particle Location**\nThe force from particle $p$ is distributed on the grid. The torque exerted by this distributed force on the fluid, calculated about the particle's own position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$, is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p \\to f, \\text{about } \\boldsymbol{x}_p} = \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) \\times (\\boldsymbol{f}_{i,p} \\Delta V) $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{f}_{i,p} = \\boldsymbol{F}_p W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon)$ is the force density at node $i$ from particle $p$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p \\to f, \\text{about } \\boldsymbol{x}_p} = \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) \\times \\left( \\boldsymbol{F}_p W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V \\right) $$\nUsing the vector identity $(\\boldsymbol{a} \\times (\\boldsymbol{b} \\times \\boldsymbol{c}))$, we can factor out $\\boldsymbol{F}_p$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p \\to f, \\text{about } \\boldsymbol{x}_p} = \\left( \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V \\right) \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_p $$\nThe reaction force on the particle is $-\\boldsymbol{F}_p$, acting at position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$. The torque this force exerts on the particle about its own position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$ is $(\\boldsymbol{x}_p - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) \\times (-\\boldsymbol{F}_p) = \\boldsymbol{0}$. For conservation of angular momentum exchange, the particle should not exert a net torque on the fluid about its own location (i.e., no self-induced torque). Thus, we require $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p \\to f, \\text{about } \\boldsymbol{x}_p} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. Since this must hold for any force $\\boldsymbol{F}_p$, the vector multiplying it must be zero:\n$$ \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis is the discrete first-moment condition. It ensures that the center of the distributed force on the grid coincides with the particle's position.\n\n**(c) Discrete Power Consistency**\nThis concerns the energy exchange between the particles and the fluid via the numerical coupling. The rate of work done by the particle-induced forces on the fluid (power transferred to the fluid) is:\n$$ P_{p \\to f} = \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{f}_i \\Delta V) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_i = \\sum_i \\left( \\left( \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\right) \\Delta V \\right) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_i $$\nSwapping the order of summations:\n$$ P_{p \\to f} = \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p \\cdot \\left( \\sum_i \\boldsymbol{u}_i W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p; \\varepsilon) \\Delta V \\right) $$\nThe term in the parentheses is precisely the definition of the fluid velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}_p$ interpolated to the particle's location. Therefore:\n$$ P_{p \\to f} = \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_p $$\nThis shows that if the same kernel $W$ is used for interpolation and spreading in the forms defined, there is an exact balance between the power injected into the Eulerian field and the power evaluated using the Lagrangian forces and their corresponding interpolated velocities. This property is also known as the operators for spreading and interpolation being adjoint to each other with respect to the natural inner products on the Eulerian and Lagrangian spaces. This prevents the numerical scheme itself from creating or destroying energy.\n\n**Analysis of Kernel Width $\\varepsilon$**\nThe kernel width $\\varepsilon$ relative to the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ is a critical parameter.\n\n_Limiting behavior as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ (Point Coupling):_\nThe kernel approaches a Dirac delta function. A particle interacts with only the nearest grid cell/node.\n- **Conservation**: The discrete partition-of-unity condition $\\sum_i W \\Delta V = 1$ is poorly satisfied for general particle positions. As a particle crosses a cell boundary, the force rapidly shifts from one node to another, causing jumps in the total force on the grid if the sum is not exactly $1$. This violates momentum conservation.\n- **Stability**: This approach is notoriously prone to numerical instabilities. The particle and the single grid node it interacts with can form an unstable oscillator, exchanging momentum at high frequencies, leading to unphysical grid-scale oscillations.\n- **Accuracy**: While it seems to provide perfect localization, the strong grid-dependence and induced oscillations are a severe source of numerical error, making it less accurate in practice.\n\n_Limiting behavior for large $\\varepsilon \\gg \\Delta x$:_\nThe kernel is spread across many grid cells.\n- **Conservation**: As $\\varepsilon/\\Delta x$ increases, the discrete sum $\\sum_i W \\Delta V$ becomes a better approximation of the continuous integral $\\int W dV$. If the kernel is normalized such that $\\int W dV = 1$, then the discrete partition-of-unity will be satisfied with smaller error. This improves momentum conservation. Similar arguments apply to the first-moment condition for torque.\n- **Stability**: The spreading of forces acts as a low-pass filter, damping high-wavenumber (grid-scale) features. This significantly enhances numerical stability.\n- **Accuracy**: This comes at a high cost to accuracy. The physical interaction between a particle and the fluid is local. Spreading the force over a large region is unphysical, as it smears out the details of the flow modification near the particle. It degrades the resolution of the coupling and can introduce artificial effects, such as an artificially large apparent added mass, because a larger volume of fluid is accelerated by the particle's force.\n\n_Intermediate $\\varepsilon$ (e.g., $\\varepsilon \\approx 2\\Delta x$ to $4\\Delta x$):_\nThis represents a compromise.\n- **Conservation, Stability, Accuracy**: A kernel with support over a few cells is wide enough to ensure a smooth transfer of force as a particle moves across the grid, which greatly improves conservation and stability compared to point coupling. At the same time, it is narrow enough to keep the interaction reasonably localized, preserving more of the near-field hydrodynamic features than a very wide kernel. This trade-off generally leads to the most accurate and robust overall simulation results for a given grid resolution.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Global linear momentum conservation in the fully discrete particle–fluid system is ensured if the force-spreading weights satisfy a discrete partition-of-unity, i.e., for every particle position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$, one has $\\sum_i W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i-\\boldsymbol{x}_p;\\varepsilon)\\,\\Delta V = 1$, and if velocity interpolation uses the same kernel, the spreading and interpolation are adjoint with respect to the Eulerian–Lagrangian inner products, yielding an exact discrete power balance $\\sum_i \\boldsymbol{f}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_i\\,\\Delta V = \\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_p$.**\n- The first part, regarding the condition for linear momentum conservation, matches our derivation (a).\n- The second part, regarding the power balance, matches our derivation (c). It correctly identifies that using the same kernel leads to an adjoint relationship and provides the correct power balance equation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Decreasing the kernel width $\\varepsilon$ (e.g., restricting support to approximately a single grid cell) always increases the accuracy of the hydrodynamic coupling by reducing spatial smearing, without compromising stability or discrete conservation.**\n- The claim that it \"always increases the accuracy\" is false. While reducing smearing is desirable, making $\\varepsilon$ too small introduces severe numerical artifacts (grid-scale oscillations).\n- The claim \"without compromising stability or discrete conservation\" is definitively false. As shown in our analysis, small $\\varepsilon$ leads to poor conservation properties and significant numerical instability.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Increasing the kernel width $\\varepsilon$ reduces aliasing and quadrature error in the discrete partition-of-unity for off-grid particle positions and generally improves robustness of conservation and stability; however, excessively large $\\varepsilon$ over-smooths the coupling, degrades resolution of near-field hydrodynamics, and can effectively increase the apparent added-mass of the particle, so an intermediate width on the order of a few grid spacings is typically most accurate.**\n- This statement accurately summarizes the trade-offs associated with the choice of $\\varepsilon$, as detailed in our analysis. It correctly identifies the benefits of larger $\\varepsilon$ (better conservation, stability, reduced aliasing) and the drawbacks (over-smoothing, loss of resolution, artificial added mass). It correctly concludes that an intermediate width is usually optimal.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For torque conservation about the particle location, it is sufficient that the kernel be even (symmetric) in space, i.e., $W(\\boldsymbol{r};\\varepsilon)=W(-\\boldsymbol{r};\\varepsilon)$, regardless of the grid and discretization.**\n- As derived in (b), torque conservation requires the discrete first moment to be zero: $\\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) \\Delta V = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n- For a general particle position $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$, the set of grid vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p\\}$ is not symmetric about the origin. Therefore, even if $W(\\boldsymbol{r})$ is a symmetric function, the sum is not guaranteed to be zero. Symmetry of $W$ guarantees the *continuous* first moment $\\int \\boldsymbol{r}W(\\boldsymbol{r})d\\boldsymbol{r}$ is zero, but not the discrete sum for arbitrary sampling points. The phrase \"regardless of the grid and discretization\" makes the statement false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. On a uniform Cartesian grid with periodic boundaries, if the kernel satisfies both a discrete partition-of-unity and a discrete first-moment condition $\\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i-\\boldsymbol{x}_p)\\,W(\\boldsymbol{x}_i-\\boldsymbol{x}_p;\\varepsilon)\\,\\Delta V = \\boldsymbol{0}$ for all $\\boldsymbol{x}_p$, then at each time step (up to time-integration error) the total fluid momentum change equals the sum of particle forces and the net torque on the fluid due to particle forces equals the sum of particle torques, independent of the particle positions.**\n- The first claim, regarding momentum, is a direct consequence of the discrete partition-of-unity, as shown in (a). It ensures the total force on the fluid is $\\sum_p \\boldsymbol{F}_p$.\n- The second claim, regarding torque, is also correct. Let the net torque on the fluid be calculated about an arbitrary origin $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$: $\\boldsymbol{T}_{\\text{fluid}} = \\sum_i (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_0) \\times (\\boldsymbol{f}_i \\Delta V)$. By substituting $\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_0 = (\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_p) + (\\boldsymbol{x}_p - \\boldsymbol{x}_0)$ and applying both the partition-of-unity and the first-moment conditions, we can show that $\\boldsymbol{T}_{\\text{fluid}} = \\sum_p (\\boldsymbol{x}_p - \\boldsymbol{x}_0) \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_p$. The RHS is the sum of torques due to forces $\\boldsymbol{F}_p$ about the origin $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$, which is what \"sum of particle torques\" means here. The statement confirms that if the kernel's discrete moments are correct, the total force and torque are correctly transferred to the grid, ensuring global conservation laws are satisfied at the semi-discrete level.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**",
