            "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze the stability of the $\\theta$-method for the linear scalar test equation $u^{\\prime}(t) = \\lambda u(t)$. The $\\theta$-method approximates the differential equation using a finite difference scheme.\n\nFirst, we derive the one-step recurrence relation for the $\\theta$-method. The general form of the method is given by:\n$$ \\frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\\Delta t} = (1-\\theta) f(t^n, u^n) + \\theta f(t^{n+1}, u^{n+1}) $$\nFor the given test equation, the right-hand side is $f(t,u) = \\lambda u(t)$. Substituting this into the scheme, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\\Delta t} = (1-\\theta) (\\lambda u^{n}) + \\theta (\\lambda u^{n+1}) $$\nOur goal is to find the amplification factor $G(z)$ such that $u^{n+1} = G(z) u^{n}$, where $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$. To do this, we rearrange the equation to solve for $u^{n+1}$:\n$$ u^{n+1} - u^{n} = \\Delta t (1-\\theta) \\lambda u^{n} + \\Delta t \\theta \\lambda u^{n+1} $$\n$$ u^{n+1} - \\theta \\lambda \\Delta t u^{n+1} = u^{n} + (1-\\theta) \\lambda \\Delta t u^{n} $$\n$$ u^{n+1} (1 - \\theta \\lambda \\Delta t) = u^{n} (1 + (1-\\theta) \\lambda \\Delta t) $$\nSubstituting $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$:\n$$ u^{n+1} (1 - \\theta z) = u^{n} (1 + (1-\\theta) z) $$\nThis gives the one-step recurrence relation:\n$$ u^{n+1} = \\left( \\frac{1 + (1-\\theta)z}{1 - \\theta z} \\right) u^{n} $$\nThe amplification factor is therefore:\n$$ G(z) = \\frac{1 + (1-\\theta)z}{1 - \\theta z} $$\nThe scheme is defined as absolutely stable for values of $z$ where the magnitude of the amplification factor is not greater than one, i.e., $|G(z)| \\le 1$.\n\nWe are given $\\lambda = -100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is a real and negative constant. Since the time step $\\Delta t$ must be positive, the parameter $z = \\lambda \\Delta t = -100 \\Delta t$ is a real, negative number. Let's denote $z$ by $x$, where $x  0$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{1 + (1-\\theta)x}{1 - \\theta x} \\right| \\le 1 $$\nSince $x$ is real, this is equivalent to:\n$$ (1 + (1-\\theta)x)^2 \\le (1 - \\theta x)^2 $$\n$$ 1 + 2(1-\\theta)x + (1-\\theta)^2 x^2 \\le 1 - 2\\theta x + \\theta^2 x^2 $$\n$$ 2(1-\\theta)x + (1-2\\theta+\\theta^2)x^2 \\le -2\\theta x + \\theta^2 x^2 $$\nAfter simplifying and collecting terms:\n$$ 2x + (1-2\\theta)x^2 \\le 0 $$\n$$ 2x \\le (2\\theta-1)x^2 $$\nSince $x  0$, we can divide by $x$ and must reverse the inequality sign:\n$$ 2 \\ge (2\\theta-1)x $$\nThis is the general stability condition for the $\\theta$-method on the negative real axis. We now analyze this condition for the three specified values of $\\theta \\in \\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\theta = 0$ (Explicit Forward Euler method)\nThe stability condition becomes:\n$$ 2 \\ge (2(0)-1)x \\implies 2 \\ge -x \\implies x \\ge -2 $$\nSince $x = \\lambda \\Delta t = -100 \\Delta t$, we have:\n$$ -100 \\Delta t \\ge -2 $$\n$$ \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe largest time step for stability is $\\Delta t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.02000\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nCase 2: $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ (Implicit Crank-Nicolson method)\nThe stability condition becomes:\n$$ 2 \\ge (2(\\frac{1}{2})-1)x \\implies 2 \\ge (1-1)x \\implies 2 \\ge 0 $$\nThis inequality is always true, independent of the value of $x$. Thus, the method is stable for all $x  0$. This implies that the method is unconditionally stable for any time step $\\Delta t > 0$. The largest time step is therefore $+\\infty$.\n\nCase 3: $\\theta = 1$ (Implicit Backward Euler method)\nThe stability condition becomes:\n$$ 2 \\ge (2(1)-1)x \\implies 2 \\ge x $$\nSince we are considering $x = \\lambda \\Delta t  0$, the condition $x \\le 2$ is always satisfied. This method is also unconditionally stable for any time step $\\Delta t > 0$. The largest time step is therefore $+\\infty$.\n\nInterpretation of the results:\nThe problem with $\\lambda = -100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ represents a stiff ordinary differential equation, where the characteristic time scale of the decaying solution, $\\tau = 1/|\\lambda| = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, is very short.\n\nFor $\\theta=0$ (Forward Euler, an explicit method), the stability requires $\\Delta t \\le 2/|\\lambda| = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This time step limit is dictated by stability, not accuracy, and is of the same order as the system's time scale. For stiff systems, this is highly restrictive, as one is forced to use very small time steps even after the fast transient has decayed and the solution changes slowly. The method's stability region on the negative real axis is the interval $[-2, 0]$.\n\nFor $\\theta=\\frac{1}{2}$ (Crank-Nicolson, an implicit method), the scheme is A-stable, meaning its stability region contains the entire left half of the complex plane. As a result, it is unconditionally stable for any $\\lambda  0$, and the choice of $\\Delta t$ is limited only by accuracy considerations. However, for large negative $z$, the amplification factor approaches $-1$, i.e., $\\lim_{z\\to-\\infty} G(z) = -1$. This means that rapidly decaying modes are not numerically damped out but persist as spurious, undamped oscillations. This lack of dissipation for stiff components is a significant drawback.\n\nFor $\\theta=1$ (Backward Euler, an implicit method), the scheme is also A-stable and thus unconditionally stable. Crucially, it is also L-stable, meaning that $\\lim_{z\\to-\\infty} G(z) = 0$. For this method, $G(z) = 1/(1-z)$, which tends to $0$ as $z \\to -\\infty$ along the real axis. This strong dissipative property ensures that stiff components (rapidly decaying modes) are quickly and effectively damped out in the numerical solution, which prevents spurious oscillations and correctly models the physics of stiff systems. Therefore, Backward Euler is generally preferred over Crank-Nicolson for very stiff problems.\n\nIn summary, the explicit Forward Euler method is impractical for stiff problems due to its severe stability constraint. Both implicit methods, Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler, overcome this stability limit, but the L-stable Backward Euler method is superior in its ability to damp high-frequency numerical error, a critical feature for robust CFD simulations of stiff phenomena.",
