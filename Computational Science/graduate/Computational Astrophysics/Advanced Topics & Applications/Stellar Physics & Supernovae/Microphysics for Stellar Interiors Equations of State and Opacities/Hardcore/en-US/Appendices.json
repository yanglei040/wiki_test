            "problem": "Consider a solar-like mixture with mass fractions $X=0.70$ for hydrogen, $Y=0.28$ for helium, and $Z=0.02$ for all heavier elements (metals). Assume the gas is described by the ideal equation of state (EOS), and define the mean molecular weight per particle $\\mu$ by the relation $P=\\rho k_{B} T / (\\mu m_{u})$, where $P$ is the gas pressure, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $T$ is the temperature, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $m_{u}$ is the atomic mass constant. Define the electron mean molecular weight $\\mu_{e}$ by $n_{e}=\\rho/(\\mu_{e} m_{u})$, where $n_{e}$ is the free electron number density.

The provided mass fractions sum to $1$ ($0.70+0.28+0.02=1.00$), ensuring self-consistency. The representation of the metal component by a single species (oxygen) is a common and valid simplification in astrophysical models. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and free from scientific flaws or ambiguities.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of Expressions**\n\nThe mean molecular weight $\\mu$ is defined by the ideal gas law, $P = n_{total} k_B T$, where $n_{total}$ is the total number density of all particles (atoms, nuclei, electrons). The given EOS, $P = \\frac{\\rho k_B T}{\\mu m_u}$, implies that $n_{total} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\mu m_u}$. The number of particles per unit mass is therefore $N_{total} = \\frac{n_{total}}{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{\\mu m_u}$.\n\nThe total number density of particles can be written as the sum of the number densities of heavy particles (atoms or nuclei), $n_I$, and free electrons, $n_e$:\n$n_{total} = n_I + n_e$.\nDividing by the mass density $\\rho$, we get the number of particles per unit mass:\n$\\frac{n_{total}}{\\rho} = \\frac{n_I}{\\rho} + \\frac{n_e}{\\rho}$.\nUsing the definitions of $\\mu$ and $\\mu_e$, we can write this as:\n$\\frac{1}{\\mu m_u} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I m_u} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_e m_u}$, where we have defined a mean molecular weight for the heavy particles, $\\mu_I$.\nThis simplifies to a key relation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_e} $$\n\nFor a component $i$ with mass fraction $X_i$ and atomic mass number $A_i$, the number density of its nuclei is $n_i = \\frac{X_i \\rho}{A_i m_u}$. The total number density of heavy particles (atoms or nuclei) is $n_I = \\sum_i n_i$.\nThus, $\\frac{n_I}{\\rho} = \\sum_i \\frac{X_i}{A_i m_u} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I m_u}$. This gives the expression for $\\mu_I$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} = \\sum_i \\frac{X_i}{A_i} $$\nThis expression is valid for both the neutral and fully ionized cases, as it only counts the number of nuclei (or atoms). For our mixture of hydrogen ($H$), helium ($He$), and metals ($Z$), we have:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} = \\frac{X}{A_H} + \\frac{Y}{A_{He}} + \\frac{Z}{A_Z} $$\nWe will use the standard approximations for the atomic mass numbers of hydrogen ($A_H \\approx 1$) and helium ($A_{He} \\approx 4$). The problem specifies $A_Z=16$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} \\approx X + \\frac{Y}{4} + \\frac{Z}{16} $$\n\nNow we derive the expressions for the four requested quantities.\n\n**1. Mean Molecular Weight in the Neutral Limit ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}$)**\nIn the neutral limit, there are no free electrons, so $n_e=0$. From the definition $n_e = \\rho/(\\mu_e m_u)$, this implies $1/\\mu_e = 0$.\nThe total number of particles consists only of neutral atoms. The heavy particle mean molecular weight $\\mu_I$ thus equals the total mean molecular weight $\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} = X + \\frac{Y}{4} + \\frac{Z}{16} $$\n\n**2. Electron Mean Molecular Weight in the Neutral Limit ($\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}}$)**\nAs established, $n_e=0$ in the neutral limit. This means that the number of free electrons per unit mass is zero. Formally, $1/\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}}=0$, which implies that $\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}}$ is infinite.\n$$ \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}} \\to \\infty $$\n\n**3. Electron Mean Molecular Weight in the Fully Ionized Limit ($\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}$)**\nIn the fully ionized limit, each nucleus of species $i$ with nuclear charge $Z_i$ contributes $Z_i$ free electrons. The number of free electrons per unit mass contributed by species $i$ is $Z_i \\frac{X_i}{A_i m_u}$.\nThe total number of free electrons per unit mass is $\\frac{n_e}{\\rho} = \\sum_i \\frac{X_i Z_i}{A_i m_u}$.\nUsing the definition $\\frac{n_e}{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_e m_u}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}} = \\sum_i \\frac{X_i Z_i}{A_i} $$\nFor our mixture, with $Z_H=1$, $Z_{He}=2$, and $Z_Z=8$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}} = \\frac{X Z_H}{A_H} + \\frac{Y Z_{He}}{A_{He}} + \\frac{Z Z_Z}{A_Z} \\approx \\frac{X(1)}{1} + \\frac{Y(2)}{4} + \\frac{Z(8)}{16} = X + \\frac{Y}{2} + \\frac{Z}{2} $$\nSince $X+Y+Z=1$, this can be simplified:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}} = X + \\frac{1-X}{2} = \\frac{2X+1-X}{2} = \\frac{1+X}{2} $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{2}{1+X} $$\n\n**4. Mean Molecular Weight in the Fully Ionized Limit ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$)**\nUsing the general relation $\\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_e}$, we can combine our results for $\\mu_I$ (which is $1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}$) and $\\mu_{e, \\mathrm{ionized}}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_I} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}} = \\left(X + \\frac{Y}{4} + \\frac{Z}{16}\\right) + \\left(X + \\frac{Y}{2} + \\frac{Z}{2}\\right) $$\nCombining terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}} = 2X + \\frac{3Y}{4} + \\frac{9Z}{16} $$\nThis expression correctly accounts for both nuclei and free electrons.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the values: $X=0.70$, $Y=0.28$, $Z=0.02$. We also use $A_H=1$, $A_{He}=4$, $A_Z=16$, $Z_H=1$, $Z_{He}=2$, and $Z_Z=8$.\n\n- **$\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}$**:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}} = 0.70 + \\frac{0.28}{4} + \\frac{0.02}{16} = 0.70 + 0.07 + 0.00125 = 0.77125 $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}} = \\frac{1}{0.77125} \\approx 1.296596... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}} \\approx 1.297$.\n\n- **$\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$**:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}} = 2(0.70) + \\frac{3(0.28)}{4} + \\frac{9(0.02)}{16} = 1.40 + \\frac{0.84}{4} + \\frac{0.18}{16} = 1.40 + 0.21 + 0.01125 = 1.62125 $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{1}{1.62125} \\approx 0.616808... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}} \\approx 0.6168$.\n\n- **$\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}}$**:\nAs derived, this value is infinite.\n$$ \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}} = \\infty $$\n\n- **$\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}}$**:\nUsing the simplified expression:\n$$ \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{2}{1+X} = \\frac{2}{1+0.70} = \\frac{2}{1.7} \\approx 1.17647... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}} \\approx 1.176$.\n\nThe final numerical values reported in the specified order $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{neutral}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{ionized}}, \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{neutral}}, \\mu_{e,\\mathrm{ionized}})$ are $(1.297, 0.6168, \\infty, 1.176)$.",

The plasma consists of fully ionized helium nuclei, so each ion has a charge $q_i = Ze$, where $Z$ is the charge number and $e$ is the elementary charge.

A fundamental assumption of DH theory is that the system is weakly coupled. This means that the potential energy of interaction between particles is much smaller than their kinetic energy.\n\nThe Coulomb coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ is the precise measure of this ratio. The condition for the validity of the Debye-Hückel theory is $\\Gamma \\ll 1$.\n\nIn the case of the specified helium plasma, we calculated $\\Gamma \\approx 2.66$. This value is not much less than $1$; in fact, it is greater than $1$. This indicates that the plasma is not weakly coupled. Instead, it is in a moderately coupled regime, where the average Coulomb potential energy between ions is more than twice their average thermal kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, because the condition $\\Gamma \\ll 1$ is strongly violated, the basic assumptions of the Debye–Hückel theory are not met. The theory is not applicable for describing ionic correlations under these plasma conditions. More advanced theoretical models or numerical simulations, such as Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics, would be required for an accurate description of the plasma's thermodynamic properties.",
