The value $R_m=3$ is a realistic mirror ratio for such devices.\n-   **Structure and Vagueness**: The problem is clearly structured into three distinct parts. There are no ambiguous or undefined terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Critical Pitch Angle**\n\nThe motion of the charged particle is governed by the conservation of two quantities: its total kinetic energy, $E$, and its magnetic moment, $\\mu$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2)$$\nwhere $v_{\\parallel}$ and $v_{\\perp}$ are the components of the particle's velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line, respectively. Since $E$ is conserved and the mass $m$ is constant, the particle's total speed $v = \\sqrt{v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2}$ is also constant.\n\nThe first adiabatic invariant, or magnetic moment, is given by:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{2B}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Conservation of $\\mu$ implies that as the particle moves into a region of stronger magnetic field, its perpendicular kinetic energy increases.\n\nLet's denote the quantities at the midplane ($z=0$) with a subscript $0$. At the midplane, the magnetic field is at its minimum, $B(0) = B_0$. The velocity components are related to the total speed $v$ and the pitch angle $\\alpha$ by:\n$$v_{\\perp 0} = v \\sin(\\alpha)$$\n$$v_{\\parallel 0} = v \\cos(\\alpha)$$\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, we can relate the perpendicular velocity at any point $z$ to its value at the midplane:\n$$\\frac{mv_{\\perp}(z)^2}{2B(z)} = \\frac{mv_{\\perp 0}^2}{2B_0}$$\n$$v_{\\perp}(z)^2 = v_{\\perp 0}^2 \\frac{B(z)}{B_0} = v^2 \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\frac{B(z)}{B_0}$$\n\nUsing the conservation of total energy (and thus total speed $v$), we can find the parallel velocity at point $z$:\n$$v_{\\parallel}(z)^2 = v^2 - v_{\\perp}(z)^2 = v^2 - v^2 \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\frac{B(z)}{B_0}$$\n$$v_{\\parallel}(z)^2 = v^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{B(z)}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)\\right)$$\n\nA particle is \"mirrored\" or reflected at a turning point $z_{turn}$ where its parallel motion reverses. At this point, $v_{\\parallel}(z_{turn}) = 0$. This gives the mirroring condition:\n$$0 = v^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{B(z_{turn})}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)\\right)$$\n$$1 = \\frac{B(z_{turn})}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)$$\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{B_0}{B(z_{turn})}$$\n\nA particle is trapped within the mirror if it reflects before escaping from the high-field region at the \"throat\" of the mirror, where the magnetic field is maximum, $B_{\\max}$. This means a turning point must exist where $B(z_{turn}) \\leq B_{\\max}$.\nSubstituting the mirroring condition into this inequality:\n$$\\frac{B_0}{\\sin^2(\\alpha)} \\leq B_{\\max}$$\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq \\frac{B_0}{B_{\\max}}$$\nUsing the definition of the mirror ratio, $R_m = B_{\\max}/B_0$, the condition for a particle to be trapped is:\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nParticles that do not satisfy this condition will escape, and their pitch angles define the \"loss cone\". The critical pitch angle, $\\alpha_c$, is the boundary of this loss cone. It corresponds to the minimum pitch angle a particle at the midplane can have and still be trapped. Therefore, it is defined by the equality:\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is an angle, $\\alpha_c$ must be in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$. Taking the square root gives:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha_c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_m}}$$\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_m}}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Value of the Critical Pitch Angle**\n\nGiven the mirror ratio $R_m = 3$, we can compute the numerical value of $\\alpha_c$.\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the argument:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.577350269...$$\nNow, we find the arcsin of this value in radians:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx \\arcsin(0.577350269...) \\approx 0.6154797... \\text{ rad}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the critical pitch angle is:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.6155 \\text{ rad}$$\n\n**Part 3: Fraction of Trapped Particles**\n\nThe problem states that the plasma at the midplane is a stationary isotropic Maxwellian. The term \"isotropic\" means the velocity distribution function is independent of direction; it depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, $v$. Consequently, the fraction of particles within a certain range of pitch angles is determined solely by the solid angle corresponding to that range, divided by the total solid angle of $4\\pi$ steradians.\n\nThe pitch angle $\\alpha$ is the polar angle in a spherical coordinate system for velocity space. The differential solid angle is $d\\Omega = \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha \\, d\\phi$.\n\nParticles are trapped if their pitch angle $\\alpha$ at the midplane satisfies $\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq 1/R_m$. This is equivalent to $\\alpha_c \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\pi - \\alpha_c$.\n\nThe solid angle of the trapped region, $\\Omega_{trapped}$, is found by integrating over the range of trapped angles:\n$$\\Omega_{trapped} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ gives $2\\pi$. The integral over $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha = [-\\cos(\\alpha)]_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} = -\\cos(\\pi - \\alpha_c) - (-\\cos(\\alpha_c))$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(\\pi - x) = -\\cos(x)$, this becomes:\n$$-(-\\cos(\\alpha_c)) + \\cos(\\alpha_c) = 2\\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\nSo, the solid angle for trapped particles is:\n$$\\Omega_{trapped} = 2\\pi \\times 2\\cos(\\alpha_c) = 4\\pi\\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\nThe fraction of trapped particles, $F_{trapped}$, is the ratio of the trapped solid angle to the total solid angle ($4\\pi$):\n$$F_{trapped} = \\frac{\\Omega_{trapped}}{\\Omega_{total}} = \\frac{4\\pi\\cos(\\alpha_c)}{4\\pi} = \\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\n\nTo find a numerical value, we first express $\\cos(\\alpha_c)$ in terms of $R_m$. Using the identity $\\cos^2(\\alpha_c) + \\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1$ and the result from Part 1, $\\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1/R_m$:\n$$\\cos^2(\\alpha_c) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nSince $\\alpha_c$ is in the first quadrant, $\\cos(\\alpha_c)$ is positive.\n$$\\cos(\\alpha_c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nSo, the fraction of trapped particles is:\n$$F_{trapped} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nFor $R_m = 3$:\n$$F_{trapped} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$F_{trapped} \\approx \\sqrt{0.666666...} \\approx 0.81649658...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction of trapped particles is:\n$$F_{trapped} \\approx 0.8165$$\n\nThe final answers for Part 2 and Part 3 are the numerical values for $\\alpha_c$ and $F_{trapped}$, respectively.\n$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.6155$ radians.\n$F_{trapped} \\approx 0.8165$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the bounce motion of a deeply trapped ion in a parabolic magnetic mirror, calculation of its bounce period, and verification of the adiabatic approximation.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- On-axis magnetic field: $B(s) = B_0\\left(1+\\beta s^2\\right)$\n- $s$: arc length along the field line from the minimum at $s=0$.\n- $B_0$: minimum magnetic field magnitude.\n- $\\beta$: a positive constant.\n- Particle: Singly ionized deuterium ion (D$^+$), with charge $q=+e$ and mass $m = 2m_p$.\n- Total kinetic energy: $E$.\n- Initial condition: The ion is deeply trapped with a pitch angle of $90^\\circ$ at $s=0$.\n- Numerical values: $E=10\\,\\text{keV}$, $B_0=2\\,\\text{T}$, $\\beta=0.1\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$, $m_p=1.672\\,621\\,923\\,69\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}$, $e=1.602\\,176\\,634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established principles of plasma physics, specifically guiding-center theory and adiabatic invariants. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and the given numerical values are physically plausible for a magnetic confinement scenario. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation based on two fundamental principles: conservation of energy and the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total kinetic energy $E$ of the ion is constant, as the Lorentz force does no work. It is the sum of the kinetic energy parallel ($E_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($E_\\perp$) to the magnetic field lines:\n    $$E = E_\\parallel + E_\\perp = \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2 = \\text{constant}$$\n    Here, $v_\\parallel$ and $v_\\perp$ are the components of the ion's velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, respectively. Note that $v_\\parallel = \\frac{ds}{dt}$.\n\n2.  **Adiabatic Invariance of the Magnetic Moment**: For motion in a magnetic field that changes slowly in space and time compared to the fast gyromotion, the magnetic moment $\\mu$ is an adiabatic invariant:\n    $$\\mu = \\frac{E_\\perp}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2}{B(s)} = \\text{constant}$$\n    This assumption's validity will be checked at the end.\n\nFrom the invariance of $\\mu$, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy as $E_\\perp(s) = \\mu B(s)$. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation gives:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\mu B(s)$$\nThis equation describes the dynamics of the guiding center along the magnetic field line. We can rearrange it to find the parallel kinetic energy:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 = E - \\mu B(s)$$\nThe term $V_{eff}(s) = \\mu B(s)$ acts as an effective potential energy for the parallel motion. The force on the guiding center along the field line, known as the mirror force, is the negative gradient of this potential:\n$$F_\\parallel = -\\frac{d}{ds}V_{eff}(s) = -\\mu \\frac{dB}{ds}$$\nThe equation of motion for the parallel component is therefore:\n$$m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\mu \\frac{dB}{ds}$$\n\nTo determine the constant $\\mu$, we use the initial conditions. The problem states that the ion has a pitch angle of $90^\\circ$ at the magnetic minimum ($s=0$). A pitch angle of $90^\\circ$ means the velocity vector is entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, at $s=0$, $v_\\parallel(0) = 0$. Consequently, the parallel kinetic energy $E_\\parallel(0) = 0$. From the conservation of energy, the total energy is equal to the perpendicular energy at this point: $E=E_\\perp(0)$.\nThe magnetic field at this point is $B(0) = B_0$. We can now fix the value of the magnetic moment:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{E_\\perp(0)}{B(0)} = \\frac{E}{B_0}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu$ and the given form of $B(s)$ into the equation of motion:\n$$B(s) = B_0\\left(1+\\beta s^2\\right) \\implies \\frac{dB}{ds} = B_0(2\\beta s) = 2\\beta B_0 s$$\n$$m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\left(\\frac{E}{B_0}\\right)(2\\beta B_0 s) = -2\\beta E s$$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \\left(\\frac{2\\beta E}{m}\\right)s = 0$$\nThis is the canonical form of the equation for simple harmonic motion, $\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \\omega_b^2 s = 0$. This demonstrates that for small-amplitude oscillations around $s=0$, the ion's bounce motion is approximately harmonic.\n\nBy comparing the two equations, we identify the square of the bounce angular frequency $\\omega_b$:\n$$\\omega_b^2 = \\frac{2\\beta E}{m}$$\nThus, the bounce angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\beta E}{m}}$$\nThe bounce period $\\tau_b$ is related to the angular frequency by $\\tau_b = 2\\pi/\\omega_b$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau_b$. First, we convert all given quantities to SI units.\n-   Deuteron mass $m$: $m = 2m_p = 2 \\times (1.672\\,621\\,923\\,69 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}) = 3.345\\,243\\,847\\,38 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}$.\n-   Ion energy $E$: $E = 10\\,\\text{keV} = 10 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{eV} = 10^4 \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}) = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{J}$.\n-   Constant $\\beta = 0.1\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$.\n\nWe calculate the bounce angular frequency $\\omega_b$:\n$$\\omega_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (0.1\\,\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{J})}{3.345\\,243\\,847\\,38 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}}}$$\n$$\\omega_b \\approx \\sqrt{9.578\\,84 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 3.094\\,97 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nThe bounce period $\\tau_b$ is:\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_b} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3.094\\,97 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.030\\,14 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{s}$$\nConverting to microseconds and rounding to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\tau_b \\approx 20.3014\\,\\mu\\text{s} \\approx 20.3\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\n\nFinally, we must verify the validity of the adiabatic approximation. This requires that the gyromotion be much faster than the bounce motion, i.e., $\\omega_c \\gg \\omega_b$, where $\\omega_c$ is the ion cyclotron (gyro) angular frequency. We calculate $\\omega_c$ at the minimum magnetic field $B_0=2\\,\\text{T}$:\n$$\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|B_0}{m} = \\frac{e B_0}{m}$$\n$$\\omega_c = \\frac{(1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\times (2\\,\\text{T})}{3.345\\,243\\,847\\,38 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}} \\approx 9.578\\,84 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nWe now evaluate the ratio of the frequencies:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_b}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{3.094\\,97 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{rad/s}}{9.578\\,84 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{rad/s}} \\approx 0.00323$$\nSince $\\omega_b/\\omega_c \\approx 3.23 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1$, the bounce frequency is indeed much smaller than the gyrofrequency. This confirms that the two time scales are well separated, and the use of the adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is justified.\nThe initial pitch angle at $s=0$ is given as $\\alpha_0 = 90^\\circ$.\nThe final calculated bounce period is the required answer.",

The setup is a simplified but physically meaningful model.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a second-order ordinary differential equation for $f(\\alpha)$ (by substituting $J_{\\alpha}$ into the continuity equation) and two boundary conditions, one on the function $f(\\alpha)$ at $\\alpha=\\alpha_{c}$ and one on its first derivative $\\partial f/\\partial\\alpha$ at $\\alpha=\\pi/2$ (via $J_{\\alpha}$).

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A formal solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the pitch-angle flux $J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha)$ and then relating it to the distribution function gradient $\\partial f/\\partial\\alpha$. The starting point is the steady-state continuity equation in pitch-angle space, valid for $\\alpha\\in(\\alpha_{c},\\pi/2]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J_{\\alpha}}{\\partial\\alpha} = S_{0} $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the flux $J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha)$. We integrate this equation with respect to $\\alpha$ from some angle $\\alpha'$ to $\\pi/2$:\n$$ \\int_{\\alpha'}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\partial J_{\\alpha}}{\\partial\\alpha} \\, d\\alpha = \\int_{\\alpha'}^{\\pi/2} S_{0} \\, d\\alpha $$\n$$ J_{\\alpha}(\\pi/2) - J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha') = S_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha'\\right) $$\nLetting $\\alpha'$ be a general angle $\\alpha$ in the domain, we have:\n$$ J_{\\alpha}(\\pi/2) - J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha) = S_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right) $$\nThe problem states the boundary condition $J_{\\alpha}(\\pi/2) = 0$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$ 0 - J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha) = S_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right) $$\n$$ J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha) = -S_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the pitch-angle diffusive flux for any $\\alpha \\in (\\alpha_{c},\\pi/2]$. Now, we use the definition of the flux provided in the problem statement:\n$$ J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha) = -D_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha} $$\nwhere $D_{\\alpha\\alpha}$ is the constant diffusion coefficient. Equating the two expressions for $J_{\\alpha}(\\alpha)$:\n$$ -D_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha} = -S_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right) $$\nWe can now solve for the slope of the distribution function, $\\partial f/\\partial\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha} = \\frac{S_{0}}{D_{\\alpha\\alpha}} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right) $$\nThe problem asks specifically for the value of this slope at the loss cone edge, which corresponds to the limit as $\\alpha$ approaches $\\alpha_{c}$ from the trapped side, denoted $\\alpha=\\alpha_{c}^{+}$. We evaluate the expression for the slope at $\\alpha = \\alpha_{c}$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right|_{\\alpha=\\alpha_{c}^{+}} = \\frac{S_{0}}{D_{\\alpha\\alpha}} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha_{c}\\right) $$\nThis result represents the required slope in terms of the given parameters $D_{\\alpha\\alpha}$, $S_{0}$, and $\\alpha_{c}$. The second boundary condition, $f(\\alpha_{c}) = 0$, was not required to find the slope at that point, but it is necessary to determine the full distribution function $f(\\alpha)$ and ensures the consistency of the physical model. The positive value of the slope at the loss-cone edge is physically consistent with a distribution function that is zero at $\\alpha_c$ and increases into the trapped region, as expected for a system with a particle source in the trapped region and a sink at the boundary.",
