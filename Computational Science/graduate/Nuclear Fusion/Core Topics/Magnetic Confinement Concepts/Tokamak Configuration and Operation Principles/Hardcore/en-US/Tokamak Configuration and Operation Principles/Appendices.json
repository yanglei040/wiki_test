The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique solution. The given numerical values are physically realistic for a large tokamak. The problem is objective and free of ambiguities.\n\nThe safety factor, $q(r)$, is defined as the number of times a magnetic field line transits toroidally around the machine for every one transit poloidally.

For a large-aspect-ratio ($R_0 \\gg a$) tokamak with circular flux surfaces, this can be approximated as the ratio of the field line path lengths, scaled by the magnetic field components:\n$$q(r) \\approx \\frac{r B_{\\phi}}{R_0 B_p(r)}$$\nHere, $B_{\\phi}$ is the toroidal field, which is assumed to be uniform, and $R_0$ is the major radius.

The on-axis safety factor is $q(0) = C/2 \\approx 1.76$, and the edge safety factor is $q(a) = C \\approx 3.53$. The profile is monotonically increasing with radius since its derivative, $\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{2Cr}{a^2(2-(r/a)^2)^2}$, is positive for $r > 0$. This corresponds to a positive magnetic shear, $s = \\frac{r}{q}\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{2(r/a)^2}{2-(r/a)^2} > 0$.\n\n**Tearing-Mode Stability:** Tearing modes are resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that arise at rational flux surfaces, where $q(r) = m/n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. They lead to the formation of magnetic islands, which can degrade plasma confinement and potentially lead to disruptions. The stability of these modes is determined by the parameter $\\Delta'$, which depends on the equilibrium current profile. For the given parabolic current profile, classical tearing mode theory predicts that modes with poloidal mode number $m \\ge 2$ are unstable ($\\Delta' > 0$).\nOur calculations show the existence of the $q=2$ surface at $r_2 \\approx 0.2910 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and the $q=3$ surface at $r_3 \\approx 0.5445 \\, \\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, this plasma configuration is susceptible to the $m/n = 2/1$ and $m/n = 3/1$ tearing modes, among others. The $m/n=2/1$ mode is particularly deleterious as it can grow to a large amplitude and lock to small error fields, leading to major disruptions.\n\n**Resistive Mode Coupling:** The problem asks to discuss coupling between the $m/n = 2/1$ and $m/n = 3/2$ resonant surfaces. The $m/n = 2/1$ surface exists at $r_2$. The $m/n = 3/2$ surface would exist at the radius where $q(r) = 1.5$. However, the minimum value of the safety factor in this plasma is on axis, with $q(0) \\approx 1.76$. Since $q(r)$ is monotonically increasing, $q(r) \\ge 1.76$ for all $r \\in [0, a]$.\nThe critical implication is that the $q=1.5$ rational surface does not exist within this plasma. Consequently, the $m/n=3/2$ tearing mode cannot be excited as a primary instability. As there is no $m/n=3/2$ island structure, there can be no direct, nonlinear coupling between the $m/n=2/1$ mode and the $m/n=3/2$ mode. Such coupling requires the resonant surfaces of the modes to be present in the plasma, ideally in close proximity. The absence of the $q=1.5$ surface completely precludes this interaction channel. The plasma dynamics would be governed by the unstable modes that do have rational surfaces, such as the $2/1$ and $3/1$ modes, without any direct interference from a non-existent $3/2$ mode.",
