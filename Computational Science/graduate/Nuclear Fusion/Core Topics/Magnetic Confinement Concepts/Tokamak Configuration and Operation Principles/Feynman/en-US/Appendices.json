Let the toroidal magnetic field be approximately uniform, denoted $B_{\\phi}$, and the poloidal magnetic field be generated by the net plasma current $I_p$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics, specifically the description of magnetic equilibria in tokamaks. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique solution. The given numerical values are physically realistic for a large tokamak. The problem is objective and free of ambiguities.\n\nThe safety factor, $q(r)$, is defined as the number of times a magnetic field line transits toroidally around the machine for every one transit poloidally. A magnetic field line is a curve $\\vec{l}(s)$ in space whose tangent at every point is parallel to the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$. This relationship is expressed by the differential equation $d\\vec{l} = \\alpha \\vec{B}$, where $\\alpha$ is a scalar proportionality factor.\n\nWe use a toroidal coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $r$ is the minor radius from the magnetic axis, $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle, and $\\phi$ is the toroidal angle. The major radius of the tokamak is $R$. For a circular cross-section, the position in cylindrical coordinates $(R', Z, \\phi)$ is given by $R' = R + r\\cos\\theta$ and $Z = r\\sin\\theta$.\n\nA differential element of length along a field line, $d\\vec{l}$, can be decomposed into its poloidal and toroidal components.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of the safety factor, $q(r)$. We begin with the geometric property that a magnetic field line is everywhere tangent to the magnetic field vector, $\\vec{B}$. In an axisymmetric tokamak, the magnetic field on a flux surface can be decomposed into its toroidal and poloidal components:\n$$\n\\vec{B} = B_{\\phi} \\hat{e}_{\\phi} + B_{\\theta} \\hat{e}_{\\theta}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{e}_{\\phi}$ and $\\hat{e}_{\\theta}$ are the unit vectors in the toroidal and poloidal directions, respectively. A differential displacement vector along the field line, $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{l}$, must be parallel to $\\vec{B}$. This displacement vector can also be written in terms of its components along the toroidal and poloidal directions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\vec{l} = \\mathrm{d}l_{\\phi} \\hat{e}_{\\phi} + \\mathrm{d}l_{\\theta} \\hat{e}_{\\theta}\n$$\nThe condition $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{l} \\parallel \\vec{B}$ implies that the ratio of the components of $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{l}$ must be equal to the ratio of the components of $\\vec{B}$. This gives the pitch of the field line:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}l_{\\phi}}{\\mathrm{d}l_{\\theta}} = \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the expressions for the differential arclengths in the large-aspect-ratio limit: $\\mathrm{d}l_{\\phi} = R\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$ and $\\mathrm{d}l_{\\theta} = r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$, where $R$ is the constant major radius and $r$ is the minor radius of the flux surface. Substituting these into the pitch relation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{R\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta} = \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the change in the toroidal angle $\\phi$ with respect to the poloidal angle $\\theta$ along the field line:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}\\theta} = \\frac{r}{R} \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}}\n$$\nThe safety factor, $q(r)$, is defined as the number of toroidal turns for one poloidal turn. One poloidal turn corresponds to a change in the poloidal angle of $\\Delta \\theta = 2\\pi$. The total change in the toroidal angle, $\\Delta \\phi$, after one poloidal turn is found by integrating $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}$ from $\\theta=0$ to $\\theta=2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}\\theta} \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r}{R} \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}} \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n$$\nThe number of toroidal turns is $\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the safety factor is:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r}{R} \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}} \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n$$\nFor a large-aspect-ratio ($r/R \\ll 1$), circular cross-section tokamak, to leading order, the magnetic field components $B_{\\phi}$ and $B_{\\theta}$ can be considered approximately constant on a given flux surface (i.e., they are functions of $r$ only). Thus, the term $\\frac{r}{R}\\frac{B_{\\phi}(r)}{B_{\\theta}(r)}$ can be treated as a constant with respect to the integration over $\\theta$:\n$$\nq(r) \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{r}{R} \\frac{B_{\\phi}(r)}{B_{\\theta}(r)}\\right) \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n$$\nEvaluating the integral, $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\theta = 2\\pi$, we arrive at the leading-order relation for the safety factor:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi}(r)}{R B_{\\theta}(r)}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the required poloidal magnetic field $B_{\\theta}$ at the specified location. We rearrange the derived formula to solve for $B_{\\theta}(r)$:\n$$\nB_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi}(r)}{R q(r)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Minor radius of the surface, $r = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Major radius of the torus, $R = 3\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Toroidal magnetic field, $B_{\\phi} = 5\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- Safety factor, $q = 3$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $B_{\\theta}$:\n$$\nB_{\\theta} = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{T})}{(3\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times 3} = \\frac{2.5}{9}\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nB_{\\theta} \\approx 0.2777... \\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\nB_{\\theta} \\approx 0.278\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$",

The law states $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}(r)$, where $I_{enc}(r)$ is the current enclosed within the loop.

The on-axis safety factor is $q(0) = C/2 \\approx 1.76$, and the edge safety factor is $q(a) = C \\approx 3.53$. The profile is monotonically increasing with radius since its derivative, $\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{2Cr}{a^2(2-(r/a)^2)^2}$, is positive for $r > 0$. This corresponds to a positive magnetic shear, $s = \\frac{r}{q}\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{2(r/a)^2}{2-(r/a)^2} > 0$.\n\n**Tearing-Mode Stability:** Tearing modes are resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that arise at rational flux surfaces, where $q(r) = m/n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. They lead to the formation of magnetic islands, which can degrade plasma confinement and potentially lead to disruptions. The stability of these modes is determined by the parameter $\\Delta'$, which depends on the equilibrium current profile. For the given parabolic current profile, classical tearing mode theory predicts that modes with poloidal mode number $m \\ge 2$ are unstable ($\\Delta' > 0$).\nOur calculations show the existence of the $q=2$ surface at $r_2 \\approx 0.2910 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and the $q=3$ surface at $r_3 \\approx 0.5445 \\, \\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, this plasma configuration is susceptible to the $m/n = 2/1$ and $m/n = 3/1$ tearing modes, among others. The $m/n=2/1$ mode is particularly deleterious as it can grow to a large amplitude and lock to small error fields, leading to major disruptions.\n\n**Resistive Mode Coupling:** The problem asks to discuss coupling between the $m/n = 2/1$ and $m/n = 3/2$ resonant surfaces. The $m/n = 2/1$ surface exists at $r_2$. The $m/n = 3/2$ surface would exist at the radius where $q(r) = 1.5$. However, the minimum value of the safety factor in this plasma is on axis, with $q(0) \\approx 1.76$. Since $q(r)$ is monotonically increasing, $q(r) \\ge 1.76$ for all $r \\in [0, a]$.\nThe critical implication is that the $q=1.5$ rational surface does not exist within this plasma. Consequently, the $m/n=3/2$ tearing mode cannot be excited as a primary instability. As there is no $m/n=3/2$ island structure, there can be no direct, nonlinear coupling between the $m/n=2/1$ mode and the $m/n=3/2$ mode. Such coupling requires the resonant surfaces of the modes to be present in the plasma, ideally in close proximity. The absence of the $q=1.5$ surface completely precludes this interaction channel. The plasma dynamics would be governed by the unstable modes that do have rational surfaces, such as the $2/1$ and $3/1$ modes, without any direct interference from a non-existent $3/2$ mode.",
