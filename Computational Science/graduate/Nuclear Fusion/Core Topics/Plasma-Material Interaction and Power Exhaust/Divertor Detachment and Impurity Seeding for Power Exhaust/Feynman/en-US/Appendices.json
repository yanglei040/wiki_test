            "problem": "A burning-plasma tokamak reactor operates with a divertor configuration intended to achieve detachment via impurity seeding for power exhaust. The \"power-to-surface area\" challenge, abbreviated as $P/S$, refers to the disparity between the power flowing across the magnetic separatrix into the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) and the limited wetted area available on the divertor targets to absorb that power without exceeding material limits. In an advanced all-metal wall scenario (no carbon), the allowable steady-state peak target heat flux is constrained by the thermal and structural limits of tungsten monoblocks and embedded cooling.\n\nConsider a reactor with total power crossing the separatrix of $P_{\\text{sep}} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$. A fraction $\\phi$ of the non-radiated power reaching the divertor strikes the outer target; take $\\phi = 0.70$. The outer divertor wetted area is $S_{\\text{out}} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. Toroidal and poloidal nonuniformities produce a peaking factor $p = 1.50$, defined so that the peak target heat flux $q_{t}$ satisfies $q_{t} = p \\, \\overline{q}_{t}$, where $\\overline{q}_{t}$ is the area-averaged target heat flux over $S_{\\text{out}}$. A fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ of $P_{\\text{sep}}$ is radiated volumetrically in the SOL and divertor before reaching the targets due to impurity line radiation and recombination (detachment).\n\nUsing energy conservation and geometric considerations of power spreading, derive an analytic expression for the minimum $f_{\\text{rad}}$ required so that the peak target heat flux does not exceed the material limit $q_{\\text{lim}}$. Take $q_{\\text{lim}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW \\, m}^{-2}$ to reflect non-carbon wall constraints. Then evaluate $f_{\\text{rad}}$ numerically for the given parameters.\n\nExpress your final answer for $f_{\\text{rad}}$ as a decimal number with no units, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data and constraints are consistent and realistic for the field of nuclear fusion energy research, specifically concerning power exhaust in a tokamak divertor. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum required radiated power fraction, $f_{\\text{rad}}$, needed to keep the peak divertor target heat flux, $q_{t}$, below a specified material limit, $q_{\\text{lim}}$. The solution is derived by applying the principle of energy conservation to the power flow from the core plasma to the divertor targets.\n\nFirst, we define the total power crossing the separatrix into the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), given as $P_{\\text{sep}}$.\nA fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ of this power is radiated volumetrically, primarily by seeded impurities, before it can reach the material surfaces of the divertor. The power that is not radiated and continues to flow towards the divertor targets is therefore:\n$$P_{\\text{target, total}} = P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$$\n\nThe problem specifies that a fraction $\\phi$ of this non-radiated power strikes the outer divertor target. The power incident on the outer target, $P_{\\text{out}}$, is thus:\n$$P_{\\text{out}} = \\phi P_{\\text{target, total}} = \\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$$\n\nThe outer divertor has a wetted area $S_{\\text{out}}$ over which this power is distributed. The area-averaged heat flux on the outer target, $\\overline{q}_{t}$, is the power to the outer target divided by its area:\n$$\\overline{q}_{t} = \\frac{P_{\\text{out}}}{S_{\\text{out}}} = \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}}$$\n\nDue to various physical and geometric effects, the heat flux is not uniform across the wetted area. A peaking factor, $p$, is introduced to relate the peak heat flux, $q_{t}$, to the average heat flux, $\\overline{q}_{t}$. The definition is given as $q_{t} = p \\overline{q}_{t}$. Substituting the expression for $\\overline{q}_{t}$, we get the peak heat flux on the outer target:\n$$q_{t} = p \\left( \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} \\right)$$\n\nThe engineering constraint is that this peak heat flux must not exceed the material thermal limit, $q_{\\text{lim}}$. This establishes the following inequality:\n$$q_{t} \\le q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n$$p \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} \\le q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the *minimum* required radiated fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ that satisfies this condition. The minimum value of $f_{\\text{rad}}$ corresponds to the case where the peak heat flux is exactly equal to the limit. Therefore, we solve the equality:\n$$p \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} = q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n\nOur goal is to isolate $f_{\\text{rad}}$. We can rearrange the equation algebraically. First, we solve for the term $(1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$:\n$$1 - f_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}}}{p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}}}{p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}}}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the minimum radiated fraction.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to evaluate $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n- Power crossing the separatrix, $P_{\\text{sep}} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$\n- Fraction of non-radiated power to the outer target, $\\phi = 0.70$\n- Outer divertor wetted area, $S_{\\text{out}} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- Heat flux peaking factor, $p = 1.50$\n- Peak heat flux limit, $q_{\\text{lim}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{(5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}}) (6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2})}{(1.50) (0.70) (150 \\ \\mathrm{MW})}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction.\nNumerator:\n$$q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}} = 5.0 \\times 6.0 = 30.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nDenominator:\n$$p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}} = 1.50 \\times 0.70 \\times 150 = 1.05 \\times 150 = 157.5 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{MW}$ cancel, as expected, leaving a dimensionless fraction.\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{30.0}{157.5}$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{30.0}{157.5} \\approx 0.19047619...$$\nFinally, we compute $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - 0.19047619... = 0.8095238...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} \\approx 0.8095$$\nThis means that a minimum of approximately $80.95\\%$ of the power crossing the separatrix must be radiated to keep the peak target heat flux at the acceptable limit of $5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}}$.",

The provided values for plasma parameters ($n_e$, $n_n$, $T_e$) are physically realistic for a detached divertor regime. The concepts of charge exchange, momentum loss, mean free path, and ion acoustic speed are standard in this context.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of a simplified formula for the ion acoustic speed, $c_s \\approx \\sqrt{e T_e/m_i}$. While the more general expression is $c_s = \\sqrt{k_B(Z T_e + \\gamma_i T_i)/m_i}$, the problem provides a specific instruction to use its approximation. In plasma physics, it is common to express temperature in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), where the actual thermal energy is this value multiplied by the elementary charge $e$. The expression $\\sqrt{e T_e/m_i}$ is interpreted as $\\sqrt{E/m_i}$, where the energy $E$ is given by $e$ times the numerical value of $T_e$ in volts. Thus, the provided expression is dimensionally correct under this common convention. This represents a specific modeling choice for the problem, not a fundamental flaw.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear objective: to derive an expression and calculate a dimensionless ratio. The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to derive the parallel momentum-loss mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)}$, due to charge exchange (CX) and then to compute the ratio $R = \\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)}/L_{\\parallel}$.\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is generally defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It can be expressed as the ratio of the particle's speed, $v$, to its collision frequency, $\\nu$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{v}{\\nu} $$\nFor this problem, we are interested in the mean free path for parallel momentum loss of an ion. The relevant speed is the characteristic parallel ion speed, $v_{i\\parallel}$, and the relevant frequency is the momentum-loss collision frequency, $\\nu^{(m)}$.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)} = \\frac{v_{i\\parallel}}{\\nu^{(m)}} $$\nThe collision being considered is charge exchange between a deuterium ion ($D^+$) and a deuterium neutral ($D^0$):\n$$ D^+_{\\text{fast}} + D^0_{\\text{slow}} \\rightarrow D^0_{\\text{fast}} + D^+_{\\text{slow}} $$\nIn this process, a fast ion captures an electron from a slow neutral. The original fast ion becomes a fast neutral, and the original slow neutral becomes a slow ion. From the perspective of the ion population, a fast ion is replaced by a slow ion. This results in a significant loss of directed momentum for the ion fluid. Therefore, the frequency of momentum loss due to CX is equivalent to the CX collision frequency itself, $\\nu_{cx}$.\n\nThe collision frequency, $\\nu_{cx}$, of a test particle (an ion) moving through a field of target particles (neutrals) is given by:\n$$ \\nu_{cx} = n_n \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} $$\nwhere $n_n$ is the density of the neutral target particles and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}$ is the reaction rate coefficient, which averages the product of the collision cross-section and the relative velocity over the velocity distributions of the colliding species.\n\nThe problem states that the characteristic parallel ion speed should be taken as the ion acoustic speed, $c_s$, with the specific formula:\n$$ v_{i\\parallel} = c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{e T_e}{m_i}} $$\nHere, $T_e$ is the electron temperature given in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). When used in this formula, it should be interpreted as a potential in volts, such that $eT_e$ is the energy in Joules.\n\nCombining these elements, we derive the expression for the parallel momentum-loss mean free path due to charge exchange:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)} = \\frac{c_s}{\\nu_{cx}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{e T_e}{m_i}}}{n_n \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}} $$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)}}{L_{\\parallel}} = \\frac{1}{L_{\\parallel}} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{e T_e}{m_i}}}{n_n \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $e = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_e = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{V}$ (the numerical value of the temperature in eV)\n- $m_i = 3.344 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- $n_n = 4.0 \\times 10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $L_{\\parallel} = 18 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ion acoustic speed, $c_s$:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C})(1.5 \\ \\mathrm{V})}{3.344 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{7.185798 \\times 10^7 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2}{\\mathrm{s}^2}} \\approx 8476.908 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} $$\nNext, we calculate the charge-exchange collision frequency, $\\nu_{cx}$:\n$$ \\nu_{cx} = (4.0 \\times 10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(8.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 3.2 \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we can find the mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)} = \\frac{c_s}{\\nu_{cx}} = \\frac{8476.908 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{3.2 \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.264903 \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{(m)}}{L_{\\parallel}} = \\frac{0.264903 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{18 \\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.0147168 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.01472$. This small value of $R$ implies that the mean free path for momentum loss is much shorter than the connection length of the divertor leg, which is a key characteristic of a high-recycling or detached divertor where momentum is effectively removed from the plasma flow before it reaches the target plate.",
