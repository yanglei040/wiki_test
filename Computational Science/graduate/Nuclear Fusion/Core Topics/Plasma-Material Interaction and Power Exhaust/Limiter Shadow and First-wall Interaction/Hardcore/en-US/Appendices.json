This exercise lays the mathematical groundwork for answering this question by tracing a magnetic field line in a simplified cylindrical geometry. By solving the differential equations that define a field line, you will derive the conditions for a point on the wall to be protected by a poloidal limiter, providing a first-principles understanding of how a limiter's shadow is cast .",

            "problem": "Consider an axisymmetric tokamak in cylindrical coordinates $(R,\\phi,Z)$ with a conducting first wall located at major radius values $R \\ge R_{\\mathrm{w}}$ and a thin, toroidally continuous limiter surface idealized by the set\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\{(R,\\phi,Z) \\,:\\, R = R_{\\mathrm{L}},\\, |Z| \\le Z_{\\mathrm{L}},\\, \\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}\\},$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{L}} < R_{\\mathrm{w}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{L}} > 0$. A point on the first wall is specified by $(R,Z,\\phi)$ with $R > R_{\\mathrm{L}}$. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ in a neighborhood connecting this wall point to the limiter is approximated as locally uniform in the sense that the cylindrical components $(B_{R},B_{\\phi},B_{Z})$ are constants over the connection length of interest, with $|B_{\\phi}| \\gg |B_{R}|,|B_{Z}|$ and $B_{\\phi} \\ne 0$. Field lines satisfy the standard relation that their tangent vector is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nStarting from these fundamentals, use the differential geometry of field lines in cylindrical coordinates to compute the first intersection of the field line launched from $(R,Z,\\phi)$ with the limiter surface $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{L}}$.

Your answer must be in radians. No numerical values are required, and no rounding is needed. You may assume that $R>0$, $R_{\\mathrm{L}}>0$, and that the sign of $B_{R}/B_{\\phi}$ is such that the first intersection in the forward-toroidal direction exists and is unique.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the toroidal angle advance for a magnetic field line, originating from a point on the first wall of a tokamak, to reach a toroidal limiter. Additionally, it asks for the poloidal coordinate at intersection and the condition for the wall point to be shadowed by the limiter. The analysis begins with the fundamental differential equations governing magnetic field lines.\n\nIn a cylindrical coordinate system $(R, \\phi, Z)$, a magnetic field line is a curve whose tangent vector at any point is parallel to the magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{B}$ at that point. This geometric condition is expressed by the following system of differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{B_R} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi} = \\frac{dZ}{B_Z}\n$$\nwhere $(B_R, B_\\phi, B_Z)$ are the cylindrical components of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. The problem states that these components are to be treated as constants in the region of interest. The field line originates from a point on the first wall with coordinates $(R, Z, \\phi)$, where $R > R_{\\mathrm{w}} > R_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the toroidal angle advance $\\Delta\\phi_*$ required for the field line to reach the limiter radius, $R_{\\mathrm{L}}$. We use the first equality from the field line equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{B_R} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi}\n$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it to isolate the variables $R$ and $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{R} = \\frac{B_R}{B_\\phi} d\\phi\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the starting point, which has major radius $R$ and toroidal angle $\\phi$, to the intersection point with the limiter cylinder, which has major radius $R_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and toroidal angle $\\phi + \\Delta\\phi_*$.\n$$\n\\int_{R}^{R_{\\mathrm{L}}} \\frac{dR'}{R'} = \\int_{\\phi}^{\\phi + \\Delta\\phi_*} \\frac{B_R}{B_\\phi} d\\phi'\n$$\nSince $B_R$ and $B_\\phi$ are constants, the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln(R') \\right]_{R}^{R_{\\mathrm{L}}} = \\frac{B_R}{B_\\phi} \\left[ \\phi' \\right]_{\\phi}^{\\phi + \\Delta\\phi_*}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(R_{\\mathrm{L}}) - \\ln(R) = \\frac{B_R}{B_\\phi} ((\\phi + \\Delta\\phi_*) - \\phi)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{L}}}{R}\\right) = \\frac{B_R}{B_\\phi} \\Delta\\phi_*\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta\\phi_*$, we obtain the expression for the toroidal angle advance:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi_* = \\frac{B_\\phi}{B_R} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{L}}}{R}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\Delta\\phi_*$ must be a minimal positive advance. Given that the field line starts at $R$ and ends at $R_{\\mathrm{L}}$ with $R > R_{\\mathrm{L}}$, the ratio $R_{\\mathrm{L}}/R < 1$, which makes its natural logarithm $\\ln(R_{\\mathrm{L}}/R)$ negative. For $\\Delta\\phi_*$ to be positive, the term $B_\\phi/B_R$ must also be negative. This is consistent with the problem's explicit assumption that the sign of $B_R/B_\\phi$ is chosen to ensure a unique intersection exists in the forward-toroidal direction ($\\Delta\\phi_* > 0$).\n\nNext, we find the poloidal coordinate $Z_*$ at the intersection point. We relate the change in $Z$ to the change in $R$ using another pair from the field line equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{B_Z} = \\frac{dR}{B_R}\n$$\nRearranging for $dZ$ gives $dZ = \\frac{B_Z}{B_R} dR$. Integrating this from the starting point $(R, Z)$ to the intersection point $(R_{\\mathrm{L}}, Z_*)$:\n$$\n\\int_{Z}^{Z_*} dZ' = \\int_{R}^{R_{\\mathrm{L}}} \\frac{B_Z}{B_R} dR'\n$$\nAs $B_Z$ and $B_R$ are constants, the integration is straightforward:\n$$\nZ_* - Z = \\frac{B_Z}{B_R} (R_{\\mathrm{L}} - R)\n$$\nThe poloidal coordinate at the intersection is therefore:\n$$\nZ_* = Z + \\frac{B_Z}{B_R} (R_{\\mathrm{L}} - R)\n$$\n\nFinally, we state the condition for the wall point to be shadowed by the limiter. The limiter surface $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is defined by $R = R_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $|Z| \\le Z_{\\mathrm{L}}$. A field line starting from a wall point provides shadowing if it intersects this physical surface. The field line intersects the cylinder of radius $R_{\\mathrm{L}}$ at the poloidal position $Z_*$. For this intersection to be on the limiter, $Z_*$ must lie within the limiter's vertical extent. Thus, the shadowing condition is $|Z_*| \\le Z_{\\mathrm{L}}$. Substituting the expression for $Z_*$, the condition is:\n$$\n\\left| Z + \\frac{B_Z}{B_R} (R_{\\mathrm{L}} - R) \\right| \\le Z_{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\nIn words, for a given wall point at coordinates $(R,Z)$, it is shadowed by the limiter if the magnitude of its poloidal coordinate mapped along the magnetic field line to the limiter's major radius, $R_{\\mathrm{L}}$, is less than or equal to the limiter's half-height, $Z_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\nThe question asks for a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\Delta\\phi_*$ in the final answer.",

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the expression for the e-folding length of the heat flux footprint on the wall, denoted $\\lambda_q$, and then to calculate its numerical value.\n\nThe heat flux deposited normal to the wall surface, $q_{\\perp, \\text{wall}}$, is the projection of the parallel heat flux at the wall, $q_{\\parallel, \\text{wall}}$. The angle of incidence is the grazing angle $\\theta$, so the projection factor is $\\sin\\theta$.\n$$\nq_{\\perp, \\text{wall}} = q_{\\parallel, \\text{wall}} \\sin\\theta\n$$\nThe problem states that the parallel heat flux $q_{\\parallel}$ is constant along a magnetic field line, apart from its cross-field variation.

This requires mapping the upstream coordinate separation $\\mathrm{d}r$ to the corresponding wall coordinate separation $\\mathrm{d}x$.\n\nThis mapping is achieved in two steps. First, we use magnetic flux conservation to relate the separation of flux surfaces upstream, $\\mathrm{d}r$, to their separation at the wall, measured perpendicular to the magnetic field. Let this perpendicular separation at the wall be $\\mathrm{d}r_{\\text{wall}}$.\n\nMagnetic flux conservation through an infinitesimal flux tube states:\n$$\nB_{\\text{up}} \\mathrm{d}A_{\\text{up}} = B_{\\text{wall}} \\mathrm{d}A_{\\text{wall}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}A$ is the area of the flux tube normal to the magnetic field. Assuming a constant toroidal width $\\mathrm{d}w$ for the flux tube, the normal areas can be written as $\\mathrm{d}A_{\\text{up}} = \\mathrm{d}r \\cdot \\mathrm{d}w$ and $\\mathrm{d}A_{\\text{wall}} = \\mathrm{d}r_{\\text{wall}} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}w$.

The coordinate $x$ is defined on the wall in the direction of the field-line intersection. The magnetic field lines strike the wall at a grazing angle $\\theta$.

In a steady state, the total flux of particles leaving the volume must equal the total rate of particle sourcing within that volume. Here, the only sink of particles from the flux tube is the parallel particle flux to the material surface (the target) at $s=L_{||}$, which we denote as $\\Gamma_{||,t}$. The problem specifies two sources of particles that are ionized within the flux tube:\n\n1.  An effective cross-field influx from the pedestal, which is stated to be proportional to the upstream density $n_u$.

The calculated value $2.6$ can be written as $2.60$ to meet this requirement.\n\nThe physical interpretation is that increasing the geometric shadowing (decreasing $g$ from $1.0$ to $0.6$) reduces the effectiveness of recycling as a particle source. To maintain the same total particle flux to the target, the other source term (cross-field transport, which is proportional to $n_u$) must compensate for this reduction.
