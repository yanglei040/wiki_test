For the high energies required in modern fusion devices, this process often begins by accelerating negative ions and then stripping their extra electron in a gas-filled chamber called a neutralizer. This exercise  provides hands-on practice in modeling this critical step, using a system of rate equations to determine the neutralization efficiency by tracking the competing atomic processes of electron detachment and reionization. Mastering this approach is fundamental to understanding and designing the source of the neutral beam itself.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is partitioned into three parts: the derivation of the neutralization efficiency formula, its numerical evaluation, and the qualitative explanation of cross-section dependencies.\n\n**1. Derivation of Neutralization Efficiency $\\eta_n(E_b)$**\n\nLet $f_{-}(x)$, $f_{0}(x)$, and $f_{+}(x)$ represent the fractions of the beam particles in the negative, neutral, and positive charge states, respectively, at a distance $x$ into the neutralizer. Since particles are only changing charge state and are not lost from the beam (elastic scattering is neglected), the sum of the fractions is conserved:\n$$f_{-}(x) + f_{0}(x) + f_{+}(x) = 1$$\nThe initial conditions at the neutralizer entrance ($x=0$) are:\n$$f_{-}(0) = 1, \\quad f_{0}(0) = 0, \\quad f_{+}(0) = 0$$\nThe rate of change of each fraction with distance $x$ is determined by the balance of production and loss processes. The probability per unit length for a particle in charge state $i$ to transition to state $j$ is given by $n_g \\sigma_{ij}$, where $n_g$ is the gas target density and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the corresponding microscopic cross section.\n\nThe change in the negative ion fraction $f_{-}$ over an infinitesimal length ${\\rm d}x$ is due to its destruction via single-electron detachment (to $D^0$) and double-electron detachment (to $D^+$).\n$${\\rm d}f_{-} = -f_{-}(x) \\cdot (n_g \\sigma_{-0}) \\cdot {\\rm d}x - f_{-}(x) \\cdot (n_g \\sigma_{-+}) \\cdot {\\rm d}x$$\nThis gives the first differential equation:\n$$\\frac{{\\rm d}f_{-}}{{\\rm d}x} = -n_g (\\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+}) f_{-}(x)$$\n\nThe change in the neutral fraction $f_{0}$ is due to its production from the detachment of negative ions and its destruction via reionization to positive ions.\n$${\\rm d}f_{0} = +f_{-}(x) \\cdot (n_g \\sigma_{-0}) \\cdot {\\rm d}x - f_{0}(x) \\cdot (n_g \\sigma_{0+}) \\cdot {\\rm d}x$$\nThis gives the second differential equation:\n$$\\frac{{\\rm d}f_{0}}{{\\rm d}x} = n_g \\sigma_{-0} f_{-}(x) - n_g \\sigma_{0+} f_{0}(x)$$\n\nWe solve this system of coupled ordinary differential equations. Let us introduce a variable for the total destructive cross section for negative ions, $\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} = \\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+}$. The equations become:\n1.  $\\frac{{\\rm d}f_{-}}{{\\rm d}x} = -n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} f_{-}(x)$\n2.  $\\frac{{\\rm d}f_{0}}{{\\rm d}x} = n_g \\sigma_{-0} f_{-}(x) - n_g \\sigma_{0+} f_{0}(x)$\n\nSolving equation (1) with the initial condition $f_{-}(0) = 1$ is straightforward:\n$$f_{-}(x) = \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} x)$$\n\nSubstitute this result into equation (2):\n$$\\frac{{\\rm d}f_{0}}{{\\rm d}x} + n_g \\sigma_{0+} f_{0}(x) = n_g \\sigma_{-0} \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} x)$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation. We solve it using an integrating factor $\\mu(x) = \\exp(\\int n_g \\sigma_{0+} {\\rm d}x) = \\exp(n_g \\sigma_{0+} x)$.\n$$\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}x} \\left( f_{0}(x) \\exp(n_g \\sigma_{0+} x) \\right) = n_g \\sigma_{-0} \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} x) \\exp(n_g \\sigma_{0+} x)$$\n$$= n_g \\sigma_{-0} \\exp(n_g (\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}) x)$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$:\n$$ f_{0}(x) \\exp(n_g \\sigma_{0+} x) = \\int n_g \\sigma_{-0} \\exp(n_g (\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}) x) {\\rm d}x + C$$\n$$ f_{0}(x) \\exp(n_g \\sigma_{0+} x) = \\frac{n_g \\sigma_{-0}}{n_g (\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}})} \\exp(n_g (\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}) x) + C$$\n$$ f_{0}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}} \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} x) + C \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{0+} x)$$\nWe use the initial condition $f_{0}(0) = 0$ to find the integration constant $C$:\n$$0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{0+} - \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} - \\sigma_{0+}}$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the expression for $f_{0}(x)$:\n$$f_{0}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} - \\sigma_{0+}} \\left( \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{0+} x) - \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} x) \\right)$$\nThe neutralization efficiency $\\eta_n$ is the fraction of neutral particles at the neutralizer exit, $x=L$. Since the beam velocity is assumed constant, the ratio of particle currents is equal to the ratio of particle number fractions.\n$$\\eta_n \\equiv \\frac{I_0(L)}{I_-(0)} = \\frac{f_0(L)}{f_-(0)} = f_0(L)$$\nSubstituting $x=L$ and the definition $\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} = \\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+}$ gives the final analytical expression:\n$$\\eta_n(E_b) = \\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{(\\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+}) - \\sigma_{0+}} \\left[ \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{0+} L) - \\exp(-n_g (\\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+}) L) \\right]$$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n-   $\\sigma_{-0} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2$\n-   $\\sigma_{-+} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2$\n-   $\\sigma_{0+} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2$\n-   $n_g = 1.00 \\times 10^{20} \\, {\\rm m}^{-3}$\n-   $L = 3.00 \\, {\\rm m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the combined cross section $\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} = \\sigma_{-0} + \\sigma_{-+} = (3.5 \\times 10^{-21}) + (0.5 \\times 10^{-21}) \\, {\\rm m}^2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless \"target thickness\" arguments for the exponential functions. The target thickness is the product $n_g L \\sigma$, often denoted $\\Pi(\\sigma)$.\n$$\\Pi_1 = n_g \\sigma_{0+} L = (1.00 \\times 10^{20} \\, {\\rm m}^{-3}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2) \\cdot (3.00 \\, {\\rm m}) = 0.300$$\n$$\\Pi_2 = n_g \\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} L = (1.00 \\times 10^{20} \\, {\\rm m}^{-3}) \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2) \\cdot (3.00 \\, {\\rm m}) = 1.20$$\nNow, we calculate the pre-factor:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{-0}}{\\sigma_{-,\\text{tot}} - \\sigma_{0+}} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm m}^2}{(4.0 \\times 10^{-21} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-21}) \\, {\\rm m}^2} = \\frac{3.5}{3.0}$$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $\\eta_n$:\n$$\\eta_n = \\frac{3.5}{3.0} \\left[ \\exp(-\\Pi_1) - \\exp(-\\Pi_2) \\right] = \\frac{3.5}{3.0} \\left[ \\exp(-0.300) - \\exp(-1.20) \\right]$$\n$$\\eta_n \\approx 1.16667 \\left[ 0.740818 - 0.301194 \\right]$$\n$$\\eta_n \\approx 1.16667 \\left[ 0.439624 \\right]$$\n$$\\eta_n \\approx 0.512895$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\eta_n \\approx 0.5129$$\n\n**3. Qualitative Explanation of Cross Section Behavior**\n\nThe problem asks for a qualitative explanation of how cross sections for charge exchange and electron detachment vary with energy and beam species.\n\n**a) Charge Exchange (Electron Capture by a Positive Ion, e.g., $X^+ + Y \\to X + Y^+$)**\n-   **Energy Dependence**: The behavior of the cross section, $\\sigma_{cx}(E)$, is strongly dependent on the collision velocity $v$ relative to the orbital velocity $v_e$ of the electron being captured.\n    -   At low energies ($v \\ll v_e$, adiabatic regime), the interaction time is long, allowing the electronic states to adjust. For resonant or near-resonant reactions (where the change in internal electronic energy is small), the cross section is large and typically decreases with increasing energy (e.g., $\\sigma \\propto (a - b\\ln v)^2$).\n    -   The cross section usually peaks at an energy where the collision velocity is comparable to the electron's orbital velocity ($v \\approx v_e$). This is known as the Massey criterion, which corresponds to the condition where the interaction time $a/v$ (with $a$ being a characteristic interaction length) is on the order of the electron's orbital period, maximizing the transition probability.\n    -   At high energies ($v \\gg v_e$, sudden regime), the interaction time is very short. The projectile ion passes the target atom so quickly that the electron has little time to respond and be captured. The cross section falls off very rapidly with energy, often as a high power law (e.g., $\\sigma \\propto E^{-n}$ with $n \\ge 5$).\n-   **Species Dependence (at fixed $E_b$)**: For a fixed beam energy $E_b$, the velocity of the projectile is $v = \\sqrt{2E_b/m}$. A heavier beam species (e.g., deuterium vs. hydrogen) will have a lower velocity at the same kinetic energy. If this lower velocity moves the collision from the high-energy side of the Massey peak towards the peak, the cross section will increase. Conversely, if the collision is already in the low-energy regime, decreasing the velocity further would also increase the cross section. Thus, the effect depends entirely on the specific energy range and reaction partners.\n\n**b) Electron Detachment of a Negative Ion (e.g., $X^- + Y \\to X + Y + e^-$)**\n-   **Energy Dependence**: Negative ions are characterized by a very low electron binding energy (electron affinity, $\\approx 0.75 \\, {\\rm eV}$ for H/D). They are fragile.\n    -   The cross section for detachment, $\\sigma_{det}(E)$, rises from a threshold energy, peaks at a relatively low energy (typically in the $10-100 \\, {\\rm keV}$ range for light ions), and then decreases at higher energies.\n    -   The fall-off at high energies is much slower than for charge exchange, often behaving as $\\sigma \\propto \\ln(E)/E$ or $E^{-1}$. This is because the weakly bound electron is easily stripped by the electric field of the target nucleus and its electrons, a process that remains efficient even at high relative velocities.\n-   **Species Dependence (at fixed $E_b$)**: Similar to charge exchange, a heavier species has a lower velocity at fixed energy $E_b$. The longer interaction time can increase the detachment probability, especially if the collision is in the energy range where the cross section is rising or near its peak. The polarizability of the target atom is also a crucial factor; a more polarizable target atom creates a stronger transient electric field as the negative ion passes, enhancing the detachment cross section. Between isotopes like $H^-$ and $D^-$, the electronic properties are nearly identical, so the primary difference at a fixed energy is the velocity.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics and neutral beam injection, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. The given parameters are physically realistic for a tokamak fusion device. The slight inequality between electron and ion densities ($n_e  n_i$) is consistent with quasi-neutrality in a non-pure plasma containing impurity ions, which is a realistic condition.\n\nWe begin by deriving the survival probability $S(x)$ from first principles. Let $N(x)$ be the number of neutral beam particles that have survived after traveling a path length $x$ into the plasma. The change in this number, $dN$, over an infinitesimal path length $dx$ is due to removal processes. The problem states that removal occurs via two independent processes: electron-impact ionization and charge exchange. The assumption that these are independent Poisson processes in path length implies that their removal rates are additive.\n\nThe probability of a single neutral being removed in a path length $dx$ is given by $P_{\\text{removal}} = \\mu_{\\text{tot}} dx$, where $\\mu_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total linear attenuation coefficient. This coefficient is the sum of the contributions from each process. The contribution of a process $k$ with target particle density $n_k$ and effective cross-section $\\sigma_k^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is $\\mu_k = n_k \\sigma_k^{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nThe two processes are:\n$1$.

This establishes the differential equation for particle conservation along the beam path:\n$$\ndN = -N(x) \\mu_{\\text{tot}} dx\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N(x)} = -\\mu_{\\text{tot}} dx\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the beam entry point at $x=0$, where the number of neutrals is $N(0)=N_0$, to a position $x$:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(x)} \\frac{dN'}{N'} = -\\int_0^x \\mu_{\\text{tot}} dx'\n$$\nAssuming the plasma parameters ($n_e$, $n_i$, and thus $\\mu_{\\text{tot}}$) are uniform along the path, we can treat $\\mu_{\\text{tot}}$ as a constant:\n$$\n[\\ln(N')]_{N_0}^{N(x)} = -\\mu_{\\text{tot}} [x']_0^x\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(x)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\mu_{\\text{tot}} x\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(x)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\mu_{\\text{tot}} x\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the number of surviving neutrals as a function of path length:\n$$\n\\frac{N(x)}{N_0} = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{tot}} x)\n$$\nThe survival probability $S(x)$ is defined as the fraction of neutrals remaining, $S(x) = \\frac{N(x)}{N_0}$.

The mean free path $\\lambda \\approx 0.995\\ \\mathrm{m}$ represents the characteristic length for beam attenuation. The ratio of the chord length to the mean free path is $L / \\lambda \\approx 3.5\\ \\mathrm{m} / 0.995\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.52$.\n\nThe deposition profile, i.e., the rate at which beam particles are ionized per unit length, is given by $D(x) = -\\frac{d S(x)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. This profile is maximal at the plasma edge ($x=0$) and decays exponentially into the plasma.\n\nSince the chord length $L$ is significantly larger than the mean free path $\\lambda$ (by a factor of approximately $3.5$), the majority of the beam neutrals will be ionized and \"deposited\" long before they traverse the full chord length. The fraction of the beam that survives to the end of the chord at $x=L$ is $S(L) = \\exp(-L/\\lambda) \\approx \\exp(-3.52) \\approx 0.0296$. This means that less than $3\\%$ of the beam penetrates to the end of the chord. Consequently, the power and particle deposition from the neutral beam will be strongly localized near the plasma edge where the beam enters. This is typically referred to as \"edge-peaked\" or \"off-axis\" deposition. For efficient core heating or current drive, a much larger mean free path (ideally, $\\lambda \\sim L/2$ or greater) would be required to allow the beam to penetrate to the plasma center before being significantly attenuated.",

            "introduction": "Operating a fusion device involves navigating a landscape of engineering trade-offs to maximize performance. For neutral beam injection, there is a classic conflict: a high-density plasma is needed to absorb the beam and prevent it from \"shining through\" to the far wall, but this same high density can increase parasitic power losses before the beam even enters the main plasma. This exercise  challenges you to move beyond analyzing individual phenomena and perform a system-level optimization. By finding the ideal plasma density that maximizes the net absorbed power, you will practice the type of applied modeling that guides real-world operational scenarios in fusion research.",

            "problem": "A Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) system delivers a steady beam of deuterium neutrals with input power $P_{0}$ into a tokamak plasma. The plasma is modeled as uniform along the beamline of length $L$, with spatially constant electron density $n_{e}$. The dominant process for beam ionization in the plasma is electron-impact ionization with an effective cross section $\\sigma_{i}$ that is approximately constant over the relevant energy range. Upstream of the plasma, the beam passes through a duct, where a fraction of the beam power is lost due to reionization on background gas created by recycled edge neutrals. In the density range of interest for this machine, the reionization-induced duct loss fraction $f_{\\mathrm{ri}}$ is empirically observed to scale linearly with $n_{e}$ as $f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e}) = c n_{e}$, with $c$ a constant coefficient.\n\nAssume straight-line beam trajectories and that ionization events are independent. The shine-through fraction $S(n_{e})$ (the fraction of neutrals that exit the plasma without ionizing) is determined by the survival probability along the beam path. The net absorbed beam power in the plasma can then be written as $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e}) = P_{0}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e}))(1 - S(n_{e}))$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of survival probability for a Poisson process along a path and using the above physical model, derive an analytic expression for the electron density $n_{e}^{\\star}$ that maximizes $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e})$.

The concepts of electron-impact ionization, beam attenuation (shine-through), and duct losses due to reionization are all standard topics in fusion plasma physics. The governing equations are based on fundamental principles (Poisson statistics for attenuation) and plausible empirical models.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It asks for the optimization of a well-defined function. The function $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_e)$ tends to zero for both very low and very high $n_e$, suggesting a maximum exists in the positive domain. The necessary information to construct this function is either provided or derivable from the instructions (e.g., the derivation of $S(n_e)$).\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: All required parameters are provided. The units are dimensionally consistent: the arguments of all functions are dimensionless. For example, the argument of $f_{\\mathrm{ri}}$ is $c n_e$, with units $(\\mathrm{m}^3)(\\mathrm{m}^{-3})=1$. The argument of the exponential in $S(n_e)$ will be $n_e \\sigma_i L$, with units $(\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(\\mathrm{m}^2)(\\mathrm{m})=1$. The parameter $P_0$ is provided but, as will be shown, is not necessary for finding the optimal density $n_e^\\star$, which does not represent a contradiction.\n5.  **Plausibility**: The given numerical values are realistic for typical NBI systems and tokamak plasmas. The empirical model $f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e}) = c n_{e}$ implies a physical limitation that $c n_e \\le 1$. The derived optimal density $n_e^\\star$ should fall within a range where this assumption holds for the model to be self-consistent. This can be verified after finding the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. It represents a valid and standard optimization problem in applied physics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe goal is to find the electron density $n_{e}^{\\star}$ that maximizes the net absorbed beam power, $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e})$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the shine-through fraction, $S(n_{e})$. The problem states that ionization is a Poisson process. For a uniform plasma of electron density $n_e$ and a constant ionization cross section $\\sigma_i$, the mean free path of a neutral beam atom before ionization is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n_e \\sigma_i}$. The probability of a neutral atom surviving a path of length $l$ without being ionized is given by the exponential distribution, $P(\\text{survival}) = \\exp(-l/\\lambda)$. The shine-through fraction $S(n_e)$ is this survival probability over the entire path length $L$ through the plasma.\n$$S(n_{e}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\exp(-n_e \\sigma_i L)$$\n\nThe net absorbed power is given by $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e}) = P_{0}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e}))(1 - S(n_{e}))$. Substituting the expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e})$ and $S(n_{e})$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e}) = P_{0}(1 - c n_{e})(1 - \\exp(-n_{e} \\sigma_{i} L))$$\n\nTo find the density $n_e^\\star$ that maximizes $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e})$, we must find the root of the derivative with respect to $n_e$. Since $P_0$ is a positive constant, we can maximize the function $g(n_e) = P_{\\mathrm{abs}}(n_{e})/P_0$. Let $\\alpha = \\sigma_i L$ to simplify the notation.\n$$g(n_e) = (1 - c n_e)(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha n_e))$$\n\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv'$:\n$$\\frac{dg}{dn_e} = \\frac{d}{dn_e}(1 - c n_e) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha n_e)) + (1 - c n_e) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dn_e}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha n_e))$$\n$$\\frac{dg}{dn_e} = (-c)(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha n_e)) + (1 - c n_e)(\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha n_e))$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for $n_e = n_e^{\\star}$:\n$$-c(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star})) + (1 - c n_e^{\\star})(\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star})) = 0$$\n$$-c + c \\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star}) + \\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star}) - c \\alpha n_e^{\\star} \\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star}) = 0$$\nFactor out the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-\\alpha n_e^{\\star}) (c + \\alpha - c \\alpha n_e^{\\star}) = c$$\n\nThis is a transcendental equation for $n_e^{\\star}$. This equation is the analytic expression required by the problem, as $n_e^{\\star}$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions of the parameters $c$, $\\sigma_i$, and $L$.\n\nTo solve for $n_e^{\\star}$ numerically, it is convenient to non-dimensionalize the equation. Let $y = \\alpha n_e^{\\star} = \\sigma_i L n_e^{\\star}$. Then $n_e^{\\star} = y / \\alpha$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\\exp(-y) \\left(c + \\alpha - c \\alpha \\frac{y}{\\alpha}\\right) = c$$\n$$\\exp(-y) (c + \\alpha - c y) = c$$\n$$c + \\alpha - c y = c \\exp(y)$$\nDividing by $c$ (since $c \\neq 0$):\n$$1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{c} - y = \\exp(y)$$\n$$1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{c} = y + \\exp(y)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\sigma_{i} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $L = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $c = 5.0 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n\nFirst, calculate the constant parameters:\n$$\\alpha = \\sigma_i L = (2.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 6.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{c} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 12$$\n\nThe equation to solve for the dimensionless variable $y$ becomes:\n$$1 + 12 = y + \\exp(y)$$\n$$13 = y + \\exp(y)$$\n\nWe solve this transcendental equation for $y$ numerically. Let $H(y) = y + \\exp(y) - 13$.\n- For $y=2$, $H(2) = 2 + \\exp(2) - 13 \\approx 2 + 7.389 - 13 = -3.611$.\n- For $y=3$, $H(3) = 3 + \\exp(3) - 13 \\approx 3 + 20.086 - 13 = 10.086$.\nThe root lies between $y=2$ and $y=3$. Using a numerical method like bisection or Newton-Raphson, we can find the root with higher precision.\n- Let's try $y=2.3$: $H(2.3) = 2.3 + \\exp(2.3) - 13 \\approx 2.3 + 9.974 - 13 = -0.726$.\n- Let's try $y=2.4$: $H(2.4) = 2.4 + \\exp(2.4) - 13 \\approx 2.4 + 11.023 - 13 = 0.423$.\nThe root lies between $y=2.3$ and $y=2.4$.\nFurther refinement gives $y^{\\star} \\approx 2.364$.\n\nFinally, we convert $y^{\\star}$ back to $n_{e}^{\\star}$:\n$$n_{e}^{\\star} = \\frac{y^{\\star}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{2.364}{6.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}}$$\n$$n_{e}^{\\star} \\approx 0.394 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 3.94 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, $n_e^{\\star} = 3.94 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nFinally, we check the validity of the linear loss model at this density:\n$f_{\\mathrm{ri}}(n_{e}^{\\star}) = c n_{e}^{\\star} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}) (3.94 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 0.197$.\nSince $f_{\\mathrm{ri}} \\approx 20\\%$, which is less than $1$, the use of the model is self-consistent.\nThe value of $P_0$ was not required to determine the optimal density $n_e^{\\star}$.",
