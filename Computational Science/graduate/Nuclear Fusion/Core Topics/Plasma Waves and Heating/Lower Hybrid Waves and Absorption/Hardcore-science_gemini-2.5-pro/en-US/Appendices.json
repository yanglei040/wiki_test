            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the fraction, $F$, of launched power from a multijunction grill that satisfies the accessibility condition for Lower Hybrid (LH) slow waves. The accessibility condition is given by the parallel refractive index $n_{\\parallel}$ being greater than or equal to a threshold value, $n_{\\mathrm{access}}$, and positive.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework for the calculation. The total launched power is distributed among discrete spectral lines, or modes, indexed by the integer $m$. The problem states that only modes with $m \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ contribute appreciably. The relative power, or weight, of each mode $m$ is given as being proportional to the square of the single-slot spectral envelope evaluated at the mode's parallel wavenumber, $k_{\\parallel}^{(m)}$.\nLet the power weight of mode $m$ be $P_m$. According to the problem, $P_m \\propto |W(k_{\\parallel}^{(m)})|^2$.\nThe single-slot envelope is $W(k_{\\parallel}) \\propto \\mathrm{sinc}(k_{\\parallel} w/2)$, so we can write the power weight for mode $m$ as\n$$\nP_m = C \\left[ \\mathrm{sinc}\\left(\\frac{k_{\\parallel}^{(m)} w}{2}\\right) \\right]^2\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Since we are calculating a fraction, this constant will cancel out and can be ignored. We use the definition $\\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \\sin(x)/x$.\n\nThe fraction $F$ of accessible power is the sum of the weights of the modes that satisfy the accessibility condition, divided by the sum of the weights of all contributing modes.\nThe accessibility and sign conditions are $n_{\\parallel} \\ge n_{\\mathrm{access}}$ and $n_{\\parallel} > 0$. Given $n_{\\mathrm{access}} = 2.0$, the condition simplifies to $n_{\\parallel} \\ge 2.0$.\nLet $S_{total} = \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ be the set of contributing modes. Let $S_{acc}$ be the subset of $S_{total}$ for which the condition $n_{\\parallel}^{(m)} \\ge 2.0$ is met.

So, $n_{\\parallel}^{(-1)} \\approx 1.28955 \\times (-\\frac{4\\pi}{3}) \\approx -5.40$.\nFor $m=0$: $k_{\\parallel}^{(0)} = \\frac{0 + 2\\pi/3}{p} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3p}$.

According to the first foundational basis, the absorbed power density is related to the parallel momentum input per unit volume per unit time, $s_{p,\\parallel}$, via the parallel phase velocity of the wave, $v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{abs}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel} s_{p,\\parallel}$$\nIn a steady state, as per the second foundational basis, this momentum input is balanced by the collisional drag experienced by the current-carrying electrons. The problem provides the collisional friction force density as $n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} u_{\\parallel}$, where $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, $m_{e}$ is the electron mass, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective momentum damping rate, and $u_{\\parallel}$ is the mean parallel velocity of the driven electrons. Therefore, the momentum balance equation is:\n$$s_{p,\\parallel} = n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} u_{\\parallel}$$\nBy substituting the expression for $s_{p,\\parallel}$ from the momentum balance equation into the energy-momentum relation, we obtain a direct link between the absorbed power density and the electron fluid velocity:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{abs}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel} (n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} u_{\\parallel})$$\nThe third foundational basis defines the parallel current density as $j_{\\parallel} = e n_{e} u_{\\parallel}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. This allows us to express the product $n_e u_\\parallel$ in terms of the current density: $n_e u_\\parallel = j_{\\parallel} / e$. Substituting this into our combined equation yields the local relationship between power density and current density:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{abs}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel} m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{j_{\\parallel}}{e}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the ratio of local current density to local power absorption density:\n$$\\frac{j_{\\parallel}}{p_{\\mathrm{abs}}} = \\frac{e}{m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel}}$$\nThe current drive efficiency, $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of the total driven current, $I_{\\mathrm{CD}}$, to the total absorbed RF power, $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$:\n$$\\eta \\equiv \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CD}}}{P_{\\mathrm{abs}}}$$\nThe total current $I_{\\mathrm{CD}}$ and total absorbed power $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ are obtained by integrating their respective densities over the plasma cross-sectional area $A$ and volume $V$. The problem specifies that the driven current density is spatially uniform, thus:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{CD}} = \\int_{A} j_{\\parallel} dA = j_{\\parallel} A$$\nThe problem also states that the absorption is uniform. This implies a uniform power absorption density $p_{\\mathrm{abs}}$. The total power is then:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\int_{V} p_{\\mathrm{abs}} dV = p_{\\mathrm{abs}} V$$\nUsing the fourth foundational basis, the volume of the tokamak plasma is given by $V = A L$, where the toroidal path length is $L = 2\\pi R$ for a large-aspect-ratio tokamak of major radius $R$. Therefore:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{abs}} = p_{\\mathrm{abs}} A (2\\pi R)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_{\\mathrm{CD}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ into the definition of efficiency, we get:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{j_{\\parallel} A}{p_{\\mathrm{abs}} A (2\\pi R)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R} \\frac{j_{\\parallel}}{p_{\\mathrm{abs}}}$$\nFinally, we substitute the previously derived ratio of $j_{\\parallel}/p_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ into this expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R} \\left( \\frac{e}{m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel}} \\right)$$\nThis gives the final analytic expression for the current drive efficiency in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{e}{2\\pi R m_{e} \\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel}}$$\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n$e = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$m_{e} = 9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$R = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\nu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$v_{\\mathrm{ph},\\parallel} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}}{2\\pi (3.0) (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}) (1.5 \\times 10^{4}) (3.0 \\times 10^{7})}$$\nThe denominator evaluates to:\n$$2\\pi (3.0)(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31})(1.5 \\times 10^{4})(3.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\approx 7.7271535 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\nThe unit seems wrong in the derivation above, let's recheck. Power is J/s. Power density is J/(s*m^3). Momentum density is (kg*m/s)/m^3. s_p,parallel is momentum density per time, so (kg*m/s)/m^3/s. p_abs = v * s_p,parallel -> J/(s*m^3) = (m/s) * (kg*m/s)/m^3/s = kg*m^2/(s^3*m^3). This matches. Let's check the units for eta. Denominator unit is $m \\cdot kg \\cdot s^{-1} \\cdot m \\cdot s^{-1} = kg \\cdot m^2 \\cdot s^{-2} = J$. Numerator unit is C. So eta has units C/J. $A/W = (C/s) / (J/s) = C/J$. The units are correct. Let's re-calculate the denominator.\n$2 \\times \\pi \\times 3.0 \\times (9.109... \\times 10^{-31}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^4) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^7) \\approx 7.72715 \\times 10^{-18}$.\nThus, the efficiency is:\n$$\\eta \\approx \\frac{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{7.7271535 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}} \\approx 0.0207345\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{J}^{-1}$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1} = 1\\,(\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\,(\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-1} = 1\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{J}^{-1}$, the unit is correct.\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives $0.02073$.",
