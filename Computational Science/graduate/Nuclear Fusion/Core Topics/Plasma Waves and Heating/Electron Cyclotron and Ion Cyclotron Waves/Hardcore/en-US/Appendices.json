            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of cutoff conditions for ordinary (O-mode) and extraordinary (X-mode) electromagnetic waves propagating perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field in a cold, uniform plasma. A cutoff is a condition where the wave's refractive index goes to zero, causing reflection.\n\n**1. O-mode Cutoff**\nFor the O-mode, the wave electric field is parallel to the background magnetic field, $\\mathbf{E} = E_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, while the propagation is perpendicular, $\\mathbf{k} = k \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The Lorentz force term, $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0$, has no component parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_0$.

The response is described by the right-hand (R) and left-hand (L) dielectric functions, which correspond to the two circularly polarized components of the wave. Using the positive electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce} = eB/m_e$, these are:\n$$ R = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})} \\quad (\\text{RHCP, electron resonant}) $$\n$$ L = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega + \\omega_{ce})} \\quad (\\text{LHCP, non-resonant for electrons}) $$\nThe dispersion relation for the X-mode propagating perpendicularly is $k^2 = (\\omega^2/c^2) \\frac{RL}{S}$, where $S=(R+L)/2$. Cutoffs ($k=0$) occur when the numerator is zero, provided the denominator is finite. Thus, the X-mode cutoff conditions are $R=0$ or $L=0$.\n*   **Left-hand cutoff:** The condition $R=0$ gives the left-hand cutoff frequency, $\\omega_L$.\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})} = 0 \\implies \\omega_{pe}^2 = \\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce}) $$\n    The corresponding density is $n_{L,\\mathrm{cut}} = \\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0}{e^2}\\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})$.

            "problem": "A linearly polarized electromagnetic wave in the ordinary mode (O-mode) is launched from the low-density side and propagates perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field in a cold, collisionless, magnetized plasma. The wave has angular frequency $\\omega$ and its electric field is parallel to the magnetic field.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the reflection coefficient $R$ of an ordinary mode (O-mode) electromagnetic wave at its cutoff in a cold, collisionless, magnetized plasma with a linear density gradient. Subsequently, it asks for a numerical estimate of $R$ for specific parameters.\n\nFirst, we will derive the governing wave equation from Maxwell's equations. For a time-harmonic wave with dependence $e^{-i\\omega t}$, Maxwell's curl equations are:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = i\\omega\\vec{B} \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J} - \\frac{i\\omega}{c^2}\\vec{E}\n$$\nIn a cold plasma, the current density $\\vec{J}$ is related to the electric field $\\vec{E}$ via the conductivity tensor, or more conveniently, the entire medium response can be described by a dielectric tensor $\\tensor{\\epsilon}$ such that $\\vec{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\tensor{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\vec{E}$. Combining the curl equations gives the wave equation:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\tensor{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\vec{E}\n$$\nThe problem specifies an O-mode wave propagating perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$. Let's set up the coordinate system such that $\\vec{B}_0$ is in the $\\hat{z}$ direction and the wave propagates in the $\\hat{x}$ direction, with plasma properties varying only with $x$. For the O-mode, the wave electric field $\\vec{E}$ is parallel to the background magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$. Thus, $\\vec{E} = E_z(x) \\hat{z}$.\n\nFor this configuration ($\\vec{E} \\parallel \\vec{B}_0$), the wave electric field does not drive any particle motion perpendicular to $\\vec{B}_0$, so the plasma response is isotropic, as if there were no magnetic field. The relevant component of the dielectric tensor is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{zz} = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\\omega^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{pe}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e(x) e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}}$ is the electron plasma frequency, which varies with position $x$ through the electron density $n_e(x)$.\n\nThe left-hand side of the wave equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times (E_z(x)\\hat{z})) = \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{dE_z}{dx} \\hat{y}\\right) = -\\frac{d^2E_z}{dx^2} \\hat{z}\n$$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} (\\epsilon_{zz} E_z(x)) \\hat{z}\n$$\nEquating the components gives the one-dimensional scalar wave equation for $E_z$:\n$$\n-\\frac{d^2E_z}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\\omega^2}\\right) E_z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E_z}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\\omega^2}\\right) E_z = 0\n$$\nThis is a Schrödinger-like equation of the form $\\frac{d^2E_z}{dx^2} + k^2(x) E_z = 0$, where $k^2(x) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} N^2(x)$ is the square of the local wavenumber and $N^2(x) = \\epsilon_{zz} = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x)}{\\omega^2}$ is the square of the refractive index.\n\nThe O-mode cutoff is defined by the condition $N^2(x) = 0$, which implies $k^2(x)=0$. This occurs at a position $x_c$ where $\\omega_{pe}(x_c) = \\omega$. Let us define our coordinate system such that this cutoff occurs at $x=0$.\nThe problem states that near the cutoff, the density profile $n_e(x)$ has a constant scale length $L_n = \\left| \\frac{n_e}{dn_e/dx} \\right|_{x=0}$. This implies a linear approximation for the density:\n$$\nn_e(x) \\approx n_e(0) + x \\left(\\frac{dn_e}{dx}\\right)_{x=0}\n$$\nSince density increases with $x$, $dn_e/dx > 0$ and $L_n = \\frac{n_e(0)}{dn_e/dx|_{x=0}}$. Thus:\n$$\nn_e(x) \\approx n_e(0) \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{L_n}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $k^2(x)$:\n$$\nk^2(x) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(0)}{\\omega^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{L_n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{pe}(0) = \\omega$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nk^2(x) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left(1 - \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{L_n}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{\\omega^2 x}{c^2 L_n}\n$$\nThe wave equation in the vicinity of the cutoff is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E_z}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2 x}{c^2 L_n} E_z = 0\n$$\nThis is the Airy differential equation. To put it in standard form $\\frac{d^2f}{d\\zeta^2} - \\zeta f = 0$, we introduce a dimensionless variable $\\zeta$:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 L_n}\\right)^{1/3} x\n$$\nWith this substitution, the wave equation becomes $\\frac{d^2E_z}{d\\zeta^2} - \\zeta E_z = 0$. The general solution is a linear combination of the Airy functions $\\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta)$ and $\\mathrm{Bi}(\\zeta)$.\n\nThe wave is launched from the low-density side ($n_e < n_e(0)$), which corresponds to $x<0$. In this region, $\\zeta<0$ and $k^2(x) > 0$, so the waves are propagating.\nFor $x>0$ (high-density side), $\\zeta>0$ and $k^2(x) < 0$, so the waves are evanescent.\nPhysical solutions must remain bounded. For $x \\to \\infty$, $\\zeta \\to \\infty$. The asymptotic behaviors of the Airy functions are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta) \\sim \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta^{1/4}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{decaying}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Bi}(\\zeta) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\zeta^{1/4}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\zeta^{3/2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{growing})\n$$\nTo ensure the field vanishes far into the evanescent region, we must choose the solution that decays. Therefore, the physically correct solution is proportional to the Airy function $\\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta)$:\n$$\nE_z(\\zeta) = C \\cdot \\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.\n\nTo find the reflection coefficient, we examine the behavior of this solution in the propagating region, $x<0$ ($\\zeta<0$). The asymptotic form of $\\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta)$ for $\\zeta \\to -\\infty$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ai}(\\zeta) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}(-\\zeta)^{1/4}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}(-\\zeta)^{3/2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThis represents a standing wave, which is a superposition of an incident and a reflected wave of equal amplitude. To see this explicitly, we use Euler's formula for the sine function:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta}}{2i}\n$$\nThe argument of the sine function can be related to the WKB phase integral $\\phi(x) = \\int_x^0 k(x') dx'$. The field in the propagating region is:\n$$\nE_z(x) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k(x)}} \\sin\\left(\\phi(x) + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_z(x) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k(x)}} \\frac{1}{2i} \\left[ \\exp\\left(i(\\phi(x) + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\right) - \\exp\\left(-i(\\phi(x) + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis is a superposition of a wave with phase advancing with $x$ (incident) and a wave with phase decreasing with $x$ (reflected). The complex amplitudes of the incident and reflected components have the same magnitude. The amplitude reflection coefficient, $r$, is the ratio of the reflected to incident amplitudes, which has magnitude $|r|=1$. The power reflection coefficient, $R$, is the squared magnitude of the amplitude reflection coefficient:\n$$\nR = |r|^2 = 1\n$$\nThis result signifies total reflection. This is expected on physical grounds: the wave is incident on a region where propagation is forbidden ($k^2<0$), and the problem specifies no loss mechanisms (collisions are neglected) or other channels for energy to escape (mode conversion is neglected). By conservation of energy, all the incident power must be reflected.\n\nThe analytical result is exactly $R=1$, independent of the specific values of $\\omega$ and $L_n$, provided the linear model for the cutoff is valid. Therefore, when asked to estimate the reflection coefficient for the specific case of $\\omega/(2\\pi) = 170\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$ and $L_n = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the answer under the problem's idealizations is exactly $1$. The given parameters are consistent with typical plasma experiments and do not invalidate the model, but they do not alter the fundamental result of total reflection in this idealized one-dimensional problem.\n\nFinal answer for $R$ is $1$.",
