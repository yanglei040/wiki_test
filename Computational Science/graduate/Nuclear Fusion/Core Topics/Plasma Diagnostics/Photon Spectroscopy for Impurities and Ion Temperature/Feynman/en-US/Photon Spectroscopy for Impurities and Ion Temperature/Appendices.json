            "problem": "A spectrometer is used on a magnetically confined fusion plasma to observe a visible impurity emission line from doubly ionized carbon $\\mathrm{C}^{2+}$ near a central vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_{0} = 465.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The measured line profile is well modeled as the convolution of two independent broadening mechanisms: the instrument response (assumed Gaussian) and the physical Doppler broadening due to the line-of-sight thermal velocity distribution of the emitting ions (assumed Gaussian). The measured Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the convolved line is $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.3730\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and the instrument response FWHM is $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inst}} = 0.1200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the following bases:\n- The one-dimensional Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution $f(v_{z}) \\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-m v_{z}^{2}/(2 k_{B} T)\\big)$ for the line-of-sight component $v_{z}$ of the ion velocity, where $m$ is the ion mass and $T$ is the ion temperature.\n- The nonrelativistic Doppler relation for small shifts $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_{0} \\approx v_{z}/c$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n- The fact that the convolution of two Gaussian functions is Gaussian, with the total variance equal to the sum of the individual variances.\n\nDerive the expression relating the physical Doppler FWHM to the ion temperature, and then compute:\n1.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: first, to determine the intrinsic Doppler broadening full width at half maximum (FWHM), $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, of the impurity emission line by deconvolving the instrument broadening; and second, to use this intrinsic width to calculate the ion temperature, $T_{i}$, of the emitting $\\mathrm{C}^{2+}$ ions, expressed as a thermal energy $k_{B}T_{i}$ in kilo–electronvolts.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Intrinsic Doppler FWHM, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$**\n\nThe measured spectral line profile is the convolution of the intrinsic Doppler-broadened profile and the instrument response profile. Both are stated to be Gaussian. A fundamental property of the convolution of two Gaussian functions is that the resulting function is also a Gaussian. If the two initial Gaussian functions have variances $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$, the convolved Gaussian has a variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2$ that is the sum of the individual variances:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2 = \\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 $$\nIn this problem, the measured profile corresponds to the total convolved profile, the intrinsic Doppler profile is one component, and the instrument response is the other. Let $\\sigma_{\\text{meas}}$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and $\\sigma_{\\text{inst}}$ be the standard deviations in wavelength corresponding to the measured, Doppler, and instrumental profiles, respectively. The relationship is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{meas}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{inst}}^2 $$\nFor any Gaussian distribution, the FWHM, denoted by $\\Delta\\lambda$, is related to its standard deviation $\\sigma$ by a constant factor:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\cdot \\sigma $$\nFrom this, we can express the variance $\\sigma^2$ in terms of the FWHM $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{(2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2})^2} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{8\\ln 2} $$\nSubstituting this relationship back into the variance addition formula, we find:\n$$ \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{meas}})^2}{8\\ln 2} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}})^2}{8\\ln 2} + \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inst}})^2}{8\\ln 2} $$\nThe constant factor $8\\ln 2$ cancels, yielding a simple quadratic relationship for the FWHMs:\n$$ (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{meas}})^2 = (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}})^2 + (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inst}})^2 $$\nWe can now solve for the intrinsic Doppler FWHM, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{meas}})^2 - (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inst}})^2} $$\nUsing the given values $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.3730\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inst}} = 0.1200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\sqrt{(0.3730\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2 - (0.1200\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\sqrt{0.139129\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 - 0.014400\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} = \\sqrt{0.124729\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} \\approx 0.353170\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the intrinsic physical Gaussian FWHM is $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.3532\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Ion Temperature, $T_{i}$**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to relate this Doppler FWHM, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, to the ion temperature, $T_{i}$. We start from the provided one-dimensional Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the line-of-sight velocity component, $v_z$, of the ions:\n$$ f(v_z) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m v_z^2}{2 k_B T_i}\\right) $$\nThis is a Gaussian distribution in $v_z$ with a mean of $0$ and variance $\\sigma_{v_z}^2 = k_B T_i / m$.\n\nThe nonrelativistic Doppler shift relates the line-of-sight velocity to the observed wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda - \\lambda_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_z}{c} \\quad \\implies \\quad v_z = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = c \\frac{\\lambda - \\lambda_0}{\\lambda_0} $$\nThe intensity profile of the spectral line, $I(\\lambda)$, as a function of wavelength $\\lambda$, is determined by this velocity distribution. By substituting the expression for $v_z$ into the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we get the line shape:\n$$ I(\\lambda) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m}{2 k_B T_i} \\left(c \\frac{\\lambda - \\lambda_0}{\\lambda_0}\\right)^2\\right) $$\n$$ I(\\lambda) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m c^2}{2 k_B T_i \\lambda_0^2} (\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2\\right) $$\nThis is a Gaussian function in $\\lambda$ of the form $\\exp(-(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2 / (2\\sigma_\\lambda^2))$, where $\\sigma_\\lambda$ is the standard deviation of the wavelength distribution. By comparing the exponents, we identify the variance $\\sigma_\\lambda^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_\\lambda^2} = \\frac{m c^2}{2 k_B T_i \\lambda_0^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\sigma_\\lambda^2 = \\frac{k_B T_i \\lambda_0^2}{m c^2} $$\nNext, we relate this variance to the Doppler FWHM, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$. Using the standard FWHM formula for a Gaussian:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\cdot \\sigma_\\lambda $$\nSquaring both sides and substituting the expression for $\\sigma_\\lambda^2$:\n$$ (\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}})^2 = (8\\ln 2) \\sigma_\\lambda^2 = (8\\ln 2) \\left(\\frac{k_B T_i \\lambda_0^2}{m c^2}\\right) $$\nThis equation provides the desired relationship between the Doppler FWHM and the ion temperature. We now solve for the thermal energy, $k_{B}T_{i}$:\n$$ k_B T_i = \\frac{m c^2}{8\\ln 2} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\lambda_0}\\right)^2 $$\nWe can now substitute the numerical values to compute $k_B T_i$.\nThe mass of a $\\mathrm{C}^{2+}$ ion is given as $m = 12\\,u$:\n$$ m = 12 \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 1.99264687992 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg} $$\nOther given values are:\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.353170 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ (using the unrounded value for precision)\n- $\\lambda_0 = 465.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\nPlugging these values into the expression for $k_B T_i$:\n$$ k_B T_i = \\frac{(1.992646... \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (2.99792458 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^2}{8\\ln 2} \\left(\\frac{0.353170 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{465.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ k_B T_i \\approx \\frac{(1.79086 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{5.545177} \\left(7.59505 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ k_B T_i \\approx (3.22956 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J}) (5.76848 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 1.86303 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilo–electronvolts (keV).

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the relationship between the variance of a Doppler-broadened spectral line and the ion temperature, and then to calculate the fractional bias in an inferred temperature measurement due to an incorrect assumption about the impurity ion's mass.\n\nThe velocity of ions along the line of sight, denoted by $v$, is assumed to follow a one-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The probability density function for an ion of mass $m$ at a true temperature $T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}$ is given by:\n$$f(v) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe non-relativistic Doppler shift relates the observed wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda - \\lambda_0$ to the velocity $v$ of the emitting ion along the line of sight:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v}{c}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the transition.\n\nWe can express the velocity $v$ in terms of the wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$v = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$$\n\nThe spectral line shape, $I(\\lambda)$, is proportional to the probability distribution of the velocities expressed in terms of wavelength. The intensity in a wavelength interval $d\\lambda$ is proportional to the probability of finding an ion in the corresponding velocity interval $dv$. Thus, $I(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\propto f(v) dv$. Since $\\lambda$ and $v$ are linearly related, $d\\lambda = (\\lambda_0/c) dv$, the line shape as a function of wavelength shift, $I(\\Delta\\lambda)$, is directly proportional to the velocity distribution function $f(v)$:\n$$I(\\Delta\\lambda) \\propto f\\left(v=c\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v$ into the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we get the spectral line shape:\n$$I(\\Delta\\lambda) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m \\left(c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}\\right)^2}{2 k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m c^2 (\\Delta\\lambda)^2}{2 \\lambda_0^2 k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the functional form of a Gaussian distribution for the variable $\\Delta\\lambda$.

An analyst measures the variance of the line from the experimental spectrum. Let this measured variance be $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\lambda, \\text{meas}}^2$. This measured value is a property of the plasma and is determined by the true physical parameters:\n$$\\sigma_{\\Delta\\lambda, \\text{meas}}^2 = \\frac{\\lambda_0^2 k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}{m c^2}$$\nwhere $m$ is the true mass of the emitting ion.\n\nThe analyst then uses this measured variance to infer the temperature, $T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}}$, but erroneously assumes the ion has a mass $m'$. The formula used for inference is obtained by rearranging the variance equation:\n$$T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}} = \\frac{m' c^2}{\\lambda_0^2 k_B} \\sigma_{\\Delta\\lambda, \\text{meas}}^2$$\nTo find how the inferred temperature scales with the true temperature, we substitute the expression for $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\lambda, \\text{meas}}^2$ into the inference formula:\n$$T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}} = \\frac{m' c^2}{\\lambda_0^2 k_B} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_0^2 k_B T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}{m c^2} \\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the scaling relation:\n$$T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}} = T_{i,\\mathrm{true}} \\frac{m'}{m}$$\nThis shows that the inferred temperature is equal to the true temperature scaled by the ratio of the assumed mass to the true mass.\n\nThe problem defines the fractional bias in the inferred temperature as:\n$$\\frac{\\delta T_{i}}{T_{i}} \\equiv \\frac{T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}{T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}}} - 1$$\nUsing our derived scaling relation, we can find the ratio $\\frac{T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}{T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}}}$:\n$$\\frac{T_{i,\\mathrm{true}}}{T_{i,\\mathrm{inf}}} = \\frac{m}{m'}$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of fractional bias gives:\n$$\\frac{\\delta T_{i}}{T_{i}} = \\frac{m}{m'} - 1$$\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specific case given.

We can express $n_1$ as $n_1 = N - n_2$ and substitute this into the rate equation:\n$$(N - n_2) n_e C_{12}(T_e) = n_2 (n_e C_{21}(T_e) + A_{21})$$\nNow, we solve for $n_2$:\n$$N n_e C_{12} - n_2 n_e C_{12} = n_2 (n_e C_{21} + A_{21})$$\n$$N n_e C_{12} = n_2 (n_e C_{12} + n_e C_{21} + A_{21})$$\n$$n_2 = \\frac{N n_e C_{12}(T_e)}{n_e (C_{12}(T_e) + C_{21}(T_e)) + A_{21}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{21}$ from Step 1 gives:\n$$n_2 = \\frac{N n_e C_{12}(T_e)}{n_e C_{12}(T_e) \\left(1 + \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) + A_{21}}$$\n\n**Step 3: Volumetric Emissivity**\n\nThe volumetric emissivity, $\\varepsilon$, is the power radiated per unit volume. For the $2 \\rightarrow 1$ transition, it is given by the product of the upper level population density $n_2$, the spontaneous emission rate $A_{21}$, and the energy of each emitted photon, $h\\nu = \\Delta E$:\n$$\\varepsilon = n_2 A_{21} \\Delta E$$\nTo obtain the emissivity in units of $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, the photon energy $\\Delta E$ must be converted from electron-volts to Joules.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $n_e = 3.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $T_e = 20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $N = 2.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $g_1 = 1$, $g_2 = 3$\n- $\\Delta E = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $A_{21} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $C_{12}(T_e) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\nFirst, calculate the exponential term's argument:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_e} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{20\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = 0.15$$\nNext, calculate the de-excitation rate coefficient $C_{21}(T_e)$:\n$$C_{21}(T_e) = \\frac{1}{3} (2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\exp(0.15)$$\n$$C_{21}(T_e) \\approx (\\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-8}) \\times 1.1618342 = 7.745561 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the terms in the expression for $n_2$:\nNumerator:\n$$N n_e C_{12} = (2.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(3.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nDenominator:\n$$n_e(C_{12} + C_{21}) + A_{21} = (3.0 \\times 10^{19})(2.0 \\times 10^{-8} + 7.745561 \\times 10^{-9}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{8}$$\n$$= (3.0 \\times 10^{19})(2.7745561 \\times 10^{-8}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{8}$$\n$$= 8.3236683 \\times 10^{11} + 1.0 \\times 10^{8} = 8.3246683 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nCalculate $n_2$:\n$$n_2 = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{8.3246683 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.441490 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nFinally, calculate the emissivity $\\varepsilon$.
