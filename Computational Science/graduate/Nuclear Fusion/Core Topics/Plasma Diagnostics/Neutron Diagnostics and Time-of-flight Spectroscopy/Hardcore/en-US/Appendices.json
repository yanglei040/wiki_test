This first practice exercise  guides you through the essential derivation of the non-relativistic relationship between a neutron's kinetic energy and its flight time.

            "solution": "The problem statement provided is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of non-relativistic kinematics, and well-posed. The scenario described is a standard application of time-of-flight spectroscopy in nuclear physics, and all provided information is consistent and sufficient for the requested derivations. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement. All expressions will be derived symbolically in terms of the given parameters: neutron mass $m_n$, flight path length $L$, time-of-flight $t$, neutron kinetic energy $E$, and the corresponding bin widths $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta E$.\n\n1. Derivation of the energy-time relation $E(t)$.\n\nWe begin with the two fundamental relations provided: the definition of velocity for an object traveling a distance $L$ in time $t$ with constant velocity $v$, and the non-relativistic kinetic energy $E$.\n\nFor a neutron traveling along a straight flight path of length $L$, the time-of-flight $t$ is related to its velocity $v$ by:\n$$v = \\frac{L}{t}$$\nThis assumes the neutron emission time is $t=0$ and the arrival time is $t$.\n\nThe non-relativistic kinetic energy $E$ of the neutron with mass $m_n$ and velocity $v$ is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m_n v^2$$\nTo find the kinetic energy $E$ as a function of the measured time-of-flight $t$, we substitute the expression for $v$ into the kinetic energy equation:\n$$E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} m_n \\left(\\frac{L}{t}\\right)^2$$\nThis simplifies to the final mapping between a time bin edge $t$ and the corresponding energy bin edge $E$:\n$$E(t) = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2 t^2}$$\nThis expression shows that energy is inversely proportional to the square of the time-of-flight, which is a characteristic feature of time-of-flight spectroscopy. High-energy neutrons arrive at early times (small $t$), while low-energy neutrons arrive at later times (large $t$).\n\n2. Derivation of the relation between time-bin width $\\Delta t$ and energy-bin width $\\Delta E$.\n\nTo relate a small time interval $\\Delta t$ to the corresponding energy interval $\\Delta E$, we use differentials. This requires calculating the derivative of the energy function $E(t)$ with respect to time $t$.\nStarting with the expression $E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 t^{-2}$, we apply the power rule for differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 t^{-2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 (-2 t^{-3}) = - \\frac{m_n L^2}{t^3}$$\nFor small, finite bin widths $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta E$, we can approximate the relationship using the derivative:\n$$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{dE}{dt} \\Delta t$$\nThe bin widths $\\Delta E$ and $\\Delta t$ are inherently positive quantities representing the size of the interval. Therefore, we consider the magnitude of the relationship:\n$$|\\Delta E| \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{dt} \\right| |\\Delta t|$$\nSubstituting the expression for the derivative's magnitude gives the relation between the bin widths:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{m_n L^2}{t^3} \\Delta t$$\nThe negative sign from the derivative simply signifies that as $t$ increases, $E$ decreases.\n\n3. Derivation of the time-bin width $\\Delta t(E)$ for uniform energy binning.\n\nThe final task is to determine the time-binning scheme, $\\Delta t(E)$, that results in energy bins of a constant width $\\Delta E$. We start by rearranging the relationship from part 2 to solve for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{t^3}{m_n L^2} \\Delta E$$\nThis expression currently gives $\\Delta t$ as a function of $t$. To express it as a function of energy $E$, we must substitute for $t^3$. We can find an expression for $t$ in terms of $E$ from the result of part 1:\n$$E = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2 t^2}$$\nSolving for $t^2$:\n$$t^2 = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2E}$$\nTaking the cube of the square root of this expression gives $t^3$:\n$$t^3 = (t^2)^{3/2} = \\left(\\frac{m_n L^2}{2E}\\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{(m_n L^2)^{3/2}}{(2E)^{3/2}} = \\frac{m_n^{3/2} L^3}{2^{3/2} E^{3/2}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $t^3$ back into our equation for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{m_n L^2} \\left( \\frac{m_n^{3/2} L^3}{2^{3/2} E^{3/2}} \\right) \\Delta E$$\nSimplifying the terms involving $m_n$ and $L$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{L^{3-2} m_n^{3/2-1}}{2^{3/2} E^{3/2}} \\Delta E = \\frac{L m_n^{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{2} E^{3/2}} \\Delta E$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\Delta t$ as a function of energy $E$ and the constant energy-bin width $\\Delta E$. It shows that to maintain a constant $\\Delta E$, the time-bin width $\\Delta t$ must vary as $E^{-3/2}$. This means that smaller time bins are required at higher energies (where energy changes rapidly with time) and larger time bins are required at lower energies (where energy changes more slowly with time).\n\nThe two final expressions requested are the mapping $E(t)$ and the function $\\Delta t(E)$.\n(i) $E(t) = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2 t^2}$\n(ii) $\\Delta t(E) = \\frac{L \\sqrt{m_n}}{2\\sqrt{2} E^{3/2}} \\Delta E$",

First, the derivation of the relativistic and non-relativistic calibration curves for the time-of-flight spectrometer. Second, the symbolic derivation of the fractional energy error. Third, the numerical calculation of this error for the specified neutron energy.\n\n### Part 1: Relativistic Calibration Curve $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}(t)$\n\nThe total energy $E_{\\mathrm{total}}$ of a particle with rest mass $m_n$ and speed $v$ is given by the special theory of relativity as:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\gamma m_n c^2$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$\nThe kinetic energy, $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, is the total energy minus the rest mass energy, $m_n c^2$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = E_{\\mathrm{total}} - m_n c^2 = (\\gamma - 1) m_n c^2$$\nFor a time-of-flight spectrometer with a flight path of length $L$, the measured time-of-flight $t$ for a particle traveling at a constant speed $v$ is given by $t = L/v$. Therefore, the speed is $v = L/t$. Note that $v < c$, which implies $t > L/c$.\n\nWe substitute $v = L/t$ into the expression for the Lorentz factor:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(L/t)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{L^2}{c^2 t^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{c^2 t^2 - L^2}{c^2 t^2}}} = \\frac{ct}{\\sqrt{c^2 t^2 - L^2}}$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $\\gamma$ into the relativistic kinetic energy equation yields the exact relativistic calibration curve, $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}(t)$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{rel}}(t) = \\left( \\frac{ct}{\\sqrt{c^2 t^2 - L^2}} - 1 \\right) m_n c^2$$\n\n### Part 2: Non-Relativistic Calibration Curve $E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t)$\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, the kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m_n$ and speed $v$ is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nr}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_n v^2$$\nUsing the same relationship between speed, distance, and time, $v=L/t$, we can write the non-relativistic calibration curve, $E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t)$, as:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2} m_n \\left(\\frac{L}{t}\\right)^2 = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2t^2}$$\nThis expression can also be obtained as the low-speed limit ($v \\ll c$, or equivalently $t \\gg L/c$) of the relativistic formula.\n\n### Part 3: Fractional Energy Error Calculation\n\nWe are asked to calculate the fractional energy error, $\\delta$, for a neutron with a true kinetic energy of $E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. The error is defined as:\n$$\n\\delta \\equiv \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t)-E_{\\mathrm{rel}}(t)}{E_{\\mathrm{rel}}(t)}\n$$\nHere, $t$ is the time-of-flight corresponding to the true relativistic kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nFirst, we express the time $t$ symbolically in terms of the true energy $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. From the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = (\\gamma - 1)m_n c^2 \\implies \\gamma = 1 + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{m_n c^2}$$\nThe speed $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1-1/\\gamma^2}$. The time-of-flight is $t=L/v$. Substituting $v$ gives:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{c\\sqrt{1-1/\\gamma^2}} \\implies t^2 = \\frac{L^2}{c^2(1-1/\\gamma^2)} = \\frac{L^2 \\gamma^2}{c^2(\\gamma^2-1)}$$\nNow, we evaluate the non-relativistic energy $E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t)$ using this time $t$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t) = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2t^2} = \\frac{m_n L^2}{2} \\left[ \\frac{c^2(\\gamma^2-1)}{L^2 \\gamma^2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} m_n c^2 \\frac{\\gamma^2-1}{\\gamma^2}$$\nThis is the energy one would erroneously infer using the non-relativistic formula for the time $t$ corresponding to the true relativistic energy $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n\nNow we can write the fractional error $\\delta$ in terms of $\\gamma$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{nr}}(t) - E_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{E_{\\mathrm{rel}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m_n c^2 \\frac{\\gamma^2-1}{\\gamma^2} - (\\gamma-1)m_n c^2}{(\\gamma-1)m_n c^2}$$\nWe can cancel the term $(\\gamma-1)m_n c^2$ from the numerator and denominator, noting that $\\gamma^2-1 = (\\gamma-1)(\\gamma+1)$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(\\gamma-1)(\\gamma+1)}{\\gamma^2} m_n c^2}{(\\gamma-1)m_n c^2} - 1 = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{2\\gamma^2} - 1$$\nThis elegant result shows that the fractional error depends only on the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$, which itself depends only on the ratio of the kinetic energy to the rest mass energy. The flight path $L$ and the speed of light $c$ are not individually required for this calculation.\n\nWe are given the true kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and the neutron rest mass energy $m_n c^2 = 939.565\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. We first calculate $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = 1 + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{m_n c^2} = 1 + \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{939.565\\,\\mathrm{MeV}} \\approx 1.021286205$$\nNow we substitute this value of $\\gamma$ into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1.021286205+1}{2(1.021286205)^2} - 1 = \\frac{2.021286205}{2(1.04302562)} - 1 = \\frac{2.021286205}{2.08605124} - 1$$\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.96895329 - 1 = -0.03104671$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\delta \\approx -0.03105$$",

A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\nThe energy resolution, $\\sigma_E$, is the uncertainty in the measurement of the neutron's kinetic energy, $E$. This uncertainty arises from the uncertainty in the measurement of its time of flight, $\\sigma_t$. We must first establish the relationship between $E$ and the time of flight, $t$.\n\nFirst, we justify the non-relativistic approximation as requested. The neutron rest mass energy, $E_0$, is given by:\n$$E_0 = m_n c^2$$\nUsing the provided mass $m_n = 1.675 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg and the speed of light $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$$E_0 = (1.675 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\approx 1.505 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J}$$\nConverting this to MeV using $1$ MeV $= 1.602 \\times 10^{-13}$ J:\n$$E_0 \\approx \\frac{1.505 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ J/MeV}} \\approx 939.6 \\text{ MeV}$$\nThe neutron's kinetic energy is given as $E = 14$ MeV. The ratio of kinetic energy to rest mass energy is:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{14 \\text{ MeV}}{939.6 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.015$$\nSince the kinetic energy is only about $1.5\\%$ of the rest mass energy, the neutron's velocity is significantly less than the speed of light, and relativistic effects will be small. The non-relativistic approximation is therefore justified for this estimation.\n\nUnder the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy $E$ of a neutron with mass $m_n$ and velocity $v$ is:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m_n v^2$$\nThe velocity $v$ is determined by the time of flight $t$ over the distance $L$:\n$$v = \\frac{L}{t}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v$ into the energy equation, we relate energy directly to time of flight:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m_n \\left(\\frac{L}{t}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 t^{-2}$$\nTo find the energy resolution $\\sigma_E$ resulting from the timing uncertainty $\\sigma_t$, we use the propagation of uncertainty formula. For a function $E(t)$, the uncertainty is given by $\\sigma_E = \\left|\\frac{dE}{dt}\\right| \\sigma_t$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $E$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 t^{-2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2 (-2) t^{-3} = -m_n L^2 t^{-3}$$\nA more convenient form for the uncertainty relationship is obtained by considering relative uncertainties. Taking the natural logarithm of the energy expression:\n$$\\ln(E) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2} m_n L^2\\right) - 2 \\ln(t)$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{E}\\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\frac{2}{t}$$\nRearranging for small finite uncertainties ($\\Delta E \\to \\sigma_E$, $\\Delta t \\to \\sigma_t$):\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_E}{E} = \\left|-2 \\frac{\\sigma_t}{t}\\right| = 2 \\frac{\\sigma_t}{t}$$\nThis gives the energy resolution as:\n$$\\sigma_E = 2E \\frac{\\sigma_t}{t}$$\nTo calculate $\\sigma_E$, we need to find the total timing uncertainty $\\sigma_t$ and the neutron's time of flight $t$.\nThe timing contributions are independent and Gaussian, so their variances add. The total timing uncertainty $\\sigma_t$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{scint}^2 + \\sigma_{TTS}^2 + \\sigma_{CFD}^2}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{(1.5 \\text{ ns})^2 + (0.3 \\text{ ns})^2 + (0.15 \\text{ ns})^2} = \\sqrt{2.25 + 0.09 + 0.0225} \\text{ ns} = \\sqrt{2.3625} \\text{ ns}$$\n$$\\sigma_t \\approx 1.53704 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$$\nNext, we calculate the time of flight $t$.
