Starting from the exponential dependence of electron current on bias voltage in the retarding-field region, you will extract the two most fundamental plasma parameters: the electron temperature ($T_e$) and electron density ($n_e$). This exercise  solidifies the direct link between the slope of the semi-log $I$-$V$ plot and $T_e$, and between the current's magnitude and $n_e$.",

The probe is oriented to collect electrons from a quasi-neutral, collisionless plasma with a thin sheath, and its projected collecting area is $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$. The electron energy distribution function is assumed to be Maxwellian (Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF)), and the ion current contribution is negligible over the electron-retarding bias range considered. The plasma potential is $V_p$, and the measured electron current–voltage characteristic $I_e(V)$ exhibits a linear region when $\\ln I_e$ is plotted against $V$ in the electron-retarding regime $V < V_p$.

Derivation of the Electron Current $I_e(V)$\nFor a Maxwellian plasma, electrons must have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the retarding potential energy barrier $e(V_p - V)$ to reach the probe. Integrating the Maxwellian velocity distribution over all velocities that satisfy this condition gives the electron flux $\\Gamma_e$ to the probe. The resulting electron current $I_e = eA\\Gamma_e$ is given by:\n$$ I_e(V) = I_{e,sat} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Kelvin, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $I_{e,sat}$ is the electron saturation current collected when $V \\geq V_p$. This saturation current represents the random thermal flux of electrons to the probe:\n$$ I_{e,sat} = e A n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{2\\pi m_e}} $$\nHere, $A$ is the probe area, $n_e$ is the electron density, and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\n#### 2.
