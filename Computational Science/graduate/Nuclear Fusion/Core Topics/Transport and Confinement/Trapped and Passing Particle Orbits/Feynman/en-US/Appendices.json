The problem is consistent and solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe motion of a charged particle in a slowly varying magnetic field can be described by the guiding-center approximation. In the absence of electrostatic fields, two quantities are conserved: the total energy $E$ and the magnetic moment $\\mu$.\n\nThe total energy is equal to the kinetic energy, which is constant:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\text{const}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the alpha particle and $v$ is its speed. All alpha particles are born with the same energy $E_\\alpha$.\n\nThe magnetic moment is an adiabatic invariant:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_\\perp^2}{2B} = \\text{const}$$\nwhere $v_\\perp$ is the component of the particle's velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$, and $B=|\\vec{B}|$.\n\nThe total energy can be expressed in terms of the velocity components parallel ($v_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($v_\\perp$) to the magnetic field:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_\\parallel^2 + v_\\perp^2)$$\nSubstituting $v_\\perp^2$ from the expression for $\\mu$, we get:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v_\\parallel^2 + \\mu B(\\theta)$$\nThis equation shows how the energy is partitioned between parallel motion and gyromotion as the particle moves along a field line and experiences a changing magnetic field strength $B(\\theta)$.\n\nA particle is considered \"trapped\" if its parallel motion is reversed. The point of reversal is called the turning point or bounce point, where $v_\\parallel=0$. At this point, all the particle's energy is in its perpendicular motion. Let the magnetic field at the turning point be $B_{\\text{turn}}$. The condition $v_\\parallel=0$ implies:\n$$E = \\mu B_{\\text{turn}} \\implies \\mu = \\frac{E}{B_{\\text{turn}}}$$\nSince $\\mu$ and $E$ are constant along a particle's trajectory, the value of $B_{\\text{turn}}$ is a fixed property of that particle's orbit. A particle can be trapped only if it can reach a point on the flux surface where the magnetic field is equal to its characteristic turning field, $B(\\theta) = B_{\\text{turn}}$.\n\nThe magnetic field on the flux surface is given by $B(\\theta) = B_{\\mathrm{axis}}/(1+\\epsilon \\cos\\theta)$. It has a minimum value at the outboard midplane ($\\theta=0$) and a maximum value at the inboard midplane ($\\theta=\\pi$):\n$$B_{\\min} = B(0) = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{axis}}}{1+\\epsilon}$$\n$$B_{\\max} = B(\\pi) = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{axis}}}{1-\\epsilon}$$\nFor a particle to be trapped, its turning field $B_{\\text{turn}}$ must lie within the range of magnetic field strengths available on the flux surface, i.e., $B_{\\min} < B_{\\text{turn}} \\le B_{\\max}$. If $B_{\\text{turn}} > B_{\\max}$, the particle never encounters a field strong enough to reflect it, so it circulates toroidally and is called a \"passing\" particle.\n\nThe problem asks to define a pitch parameter $\\lambda$ based on the minimum magnetic field $B_{\\min}$. A standard definition is:\n$$\\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\mu B_{\\min}}{E}$$\nAlpha particles are born at $\\theta=0$, where the field is $B_{\\min}$. Let $\\xi_0$ be the pitch angle at birth, defined as the angle between the particle's velocity vector and the magnetic field line. At this location, $v_\\perp = v \\sin\\xi_0$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m (v \\sin\\xi_0)^2}{2 B_{\\min}} = \\frac{2E \\sin^2\\xi_0}{2 B_{\\min}} = \\frac{E \\sin^2\\xi_0}{B_{\\min}}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\mu$ into the definition of $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{E \\sin^2\\xi_0}{B_{\\min}}\\right) B_{\\min}}{E} = \\sin^2\\xi_0$$\nThus, the parameter $\\lambda$ is the square of the sine of the pitch angle at the point of minimum magnetic field.\n\nWe can now formulate the trapping criterion in terms of $\\lambda$. A particle is trapped if $B_{\\text{turn}} \\le B_{\\max}$. From $\\mu = E/B_{\\text{turn}}$, we have $B_{\\text{turn}} = E/\\mu$. The trapping condition becomes $E/\\mu \\le B_{\\max}$, or $\\mu \\ge E/B_{\\max}$.\nSubstituting the definition of $\\lambda$, $\\mu = \\lambda E/B_{\\min}$:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda E}{B_{\\min}} \\ge \\frac{E}{B_{\\max}} \\implies \\lambda \\ge \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}$$\nThe value of $\\lambda = \\sin^2\\xi_0$ can range from $0$ (for purely parallel motion) to $1$ (for purely perpendicular motion). Therefore, the full ranges for trapped and passing particles are:\n- Trapped particles: $\\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} < \\lambda \\le 1$\n- Passing particles: $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}$\nThe boundary case $\\lambda = B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}$ is the \"trapped-passing boundary\". This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the fraction of trapped alpha particles. The particles are born at $\\theta=0$ with an isotropic velocity distribution. In velocity space, this means the probability of a particle having a certain velocity vector direction is uniform over a sphere. The number of particles $dN$ with pitch angles between $\\xi_0$ and $\\xi_0 + d\\xi_0$ is proportional to the solid angle element, $d\\Omega = 2\\pi \\sin\\xi_0 d\\xi_0$. So, $dN \\propto \\sin\\xi_0 d\\xi_0$.\n\nThe total number of particles, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is found by integrating over all possible pitch angles, from $\\xi_0=0$ to $\\xi_0=\\pi$:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} \\propto \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\xi_0 \\, d\\xi_0 = [-\\cos\\xi_0]_0^\\pi = -(-1) - (-1) = 2$$\nThe number of trapped particles, $N_{\\text{trapped}}$, is found by integrating over the range of pitch angles that satisfy the trapping condition $\\lambda > B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}$, which is $\\sin^2\\xi_0 > B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}$. This is equivalent to $|\\sin\\xi_0| > \\sqrt{B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}}$. Since $\\xi_0 \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\sin\\xi_0 \\ge 0$, so the condition is $\\sin\\xi_0 > \\sqrt{B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}}$.\n\nLet $\\xi_{c} = \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{B_{\\min}/B_{\\max}}\\right)$. The trapping condition is satisfied for $\\xi_0$ in the range $(\\xi_c, \\pi - \\xi_c)$.\n$$N_{\\text{trapped}} \\propto \\int_{\\xi_c}^{\\pi - \\xi_c} \\sin\\xi_0 \\, d\\xi_0 = [-\\cos\\xi_0]_{\\xi_c}^{\\pi - \\xi_c}$$\n$$N_{\\text{trapped}} \\propto -\\cos(\\pi - \\xi_c) - (-\\cos\\xi_c) = -(-\\cos\\xi_c) + \\cos\\xi_c = 2\\cos\\xi_c$$\nThe fraction of trapped particles, $f_{\\text{trapped}}$, is the ratio $N_{\\text{trapped}}/N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{trapped}} = \\frac{2\\cos\\xi_c}{2} = \\cos\\xi_c$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos\\xi_c = \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\xi_c}$, we get:\n$$f_{\\text{trapped}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $B_{\\min}$ and $B_{\\max}$:\n$$\\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{axis}}/(1+\\epsilon)}{B_{\\mathrm{axis}}/(1-\\epsilon)} = \\frac{1-\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}$$\nSo, the trapped fraction is:\n$$f_{\\text{trapped}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1-\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+\\epsilon) - (1-\\epsilon)}{1+\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}}$$\nThe problem provides $R_0 = 6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $a = 2\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The inverse aspect ratio for the flux surface under consideration is:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{a}{R_0} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $f_{\\text{trapped}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{trapped}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1/3)}{1 + (1/3)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2/3}{4/3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$f_{\\text{trapped}} \\approx 0.70710678...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction of trapped alpha particles is $0.7071$.",

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, theoretical problem in the field of plasma physics concerning neoclassical transport near the trapped-passing separatrix in a tokamak.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Asymptotic form of the bounce time $T_{b}(\\delta\\lambda)$\n\nThe bounce time $T_{b}$ for a trapped particle is the time it takes to complete one full orbit between its turning points. It is given by the integral of the inverse of the parallel speed $|v_{\\parallel}|$ along the magnetic field line over a closed orbit path $s$:\n$$\nT_{b} = \\oint \\frac{ds}{|v_{\\parallel}|}\n$$\nThe problem provides the parallel speed as $v_{\\parallel}(\\theta, \\lambda) = v \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda B(\\theta)}$. We are to consider a particle near the trapped-passing separatrix, on the trapped side, so its pitch parameter is $\\lambda = \\lambda_{c} + \\delta\\lambda$ with $\\delta\\lambda \\to 0^{+}$. Here, $\\lambda_{c} = 1/B_{\\max}$.\n\nThe particle is trapped in the magnetic well, meaning it is confined to a region where $B(\\theta)  1/\\lambda$. It reflects at turning points, where $v_{\\parallel}=0$, which implies $B(\\theta_{t}) = 1/\\lambda$. As $\\lambda \\to \\lambda_{c}^{+}$, the turning points approach the location of the magnetic field maximum, which is specified to be at $\\theta=\\pi$. The divergence of the bounce time arises from the particle spending a long time near these turning points. We can, therefore, find the leading-order divergence by analyzing the integral in the vicinity of $\\theta=\\pi$, using the provided expansion for the magnetic field in terms of $\\vartheta = \\pi - \\theta$: $B(\\vartheta) = B_{\\max} - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa \\vartheta^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we find the location of the turning points $\\pm\\vartheta_{t}$.\n$$\nB(\\vartheta_{t}) = B_{\\max} - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa \\vartheta_{t}^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{c} + \\delta\\lambda}\n$$\nUsing $\\lambda_{c} = 1/B_{\\max}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{B_{\\max}} + \\delta\\lambda} = B_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + B_{\\max}\\delta\\lambda} \\right) \\approx B_{\\max}(1 - B_{\\max}\\delta\\lambda)\n$$\nfor small $\\delta\\lambda$.

The dominant contribution to the bounce time comes from the vicinity of the two turning points. The time to pass from $\\vartheta_t$ to some angle $\\vartheta_1 \\gg \\vartheta_t$ is:\n$$\nT_{passage} = \\int_{\\vartheta_{t}}^{\\vartheta_{1}} \\frac{d\\vartheta}{|v_{\\parallel}|} \\approx \\int_{\\vartheta_{t}}^{\\vartheta_{1}} \\frac{d\\vartheta}{v\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{c}\\kappa}{2}} \\sqrt{\\vartheta^{2} - \\vartheta_{t}^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\int_{\\vartheta_{t}}^{\\vartheta_{1}} \\frac{d\\vartheta}{\\sqrt{\\vartheta^{2} - \\vartheta_{t}^{2}}}\n$$\nwhere we have used the definition $\\Omega \\equiv v \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{c}\\,\\kappa}{2}}$. The integral is a standard form:\n$$\nT_{passage} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\left[ \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\vartheta}{\\vartheta_{t}}\\right) \\right]_{\\vartheta_{t}}^{\\vartheta_{1}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\left( \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\vartheta_{1}}{\\vartheta_{t}}\\right) - \\arccosh(1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\vartheta_{1}}{\\vartheta_{t}}\\right)\n$$\nThe total bounce time $T_{b}$ includes two such passages (one near each turning point), plus the time spent traversing the rest of the orbit, which is non-divergent. The leading-order asymptotic behavior is determined by the passages near the turning points. For small $\\vartheta_t$, $\\vartheta_1/\\vartheta_t \\gg 1$, and we can use the asymptotic expansion $\\arccosh(x) \\approx \\ln(2x)$.\n$$\nT_{b} \\sim \\frac{2}{\\Omega} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\vartheta_{1}}{\\vartheta_{t}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\Omega} (\\ln(2\\vartheta_1) - \\ln\\vartheta_t)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\vartheta_{t} \\propto \\sqrt{\\delta\\lambda}$:\n$$\nT_{b} \\sim \\frac{2}{\\Omega} \\left( \\text{const} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\delta\\lambda) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta\\lambda}\\right) + \\text{const'}\n$$\nThis can be written in the desired form:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\delta\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C}{\\delta\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant incorporating the geometric factors. This confirms the logarithmic divergence.\n\n### Part 2: Effective bounce time $T_{b}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$\n\nIn the presence of collisions, the pitch parameter $\\lambda$ of a particle is not constant but undergoes a random walk due to pitch-angle scattering. The characteristic time scale for this scattering is the collision time, $t_{c} \\sim 1/\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is the collision frequency.\n\nThe collisionless bounce time $T_{b}(\\delta\\lambda)$ diverges as $\\delta\\lambda \\to 0$. This means that a particle with a pitch parameter infinitesimally close to the separatrix would, in a collisionless model, take an infinitely long time to complete a bounce. However, on a time scale longer than the collision time $t_c$, the particle's pitch parameter will have changed significantly due to collisions, and it will no longer be on the original trajectory with the fixed value of $\\delta\\lambda$.\n\nTherefore, the physical process of traversing the separatrix region is limited by the shorter of two timescales: the collisionless bounce time $T_{b}(\\delta\\lambda)$ and the collision time $t_{c}$. The logarithmic divergence of $T_{b}$ is effectively \"cut off\" when the bounce time exceeds the collision time. The longest meaningful time a particle can be said to spend on a near-separatrix orbit is the collision time itself.\n$$\nT_{b}^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\nu}\n$$\nThis cutoff provides a regularization for any physical quantity that depends on the divergent bounce time. By equating the asymptotic expression for $T_b$ with this effective time, we can determine the characteristic scale of the regularized process.\n$$\nT_{b}^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C}{\\delta\\lambda}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\nu}\n$$\nThis implies that for processes occurring at the separatrix boundary layer, the divergent logarithmic factor $\\ln(C/\\delta\\lambda)$ is effectively replaced by the dimensionless ratio $\\Omega/\\nu$.\n\n### Part 3: Effective orbit-averaged diffusion coefficient $\\hat{D}_{\\mathrm{tp}}$\n\nWe are asked to find the effective orbit-averaged diffusion coefficient, $\\hat{D}_{\\mathrm{tp}}$, for particles crossing the trapped-passing boundary. Diffusion is a random walk process, characterized by a coefficient $D \\sim (\\text{step size})^{2} \\times (\\text{step rate})$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the \"effective crossing rate is limited by the collision time cutoff at the separatrix\". As established in Part 2, this means the characteristic time for a step (i.e., a crossing event) is $T_{step} = T_{b}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1/\\nu$. The frequency of these steps is therefore $f_{step} = 1/T_{step} = \\nu$.\n\nThe problem provides a \"small, constant, dimensionless orbit-averaged diffusion amplitude $\\hat{D}_{0}$ in $\\lambda$\". In the context of this simplified heuristic model, this term is interpreted as representing the mean-square displacement in $\\lambda$ per characteristic event (a separatrix crossing). Thus, we identify the step size squared as:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\lambda)^2 = \\hat{D}_{0}\n$$\nThe physical diffusion coefficient in $\\lambda$-space, $D_{\\mathrm{tp}}$, is given by the product of the mean-square step size and the step frequency:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{tp}} = (\\Delta\\lambda)^2 \\times f_{step} = \\hat{D}_{0} \\nu\n$$\nThe problem asks for the effective diffusion coefficient in dimensionless variables, $\\hat{D}_{\\mathrm{tp}}$. The normalization is based on the characteristic frequency $\\Omega$, with normalized time $\\tau = \\Omega t$. A dimensionless diffusion coefficient $\\hat{D}$ is related to the physical one $D$ by $\\hat{D} = D/\\Omega$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{D}_{\\mathrm{tp}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{tp}}}{\\Omega} = \\frac{\\hat{D}_{0} \\nu}{\\Omega}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the normalized collisionality, $\\hat{\\nu} = \\nu/\\Omega$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\n\\hat{D}_{\\mathrm{tp}} = \\hat{D}_{0} \\hat{\\nu}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\hat{D}_{0}\\hat{\\nu}}\n$$"
