The model relies on the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear definition of the quantity to be calculated ($f_{t,s}$) and sufficient information (the magnetic field model and particle distribution function) to derive it. All terms are standard and objective. The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nWe begin with the two conserved quantities for collisionless guiding-center motion: the total energy $E$ and the magnetic moment $\\mu$.\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^{2} + \\mu B$$\nA particle is trapped if it has a turning point, where $v_{\\parallel} = 0$. This occurs at a magnetic field strength $B_{turn}$ such that $E = \\mu B_{turn}$. A particle is trapped if its turning point occurs at a magnetic field strength that is accessible on its flux surface. The condition for this is that the particle's value of $E/\\mu$ is less than the maximum magnetic field on the surface, $E/\\mu  B_{max}$.\n\nWe evaluate $E$ and $\\mu$ at the outboard midplane ($\\theta = 0$), where the magnetic field is at its minimum, $B_{min}$. At this location, the particle's velocity is $v$, with components $v_{\\parallel 0}$ and $v_{\\perp 0}$. The invariants are:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}$$\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp 0}^{2}}{2 B_{min}}$$\nSubstituting these into the trapping condition $E  \\mu B_{max}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}  \\left(\\frac{m v_{\\perp 0}^{2}}{2 B_{min}}\\right) B_{max}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$v^{2}  v_{\\perp 0}^{2} \\frac{B_{max}}{B_{min}}$$\nWe relate $v_{\\perp 0}$ to the pitch-angle cosine at the outboard midplane, $\\xi_{0} = v_{\\parallel 0}/v$. From the relation $v^{2} = v_{\\parallel 0}^{2} + v_{\\perp 0}^{2}$, we have $v_{\\perp 0}^{2} = v^{2} - v_{\\parallel 0}^{2} = v^{2}(1 - \\xi_{0}^{2})$. Substituting this into the trapping inequality:\n$$v^{2}  v^{2}(1 - \\xi_{0}^{2}) \\frac{B_{max}}{B_{min}}$$\n$$1  (1 - \\xi_{0}^{2}) \\frac{B_{max}}{B_{min}}$$\nRearranging for $\\xi_{0}^{2}$ gives the trapping condition in terms of the pitch-angle cosine at the outboard midplane:\n$$\\xi_{0}^{2}  1 - \\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}}$$\nNow, we use the given magnetic field model $B(\\theta) = B_{0}/(1 + \\epsilon \\cos\\theta)$.\nThe minimum magnetic field occurs at $\\theta=0$: $B_{min} = B(0) = B_{0}/(1 + \\epsilon)$.\nThe maximum magnetic field occurs at $\\theta=\\pi$: $B_{max} = B(\\pi) = B_{0}/(1 - \\epsilon)$.\n\nThe ratio is $\\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}} = \\frac{B_{0}/(1 + \\epsilon)}{B_{0}/(1 - \\epsilon)} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}$.\nSince $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, we can expand this to leading order in $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon} = (1 - \\epsilon)(1 + \\epsilon)^{-1} \\approx (1 - \\epsilon)(1 - \\epsilon) = 1 - 2\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^{2})$$\nSubstituting this into the trapping condition for $\\xi_{0}^{2}$:\n$$\\xi_{0}^{2}  1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon) = 2\\epsilon$$\nThus, particles are trapped if their pitch-angle cosine at the outboard midplane satisfies $|\\xi_{0}|  \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$, to leading order in $\\epsilon$. This region in velocity space is often called the \"trapping cone\".\n\nThe problem defines the trapped fraction $f_{t,s}$ as the fraction of particles of species $s$ at the outboard midplane that are on trapped orbits. The distribution function is given as an isotropic local Maxwellian. The crucial property is \"isotropic,\" meaning $f_s$ depends only on the speed $v = |\\vec{v}|$, not on the direction of the velocity vector.\n\nThe fraction of trapped particles is the ratio of the volume of the trapped region in velocity space to the total volume. Since the distribution is isotropic, this simplifies to a ratio of solid angles.\n$$f_{t,s} = \\frac{\\int_{\\text{trapped}} d\\Omega}{\\int_{\\text{all}} d\\Omega}$$\nLet's use spherical coordinates in velocity space, where the pitch-angle cosine $\\xi_0$ is the cosine of the polar angle. The velocity space volume element is $d^{3}v = v^{2} dv \\, d\\Omega$, where $d\\Omega = -\\mathrm{d}\\xi_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$.\nThe integral over the total solid angle is:\n$$\\int_{\\text{all}} d\\Omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{-1}^{1} d\\xi_{0} = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi$$\nThe integral over the trapped region is defined by the limits $\\xi_{0} \\in [-\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}, \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}]$.\n$$\\int_{\\text{trapped}} d\\Omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{-\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}^{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}} d\\xi_{0} = 2\\pi \\times (2\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}) = 4\\pi\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$$\nThe trapped fraction is the ratio of these two solid angles:\n$$f_{t,s} = \\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{4\\pi} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$$\nThis is the leading-order expression for the trapped fraction for any species $s$. This result depends only on the geometric parameter $\\epsilon$ and is independent of particle mass $m_s$, charge, or temperature $T$, due to the assumption of an isotropic velocity distribution.\n\nTherefore, the trapped fraction for ions, $f_{t,i}$, and the trapped fraction for electrons, $f_{t,e}$, are identical to leading order in $\\epsilon$:\n$$f_{t,i} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$$\n$$f_{t,e} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$$\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $f_{t,i}/f_{t,e}$.\n$$\\frac{f_{t,i}}{f_{t,e}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}} = 1$$\nThe ratio of the trapped ion fraction to the trapped electron fraction is $1$.",

The integrand depends on the instantaneous radial drift velocity $v_r(\\theta)$. We need to determine the symmetry of the integrand with respect to the poloidal angle $\\theta$.

The drift velocities are perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}$, and in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak $\\boldsymbol{B} \\approx B_\\phi \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\phi$. So the drifts are primarily in the poloidal plane. The dominant drifts causing vertical motion (which has a radial component) are due to the gradient and curvature of the toroidal field.\n\n1.  **Magnetic Field Gradient and Curvature**: The toroidal field strength $B$ is strongest on the inboard side ($\\theta=\\pi$) and weakest on the outboard side ($\\theta=0$).\n    - The gradient $\\nabla B$ points from the outboard to the inboard side, predominantly in the $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_r$ direction near the top/bottom of the torus and in the poloidal plane.\n    - The field line curvature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ points towards the center of the torus, roughly in the $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_R$ direction (where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_R$ is the major radius unit vector).\n\n2.  **Drift Directions**:\n    - The $\\nabla B$ drift is proportional to $\\boldsymbol{B} \\times \\nabla B$.
