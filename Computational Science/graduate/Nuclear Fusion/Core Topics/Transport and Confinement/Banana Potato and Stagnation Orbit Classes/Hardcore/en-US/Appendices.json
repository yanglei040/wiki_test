            "solution": "The problem requires finding the fraction of magnetically trapped electrons, $f_{t}(\\epsilon)$, on a given flux surface in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak. The solution is derived from the principles of guiding-center motion, namely the conservation of energy and the first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment).\n\nAn electron's state is characterized by its total energy, $E$, and its magnetic moment, $\\mu$. These quantities are conserved along its guiding-center trajectory.\nThe total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m_{e} v^{2}$. For the ensemble of electrons considered, the speed $v$ is fixed, so $E$ is a constant parameter.\nThe magnetic moment is $\\mu = \\frac{m_{e} v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 B}$, where $v_{\\perp}$ is the component of the electron's velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, and $B=|\\vec{B}|$.\nThe electron's velocity can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, such that $v^{2} = v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2}$.\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, the perpendicular velocity at any point on the flux surface is given by $v_{\\perp}^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{2 \\mu B(\\theta)}{m_{e}}$. Using this, we can express the parallel velocity as a function of the poloidal angle $\\theta$:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\theta) = v^{2} - v_{\\perp}^{2}(\\theta) = v^{2} - \\frac{2 \\mu B(\\theta)}{m_{e}}$$\nFor a particle's trajectory to be physically real, $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\theta)$ must be non-negative. This implies that a particle with magnetic moment $\\mu$ cannot access regions where $B(\\theta)  \\frac{m_{e} v^{2}}{2 \\mu}$.\n\nA particle is defined as \"trapped\" if it is reflected by the magnetic mirror effect before it can travel completely around the torus. This means its parallel velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ becomes zero at some turning points $\\theta_{t}$. The magnetic field in the specified model varies from a minimum value $B_{\\min} = B_{0}(1-\\epsilon)$ at the outboard midplane ($\\theta=0$) to a maximum value $B_{\\max} = B_{0}(1+\\epsilon)$ at the inboard midplane ($\\theta=\\pi$). A particle is trapped if it cannot reach the point of maximum magnetic field. The limiting case, separating trapped and passing particles, is for a particle that just reaches the inboard midplane with zero parallel velocity, i.e., $v_{\\parallel}(\\pi) = 0$.\nA particle is therefore trapped if its parallel kinetic energy would be negative at the location of maximum magnetic field. The trapping condition is thus $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\pi)  0$.\n\nTo evaluate this condition, we first express the conserved quantity $\\mu$ in terms of the particle's properties at the outboard midplane ($\\theta=0$), where the pitch parameter $\\xi = v_{\\parallel}(0)/v$ is defined. At $\\theta=0$, the magnetic field is $B(0) = B_{\\min}$. The perpendicular velocity is $v_{\\perp}^{2}(0) = v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)$.\nThe magnetic moment is:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m_{e} v_{\\perp}^{2}(0)}{2 B_{\\min}} = \\frac{m_{e} (v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0))}{2 B_{\\min}}$$\nNow, we can write the parallel velocity squared at the inboard midplane, $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\pi)$, using this expression for $\\mu$:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\pi) = v^{2} - \\frac{2 \\mu B_{\\max}}{m_{e}} = v^{2} - \\frac{2 B_{\\max}}{m_{e}} \\left( \\frac{m_{e} (v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0))}{2 B_{\\min}} \\right)$$\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\pi) = v^{2} - (v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)) \\frac{B_{\\max}}{B_{\\min}}$$\nThe trapping condition $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(\\pi)  0$ becomes:\n$$v^{2} - (v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)) \\frac{B_{\\max}}{B_{\\min}}  0$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)$:\n$$v^{2}  (v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)) \\frac{B_{\\max}}{B_{\\min}}$$\n$$v^{2} \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}  v^{2} - v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)$$\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(0)  v^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} \\right)$$\nDividing by $v^{2}$ and using the definition of the pitch parameter $\\xi = v_{\\parallel}(0)/v$, we get the condition for trapped particles in terms of $\\xi$:\n$$\\xi^{2}  1 - \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}$$\nWe are given $B_{\\min} = B_{0}(1 - \\epsilon)$ and $B_{\\max} = B_{0}(1 + \\epsilon)$. The ratio is:\n$$\\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}$$\nSubstituting this into the inequality:\n$$\\xi^{2}  1 - \\frac{1 - \\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon} = \\frac{(1 + \\epsilon) - (1 - \\epsilon)}{1 + \\epsilon} = \\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}$$\nThis defines the range of the pitch parameter for trapped particles:\n$$|\\xi|  \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$$\nLet's denote the critical pitch parameter as $\\xi_{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$. Trapped particles are those with $|\\xi|  \\xi_{c}$.\n\nThe problem states that the velocity directions at the outboard midplane are isotropically distributed, which implies that $\\xi$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The probability density function (PDF) for $\\xi$ is therefore $p(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{1 - (-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}$ for $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$, and $p(\\xi) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe fraction of trapped particles, $f_{t}(\\epsilon)$, is the probability that a randomly chosen electron has a pitch parameter $\\xi$ in the trapped range, i.e., $P(|\\xi|  \\xi_{c})$.

The integral evaluates to:\n$$f_{t}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} [\\xi]_{-\\xi_{c}}^{\\xi_{c}} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\xi_{c} - (-\\xi_{c})) = \\xi_{c}$$\nTherefore, the fraction of trapped particles is given by the value of the critical pitch parameter:\n$$f_{t}(\\epsilon) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the trapped particle fraction as a function of the inverse aspect ratio $\\epsilon$.",
