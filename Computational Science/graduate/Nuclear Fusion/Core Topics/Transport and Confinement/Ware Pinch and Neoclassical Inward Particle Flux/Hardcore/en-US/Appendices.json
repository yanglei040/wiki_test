            "solution": "The goal is to estimate the radial half–width $\\Delta_{b}$ of a trapped particle banana orbit from first principles, using the conservation of magnetic moment, guiding–center drift physics, and large–aspect–ratio tokamak geometry.\n\nFoundational elements:\n\n- Magnetic moment conservation: for a particle in a slowly varying magnetic field, the magnetic moment $\\mu \\doteq m v_{\\perp}^{2}/(2 B)$ is an adiabatic invariant. As the particle samples regions of varying $B$, the parallel speed adjusts via $v_{\\parallel}^{2} = v^{2} - v_{\\perp}^{2} = v^{2}\\left(1 - \\lambda B\\right)$, where $\\lambda$ is the pitch parameter proportional to $\\mu/E$, with $E \\doteq m v^{2}/2$.\n\n- In a large–aspect–ratio tokamak, the magnetic field magnitude on a given flux surface varies poloidally with relative amplitude $\\Delta B/B \\sim \\epsilon \\doteq r/R$. A convenient representation is $B(\\theta) \\approx B_{0}\\left(1 - \\epsilon \\cos\\theta\\right)$ for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, where $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle and $B_{0}$ is a characteristic field strength on the surface. Hence the total fractional variation is $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$.\n\n- Trapped particles are those for which $v_{\\parallel}$ vanishes at turning points (mirror points), so that along their bounce motion $v_{\\parallel}^{2}$ is small compared to $v^{2}$. Because the magnetic well depth is $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, conservation of $\\mu$ implies that for trapped particles the typical parallel kinetic energy fraction is $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, i.e., $v_{\\parallel}^{2} \\sim \\epsilon\\, v^{2}$, or $v_{\\parallel} \\sim v\\, \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, where $v$ is the total speed and we assume a deeply trapped orbit such that this scaling is representative over the bounce.\n\n- The parallel distance along a field line traversed during a half–bounce is set by the connection length of the toroidal field geometry. In a large–aspect–ratio tokamak, the characteristic parallel length scale is $L_{\\parallel} \\sim q R$, where $q$ is the safety factor. For a trapped particle executing a bounce between two turning points, the parallel distance traversed over a half–bounce is of order $L_{\\parallel} \\sim q R$ (the poloidal angular extent is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for a deeply trapped orbit). Therefore, the bounce time scales as\n$$\n\\tau_{b} \\sim \\frac{L_{\\parallel}}{v_{\\parallel}} \\sim \\frac{q R}{v \\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\, ,\n$$\nso the bounce frequency is\n$$\n\\omega_{b} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\tau_{b}} \\sim \\frac{v \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{q R} \\, .\n$$\n\n- The guiding–center drift that causes radial excursion is dominated by curvature and gradient–$B$ drifts. The drift velocity transverse to the magnetic field has magnitude\n$$\nv_{d} \\sim \\frac{v_{\\perp}^{2}/2 + v_{\\parallel}^{2}}{\\Omega R_{c}} \\, ,\n$$\nwhere $R_{c} \\sim R$ is the curvature radius, and $\\Omega$ is the gyrofrequency. For trapped particles with $v_{\\parallel}^{2} \\sim \\epsilon\\, v^{2}$ and $v_{\\perp}^{2} \\sim v^{2}$, one has $v_{\\perp}^{2}/2 + v_{\\parallel}^{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$, so\n$$\nv_{d} \\sim \\frac{v^{2}}{\\Omega R} \\, .\n$$\n\nWith these ingredients, the radial half–width $\\Delta_{b}$ of a banana orbit can be estimated as the radial drift distance accumulated over approximately a half–bounce, or equivalently as the ratio of the drift speed to the bounce frequency,\n$$\n\\Delta_{b} \\sim \\frac{v_{d}}{\\omega_{b}} \\sim \\frac{\\dfrac{v^{2}}{\\Omega R}}{\\dfrac{v \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{q R}} = \\frac{q\\, v}{\\Omega\\, \\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\, .\n$$\nIntroducing the Larmor radius $\\rho \\doteq v_{\\perp}/\\Omega$, and using $v_{\\perp} \\sim v$ for a deeply trapped orbit at leading order, we obtain\n$$\n\\Delta_{b} \\sim \\frac{q\\, \\rho}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\, .\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon \\doteq r/R$, this can be written explicitly in terms of $q$, $R$, $r$, and $\\rho$ as\n$$\n\\Delta_{b} \\sim q\\, \\rho\\, \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{r}} \\, .\n$$\nInterpreting the $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ scaling: As $\\epsilon$ decreases (either larger $R$ at fixed $r$ or smaller $r$ at fixed $R$), the factor $1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ increases, making $\\Delta_{b}$ larger. Thus the banana step size grows at small $\\epsilon$, which enhances the role of trapped–particle orbits in cross–field transport. In the presence of an inductive toroidal electric field (which drives the Ware pinch), trapped particles experience a systematic inward displacement during their bounce motion. The larger banana width at smaller $\\epsilon$ amplifies the effective inward step per bounce, thereby strengthening the neoclassical inward particle flux driven by the Ware pinch in the banana regime.\n\nTherefore, the leading–order banana half–width is captured by the closed–form expression\n$$\n\\Delta_{b} = q\\, \\rho\\, \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{r}} \\, ,\n$$\nup to order–unity geometric factors that are beyond the scope of this scaling derivation.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in tokamak plasma physics.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Ware Pinch Velocity $V_{W}(r)$\n\nThe Ware pinch is an inward radial drift experienced by trapped particles in a tokamak in the presence of a toroidal electric field. It can be derived from the conservation of canonical toroidal angular momentum, $P_{\\phi}$, of a particle's guiding center.\n\nIn an axisymmetric toroidal system, the canonical momentum conjugate to the toroidal angle $\\phi$ for a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ is given by:\n$$\nP_{\\phi} = m R v_{\\phi} + q \\psi\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the major radius coordinate, $v_{\\phi}$ is the toroidal component of the velocity, and $\\psi$ is the poloidal magnetic flux function (defined as the poloidal flux per $2\\pi$ radians of toroidal angle). The magnetic field is related to $\\psi$ by $\\mathbf{B} = F(\\psi) \\nabla\\phi + \\nabla\\phi \\times \\nabla\\psi$, where $F=RB_\\phi$.\n\nThe poloidal component of the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}_p$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_p = \\nabla\\phi \\times \\nabla\\psi = \\frac{1}{R} (\\nabla\\psi \\times \\hat{\\phi})\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\phi}$ is the unit vector in the toroidal direction. For a standard tokamak configuration with a positive toroidal plasma current and positive toroidal magnetic field, the poloidal magnetic field is in the positive poloidal direction, $\\hat{\\theta}$. Assuming quasi-circular flux surfaces, $\\psi$ is a function of the minor radius $r$, so $\\nabla\\psi = \\frac{d\\psi}{dr}\\hat{r}$. The relationship is then:\n$$\nB_p \\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} (\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\phi}) = -\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} \\hat{\\theta}\n$$\nThis implies a sign convention where $B_p(r) = -\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d\\psi}{dr}$. For $B_p  0$, we must have $\\frac{d\\psi}{dr}  0$. In the large aspect ratio approximation ($R \\approx R_0$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dr} \\approx -R_0 B_p(r)\n$$\nThis is the required geometric relation between the poloidal flux, radius, and poloidal magnetic field.\n\nThe rate of change of the canonical momentum is equal to the applied generalized toroidal force. A toroidal electric field $E_{\\phi}$ exerts a force $F_{\\phi} = q E_{\\phi}$, which corresponds to a generalized force (torque) of $Q_{\\phi} = R F_{\\phi} = q R E_{\\phi}$. Thus, the equation of motion for $P_{\\phi}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_{\\phi}}{dt} = q R E_{\\phi}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\phi}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi} + q \\psi) = q R E_{\\phi}\n$$\nThe total time derivative of $\\psi$ as seen by the moving particle is $\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_g \\cdot \\nabla\\psi$. For a static inductive field, $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}=0$. The guiding-center velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_g$, and its radial component is $v_r = \\mathbf{v}_g \\cdot \\hat{r}$. So, $\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} v_r$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi}) + q \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} v_r = q R E_{\\phi}\n$$\nSubstituting the relation $\\frac{d\\psi}{dr} = -R_0 B_p(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi}) - q R_0 B_p(r) v_r = q R E_{\\phi}\n$$\nThis equation applies to any particle. The Ware pinch arises from averaging this equation over the bounce motion of a trapped particle. A trapped particle oscillates between two bounce points in the poloidal plane and does not complete a full poloidal circuit. Its parallel velocity $v_\\|$ reverses sign during a bounce period $\\tau_b$. For a stationary orbit (in the absence of collisions or slow transport), the particle returns to its initial state after one bounce, so the bounce average of the time derivative of any state function like $m R v_\\phi$ is zero:\n$$\n\\langle \\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi}) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} \\int_0^{\\tau_b} \\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi}) dt = \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} [m R v_{\\phi}]_0^{\\tau_b} = 0\n$$\nBounce-averaging the momentum equation and assuming $E_{\\phi}$, $B_p(r)$ and $R$ are approximately constant over the small radial width of a banana orbit (approximating $R \\approx R_0$):\n$$\n\\langle \\frac{d}{dt}(m R v_{\\phi}) \\rangle - q R_0 B_p(r) \\langle v_r \\rangle = q R_0 E_{\\phi}\n$$\n$$\n0 - q R_0 B_p(r) \\langle v_r \\rangle = q R_0 E_{\\phi}\n$$\nSolving for the bounce-averaged radial velocity $\\langle v_r \\rangle$, which is the Ware pinch velocity $V_W(r)$:\n$$\nV_W(r) = -\\frac{E_{\\phi}}{B_p(r)}\n$$\nThis is an inward drift for standard tokamak operation where $E_{\\phi}0$ and $B_p0$.\n\n### Part 2: Neoclassical Ware Pinch Particle Flux Density $\\Gamma_{W}(r)$\n\nThe problem defines the Ware pinch flux density as $\\Gamma_{W}(r) = n_{\\mathrm{init}}(r) f_{t}(r) V_{W}(r)$. We substitute the given expressions for each term.\n- $n_{\\mathrm{init}}(r) = n_{a} + (n_{0}-n_{a})[1 - (r/a)^{2}]^{2}$\n- $f_{t}(r) = 1.46\\sqrt{\\epsilon(r)} = 1.46\\sqrt{r/R_0}$\n- $V_{W}(r) = -\\frac{E_{\\phi}}{B_p(r)} = -\\frac{E_{\\phi}}{B_{p,a}(r/a)} = -\\frac{E_{\\phi}a}{B_{p,a}r}$\n\nCombining these gives the explicit analytic expression for the flux:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{W}(r) = \\left( n_{a} + (n_{0}-n_{a})\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{2} \\right) \\left( 1.46\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{R_0}} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{E_{\\phi}a}{B_{p,a}r} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma_{W}(r) = -\\frac{1.46 E_{\\phi} a}{B_{p,a}\\sqrt{R_0}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\left( n_{a} + (n_{0}-n_{a})\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{2} \\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Density Peaking Factor in Steady State\n\nIn steady state ($\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$) with no particle sources, the particle conservation equation $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r\\Gamma(r)) = 0$ simplifies to $r\\Gamma(r) = \\text{const}$. Since there is zero net flux at the edge, and no source at the center, the constant must be zero. Therefore, the radial flux density must be zero everywhere: $\\Gamma(r)=0$ for $0 \\le r \\le a$.\n\nThe total radial particle flux density is given as:\n$$\n\\Gamma(r) = -D_{n}\\frac{dn}{dr} + n(r)f_{t}(r)V_{W}(r) = 0\n$$\nThis yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for the density profile $n(r)$:\n$$\nD_{n}\\frac{dn}{dr} = n(r)f_{t}(r)V_{W}(r)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_t(r)$ and $V_W(r)$:\n$$\nD_{n}\\frac{dn}{dr} = n(r) \\left( 1.46\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{R_0}} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{E_{\\phi}a}{B_{p,a}r} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nD_{n}\\frac{dn}{dr} = -n(r) \\frac{1.46 E_{\\phi} a}{B_{p,a} \\sqrt{R_0}} r^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis is a separable equation.

Equivalently, averaging the contribution of a process with intrinsic rate $\\omega_{b,s}$ in the presence of interruptions with rate $\\nu_{s}$ gives a multiplicative reduction by the factor $\\omega_{b,s}/(\\omega_{b,s}+\\nu_{s})$.\n\nWith this retention factor, the effective inward convective flux for species $s$ is\n$$\n\\Gamma_{s} \\approx n_{s}\\, f_{t}\\, V_{W}\\, \\mathcal{R}_{s} \\,.\n$$\nSince $n_{e} \\approx n_{i}$ (quasineutrality), $f_{t}$ is a geometric property of the magnetic configuration, and $V_{W}$ is species independent, the ratio of electron to ion inward convective flux is\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma_{e}}{\\Gamma_{i}} = \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_{e}}{\\mathcal{R}_{i}} = \\frac{\\omega_{b,e}}{\\omega_{b,e}+\\nu_{e}} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_{b,i}+\\nu_{i}}{\\omega_{b,i}} \\,.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate the ingredients for the given parameters.\n\nGeometric quantities:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{a}{R} = \\frac{1}{3} \\,,\\quad \\sqrt{\\epsilon} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} \\,,\n\\quad q=3 \\,,\\quad R=3\\,\\mathrm{m} \\,.\n$$\n\nThermal speeds:\n$$\nv_{T,e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_{e}}{m_{e}}} \\,,\\qquad v_{T,i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_{i}}{m_{i}}} \\,,\n$$\nwith $T_{e}=T_{i}=3.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $m_{e}$ the electron mass, and $m_{i}=2 m_{p}$ for deuterium.\n\nBounce frequencies (deeply trapped, large aspect ratio):\n$$\n\\omega_{b,s} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\, v_{T,s}}{q R} \\,.\n$$\n\nCollision frequencies.
