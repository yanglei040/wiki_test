The magnetic field magnitude along the arc-length coordinate $s$ is given by $B(s) = B_0 \\left( 1 + \\alpha s^2 \\right)$, where $B_0 > 0$ is the field minimum at $s = 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$ sets the curvature of the mirror.\n\nAssume:\n- The evolution is sufficiently slow and the magnetic field varies smoothly on the scale of the particle gyroradius so that the first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment) $\\mu$ is conserved.\n- There are no electric fields and the total kinetic energy $E$ is conserved.\n- The particle remains close to the given field line so that the guiding-center description applies.\n\nStarting only from the conservation of total kinetic energy and the constancy of the first adiabatic invariant, derive the condition that determines the reflection (turning) points along $s$ where the parallel component of the velocity vanishes. Then, for the specified profile $B(s)$, solve for the two symmetric reflection points $s_1$ and $s_2$ explicitly in terms of $E$, $\\mu$, $B_0$, and $\\alpha$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the reflection points of a charged particle in a magnetic mirror. The solution is based on two fundamental conservation laws: the conservation of total kinetic energy, $E$, and the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment), $\\mu$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy $E$ of the particle is the sum of its kinetic energy parallel to the magnetic field, $E_{k, \\parallel}$, and its kinetic energy perpendicular to the magnetic field, $E_{k, \\perp}$.\n$$E = E_{k, \\parallel} + E_{k, \\perp}$$\nThese components are given by $E_{k, \\parallel} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\parallel}^2$ and $E_{k, \\perp} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp}^2$, where $m$ is the particle's mass, and $v_{\\parallel}$ and $v_{\\perp}$ are the components of its velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line, respectively.\n\nThe first adiabatic invariant, $\\mu$, is defined as the ratio of the perpendicular kinetic energy to the magnetic field magnitude, $B(s)$. Since $\\mu$ is conserved, we have:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{E_{k, \\perp}}{B(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp}^2}{B(s)} = \\text{constant}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy at any point $s$ along the field line as:\n$$E_{k, \\perp}(s) = \\mu B(s)$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for total energy conservation gives:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\mu B(s)$$\nThis equation describes the partitioning of energy between parallel and perpendicular motion as the particle moves along the field line. We can rearrange it to solve for the parallel velocity component:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2(s) = \\frac{2}{m} \\left( E - \\mu B(s) \\right)$$\nA reflection (or turning) point, which we will denote as $s_{\\text{turn}}$, is a location where the particle's parallel motion ceases and reverses direction. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the parallel velocity vanishes, i.e., $v_{\\parallel} = 0$.\nSetting $v_{\\parallel}(s_{\\text{turn}}) = 0$ in the equation above yields the general condition for the turning points:\n$$0 = \\frac{2}{m} \\left( E - \\mu B(s_{\\text{turn}}) \\right)$$\n$$E = \\mu B(s_{\\text{turn}})$$\nThis equation states that a particle is reflected at the point $s_{\\text{turn}}$ where the local magnetic field $B(s_{\\text{turn}})$ becomes strong enough to account for the particle's entire kinetic energy $E$, given its magnetic moment $\\mu$.\n\nNow, we apply this general condition to the specific magnetic field profile given in the problem:\n$$B(s) = B_0 \\left( 1 + \\alpha s^2 \\right)$$\nSubstituting this profile into the turning point condition, we get:\n$$E = \\mu \\left[ B_0 \\left( 1 + \\alpha s_{\\text{turn}}^2 \\right) \\right]$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $s_{\\text{turn}}$. We can rearrange the terms as follows:\n$$\\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} = 1 + \\alpha s_{\\text{turn}}^2$$\n$$\\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 = \\alpha s_{\\text{turn}}^2$$\n$$s_{\\text{turn}}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\right)$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives two symmetric solutions for the turning points:\n$$s_{\\text{turn}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\right)}$$\nThus, the two symmetric reflection points, $s_1$ and $s_2$, are:\n$$s_1 = - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\right)}$$\n$$s_2 = + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\right)}$$\n\nFor these reflection points to exist as real values, the argument of the square root must be non-negative.\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\right) \\ge 0$$\nGiven that the problem specifies $\\alpha > 0$, this condition simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} - 1 \\ge 0$$\n$$\\frac{E}{\\mu B_0} \\ge 1$$\nTherefore, the condition for the existence of real-valued reflection points is:\n$$E \\ge \\mu B_0$$\nThis is the condition for a particle to be trapped within the magnetic mirror. If this condition is not met, the particle is not confined by this magnetic field configuration (a scenario which is physically inconsistent with the setup as $E_{k,\\parallel}$ would need to be negative at the magnetic minimum). If $E = \\mu B_0$, the turning points coincide at $s=0$, meaning the particle is trapped exactly at the bottom of the magnetic well.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics, is well-posed with sufficient information, and is stated objectively. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, to derive the condition on the particle's pitch angle at the midplane that determines whether it is trapped by the magnetic mirror; second, to use this condition to calculate the fraction of particles in an isotropic Maxwellian distribution that are trapped.\n\nLet the particle's mass be $m$ and its velocity be $\\mathbf{v}$. The total kinetic energy $E$ and the first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment) $\\mu$ are conserved along the particle's guiding-center trajectory.\nThe kinetic energy is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2}) = \\text{constant}$$\nwhere $v_{\\parallel}$ and $v_{\\perp}$ are the components of the velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, respectively.\n\nThe magnetic moment is given by:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2B} = \\text{constant}$$\nwhere $B = |\\mathbf{B}|$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nLet the quantities at the midplane ($z=0$) be denoted with a subscript '$0$' and quantities at any other point along the field line be denoted without a subscript. At the midplane, we have $B_0 = B_{\\min}$. We are given the pitch angle $\\alpha$ at the midplane, defined by $v_{\\perp,0} = v \\sin\\alpha$ and $v_{\\parallel,0} = v \\cos\\alpha$, where $v$ is the total speed of the particle.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total speed $v = \\sqrt{v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2}}$ is constant along the trajectory, because the static magnetic field does no work on the charged particle.\n\nFrom the conservation of magnetic moment, we can relate the perpendicular velocity component at any point $z$ to its value at the midplane:\n$$\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2B(z)} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp,0}^{2}}{2B_{\\min}}$$\n$$v_{\\perp}^{2}(z) = v_{\\perp,0}^{2} \\frac{B(z)}{B_{\\min}} = (v \\sin\\alpha)^{2} \\frac{B(z)}{B_{\\min}}$$\nNow, we can express the parallel velocity component at any point $z$ using the conservation of energy:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(z) = v^{2} - v_{\\perp}^{2}(z) = v^{2} - v^{2} \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\frac{B(z)}{B_{\\min}}$$\n$$v_{\\parallel}^{2}(z) = v^{2} \\left( 1 - \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\frac{B(z)}{B_{\\min}} \\right)$$\nA particle is trapped if it is reflected before it reaches the end of the mirror device where the magnetic field is maximum, $B_{\\max}$. Reflection occurs at the point $z_r$ where the parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_{\\parallel}(z_r) = 0$. At this point, the magnetic field is $B(z_r) = B_r$. Setting $v_{\\parallel}^{2}(z_r) = 0$ in the equation above gives:\n$$0 = v^{2} \\left( 1 - \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\frac{B_r}{B_{\\min}} \\right)$$\nSince $v \\neq 0$ for a particle to be present, we must have:\n$$1 - \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\frac{B_r}{B_{\\min}} = 0$$\n$$\\sin^{2}\\alpha = \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_r}$$\nFor a particle to be trapped within the device (i.e., for its reflection point to be at $|z_r| < L$), the magnetic field at reflection $B_r$ must be less than the maximum field $B_{\\max}$. If $B_r \\ge B_{\\max}$, the particle has a non-zero parallel velocity even at the mirror throat and will escape. Therefore, the condition for a particle to be trapped is $B_r < B_{\\max}$.\nSubstituting our expression for $B_r$:\n$$\\frac{B_{\\min}}{\\sin^{2}\\alpha} < B_{\\max}$$\nRearranging this inequality gives the condition on the midplane pitch angle $\\alpha$ for trapping:\n$$\\sin^{2}\\alpha > \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nwhere $R_m = B_{\\max}/B_{\\min}$ is the mirror ratio.\n\nParticles that do not satisfy this condition, i.e., those for which $\\sin^{2}\\alpha \\le 1/R_m$, are not trapped and belong to the \"loss cone\". The boundary of the loss cone is defined by the critical pitch angle $\\alpha_c$, given by:\n$$\\sin^{2}\\alpha_c = \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nSo, particles with $\\alpha_c \\le \\alpha \\le \\pi - \\alpha_c$ are trapped, while particles with $0 \\le \\alpha < \\alpha_c$ or $\\pi - \\alpha_c < \\alpha \\le \\pi$ are lost.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to calculate the fraction of trapped particles, $F_{\\mathrm{trap}}$. The distribution function $f(\\mathbf{v})$ at the midplane is given as an isotropic Maxwellian. \"Isotropic\" means the distribution depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$, and not on its direction.\n\nThe number of particles $dN$ in a velocity-space volume element $d^3v$ is $dN = f(v) d^3v$. In spherical coordinates in velocity space $(v, \\alpha, \\phi)$, where $\\alpha$ is the pitch angle and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle, the volume element is $d^3v = v^2 \\sin\\alpha \\, dv \\, d\\alpha \\, d\\phi$.\n\nThe total number of particles is found by integrating over all of velocity space:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\int_{\\text{all}} f(v) d^3v = \\int_0^{\\infty} dv \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^{\\pi} d\\alpha \\, f(v) v^2 \\sin\\alpha$$\nThe number of trapped particles is found by integrating over the trapped region of velocity space, which corresponds to pitch angles $\\alpha$ from $\\alpha_c$ to $\\pi - \\alpha_c$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{trap}} = \\int_{\\text{trap}} f(v) d^3v = \\int_0^{\\infty} dv \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} d\\alpha \\, f(v) v^2 \\sin\\alpha$$\nThe fraction of trapped particles is the ratio $F_{\\mathrm{trap}} = N_{\\mathrm{trap}} / N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{trap}} = \\frac{\\int_0^{\\infty} dv \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} d\\alpha \\, f(v) v^2 \\sin\\alpha}{\\int_0^{\\infty} dv \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^{\\pi} d\\alpha \\, f(v) v^2 \\sin\\alpha}$$\nBecause the integration limits for $v$ and $\\phi$ are the same in the numerator and denominator, and the integrand is separable, we can cancel the common integrals:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{trap}} = \\frac{\\left( \\int_0^{\\infty} f(v) v^2 dv \\right) \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\left( \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha \\right)}{\\left( \\int_0^{\\infty} f(v) v^2 dv \\right) \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\left( \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha \\right)} = \\frac{\\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha}{\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha}$$\nThis shows that for an isotropic distribution, the fraction of particles in a certain angular range is simply the ratio of the solid angle of that range to the total solid angle ($4\\pi$ steradians).\n\nWe now evaluate the integrals:\nThe integral in the numerator is:\n$$\\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha = [-\\cos\\alpha]_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} = -\\cos(\\pi-\\alpha_c) - (-\\cos\\alpha_c) = -(-\\cos\\alpha_c) + \\cos\\alpha_c = 2\\cos\\alpha_c$$\nThe integral in the denominator is:\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha = [-\\cos\\alpha]_0^{\\pi} = -\\cos(\\pi) - (-\\cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2$$\nSo, the fraction of trapped particles is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{trap}} = \\frac{2\\cos\\alpha_c}{2} = \\cos\\alpha_c$$\nTo express this in terms of the mirror ratio $R_m$, we use the identity $\\cos^2\\alpha_c + \\sin^2\\alpha_c = 1$. Since $\\alpha_c$ is the critical angle defining the boundary of the loss cone, it can be taken in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$, so $\\cos\\alpha_c \\ge 0$.\n$$\\cos\\alpha_c = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\alpha_c}$$\nSubstituting $\\sin^2\\alpha_c = 1/R_m$:\n$$\\cos\\alpha_c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nThus, the final expression for the fraction of trapped particles as a function of the mirror ratio is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{trap}}(R_m) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nThis can also be written as $\\sqrt{\\frac{R_m-1}{R_m}}$.",
