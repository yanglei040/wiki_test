This property stems from the behavior of the drift and diffusion coefficients at the boundaries $\\xi = \\pm 1$.\nAt the boundary $\\xi = 1$:\nThe drift coefficient is $a(1) = -\\nu(1) = -\\nu$.\nThe diffusion coefficient is $b(1) = \\sqrt{\\nu(1-1^2)} = 0$.\nAt the boundary $\\xi = -1$:\nThe drift coefficient is $a(-1) = -\\nu(-1) = \\nu$.\nThe diffusion coefficient is $b(-1) = \\sqrt{\\nu(1-(-1)^2)} = 0$.\n\nA fundamental property of one-dimensional diffusions is that a boundary $\\xi_b$ cannot be exited if the diffusion coefficient vanishes at that boundary, i.e., $b(\\xi_b)=0$. In this situation, the stochastic part of the dynamics, $b(\\xi)dW_t$, vanishes, and the evolution of the process at the boundary becomes deterministic, governed by the ordinary differential equation $d\\xi = a(\\xi_b)dt$.\n\nFor our process:\n- If a sample path reaches $\\xi=1$, its subsequent evolution is governed by $d\\xi = a(1)dt = -\\nu dt$. Since $\\nu0$, the drift is negative, forcing the path back into the interval $(-1, 1)$. It is impossible for the process to cross into the region $\\xi  1$.\n- If a sample path reaches $\\xi=-1$, its subsequent evolution is governed by $d\\xi = a(-1)dt = \\nu dt$. Since $\\nu0$, the drift is positive, forcing the path back into the interval $(-1, 1)$. It is impossible for the process to cross into the region $\\xi  -1$.\n\nIn both cases, the diffusion coefficient is zero at the boundary, and the drift vector points strictly into the interior of the domain $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, any trajectory starting inside or on the boundary of the interval $[-1, 1]$ will be confined to this interval for all future times, almost surely. This proves the invariant constraint $|\\xi(t)|\\le 1$.\n\n#### Part 2: Maximum Time Step for Numerical Scheme\n\nThe Euler–Maruyama discretization with the specified bounded noise is:\n$$ \\xi_{n+1}=\\xi_{n}+a(\\xi_{n})\\,\\Delta t + b(\\xi_{n})\\,\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,R_{n} $$\nSubstituting the derived coefficients $a(\\xi) = -\\nu\\xi$ and $b(\\xi) = \\sqrt{\\nu(1-\\xi^2)}$:\n$$ \\xi_{n+1} = \\xi_n - \\nu \\xi_n \\Delta t + \\sqrt{\\nu(1-\\xi_n^2)}\\,\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,R_n $$\nWe are given that $|\\xi_n| \\le 1$ and we must find the largest $\\Delta t  0$ such that $|\\xi_{n+1}| \\le 1$ is guaranteed for both outcomes of $R_n \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ and for all possible values of $\\xi_n \\in [-1, 1]$.\nLet $x = \\xi_n$. The update can be written as:\n$$ \\xi_{n+1} = x(1-\\nu\\Delta t) + R_n \\sqrt{\\nu\\Delta t(1-x^2)} $$\nThis expression is of the form $f(x) = C_1 x + C_2 \\sqrt{1-x^2}$, where $C_1 = 1-\\nu\\Delta t$ and $C_2 = R_n\\sqrt{\\nu\\Delta t}$. The extrema of such a function over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$ are given by $\\pm \\sqrt{C_1^2 + C_2^2}$. This can be seen by parameterizing $x = \\cos\\theta$ and using trigonometric identities, or by standard calculus. The maximum absolute value of $f(x)$ is $\\sqrt{C_1^2 + C_2^2}$.\n\nThe condition $|\\xi_{n+1}| \\le 1$ must hold for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and all $R_n$. This implies that the maximum possible value of $|\\xi_{n+1}|$ must be less than or equal to $1$.\n$$ \\max_{x \\in [-1,1], R_n \\in \\{-1,1\\}} |\\xi_{n+1}| \\le 1 $$\nThe maximum absolute value is $\\sqrt{C_1^2 + C_2^2}$, where $C_1^2 = (1-\\nu\\Delta t)^2$ and $C_2^2 = (R_n\\sqrt{\\nu\\Delta t})^2 = \\nu\\Delta t$.\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\sqrt{(1-\\nu\\Delta t)^2 + \\nu\\Delta t} \\le 1 $$\nSince both sides are non-negative, we can square the inequality without changing its direction:\n$$ (1-\\nu\\Delta t)^2 + \\nu\\Delta t \\le 1 $$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$ 1 - 2\\nu\\Delta t + (\\nu\\Delta t)^2 + \\nu\\Delta t \\le 1 $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ (\\nu\\Delta t)^2 - \\nu\\Delta t \\le 0 $$\n$$ \\nu\\Delta t (\\nu\\Delta t - 1) \\le 0 $$\nSince $\\nu  0$ and we are looking for $\\Delta t  0$, the term $\\nu\\Delta t$ is strictly positive.

Here $b_{90}$ is the impact parameter for a $\\theta=\\pi/2$ scatter.\n*   **Regime of Interest (Low-Speed):** $v$ is reduced such that $b_{90}$ sets $b_{\\min}$ (i.e., $b_{90}  \\lambda_B$), and $b_{90}$ approaches $\\lambda_D$, making $\\ln\\Lambda$ no longer large.\n*   **Task:** Using only the stated relations and definitions, determine how the ion mean free path ($\\lambda$) for an order-unity pitch-angle change behaves as $v$ is reduced, and how large-angle collisions modify the naive scaling $\\lambda \\propto v^4$.\n*   **Question:** Identify the most accurate statement among the options provided.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in standard plasma kinetic theory. The concepts of Rutherford scattering, Debye screening, Coulomb logarithm, Fokker-Planck equation, and mean free path are cornerstones of this field. The specified transition from a diffusion-dominated regime (many small-angle scatters) to a large-angle scattering regime at low particle velocities is a well-established physical phenomenon. All premises are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the scaling behavior of the mean free path in a well-defined physical limit. It provides all necessary physical relations and definitions to derive this scaling. The question is unambiguous and seeks the \"most accurate\" description among a set of choices, which is a standard format for physics problems testing conceptual understanding.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is precise and technical, free of subjectivity or opinion.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The statement that the plasma is \"weakly coupled\" (meaning average potential energy is small compared to thermal kinetic energy) is consistent with studying a low-velocity test particle that can undergo strong individual collisions ($v \\ll v_{thermal}$).\n5.  **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, or otherwise flawed. It addresses a key conceptual point in the application of collision theory to plasmas.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between the mean free path for pitch-angle scattering in two different regimes: the high-speed regime dominated by cumulative small-angle scattering, and the low-speed regime where single large-angle scattering events become dominant.\n\n**High-Speed (Small-Angle Diffusion) Regime**\n\nIn this regime, an order-unity change in pitch angle (e.g., $90^\\circ$) is the result of many small-angle deflections. This process is diffusive and is described by the Fokker-Planck equation. The characteristic mean free path for a $90^\\circ$ turn, $\\lambda_{90,\\text{diff}}$, is given by the particle speed $v$ divided by the $90^\\circ$-scattering frequency, $\\nu_{90}$. The standard result from kinetic theory is:\n$$ \\nu_{90} \\propto n_i \\frac{k^2}{\\mu^2 v^3} \\ln\\Lambda $$\nTherefore, the mean free path is:\n$$ \\lambda_{90,\\text{diff}} = \\frac{v}{\\nu_{90}} \\propto \\frac{\\mu^2 v^4}{n_i k^2 \\ln\\Lambda} $$\nIf the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$, were a constant, the scaling would be $\\lambda \\propto v^4$. This is the \"naive\" scaling mentioned in the problem. However, $\\ln\\Lambda$ itself depends on velocity.\n\n**Low-Speed (Large-Angle Scattering) Regime**\n\nThe problem directs us to the regime where $v$ is low enough that large-angle scattering events are no longer rare. In this limit, an order-unity change in pitch angle is most likely to occur in a single collision. The relevant mean free path, $\\lambda_{LAS}$, is then determined by the cross-section for a single large-angle scattering event. The definition of mean free path in this case is:\n$$ \\lambda_{LAS} = \\frac{1}{n_i \\sigma_{LAS}} $$\nLet us define a \"large-angle scatter\" as an event with a scattering angle $\\theta \\ge \\pi/2$. The cross-section for such an event, $\\sigma(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)$, is the area of a circle with a radius equal to the impact parameter that produces a $\\pi/2$ scatter, which is $b_{90}$. Any particle with an impact parameter $b \\le b_{90}$ will scatter by an angle $\\theta \\ge \\pi/2$.\n$$ \\sigma(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2) = \\pi b_{90}^2 $$\nTo find the velocity dependence of $b_{90}$, we use the given Rutherford relation:\n$$ \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b} $$\nFor $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\tan(\\pi/4) = 1$. This gives:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b_{90}} \\quad \\implies \\quad b_{90} = \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2} $$\nThis shows that the impact parameter for a $90^\\circ$ scatter scales as $b_{90} \\propto v^{-2}$.\nNow we can find the scaling of the cross-section:\n$$ \\sigma(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2) = \\pi b_{90}^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2}\\right)^2 \\propto v^{-4} $$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for the mean free path for large-angle scattering:\n$$ \\lambda_{LAS} = \\frac{1}{n_i \\sigma(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)} \\propto \\frac{1}{v^{-4}} = v^4 $$\n\n**The Transition**\n\nThe problem asks how the naive scaling $\\lambda \\propto v^4$ is modified. At high speeds, the correct scaling is $\\lambda \\propto v^4/\\ln\\Lambda(v)$. The regime of interest is where $b_{\\min} = b_{90}$, so the Coulomb logarithm is $\\ln\\Lambda(v) = \\ln(\\lambda_D / b_{90}) = \\ln(\\lambda_D \\mu v^2 / k)$. As $v$ decreases, this logarithmic term also decreases, causing $\\lambda$ to decrease faster than $v^4$.\n\nWhen $\\ln\\Lambda(v)$ approaches unity (i.e., $b_{90}$ approaches $\\lambda_D$), the Fokker-Planck formalism, which relies on $\\ln\\Lambda \\gg 1$, breaks down. The dominant physical process becomes single large-angle scattering. As derived above, the mean free path for this process scales as $\\lambda_{LAS} \\propto v^4$.\n\nTherefore, the behavior of the mean free path as $v$ is reduced is a transition from the diffusive result, $\\lambda \\propto v^4/\\ln\\Lambda(v)$, to the single-scattering result, $\\lambda \\propto v^4$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. When $b_{90}$ sets $b_{\\min}$ and $\\ln\\Lambda$ is order unity, the relevant mean free path for an order-unity pitch-angle change transitions from the small-angle diffusion result $\\lambda \\propto v^4/\\ln\\Lambda(v)$ to the distance between $\\theta \\ge \\pi/2$ events, $\\lambda \\sim \\left[n_i\\,\\sigma(\\theta\\pi/2)\\right]^{-1} \\propto v^4$, i.e., the $v^4$ power law is retained but the Coulomb logarithm is removed from the prefactor.**\nThis statement accurately describes the physics of the transition. It correctly identifies that the governing mechanism changes from cumulative small-angle diffusion to single large-angle events. It correctly states the definition for the mean free path in the large-angle regime ($\\lambda \\sim [n_i \\sigma]^{-1}$) and correctly derives its scaling ($\\lambda \\propto v^4$). The final clause, comparing the low-speed $v^4$ scaling to the naive high-speed scaling, correctly points out that the $\\ln\\Lambda$ factor is no longer present. This option is a precise summary of our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Once $b_{90}$ exceeds $\\lambda_D$, the large-angle cross section becomes geometric, $\\sigma \\sim \\pi \\lambda_D^2$, so the mean free path saturates at a constant $\\lambda \\sim 1/\\!\\left(n_i \\pi \\lambda_D^2\\right)$ independent of $v$.**\nThis statement describes a valid physical effect that occurs at even lower velocities than the regime specified in the question. The question asks about the limit where $b_{90}$ *approaches* $\\lambda_D$, implying $b_{90} \\lesssim \\lambda_D$. This option discusses the case where $v$ is so low that $b_{90}  \\lambda_D$. In this case, the interaction is always cut off by Debye screening at a range of $\\approx \\lambda_D$, so the cross-section saturates to a constant value $\\pi \\lambda_D^2$, and the mean free path also becomes constant. While physically correct, this behavior occurs in a different, lower-velocity regime than the one primarily being asked about. Therefore, it is not the *most accurate* description of the modification occurring as $\\ln\\Lambda$ ceases to be large. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the regime where large-angle scattering dominates, the $\\theta \\ge \\pi/2$ cross section scales as $\\sigma \\propto v^{-2}$, so the associated mean free path scales as $\\lambda \\propto v^2$.**\nThis statement contains an incorrect scaling for the cross-section. As derived above from the Rutherford formula, the impact parameter for $90^\\circ$ scattering is $b_{90} \\propto v^{-2}$. The cross-section is $\\sigma(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2) = \\pi b_{90}^2$, which scales as $(v^{-2})^2 = v^{-4}$. This option claims $\\sigma \\propto v^{-2}$, which is incorrect. Consequently, the derived mean free path scaling of $\\lambda \\propto v^2$ is also incorrect. The correct scaling is $\\lambda \\propto v^4$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The correct low-speed correction is to replace $\\ln\\Lambda$ by $\\ln\\!\\left(\\lambda_D/\\lambda_B\\right)$, which grows as $v^{-1}$, so the mean free path steepens from $\\lambda \\propto v^4$ to $\\lambda \\propto v^5$.**\nThis statement is flawed in multiple ways. First, the problem explicitly defines the regime of interest as the one where the classical strong-collision cutoff applies, meaning $b_{\\min} = b_{90}$, not the quantum cutoff $\\lambda_B$. Using $\\lambda_B$ contradicts the problem setup. Second, the claim that $\\ln(\\lambda_D/\\lambda_B)$ \"grows as $v^{-1}$\" is mathematically false. The de Broglie wavelength is $\\lambda_B = h/p \\propto v^{-1}$, so the argument of the logarithm, $\\lambda_D/\\lambda_B$, is proportional to $v$. The function $\\ln(c \\cdot v)$ does not grow as $v^{-1}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the derivation from first principles as laid out in the problem statement, option A provides the most accurate and relevant description of the behavior of the ion mean free path in the specified low-speed limit. It correctly identifies the change in the underlying physical process and derives the correct resulting scaling law.",
