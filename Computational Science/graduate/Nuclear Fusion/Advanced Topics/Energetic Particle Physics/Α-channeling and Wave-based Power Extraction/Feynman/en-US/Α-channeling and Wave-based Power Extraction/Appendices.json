The scenario describes alpha-channeling, a legitimate topic in nuclear fusion research. The given physical quantities are consistent and realistic: a $3.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ alpha particle, resulting from a Deuterium-Tritium fusion reaction, has a speed which is non-relativistic ($v/c \\approx 0.043$), justifying the use of the nonrelativistic Doppler relation. The frequency is in a range used for plasma heating. The definitions and required tasks are clear and unambiguous, leading to a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Resonance Condition**\nLet the magnetic field be oriented along the $z$-axis. A plane wave propagating in the plasma can be described by its phase, $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t$. We are interested in the interaction along the magnetic field, so we consider only the components parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$. The phase is thus $\\Phi(z, t) = k_{\\parallel} z - \\omega t$, where $k_{\\parallel}$ is the component of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ parallel to the magnetic field.\n\nA particle moves along the magnetic field line with a parallel velocity component $v_{\\parallel}$. Its position as a function of time is $z(t) = z_0 + v_{\\parallel} t$. To find the phase of the wave as experienced by the moving particle, we substitute its position into the phase function:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\parallel} (z_0 + v_{\\parallel} t) - \\omega t $$\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\parallel} z_0 + (k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t $$\nLandau resonance corresponds to a resonant energy exchange, which occurs when the particle experiences a quasi-static electric field from the wave. This means the phase of the wave in the particle's frame of reference must be constant, i.e., $\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = 0$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( k_{\\parallel} z_0 + (k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t \\right) = k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel} - \\omega = 0 $$\nThis yields the fundamental Landau resonance condition:\n$$ \\omega = k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel} $$\nThis condition can also be interpreted as a Doppler shift: the frequency in the moving frame, $\\omega' = \\omega - k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel}$, is zero.\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimal* parallel wavenumber, $k_{\\parallel}$. From the resonance condition, we can express $k_{\\parallel}$ as:\n$$ k_{\\parallel} = \\frac{\\omega}{v_{\\parallel}} $$\nTo minimize $k_{\\parallel}$ for a fixed wave frequency $\\omega$, the parallel velocity of the resonating particle, $v_{\\parallel}$, must be maximized. The alpha particles in a tokamak have a distribution of velocities and pitch angles. The parallel velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ is related to the total particle speed $v$ by $v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the pitch angle. The maximum possible value for $v_{\\parallel}$ is the total speed $v$, which occurs for a particle traveling purely parallel to the magnetic field ($\\theta=0$).\nTherefore, the maximum parallel velocity is $v_{\\parallel, \\max} = v$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $k_{\\parallel}$ gives the minimal parallel wavenumber required for resonance:\n$$ k_{\\parallel, \\min} = \\frac{\\omega}{v} $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nThe given values are:\n- Angular frequency: $\\omega = 2\\pi \\times 5\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 2\\pi \\times 5 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 10\\pi \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Particle speed: $v = 1.3 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the numerical value of $k_{\\parallel, \\min}$:\n$$ k_{\\parallel, \\min} = \\frac{10\\pi \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.3 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{1000\\pi}{1.3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$ k_{\\parallel, \\min} \\approx \\frac{1000 \\times 3.14159265}{1.3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\approx 2416.6097\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ k_{\\parallel, \\min} \\approx 2417\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n\n**Feasibility Comment**\nTo assess the feasibility of achieving this $k_{\\parallel}$ in a tokamak, we calculate the corresponding parallel refractive index, $n_{\\parallel}$, defined as $n_{\\parallel} = c k_{\\parallel}/\\omega$. Using the resonance condition $k_{\\parallel} = \\omega/v$, we can write $n_{\\parallel}$ in a simple form:\n$$ n_{\\parallel} = \\frac{c}{\\omega} \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{v}\\right) = \\frac{c}{v} $$\nUsing the speed of light $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and the given alpha particle speed $v = 1.3 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ n_{\\parallel} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{1.3 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 23.1 $$\nThis value of $n_{\\parallel}$ is exceptionally high for Lower Hybrid (LH) waves. While it satisfies the accessibility condition to penetrate the plasma core (typically $n_{\\parallel} \\gtrsim 1.5 - 2.0$), it presents two major practical challenges:\n1.  **Wave Launching**: LH wave antennas (grills) are designed to launch a specific spectrum of $n_{\\parallel}$. To launch a wave with $n_{\\parallel} \\approx 23.1$ would require an antenna with extremely fine-scale structure and phasing, which is technologically challenging and would likely have very poor power coupling to the plasma. Typical $n_{\\parallel}$ values for LH current drive are in the range of $1.5 - 4$.\n2.  **Wave Damping**: LH waves with such a high $n_{\\parallel}$ are subject to extremely strong Landau damping on plasma electrons. The phase velocity of the wave $v_{ph, \\parallel} = \\omega/k_{\\parallel} = v = 1.3 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ is quite low, comparable to the thermal speed of electrons in the outer regions of the plasma. Consequently, the wave would deposit its energy into the edge electrons and would be completely damped long before it could reach the hot plasma core where the $3.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ alpha particles reside.\n\nIn conclusion, while the resonance condition can be met in principle, achieving it with LH waves is considered infeasible due to insurmountable difficulties in launching waves with the required high $n_{\\parallel}$ and the certainty of premature power absorption by electrons at the plasma edge. This is a primary reason why alpha-channeling research often explores other wave types, such as Ion Cyclotron Emission (ICE) or waves in the Alfvenic frequency range.",

The derivation must proceed from first principles and then be evaluated numerically.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. All necessary data and physical relationships are provided for a unique solution. We can therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nWe adopt the local slab geometry described, where the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ correspond to the minor-radial, poloidal, and toroidal directions, respectively. The equilibrium magnetic field is uniform and directed toroidally: $\\mathbf{B} = B_0 \\hat{z}$.\n\nThe first principle provided is the wave momentum theorem, which relates the absorbed power density, $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, to the poloidal momentum deposition rate density (force density), $\\Pi_\\theta$. The force density is a vector quantity, and its poloidal component $\\Pi_\\theta$ is given by:\n$$ \\Pi_\\theta = \\frac{k_\\theta}{\\omega} P_{\\mathrm{abs}} $$\nThis force density acts on the resonant alpha particles in the poloidal direction. We can write the force density vector as $\\mathbf{\\Pi} = \\Pi_\\theta \\hat{y}$.\n\nThis macroscopic force density is the sum of forces on all individual resonant particles within a unit volume.

Consequently, the channeling sign is\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{ch}} \\equiv \\operatorname{sgn}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\mathcal{E}}{\\Delta r}\\right) = \\operatorname{sgn}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega B_{\\theta}}{n_{\\phi}}\\right).\n$$\nSince $\\omega  0$ by definition and $B_{\\theta}  0$ by the chosen orientation, this reduces to\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi}).\n$$\n\nNext, in the strong-toroidal-field ordering with $|B_{\\phi}| \\gg |B_{\\theta}|$, the parallel wavenumber obeys\n$$\nk_{\\parallel} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi}/R + m B_{\\theta}/r}{|B|},\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(k_{\\parallel}) = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi})\n$$\nwhen the toroidal contribution dominates. Define the driven-current sign by\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cd}} \\equiv \\operatorname{sgn}(k_{\\parallel}) = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi}).\n$$\n\nWe now analyze the effect of reversing $B_{\\phi} \\to -B_{\\phi}$ under two operational choices for the launcher.\n\nCase (A): Hold $n_{\\phi}$ fixed and reverse $B_{\\phi}$. Then:\n- The channeling sign $S_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi})$ is independent of $B_{\\phi}$, so $S_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ does not change. Hence $F_{\\mathrm{ch}}^{(A)} = +1$.\n- The current-drive sign $S_{\\mathrm{cd}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi})$ changes sign because $B_{\\phi}$ changes sign while $n_{\\phi}$ is fixed. Hence $F_{\\mathrm{cd}}^{(A)} = -1$.\n\nCase (B): Hold $k_{\\parallel}$ fixed when reversing $B_{\\phi}$. In the strong-toroidal-field ordering, maintaining $\\operatorname{sgn}(k_{\\parallel})$ constant under $B_{\\phi} \\to -B_{\\phi}$ requires flipping $n_{\\phi} \\to -n_{\\phi}$ so that $\\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi})$ remains unchanged. Then:\n- The current-drive sign $S_{\\mathrm{cd}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi} B_{\\phi})$ is invariant by construction, so $F_{\\mathrm{cd}}^{(B)} = +1$.\n- The channeling sign $S_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(n_{\\phi})$ flips because $n_{\\phi} \\to -n_{\\phi}$. Hence $F_{\\mathrm{ch}}^{(B)} = -1$.\n\nSymmetry considerations: The diffusion path in the space of constants of motion is determined by the ratio $\\Delta P_{\\phi}/\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = n_{\\phi}/\\omega$, which depends on the discrete mode number $n_{\\phi}$ and the frequency $\\omega$, but not on the direction of $B_{\\phi}$. Therefore, the channeling relationship between energy change and radial displacement, $S_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega B_{\\theta}/n_{\\phi})$, is insensitive to $B_{\\phi}$ itself; it depends only on the sign of $n_{\\phi}$ when $\\omega$ and $B_{\\theta}$ are fixed and positive. By contrast, the sign of the driven current is governed by the sign of the parallel phase velocity, $\\operatorname{sgn}(k_{\\parallel})$, which is odd under $B_{\\phi}$ reversal at fixed $n_{\\phi}$ but is even if $n_{\\phi}$ is flipped simultaneously to compensate. Thus, under $B_{\\phi}$ reversal, either the channeling sign is preserved and the driven-current sign flips (case A), or the driven-current sign is preserved and the channeling sign flips (case B), reflecting the underlying invariance of the diffusion path under $B_{\\phi}$ and the parity of $k_{\\parallel}$ with respect to $B_{\\phi}$.\n\nCollecting the multiplicative sign-change factors,\n$$\n\\left[F_{\\mathrm{ch}}^{(A)} \\; F_{\\mathrm{cd}}^{(A)} \\; F_{\\mathrm{ch}}^{(B)} \\; F_{\\mathrm{cd}}^{(B)}\\right] = \\left[+1 \\; -1 \\; -1 \\; +1\\right].\n$$",
