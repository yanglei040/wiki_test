            "problem": "Consider a simplified empirical representation of the electron-impact ionization cross section relevant to Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) source physics in nuclear fusion, where ionization reduces neutral yield and modifies charge-exchange and slowing-down dynamics in the source region. The model assumes that the ionization cross section depends on the incident electron kinetic energy according to\n$$\\sigma(E) = a \\frac{\\ln(E/I)}{E},$$\nwhere $E$ is the electron energy in $\\text{eV}$, $I$ is the effective ionization threshold in $\\text{eV}$, $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm, $\\sigma$ is the cross section in $\\text{m}^2$, and $a$ is an empirical constant with units $\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{eV}$ encoding target-specific physics.

Use the natural logarithm for $\\ln$. Your program must compute the ordinary least squares estimate for $a$ given by minimizing\n$$S(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left[\\sigma_i - a\\,\\frac{\\ln(E_i/I)}{E_i}\\right]^2,$$\nfor each test case independently.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed and scientifically sound problem in the domain of plasma physics and computational methods. It requires the application of the principle of least squares to estimate a parameter in a physically motivated empirical model. All necessary data and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nThe problem asks for the estimation of the parameter $a$ in the model for the electron-impact ionization cross section $\\sigma(E)$, given by:\n$$\\sigma(E) = a \\frac{\\ln(E/I)}{E}$$\nHere, $E$ is the electron kinetic energy, $I$ is the ionization threshold energy, and $a$ is the empirical constant to be determined. We are given a set of $N$ experimental data points $(E_i, \\sigma_i)$.\n\nThe method to be used is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, which involves minimizing the sum of the squared residuals, $S(a)$. The residual for the $i$-th data point is the difference between the measured value $\\sigma_i$ and the value predicted by the model, $\\sigma(E_i)$. The sum of squared residuals is therefore:\n$$S(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left[\\sigma_i - \\sigma(E_i)\\right]^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left[\\sigma_i - a\\,\\frac{\\ln(E_i/I)}{E_i}\\right]^2$$\nTo simplify the notation, let us define a predictor variable $X_i$ that depends only on the known quantities $E_i$ and $I$:\n$$X_i = \\frac{\\ln(E_i/I)}{E_i}$$\nWith this definition, the sum of squares becomes:\n$$S(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\sigma_i - a X_i\\right)^2$$\nTo find the value of $a$ that minimizes $S(a)$, we must find the root of the first derivative of $S(a)$ with respect to $a$. We set this derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{dS}{da} = 0$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dS}{da} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{da} \\left(\\sigma_i - a X_i\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\\left(\\sigma_i - a X_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\sigma_i - a X_i\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dS}{da} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\\left(\\sigma_i - a X_i\\right) \\cdot \\left(-X_i\\right) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\sigma_i X_i - a X_i^2\\right)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the optimal estimate $\\hat{a}$:\n$$-2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\sigma_i X_i - \\hat{a} X_i^2\\right) = 0$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i X_i - \\hat{a} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving for $\\hat{a}$, we obtain the OLS estimator:\n$$\\hat{a} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i X_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $X_i$ back into this formula gives the final expression for the estimator $\\hat{a}$ in terms of the given data:\n$$\\hat{a} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i \\left(\\frac{\\ln(E_i/I)}{E_i}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{\\ln(E_i/I)}{E_i}\\right)^2}$$\nThis expression is well-defined as long as the denominator is non-zero. The denominator, being a sum of squares, is zero if and only if every term in the sum is zero. This occurs if $X_i = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The condition $X_i = 0$ is met if $\\ln(E_i/I) = 0$, which implies $E_i = I$. Therefore, if all data points are taken exactly at the ionization threshold ($E_i=I$ for all $i$), the denominator is zero, and the estimator $\\hat{a}$ is undefined. In this specific scenario, as per the problem statement, the special floating-point value `nan` should be returned.\n\nFor numerical implementation, it is efficient to represent the data as vectors. Let $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N)$ and $\\vec{X} = (X_1, \\dots, X_N)$. The sums in the expression for $\\hat{a}$ can be computed as vector dot products:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_i X_i = \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{X}$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i^2 = \\vec{X} \\cdot \\vec{X}$$\nThus, the estimator can be computed as:\n$$\\hat{a} = \\frac{\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{X}}{\\vec{X} \\cdot \\vec{X}}$$\nThe program will implement this vector-based formula for each test case, including the check for a zero denominator.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and assumptions to model the charge-state evolution of a hydrogen beam in a gas neutralizer, a standard problem in nuclear fusion technology. The provided parameters are physically realistic.\n\nWe begin by formulating the differential equations that govern the evolution of the ionic fraction, $f_{1}(x)$, and the neutral fraction, $f_{0}(x)$, of the beam as a function of distance $x$ through the neutralizer. The problem specifies two key collisional processes:\n1.  Charge exchange (electron capture): $\\text{H}^{+} + \\text{H}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{H}^{0} + \\cdots$, with cross section $\\sigma_{\\text{cx}}$. This process converts ions into neutrals.\n2.  Electron-loss (stripping): $\\text{H}^{0} + \\text{H}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{H}^{+} + \\cdots$, with cross section $\\sigma_{\\text{i}}$. This process converts neutrals back into ions.\n\nThe rate of change of a species fraction is determined by the balance of its production and destruction channels. The probability of a reaction of type $j$ per unit path length for a single beam particle is given as $n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{j}$, where $n_{\\text{H}_{2}}$ is the density of the target gas molecules.\n\nLet's consider the change in the ion fraction $f_{1}$ over a differential length $dx$. The number of ions is depleted by charge exchange and replenished by stripping of neutrals.\nThe rate of loss of ions is proportional to the ion fraction $f_{1}(x)$, the target density $n_{\\text{H}_{2}}$, and the charge exchange cross section $\\sigma_{\\text{cx}}$.\nThe rate of gain of ions is proportional to the neutral fraction $f_{0}(x)$, the target density $n_{\\text{H}_{2}}$, and the stripping cross section $\\sigma_{\\text{i}}$.\nThus, the differential equation for $f_{1}(x)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{df_{1}}{dx} = -f_{1}(x) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} + f_{0}(x) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}} $$\n\nSimilarly, for the neutral fraction $f_{0}(x)$, it is gained through charge exchange of ions and lost through stripping.\n$$ \\frac{df_{0}}{dx} = f_{1}(x) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} - f_{0}(x) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}} $$\n\nThe problem states to neglect other loss channels, so the total number of beam particles (ions + neutrals) is conserved. This implies $f_{1}(x) + f_{0}(x) = 1$ for all $x$. We can verify this by summing the two differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(f_{1} + f_{0}) = (-f_{1} n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} + f_{0} n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}}) + (f_{1} n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} - f_{0} n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}}) = 0 $$\nThis means $f_{1}(x) + f_{0}(x)$ is a constant. Given the initial conditions $f_{1}(0) = 1$ and $f_{0}(0) = 0$, the constant is $1+0=1$. Thus, $f_{1}(x) = 1 - f_{0}(x)$.\n\nWe can substitute $f_{1}(x) = 1 - f_{0}(x)$ into the equation for $f_{0}(x)$ to obtain a single first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the neutral fraction:\n$$ \\frac{df_{0}}{dx} = (1 - f_{0}(x)) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} - f_{0}(x) n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}} $$\n$$ \\frac{df_{0}}{dx} = n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} - f_{0}(x) (n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} + n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{i}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{df_{0}}{dx} + n_{\\text{H}_{2}}(\\sigma_{\\text{cx}} + \\sigma_{\\text{i}}) f_{0}(x) = n_{\\text{H}_{2}} \\sigma_{\\text{cx}} $$\nThis is a standard form $y' + Py = Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are constants.

The test ion (a deuteron with mass $m_f$ and charge $Z_f=1$) has a speed $v$ that satisfies the ordering $v_{ti} \\ll v \\ll v_{te}$, where $v_{ti}$ and $v_{te}$ are the thermal speeds of the background ions and electrons, respectively.\n\n1.  **Power Loss to Electrons ($P_e$)**\n    For a test ion with speed $v$ much less than the electron thermal speed $v_{te}$, the electrons can be treated as a hot, Maxwellian gas through which the ion moves. The primary energy loss mechanism is dynamic friction (drag). The drag force on the test ion is proportional to its velocity, $F_{drag} \\propto v$. The power transferred to the electrons is given by $P_e = \\vec{F}_{drag} \\cdot \\vec{v}$, and thus $P_e \\propto v^2$. Since the kinetic energy of the test ion is $E = \\frac{1}{2}m_f v^2$, the power loss is directly proportional to its energy:\n    $$P_e = C_e E$$\n    A full derivation from kinetic theory shows that the constant of proportionality $C_e$ depends on electron properties:\n    $$C_e \\propto \\frac{n_e Z_f^2}{m_f} \\frac{\\sqrt{m_e}}{T_e^{3/2}}$$\n    where $n_e$ is the electron density, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature (in energy units). For the purpose of finding the scaling with $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ while other parameters are held constant, we only need the dependence on $E$:\n    $$P_e(E) \\propto E$$\n\n2.  **Power Loss to Ions ($P_i$)**\n    For a test ion with speed $v$ much greater than the ion thermal speed $v_{ti}$, the background ions can be treated as essentially stationary targets. The energy loss is dominated by a series of small-angle Coulomb scattering events. The power loss to a single ion species $j$ is inversely proportional to the test ion's speed:\n    $$P_{i,j} \\propto \\frac{n_j Z_j^2 Z_f^2}{v}$$\n    where $n_j$ and $Z_j$ are the density and charge number of ion species $j$. The total power loss to all ion species in the plasma is the sum over all species $j$:\n    $$P_i = \\sum_j P_{i,j} \\propto \\frac{Z_f^2}{v} \\sum_j n_j Z_j^2$$\n    Here, a common approximation is made that factors like the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$ and the reduced mass term are approximately constant across the different ion species. The problem defines the effective charge as $Z_{\\text{eff}} \\equiv \\sum_{j} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} / n_{e}$. We can substitute this definition into the expression for $P_i$:\n    $$\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2 = n_e Z_{\\text{eff}}$$\n    This leads to:\n    $$P_i \\propto \\frac{Z_f^2 n_e Z_{\\text{eff}}}{v}$$\n    Since $v = \\sqrt{2E/m_f}$, the power loss to ions scales with energy as $E^{-1/2}$:\n    $$P_i(E) \\propto \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}}{\\sqrt{E}}$$\n    Note that a more rigorous treatment reveals a dependence on the masses of the ion species, $\\sum_j (n_j Z_j^2 / m_j)$. To obtain a simple scaling with $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, one must make the standard approximation that all ion species $j$ have a similar mass, $m_j \\approx m_i$, where $m_i$ is a characteristic mass of the main background ions. This approximation is implicit in problems seeking a simple scaling relationship between $E_c$ and $Z_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n3.  **Derivation of Critical Energy $E_c$ Scaling**\n    By definition, at the critical energy $E_c$, the power loss to electrons equals the power loss to ions:\n    $$P_e(E_c) = P_i(E_c)$$\n    Substituting the derived proportionalities:\n    $$K_1 E_c = K_2 \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}}{\\sqrt{E_c}}$$\n    where $K_1$ and $K_2$ are constants of proportionality that absorb all other physical parameters ($T_e, n_e, m_f, m_i, m_e$, fundamental constants). Solving for $E_c$:\n    $$E_c^{3/2} = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} Z_{\\text{eff}}$$\n    $$E_c = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{2/3} Z_{\\text{eff}}^{2/3}$$\n    Therefore, the critical energy $E_c$ scales with the effective charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ as:\n    $$E_c \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}}^{2/3}$$\n    The presence of impurities increases $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ (since impurities have $Z_j  1$). According to this scaling, an increase in impurity content raises the critical energy. This physically means that as the plasma becomes \"dirtier\" with high-$Z$ ions, the collisional power transfer to ions becomes stronger relative to electrons, so the fast ion must have a higher energy before electron drag becomes dominant.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Multiplicative Change Factor**\n    We are asked to compute the ratio $E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=3)/E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=1.5)$. Using the derived scaling law, we can write $E_c(Z_{\\text{eff}}) = K \\cdot Z_{\\text{eff}}^{2/3}$, where $K$ is the constant of proportionality.\n    The ratio is:\n    $$\\frac{E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=3)}{E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=1.5)} = \\frac{K \\cdot (3)^{2/3}}{K \\cdot (1.5)^{2/3}}$$\n    The constant $K$ cancels out:\n    $$\\frac{E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=3)}{E_{c}(Z_{\\text{eff}}=1.5)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{1.5}\\right)^{2/3} = (2)^{2/3}$$\n    This can be written as the cube root of $2$ squared:\n    $$(2)^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{4}$$\n    This is the exact value for the multiplicative change factor.",
