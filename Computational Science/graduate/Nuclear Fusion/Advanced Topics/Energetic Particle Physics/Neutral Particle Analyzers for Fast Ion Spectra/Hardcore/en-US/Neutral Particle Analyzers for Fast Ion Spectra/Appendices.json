This exercise explores how the plasma edge environment itself can prevent a neutral from being detected by reionizing it through collisions, a process known as attenuation. By calculating the survival fraction, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how this filtering effect is a critical factor that must be considered when interpreting the final signal strength from a Neutral Particle Analyzer ().",

            "problem": "A Neutral Particle Analyzer (NPA) detects fast neutral deuterium atoms produced by charge exchange in a tokamak plasma edge. Consider a fast neutral born at the start of the edge region and traveling along a straight chord of length $L$ to the NPA detector. Along this path, the neutral is subject to electron-loss (reionization) collisions with background neutrals. Assume the following scientifically consistent scenario:\n\n- The background neutral density profile along the chord coordinate $s$ (with $s = 0$ at the birth point and $s = L$ at the detector) is $n_{n}(s) = n_{0} \\exp(-s/\\lambda)$, with $n_{0} = 8.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ and $\\lambda = 0.08\\,\\text{m}$.\n- The chord length is $L = 0.64\\,\\text{m}$.\n- The reionization (electron-loss) cross section for a fast neutral of kinetic energy $E$ due to collisions with neutral targets is $\\sigma_{\\text{ion}}(E) = \\sigma_{*} \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{*}}\\right)^{-1/2}$, with $\\sigma_{*} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\text{m}^{2}$ and $E_{*} = 40\\,\\text{keV}$.\n- The fast neutral has energy $E = 80\\,\\text{keV}$ and travels without energy loss or deflection.\n\nStarting from first principles of kinetic theory and collision probability, derive the survival fraction $S(E)$, defined as the fraction of charge-exchange-produced neutrals of energy $E$ that remain in the same charge state (neutral) upon arrival at the detector. Then, using the given parameters, evaluate $S(E)$ numerically. Express your final result as a pure number (dimensionless) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of kinetic theory and atomic collisions, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and is formulated with objective, precise language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe survival fraction of fast neutral atoms traversing a medium is governed by the probability of ionizing collisions. We begin from the fundamental principle of particle beam attenuation. Let $I(s)$ be the flux of fast neutrals at a distance $s$ along a straight-line path. Over an infinitesimal path length $ds$, the number of particles removed from the beam, $dI$, is proportional to the incident flux $I(s)$, the local density of target particles $n_n(s)$, and the collision cross-section $\\sigma_{ion}(E)$. The differential equation for attenuation is:\n$$dI(s) = -I(s) n_n(s) \\sigma_{ion}(E) ds$$\nThe negative sign signifies a reduction in flux. This is a first-order separable differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\\frac{dI}{I} = -n_n(s) \\sigma_{ion}(E) ds$$\nTo find the total attenuation over the entire path of length $L$, we integrate this equation. The integration is performed from the point of origin, $s=0$, where the initial flux is $I_0$, to the detector at $s=L$, where the final flux is $I_L$.\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I_L} \\frac{dI}{I} = -\\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) \\sigma_{ion}(E) ds$$\nThe energy $E$ of the fast neutral is assumed to be constant along its path, which implies that the reionization cross-section $\\sigma_{ion}(E)$ is also a constant with respect to the position variable $s$. It can therefore be taken outside the integral on the right-hand side.\n$$\\ln(I_L) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\sigma_{ion}(E) \\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) ds$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_L}{I_0}\\right) = -\\sigma_{ion}(E) \\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) ds$$\nThe survival fraction, $S(E)$, is defined as the ratio of the flux at the detector to the initial flux, $S(E) = I_L/I_0$. By exponentiating both sides of the equation, we obtain the expression for $S(E)$:\n$$S(E) = \\exp\\left( -\\sigma_{ion}(E) \\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) ds \\right)$$\nThe argument of the exponential is the optical depth of the medium, denoted by $\\tau(E)$:\n$$\\tau(E) = \\sigma_{ion}(E) \\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) ds$$\nThe next step is to evaluate the line-integrated density by integrating the given density profile, $n_n(s) = n_{0} \\exp(-s/\\lambda)$, from $s=0$ to $s=L$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} n_n(s) ds = \\int_{0}^{L} n_{0} \\exp(-s/\\lambda) ds = n_{0} \\Big[-\\lambda \\exp(-s/\\lambda)\\Big]_{0}^{L}$$\n$$= n_{0} \\left( -\\lambda \\exp(-L/\\lambda) - (-\\lambda \\exp(0)) \\right) = n_{0} \\lambda \\left(1 - \\exp(-L/\\lambda)\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute this result and the given expression for the cross-section, $\\sigma_{ion}(E) = \\sigma_{*} \\left(E/E_{*}\\right)^{-1/2}$, into the equation for $S(E)$.

According to the Ideal Gas Law, the pressure $P_g$, volume $V$, number of particles $N$, and absolute temperature $T_g$ are related by the equation $P_g V = N k_B T_g$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The number density $n_g$ is defined as the number of particles per unit volume, $n_g = N/V$. Therefore, we can express the target density as:\n$$n_g = \\frac{P_g}{k_B T_g}$$\n\nNext, we derive the probability of a neutral deuterium atom being converted into an ion as it traverses the gas cell. Let $I(x)$ be the flux of neutral deuterium atoms at a distance $x$ into the cell. The change in the neutral flux, $dI$, over an infinitesimal distance $dx$ is proportional to the incident flux $I(x)$, the target density $n_g$, and the electron-loss (stripping) cross section $\\sigma_{\\text{strip}}$.

Therefore, the conversion probability, $P_{\\text{strip}}$, which is the probability of a neutral being stripped to an ion, is simply $1$ minus the survival probability:\n$$P_{\\text{strip}}(L_g) = 1 - P_{\\text{survival}}(L_g) = 1 - \\exp(-n_g \\sigma_{\\text{strip}} L_g)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the target density $n_g$, we obtain the conversion probability in terms of the given macroscopic parameters:\n$$P_{\\text{strip}}(L_g) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{P_g \\sigma_{\\text{strip}} L_g}{k_B T_g}\\right)$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nThe next step is to find the minimal gas cell length, $L_g$, that satisfies the design requirement $P_{\\text{strip}} > 0.9$.
