This corresponds to a negative density gradient, $\\frac{\\partial n_Z}{\\partial r} < 0$.\nThe impurity inverse scale length is $L_{nZ}^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{n_Z}\\frac{\\partial n_Z}{\\partial r}$. Since $n_Z > 0$, the condition $\\frac{\\partial n_Z}{\\partial r} < 0$ implies that $L_{nZ}^{-1} > 0$.\nThe impurity peaking factor is $R/L_{nZ}$. As the major radius $R$ is a positive definite quantity, the condition for inward peaking ($L_{nZ}^{-1} > 0$) is equivalent to the peaking factor being positive:\n$$\n\\frac{R}{L_{nZ}} > 0\n$$\nUsing the derived expression, the condition becomes:\n$$\nC_T\\,\\left(\\frac{R}{L_{T_e}}\\right) + C_n\\,\\left(\\frac{R}{L_{n_e}}\\right) - C_{\\epsilon} > 0\n$$\nThis inequality shows that the thermodiffusive term (proportional to the temperature gradient, $R/L_{T_e}$) and the conventional convective term (proportional to the density gradient, $R/L_{n_e}$) drive impurities inward, while the curvature-related pinch term (proportional to $C_{\\epsilon}$) drives impurities outward for $C_{\\epsilon} > 0$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical computation of $R/L_{nZ}$**\n\nWe use the derived formula and substitute the provided numerical values:\n- $C_T = 0.45$\n- $C_n = 0.20$\n- $C_{\\epsilon} = 0.55$\n- $\\frac{R}{L_{T_e}} = 6.5$\n- $\\frac{R}{L_{n_e}} = 0.80$\n\n$$\n\\frac{R}{L_{nZ}} = (0.45)\\,(6.5) + (0.20)\\,(0.80) - 0.55\n$$\nFirst, we compute the individual terms:\n$$\n(0.45)\\,(6.5) = 2.925\n$$\n$$\n(0.20)\\,(0.80) = 0.16\n$$\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{R}{L_{nZ}} = 2.925 + 0.16 - 0.55\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{R}{L_{nZ}} = 3.085 - 0.55\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{R}{L_{nZ}} = 2.535\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer to four significant figures, which the result $2.535$ already possesses. Since the computed value is positive ($2.535 > 0$), this plasma state exhibits inward impurity peaking.",
