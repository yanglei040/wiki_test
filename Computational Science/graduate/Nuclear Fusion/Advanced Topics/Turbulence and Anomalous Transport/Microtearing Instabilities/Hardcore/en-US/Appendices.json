This is a standard optimization problem that can be solved using differential calculus. The physically relevant domain for $x$ is $x  0$, as the wavenumber $k_y$ and the ion Larmor radius $\\rho_i$ are positive definite quantities.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ that maximizes $\\hat{\\gamma}(x)$, we must first find the critical points of the function.

The tearing-parity perturbation is characterized by an even magnetic flux function $\\psi(x)$ and an odd radial magnetic field perturbation.\n\nWe start from Maxwell’s equations and ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

In tearing theory, the outer ideal solution provides a boundary condition for the inner kinetic layer, where electron dynamics, collisions, and temperature gradients enter. Asymptotic matching yields a dispersion relation in which the inner-layer response produces a complex relation between the layer current and the imposed outer-field gradient, while the outer region contributes through $\\Delta'$. To leading order, the growth rate inherits a proportional dependence on $\\Delta'$ multiplied by inner-layer transport coefficients and drive terms (for microtearing, the electron temperature gradient and finite electron conductivity set the drive). \n\nThe sign of $\\Delta'$ determines whether the outer solution promotes or suppresses reconnection: a positive $\\Delta'$ corresponds to a net focusing of field lines that tends to amplify the reconnecting perturbation, whereas a negative $\\Delta'$ corresponds to defocusing and tends to inhibit reconnection. Consequently, for microtearing driven by electron temperature gradients, a larger positive $\\Delta'$ lowers the threshold and increases the growth rate. If $\\Delta'$ is negative, as in the present eigenfunction with $\\Delta' = -2 k$, the outer-region matching is stabilizing; microtearing can still occur only if the inner-layer kinetic drive is sufficiently strong to overcome this stabilizing outer contribution. The magnitude $|\\Delta'|$ scales the strength of this outer-region effect linearly to leading order, so increasing $|\\Delta'|$ strengthens either the stabilizing or destabilizing influence depending on its sign.\n\nIn summary, the requested analytic expression for the tearing stability parameter associated with the given eigenfunction is\n$$\n\\Delta' = -2 k\n$$\nThis expression encapsulates the outer-region contribution that, when fed into the inner-layer microtearing physics, sets the sign and scale of the growth-rate modification due to tearing stability.",

We consider the potentials $\\phi$ and $A_{\\parallel}$ to be functions of $\\theta$ only, so they are even in $v_{\\parallel}$.\n\n**Case A: Drift-Wave (ITG/TEM) Modes**\n\nDrift-wave instabilities are fundamentally electrostatic, driven by pressure gradients. The primary potential describing the mode is $\\phi$. For the most unstable mode, which is the ground state of the corresponding eigenproblem, we expect a nodeless structure. In a symmetric potential well, which is the case here as the operator coefficients are even in $\\theta$, the ground state eigenfunction must be even. Thus, we postulate that for drift waves, $\\phi(\\theta)$ is **even**. This corresponds to $C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{DW}} = +1$.\n\nLet's assume the eigenmode possesses drift-wave parity: $\\phi(\\theta)$ is even, $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is odd.\nLet's determine the combined parity of the source term $S_s \\propto J_0(\\phi - v_{\\parallel} A_{\\parallel})$. Under $(\\theta, v_{\\parallel}) \\to (-\\theta, -v_{\\parallel})$:\n$S_s \\to J_0(\\phi(-\\theta) - (-v_{\\parallel}) A_{\\parallel}(-\\theta)) = J_0(\\phi(\\theta) + v_{\\parallel} (-A_{\\parallel}(\\theta))) = J_0(\\phi(\\theta) - v_{\\parallel} A_{\\parallel}) = S_s$.\nThe source $S_s$ is \"even\".

This requires $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ to be **odd**. This is consistent with our initial assumption. Thus, $C_{A}^{\\mathrm{DW}} = -1$.\n\n2.  **Quasineutrality**: $\\sum_s e_s \\delta n_s = 0$.\n    The perturbed density $\\delta n_s = -\\frac{e_s n_{0s}}{T_s}\\phi + \\int J_0 \\delta g_s d^3 v$. The first term is even since $\\phi$ is assumed even. The second term gives the non-adiabatic density response, let's call it $\\delta n_{s,NA}$. As $\\delta g_s$ is \"even\" and $J_0$ is even, the integral $\\int J_0 \\delta g_s d^3v$ results in an even function of $\\theta$. Thus, the quasineutrality equation is a sum of even functions, which is consistent.\n\nThe assignment $(\\phi, A_{\\parallel}) = (\\text{even, odd})$ is self-consistent for the drift-wave branch.\n\n**Case B: Microtearing (MT) Modes**\n\nMicrotearing modes are fundamentally electromagnetic, driven by the electron temperature gradient. They require magnetic reconnection, which is facilitated by a parallel current sheet localized at the resonant surface ($\\theta=0$). The primary potential is $A_{\\parallel}$. The simplest mode structure corresponding to reconnection involves an even profile for $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ and the parallel current $j_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$. Thus, we postulate that for microtearing modes, $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is **even**. This implies $C_{A}^{\\mathrm{MT}} = +1$.\n\nLet's assume the eigenmode possesses tearing parity: $\\phi(\\theta)$ is odd, $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is even.\nLet's determine the combined parity of the source term $S_s \\propto J_0(\\phi - v_{\\parallel} A_{\\parallel})$. Under $(\\theta, v_{\\parallel}) \\to (-\\theta, -v_{\\parallel})$:\n$S_s \\to J_0(\\phi(-\\theta) - (-v_{\\parallel}) A_{\\parallel}(-\\theta)) = J_0(-\\phi(\\theta) + v_{\\parallel} A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)) = -S_s$.\nThe source $S_s$ is \"odd\". Consequently, the response $\\delta g_s$ must also be \"odd\": $\\delta g_s(-\\theta, -v_{\\parallel}) = -\\delta g_s(\\theta, v_{\\parallel})$.\n\nNow, we check for consistency.\n1.  **Parallel Ampère's Law**: $-k_{\\perp}^{2}(\\theta) A_{\\parallel}(\\theta) = \\mu_0 j_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$.\n    We find the parity of $j_{\\parallel}(\\theta) = \\sum_s e_s \\int v_{\\parallel} J_0 \\delta g_s \\, d^3v$.\n    $j_{\\parallel}(-\\theta) = \\sum_s e_s \\int (-v'_{\\parallel}) J_0(\\theta) \\delta g_s(-\\theta, -v'_{\\parallel}) \\, d^3v'$.\n    Since $\\delta g_s$ is \"odd\", $\\delta g_s(-\\theta, -v'_{\\parallel}) = -\\delta g_s(\\theta, v'_{\\parallel})$.\n    $j_{\\parallel}(-\\theta) = \\sum_s e_s \\int (-v'_{\\parallel}) J_0(\\theta) [-\\delta g_s(\\theta, v'_{\\parallel})] \\, d^3v' = j_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$.\n    So, $j_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is an **even** function of $\\theta$.\n    Ampère's law becomes: $-(\\text{even}) A_{\\parallel} = (\\text{even})$. This requires $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ to be **even**. This is consistent with our initial assumption.\n\n2.  **Quasineutrality**: $\\sum_s e_s \\delta n_s = 0$.\n    The non-adiabatic density response $\\delta n_{s,NA} = \\int J_0 \\delta g_s d^3v$ has a parity determined by the \"odd\" nature of $\\delta g_s$. This integral is an odd function of $\\theta$. The electrostatic term is proportional to $\\phi$. For the equation to hold, $\\phi$ must also be **odd** to match the parity of the non-adiabatic response. This is consistent with our initial assumption. Thus, $C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{MT}} = -1$.\n\nThe assignment $(\\phi, A_{\\parallel}) = (\\text{odd, even})$ is self-consistent for the microtearing branch.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the symmetry analysis of the governing gyrokinetic-Maxwell equations, we have determined the parities:\n-   For Microtearing (MT) modes: $\\phi(\\theta)$ is odd ($C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{MT}} = -1$) and $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is even ($C_{A}^{\\mathrm{MT}} = +1$).\n-   For Drift-Wave (DW) modes: $\\phi(\\theta)$ is even ($C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{DW}} = +1$) and $A_{\\parallel}(\\theta)$ is odd ($C_{A}^{\\mathrm{DW}} = -1$).\n\nThe requested ordered quadruple is $(C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{MT}},\\, C_{A}^{\\mathrm{MT}},\\, C_{\\phi}^{\\mathrm{DW}},\\, C_{A}^{\\mathrm{DW}})$. Substituting the values: $(-1, 1, 1, -1)$.",
