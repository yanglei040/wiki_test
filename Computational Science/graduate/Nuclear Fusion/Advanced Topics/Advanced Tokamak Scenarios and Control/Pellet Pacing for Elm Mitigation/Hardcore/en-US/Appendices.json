Consider a simplified pedestal energy balance model in which the edge pedestal energy, denoted by $E_{p}(t)$, is increased by a net heating power $P_{\\mathrm{in}}$ deposited into the pedestal between ELMs and is reduced primarily by discrete ELM crashes that remove an average energy $\\langle \\Delta W \\rangle$ per event.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is energy conservation applied over a single, complete ELM cycle in a steady-state condition. The assumption of a \"steady periodic fashion\" implies that, on average, the energy gained by the pedestal during the inter-ELM period must be exactly balanced by the energy lost during the ELM crash.\n\nLet $T_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$ be the period of one ELM cycle. The frequency $f_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$ is related to the period by the definition:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ELM}} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ELM}}}$$\n\nDuring the time interval $T_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$, the total energy supplied to the pedestal by the net heating power $P_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{gain}} = P_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times T_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, this accumulated energy is then expelled in a discrete event, an ELM crash, which removes an average energy $\\langle \\Delta W \\rangle$. Thus, the energy lost in one cycle is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\langle \\Delta W \\rangle$$\n\nFor the system to be in a steady state, the energy gained over one period must equal the energy lost in that period:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{gain}} = E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times T_{\\mathrm{ELM}} = \\langle \\Delta W \\rangle$$\n\nWe can now solve for the period $T_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ELM}} = \\frac{\\langle \\Delta W \\rangle}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\n\nSubstituting $T_{\\mathrm{ELM}} = 1 / f_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$, we can express the frequency $f_{\\mathrm{ELM}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{ELM}}} = \\frac{\\langle \\Delta W \\rangle}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ELM}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\langle \\Delta W \\rangle}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the expected energy loss per natural Edge Localized Mode (ELM), $\\Delta W_{N}$, in a tokamak. This will be accomplished in three main steps: first, deriving the volume of the pedestal region, $V_{\\mathrm{ped}}$; second, calculating the total stored thermal energy in the pedestal, $W_{\\mathrm{ped}}$; and third, using the given fractional loss to find $\\Delta W_{N}$.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Pedestal Volume $V_{\\mathrm{ped}}$\n\nThe plasma is described as an axisymmetric torus with a major radius $R$ and an elliptical cross-section. The cross-section has a minor radius $a$ (horizontal semi-axis) and an elongation $\\kappa$, so its vertical semi-axis is $b = \\kappa a$.\n\nThe volume of a body of revolution can be found using Pappus's second theorem, which states that the volume $V$ is the product of the cross-sectional area $A$ and the distance traveled by the centroid of the area, $2\\pi R_c$, where $R_c$ is the distance from the axis of revolution to the centroid. For an elliptical cross-section centered at a major radius $R$, the centroid is at a distance $R$ from the central axis of the tokamak.\n\nThe area of the elliptical cross-section is $A = \\pi a b = \\pi a (\\kappa a) = \\pi \\kappa a^2$.\n\nThe total volume of the plasma enclosed by the flux surface with minor radius $r$ and elongation $\\kappa$ is:\n$$V(r) = (2\\pi R) \\times (\\pi \\kappa r^2) = 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R r^2$$\n\nThe pedestal is modeled as a thin shell of radial width $\\Delta$ adjacent to the plasma boundary at $r=a$. This shell occupies the region between the minor radius $r = a-\\Delta$ and $r = a$. The volume of this shell, $V_{\\mathrm{ped}}$, is the difference between the volume enclosed by the surface at $r=a$ and the volume enclosed by the surface at $r=a-\\Delta$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} = V(a) - V(a-\\Delta)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R a^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R (a-\\Delta)^2$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R [a^2 - (a-\\Delta)^2]$$\nExpanding the $(a-\\Delta)^2$ term:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R [a^2 - (a^2 - 2a\\Delta + \\Delta^2)]$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R (2a\\Delta - \\Delta^2)$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the small-$\\Delta$ limit, where $\\Delta \\ll a$. In this limit, the term $\\Delta^2$ is negligible compared to the term $2a\\Delta$. Therefore, we can approximate the pedestal volume as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ped}} \\approx 2\\pi^2 \\kappa R (2a\\Delta) = 4\\pi^2 \\kappa R a \\Delta$$\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Pedestal Stored Energy $W_{\\mathrm{ped}}$\n\nThe problem states that the plasma behaves as an ideal, fully ionized, monatomic gas. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the internal energy density $u$ of a monatomic ideal gas is related to its pressure $p$ by:\n$$u = \\frac{3}{2} p$$\nThe pressure in the pedestal, $p_{\\mathrm{ped}}$, is assumed to be uniform. Thus, the internal energy density in the pedestal is constant:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{ped}} = \\frac{3}{2} p_{\\mathrm{ped}}$$\nThe total stored energy in the pedestal, $W_{\\mathrm{ped}}$, is the product of the internal energy density and the pedestal volume:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ped}} = u_{\\mathrm{ped}} V_{\\mathrm{ped}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $u_{\\mathrm{ped}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{ped}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ped}} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} p_{\\mathrm{ped}}\\right) (4\\pi^2 \\kappa R a \\Delta)$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 6\\pi^2 \\kappa R a \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{ped}}$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the ELM Energy Loss $\\Delta W_N$\n\nThe energy loss per natural ELM, $\\Delta W_N$, is given as a fraction $f_N$ of the pedestal stored energy:\n$$\\Delta W_{N} = f_{N} W_{\\mathrm{ped}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $W_{\\mathrm{ped}}$:\n$$\\Delta W_{N} = f_{N} (6\\pi^2 \\kappa R a \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{ped}}) = 6\\pi^2 f_{N} \\kappa R a \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{ped}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

This window is defined by a minimum size, $N_{\\min}$, to trigger an ELM, and a maximum size, $N_{\\max}$, to avoid suppressing the ELM cycle entirely.\n\nFirst, we provide the qualitative explanation. Pellet injection introduces a localized source of cold particles into the plasma edge.

The normalized electron collisionality, $\\nu^{*}_{e}$, is a key parameter that characterizes the transport regime of the plasma and scales as $\\nu^{*}_{e} \\propto n/T^2$.

At high collisionality, the bootstrap current, a self-generated current driven by the pressure gradient, is reduced. Since the bootstrap current is a major driver of peeling-ballooning modes, which are responsible for large Type-I ELMs, a sufficient increase in collisionality can stabilize these modes and lead to a transient ELM-free or small-ELM regime.

This can be rewritten using pressure $p_1 = n_1 T_1 e$ as:\n$$C \\frac{n_1^3}{(n_1 T_1)^2} = C \\frac{n_1^3}{(p_1/e)^2} = 1 \\implies C \\left(\\frac{p_1}{e}\\right)^2 = n_1^3$$\nThe post-pellet average density is $n_1 = n_0 + N_{\\max}/V_p$.\nThe final pressure (in units of eV$\\cdot$m$^{-3}$) can be found from energy conservation. The initial energy is $E_0 = \\frac{3}{2}p_0 V_p$, and the final energy is $E_1 = E_0 - E_a N_{\\max} e$. The final pressure is $p_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{E_1}{V_p}$.\n$$p_1/e = n_0 T_0 - \\frac{2 E_a N_{\\max}}{3 V_p}$$\nSubstituting these into the stability condition:\n$$C \\left(n_0 + \\frac{N_{\\max}}{V_p}\\right)^3 = \\left(n_0 T_0 - \\frac{2 E_a N_{\\max}}{3 V_p}\\right)^2$$\nThis is a cubic equation for $N_{\\max}$. Let $N_{\\max} = x \\cdot 10^{20}$.\nPlugging in values: $C = 6.4468 \\times 10^{-15}$, $n_0 = 5 \\times 10^{19}$, $T_0 = 1500$, $E_a = 50$, $V_p = 3.2$.\nLHS: $C \\left(5 \\times 10^{19} + \\frac{x \\cdot 10^{20}}{3.2}\\right)^3 = 6.4468 \\times 10^{-15} \\left(5 + 3.125x\\right)^3 \\times (10^{19})^3 = 6.4468 \\times 10^{42} \\left(5 + 3.125x\\right)^3$\nRHS: $\\left(5 \\times 10^{19} \\cdot 1500 - \\frac{2 \\cdot 50 \\cdot x \\cdot 10^{20}}{3 \\cdot 3.2}\\right)^2 = \\left(7.5 \\times 10^{22} - 1.04167x \\times 10^{21}\\right)^2 = \\left(7.5 - 0.104167x\\right)^2 \\times (10^{22})^2 = \\left(7.5 - 0.104167x\\right)^2 \\times 10^{44}$\nEquating them and simplifying:\n$$6.4468 \\times 10^{42} \\left(5 + 3.125x\\right)^3 = \\left(7.5 - 0.104167x\\right)^2 \\times 10^{44}$$\n$$0.064468 \\left(5 + 3.125x\\right)^3 = \\left(7.5 - 0.104167x\\right)^2$$\nThis equation must be solved numerically for $x$. Testing values shows that $x \\approx 1.4175$ is the solution.\nFor $x=1.4175$:\nLHS: $0.064468 \\left(5 + 3.125 \\cdot 1.4175\\right)^3 = 0.064468 \\left(9.4297\\right)^3 \\approx 0.064468 \\cdot 838.4 \\approx 54.06$\nRHS: $\\left(7.5 - 0.104167 \\cdot 1.4175\\right)^2 = \\left(7.5 - 0.14766\\right)^2 = (7.35234)^2 \\approx 54.05$\nThe values match. Thus, $N_{\\max} \\approx 1.4175 \\times 10^{20}$ atoms.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Usable Pacing Window, $\\Delta N$**\n\nThe usable window for pellet pacing is the difference between the maximum and minimum pellet sizes:\n$$\\Delta N = N_{\\max} - N_{\\min}$$\n$$\\Delta N = 1.4175 \\times 10^{20} - 3.75 \\times 10^{19} = 1.4175 \\times 10^{20} - 0.375 \\times 10^{20} = 1.0425 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ atoms}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in units of $10^{20}$ atoms, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta N = 1.04 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ atoms}$$",
