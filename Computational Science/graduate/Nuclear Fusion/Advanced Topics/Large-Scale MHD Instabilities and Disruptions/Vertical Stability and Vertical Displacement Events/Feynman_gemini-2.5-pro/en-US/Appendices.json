            "introduction": "The first line of defense against vertical instability in a tokamak is passive stabilization provided by nearby conductive structures, such as the vacuum vessel. Any vertical plasma motion induces toroidal eddy currents in these structures, which in turn generate a magnetic field that pushes the plasma back toward its original position. This practice will guide you through a first-principles derivation of the characteristic time for these eddy currents to decay, a crucial parameter known as the wall time, which sets the timescale for the required active feedback control.

            "problem": "Consider a high–aspect-ratio toroidal vacuum vessel in a tokamak, idealized as a thin conducting cylindrical shell with major radius $R$, wall thickness $t$, and uniform electrical conductivity $\\sigma$. The shell is axisymmetric, and the plasma generates a time-varying poloidal magnetic flux $\\Phi_{p}(t)$ that links the shell. The shell responds with induced eddy currents that flow in the toroidal direction and oppose the change of $\\Phi_{p}(t)$.\n\nWork in the magnetoquasistatic limit where the displacement current is negligible, and start from Maxwell’s equations (Faraday’s law and Ampère’s law) and Ohm’s law. Treat the wall as a thin sheet, assume axisymmetry, and use the toroidal component of the magnetic vector potential $A_{\\phi}(r,t)$ to describe the poloidal magnetic field in vacuum regions inside and outside the shell. Impose the appropriate boundary conditions across the thin sheet that follow from Ampère’s law. Derive an ordinary differential equation for the time evolution of $A_{\\phi}(R,t)$ and hence obtain the characteristic poloidal eddy current diffusion time for the shell. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\mu_{0}$, $\\sigma$, $t$, and $R$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the characteristic poloidal eddy current diffusion time of a thin, conducting, axisymmetric cylindrical shell of major radius $R$, thickness $t$, and electrical conductivity $\\sigma$. We are instructed to work in the magnetoquasistatic limit, starting from Maxwell's equations and Ohm's law, and to use the toroidal component of the magnetic vector potential, denoted as $A_{\\phi}(r,t)$, to describe the poloidal magnetic field. This implies an analysis in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\phi, z)$, where axisymmetry means $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}=0$, and the specific functional form $A_{\\phi}(r,t)$ implies we neglect variations along the $z$-axis, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}=0$. This is a common simplification for a high-aspect-ratio torus.\n\nThe magnetic vector potential is purely toroidal: $\\mathbf{A} = A_{\\phi}(r,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$.\nThe poloidal magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_p$ is given by $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$. In cylindrical coordinates, with $\\mathbf{A} = A_{\\phi}(r,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$, this simplifies to a purely axial field:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = B_z(r,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad B_z = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_{\\phi})\n$$\nFaraday's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$, combined with $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$, gives $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}) = 0$. This implies $\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla V$. For the toroidal component, and given axisymmetry ($\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\phi}=0$), the electric field is $E_{\\phi} = -\\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}}{\\partial t}$.\n\nInside the conducting shell, Ohm's law relates the induced toroidal current density $J_{\\phi}$ to the electric field: $J_{\\phi} = \\sigma E_{\\phi}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\phi} = -\\sigma \\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nAmpère's law in the magnetoquasistatic limit is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. With $\\mathbf{B} = B_z(r,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the curl is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$.\nThus, Ampère's law gives the relationship between the current density and the magnetic field:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial r} = \\mu_0 J_{\\phi}\n$$\nIn vacuum regions (inside for $r<R$ and outside for $r>R$), $J_{\\phi}=0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial r}=0$, so $B_z$ is constant with respect to $r$. Substituting $B_z = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_{\\phi})$, we get the governing equation for $A_{\\phi}$ in vacuum:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_{\\phi})\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is a Cauchy-Euler type equation, with the general solution $A_{\\phi}(r) = C_1 r + C_2 \\frac{1}{r}$.\n\nWe model the system with a source field, such as from the plasma current, which we represent as an externally applied uniform field $B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t)$. The corresponding vector potential is $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{ext}}(r,t) = \\frac{1}{2} B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t) r$. The total vector potential is the sum of this external potential and the potential from the induced eddy currents, $A_{\\phi} = A_{\\phi}^{\\text{ext}} + A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy}}$. The eddy current potential $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy}}$ must satisfy the homogeneous equation.\n\nWe apply boundary conditions to determine the solution for $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy}}$ in the regions inside ($r<R$) and outside ($r>R$) the shell.\n-   Inside the shell ($r<R$): To ensure the potential is finite at the origin $r=0$, the solution must be of the form $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, in}}(r,t) = C_{\\text{in}}(t) r$.\n-   Outside the shell ($r>R$): For the magnetic field to vanish as $r \\to \\infty$, the solution must be of the form $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, out}}(r,t) = C_{\\text{out}}(t) \\frac{1}{r}$.\n\nAcross the shell at $r=R$, two boundary conditions must be satisfied:\n1.  The vector potential $A_{\\phi}$ must be continuous.\n    $A_{\\phi}^{\\text{ext}}(R,t) + A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, in}}(R,t) = A_{\\phi}^{\\text{ext}}(R,t) + A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, out}}(R,t)$\n    $C_{\\text{in}}(t) R = C_{\\text{out}}(t) \\frac{1}{R} \\implies C_{\\text{out}}(t) = C_{\\text{in}}(t) R^2$.\n\n2.  The tangential magnetic field component ($B_z$) has a discontinuity related to the surface current density $K_{\\phi}$ in the shell. From the integral form of Ampère's law, the jump condition is $B_z(R^-) - B_z(R^+) = \\mu_0 K_{\\phi}$. The external field $B_z^{\\text{ext}}$ is continuous, so the jump is entirely in the field produced by the eddy currents: $B_z^{\\text{eddy}}(R^-) - B_z^{\\text{eddy}}(R^+) = \\mu_0 K_{\\phi}$.\n\nLet's compute the fields from the eddy current potentials:\n-   $B_z^{\\text{eddy, in}}(r,t) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, in}}) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(C_{\\text{in}}(t) r^2) = 2 C_{\\text{in}}(t)$.\n-   $B_z^{\\text{eddy, out}}(r,t) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, out}}) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(C_{\\text{in}}(t) R^2) = 0$.\n\nSo, $B_z^{\\text{eddy}}(R^-) = 2C_{\\text{in}}(t)$ and $B_z^{\\text{eddy}}(R^+) = 0$. The jump condition becomes:\n$$\n2C_{\\text{in}}(t) = \\mu_0 K_{\\phi}\n$$\nThe surface current density is $K_{\\phi} = J_{\\phi} t$. At the shell ($r=R$), $J_{\\phi} = -\\sigma \\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{\\partial t}$.\nThus, $K_{\\phi} = -\\sigma t \\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{\\partial t}$.\nSubstituting this into the jump condition equation:\n$$\n2C_{\\text{in}}(t) = -\\mu_0 \\sigma t \\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{\\partial t}\n$$\nNow we express $C_{\\text{in}}(t)$ in terms of $A_{\\phi}(R,t)$ and the external source. The total potential at the shell is:\n$A_{\\phi}(R,t) = A_{\\phi}^{\\text{ext}}(R,t) + A_{\\phi}^{\\text{eddy, in}}(R,t) = \\frac{1}{2}B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t) R + C_{\\text{in}}(t) R$.\nSolving for $C_{\\text{in}}(t)$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{in}}(t) = \\frac{A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{R} - \\frac{1}{2}B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{\\text{in}}(t)$ into the equation from the jump condition gives:\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{R} - \\frac{1}{2}B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t)\\right) = -\\mu_0 \\sigma t \\frac{d A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{dt}\n$$\nNote that we use an ordinary derivative $d/dt$ since $A_{\\phi}$ at a fixed position $r=R$ is a function of time only.\n$$\n\\frac{2}{R}A_{\\phi}(R,t) - B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t) = -\\mu_0 \\sigma t \\frac{d A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{dt}\n$$\nRearranging this yields the ordinary differential equation for $A_{\\phi}(R,t)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\sigma t \\frac{d A_{\\phi}(R,t)}{dt} + \\frac{2}{R} A_{\\phi}(R,t) = B_z^{\\text{ext}}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation. The characteristic time is the time constant of the corresponding homogeneous equation, $\\mu_0 \\sigma t \\frac{d A_{\\phi}}{dt} + \\frac{2}{R} A_{\\phi} = 0$.\nRewriting in the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}y = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d A_{\\phi}}{dt} + \\frac{2}{\\mu_0 \\sigma t R} A_{\\phi} = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic poloidal eddy current diffusion time, $\\tau$, is the reciprocal of the coefficient of the $A_{\\phi}$ term:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\sigma t R}{2}\n$$\nThis time constant characterizes the decay of eddy currents in the shell and the penetration of poloidal magnetic flux through it.",

It is simpler to first calculate the true-positive rate, which is the probability of a trigger under class $\\mathcal{V}$, and then find $\\beta$ using the complement.\nThe true-positive rate, $P(\\text{trigger} | \\mathcal{V})$, is:\n$$\nP(\\text{trigger} | \\mathcal{V}) = P(Z \\geq Z_{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ and } \\dot{Z} \\geq \\dot{Z}_{\\mathrm{th}} | \\mathcal{V})\n$$\nUnder class $\\mathcal{V}$, $Z$ and $\\dot{Z}$ are also independent, so:\n$$\nP(\\text{trigger} | \\mathcal{V}) = P(Z \\geq Z_{\\mathrm{th}} | \\mathcal{V}) \\times P(\\dot{Z} \\geq \\dot{Z}_{\\mathrm{th}} | \\mathcal{V})\n$$\nThe distributions are $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{Z}, \\sigma_{Z}^{2})$ and $\\dot{Z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\dot{Z}}, \\sigma_{\\dot{Z}}^{2})$. We standardize these variables using their respective means and the given thresholds and parameters:\n$\\sigma_{Z} = 0.01$, $\\mu_{Z} = 0.05$, $Z_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sigma_Z = 0.01$.\n$\\sigma_{\\dot{Z}} = 30$, $\\mu_{\\dot{Z}} = 90$, $\\dot{Z}_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.5\\,\\sigma_{\\dot{Z}} = 2.5 \\times 30 = 75$.\n\nFor the variable $Z$:\n$$\nP(Z \\geq Z_{\\mathrm{th}} | \\mathcal{V}) = Q\\left(\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\mu_{Z}}{\\sigma_{Z}}\\right) = Q\\left(\\frac{0.01 - 0.05}{0.01}\\right) = Q(-4)\n$$\nFor the variable $\\dot{Z}$:\n$$\nP(\\dot{Z} \\geq \\dot{Z}_{\\mathrm{th}} | \\mathcal{V}) = Q\\left(\\frac{\\dot{Z}_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\mu_{\\dot{Z}}}{\\sigma_{\\dot{Z}}}\\right) = Q\\left(\\frac{75 - 90}{30}\\right) = Q\\left(\\frac{-15}{30}\\right) = Q(-0.5)\n$$\nThe true-positive rate is $Q(-4) \\times Q(-0.5)$. The false-negative rate $\\beta$ is the complement:\n$$\n\\beta = 1 - P(\\text{trigger} | \\mathcal{V}) = 1 - \\left[ Q(-4) \\times Q(-0.5) \\right]\n$$\n\n**3. Balanced Error Rate ($\\mathrm{BER}$)**\n\nThe balanced error rate is defined as $\\mathrm{BER} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{2}$. Substituting the derived expressions for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BER} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (Q(1) \\times Q(2.5)) + (1 - Q(-4) \\times Q(-0.5)) \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we use standard values for the $Q$ function.\nWe have $Q(x) = 1 - \\Phi(x)$, which implies $Q(-x) = 1 - \\Phi(-x) = \\Phi(x) = 1 - Q(x)$. Thus, we can express $Q(-4)$ and $Q(-0.5)$ as:\n$Q(-4) = 1 - Q(4)$\n$Q(-0.5) = 1 - Q(0.5)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = 1 - \\left[ (1 - Q(4)) \\times (1 - Q(0.5)) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$Q(1) \\approx 0.158655$\n$Q(2.5) \\approx 0.006210$\n$\\alpha \\approx 0.158655 \\times 0.006210 \\approx 0.00098525$\n\n$Q(0.5) \\approx 0.308538$\n$Q(4) \\approx 3.167 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$\\beta = 1 - \\left[ (1 - 3.167 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (1 - 0.308538) \\right] = 1 - [ (0.99996833) \\times (0.691462) ] \\approx 1 - 0.691440 \\approx 0.308560$\n\nFinally, we calculate the BER:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BER} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.00098525 + 0.308560}{2} = \\frac{0.30954525}{2} \\approx 0.1547726\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1548$.",
