It is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics relevant to tokamak disruption mitigation, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe objective is to compute the radiated fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, which is defined as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\equiv \\min\\!\\left\\{1,\\; \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{W_{\\mathrm{th},0}}\\right\\}\n$$\nThis requires the calculation of two quantities: the initial total thermal energy of the plasma, $W_{\\mathrm{th},0}$, and the total energy radiated by impurities over the thermal-quench interval $\\tau_{\\mathrm{TQ}}$, which is denoted $E_{\\mathrm{rad}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial total thermal energy, $W_{\\mathrm{th},0}$. The thermal energy of a plasma is the sum of the kinetic energies of its constituent particles. The initial plasma consists of electrons and fully ionized deuterium ions ($Z_i = 1$). The thermal energy density, $w_{\\mathrm{th},0}$, is the sum of the electron and ion energy densities:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{th},0} = w_e + w_i = \\frac{3}{2} n_e k_B T_e + \\frac{3}{2} n_i k_B T_i\n$$\nThe problem states the pre-quench conditions are $n_i \\approx n_e$ and $T_i = T_e$.

We first evaluate the ratio of the calculated radiated energy to the initial thermal energy:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{W_{\\mathrm{th},0}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^9 \\,\\text{J}}{1.4418 \\times 10^7 \\,\\text{J}} \\approx 104.0\n$$\nSince this ratio is greater than $1$, the definition of $f_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ implies:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\min\\{1, 104.0\\} = 1\n$$\nPhysically, this means that the calculated potential radiated energy (assuming constant temperature) exceeds the total available thermal energy. In reality, the plasma would cool rapidly, radiating away essentially all its thermal energy in a time much shorter than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{TQ}}$. The definition of $f_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ correctly captures this physical limit, indicating a complete thermal quench where $100\\%$ of the initial thermal energy is radiated away.\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $1.00$.",
