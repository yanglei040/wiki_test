The concepts of safety factor, magnetic shear, pressure-driven instabilities, and the energy principle $\\delta W$ are fundamental to this field. The provided form of $\\delta W$ is a well-known simplified model for localized modes, representing a balance of field line bending, plasma stiffness, and pressure gradient effects. It is a scientifically valid, albeit simplified, representation of the core physics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific mathematical functional and asks for the determination of a marginal stability threshold based on it. The conditions on the coefficients ($C_1, C_2, C_3  0$) ensure that the terms have a definite stabilizing or destabilizing character. The task is to find a specific limiting value, which is a mathematically unambiguous objective.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard terminology of plasma physics. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the marginal stability threshold for interchange modes based on a simplified one-dimensional energy principle, $\\delta W$, valid for localized perturbations near a rational magnetic surface $r=r_s$. We first provide a physical interpretation of the terms in the given expression for $\\delta W$.\n\nThe potential energy functional is given as:\n$$\n\\delta W \\propto \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\left[ C_{1} \\left|\\frac{d \\xi_{r}}{dx}\\right|^{2} + C_{2} s^{2} x^{2} \\left|\\xi_{r}\\right|^{2} + C_{3} \\, \\alpha \\, \\left|\\xi_{r}\\right|^{2} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $x = r - r_s$ is the radial distance from the rational surface.\n\n1.  The term $C_{1} \\left|d \\xi_{r}/dx\\right|^{2}$ represents the energy required to create a radial gradient in the plasma displacement. It is an effective \"stiffness\" of the plasma against deformation and is always positive (stabilizing) since $C_1  0$. It penalizes perturbations with short radial wavelengths.\n\n2.  The term $C_{2} s^{2} x^{2} \\left|\\xi_{r}\\right|^{2}$ represents the energy required to bend the magnetic field lines. For a flute-like perturbation, the parallel wave-vector is $k_{\\parallel} = (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})/B$. At the rational surface $r_s$, $k_{\\parallel}(r_s) = 0$. For small deviations $x = r-r_s$, $k_\\parallel(x) \\approx k_\\parallel'(r_s) x$. The derivative of the parallel wave number is proportional to the magnetic shear, $k_\\parallel' \\propto (nq'/R) \\propto s$. Thus, $k_{\\parallel}^2 \\propto s^2 x^2$. The field line bending energy is proportional to $\\int k_{\\parallel}^2 |\\mathbf{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2 dV$. This term, with $C_20$, is always positive and represents stabilization due to magnetic shear.\n\n3.  The term $C_{3} \\alpha \\left|\\xi_{r}\\right|^{2}$ represents the free energy available from the plasma pressure gradient in the presence of magnetic field line curvature. For a typical magnetically confined plasma, the pressure decreases outwards ($dp/dr  0$). From the definition $\\alpha \\equiv (2 \\mu_{0} R q^{2}/B^{2}) (dp/dr)$, a negative pressure gradient implies $\\alpha  0$. With $C_3  0$, this term is negative, so it is destabilizing. It drives the interchange instability.\n\nA plasma state is stable if $\\delta W \\geq 0$ for all possible localized displacements $\\xi_r(x)$. It is unstable if there exists any $\\xi_r(x)$ for which $\\delta W  0$. The marginal stability point is defined by the condition that the minimum possible value of $\\delta W$ is exactly zero. We seek the critical value $\\alpha_c$ for which this occurs.\n\nTo find the minimum of the functional $\\delta W$, we can use the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle. Normalizing the energy by $\\int |\\xi_r|^2 dx$, we want to find the minimum of:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\delta W}{\\int |\\xi_r|^2 dx} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ C_{1} \\left|\\frac{d \\xi_{r}}{dx}\\right|^{2} + C_{2} s^{2} x^{2} \\left|\\xi_{r}\\right|^{2} \\right] dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\xi_r|^2 dx} + C_{3} \\alpha\n$$\nThe minimum value of this expression is found by minimizing the first term, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator $H = -C_{1} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + C_{2} s^2 x^2$. This is the Hamiltonian for a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The minimum value of the first term is the ground state energy $E_0$ of this QHO.\n\nThe standard QHO Hamiltonian is $H_{std} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$, with ground state energy $E_{0,std} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Our operator is $H = -C_{1} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + C_{2} s^2 x^2$. By identifying $C_1 = \\hbar^2/(2m)$ and $C_2 s^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2$, we can find the ground state energy.\n$m = \\hbar^2/(2C_1)$.\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{2 C_2 s^2}{m} = \\frac{2 C_2 s^2}{\\hbar^2/(2C_1)} = \\frac{4 C_1 C_2 s^2}{\\hbar^2}$.\nSo, $\\omega = \\frac{2|s|\\sqrt{C_1 C_2}}{\\hbar}$.\nThe ground state energy is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\left( \\frac{2|s|\\sqrt{C_1 C_2}}{\\hbar} \\right) = |s|\\sqrt{C_1 C_2}$.\n\nAt marginal stability, the minimum of $2\\delta W / \\int |\\xi_r|^2 dx$ is zero. This occurs when\n$$\nE_0 + C_3 \\alpha_c(s) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_0$:\n$$\n|s|\\sqrt{C_1 C_2} + C_3 \\alpha_c(s) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the critical pressure gradient parameter $\\alpha_c(s)$:\n$$\n\\alpha_c(s) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{C_1 C_2}}{C_3} |s|\n$$\nThe problem asks for the limiting critical value as the shear approaches zero, $s \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{s \\to 0} \\alpha_c(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{C_1 C_2}}{C_3} |s| \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis result represents the stability boundary for an interchange mode in the absence of shear stabilization.\nFor the final explanatory part: For a magnetically confined plasma, the pressure typically decreases from the core to the edge, so $dp/dr  0$. The definition of the pressure parameter is $\\alpha(r) \\equiv (2 \\mu_{0} R q(r)^{2}/B^{2}) (dp/dr)$. Since all other quantities in the prefactor are positive, $dp/dr  0$ implies $\\alpha  0$. The stability condition in the absence of shear ($s=0$) is $\\alpha \\ge \\alpha_c(s=0) = 0$. A typical profile with $\\alpha  0$ violates this condition, $\\alpha  \\alpha_c$, and is therefore unstable to interchange modes. This is the classic ideal interchange instability driven by the combination of pressure gradient and unfavorable magnetic curvature, which is no longer stabilized when shear is absent.",

There are no contradictions or missing critical information for the requested analysis. The problem is **VALID**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe stability of ideal MHD interchange modes is determined by the sign of the change in potential energy, $\\delta W$, resulting from a plasma displacement $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$. The problem states that $\\delta W$ is composed of a destabilizing term related to the pressure gradient and field-line curvature (parameterized by $\\alpha$) and a stabilizing term from magnetic line-bending. Let the radial displacement be $\\xi_r(r)$. The potential energy density, $U(r)$, can be written as:\n$$ U(r) \\propto B^2 k_{\\parallel}^2(r) |\\xi_r|^2 - \\alpha(r) |\\xi_r|^2 $$\nInstability ($\\delta W  0$) is possible if the negative term from the pressure drive ($\\alpha  0$) can overcome the positive, stabilizing line-bending term.\n\n**1. Radial Variation of $k_\\parallel$ due to Shear**\n\nThe parallel wavenumber is defined as $k_\\parallel(r) = (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) / |\\mathbf{B}|$. For a helical perturbation $\\sim \\exp(im\\theta - ik_z z)$ in a cylindrical pinch with $\\mathbf{B}(r) = B_\\theta(r)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + B_z(r)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$, this is $k_\\parallel = (m/r)B_\\theta(r) - k_z B_z(r)$. Using the safety factor definition for a periodic cylinder of length $L = 2\\pi R$, $q(r) = r B_z / (R B_\\theta)$, we can express $k_\\parallel$ as:\n$$ k_\\parallel(r) = \\frac{m B_\\theta}{r} - k_z B_z \\approx \\frac{B_z}{R} \\left( \\frac{m}{q(r)} - n \\right) $$\nwhere we have set the axial wavenumber to be quantized as $k_z = n/R$.\n\nThe mode is localized near the rational surface $r_s$ where $k_\\parallel(r_s) = 0$, which implies $q(r_s) = m/n$. We perform a Taylor expansion of $k_\\parallel(r)$ around $r_s$ for a small displacement $x = r - r_s$:\n$$ k_\\parallel(r) \\approx k_\\parallel(r_s) + x \\left. \\frac{d k_\\parallel}{dr} \\right|_{r_s} = x \\left. \\frac{d k_\\parallel}{dr} \\right|_{r_s} $$\nThe derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d k_\\parallel}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{B_z}{R} \\left(\\frac{m}{q} - n\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{m B_z}{R q^2} \\frac{dq}{dr} $$\nUsing the definition of magnetic shear, $s(r) = (r/q) dq/dr$, we have $dq/dr = sq/r$. Substituting this into the derivative gives:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d k_\\parallel}{dr} \\right|_{r_s} = -\\frac{m B_z}{R q_s^2} \\frac{s_s q_s}{r_s} = -\\frac{m B_z s_s}{R r_s q_s} $$\nwhere the subscript $s$ denotes evaluation at $r=r_s$. The key result is that the rate of change of $k_\\parallel$ is directly proportional to the magnetic shear, $s$:\n$$ \\frac{d k_\\parallel}{dr} \\propto s $$\nTherefore, near the rational surface, the parallel wavenumber varies linearly with the distance $x = r-r_s$:\n$$ k_\\parallel(x) \\approx x \\left(k_\\parallel'\\right)_s \\propto s \\cdot x $$\n\n**2. Shear-Generated Stabilizing Term**\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the line-bending energy term gives:\n$$ B^2 k_{\\parallel}^2(x) \\propto B^2 \\left( k_\\parallel' x \\right)^2 \\propto s^2 x^2 $$\nThis shows that magnetic shear generates a stabilizing potential energy term that increases quadratically with distance from the rational surface. This forms a parabolic potential \"barrier\" that confines the mode and opposes the interchange instability. The potential energy density near $r_s$ is:\n$$ U(x) \\propto s^2 x^2 - \\alpha $$\n(Here, we absorb various constants and scale lengths into the definitions of the coefficients).\n\n**3. Stability in the High-Shear Limit**\n\nFor an unstable mode to exist, the total potential energy $\\delta W = \\int U(x) |\\xi_r(x)|^2 dx$ must be negative. The mode tries to localize itself in the region where $U(x)  0$, which is $|x|  \\sqrt{\\alpha}/|s|$. Let the characteristic width of the mode be $\\delta r$. To form a bound, unstable mode, the destabilizing energy gained from the $-\\alpha$ term must overcome two stabilizing effects:\n1. The line-bending energy within the mode width: $\\delta W_{bend} \\propto \\int (s^2 x^2) |\\xi_r|^2 dx$. For a mode of width $\\delta r$, this scales as $s^2 (\\delta r)^2$.\n2. The energy cost of radial gradients in the eigenfunction: $\\delta W_{grad} \\propto \\int |\\nabla_\\perp \\xi_r|^2 dx \\sim \\int |\\frac{d\\xi_r}{dx}|^2 dx$. For a mode of width $\\delta r$, this scales as $1/(\\delta r)^2$.\n\nA full variational analysis or solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation shows that the condition for ideal MHD interchange instability is given by the Suydam criterion. In the notation of this problem, the criterion for stability is approximately $C s^2  \\alpha$ for some constant $C$ of order unity.\nThe problem specifies the high-shear limit, $|s| \\gg \\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$, which implies $s^2 \\gg |\\alpha|$. In this limit, the Suydam criterion for stability is strongly satisfied. The stabilizing effect of shear, which grows as $s^2$, overwhelms the pressure drive, which scales as $\\alpha$.\nConsequently, in ideal MHD, there are **no unstable interchange modes** in the high-shear limit. The system is stable.\n\n**4. Radial Width Scaling**\n\nAlthough no unstable mode exists, we can determine the characteristic radial scale of the physics involved. This scale, $\\delta r$, represents the width of the region where the destabilizing drive is comparable to the stabilizing line-bending potential. This is found by balancing the two terms in the potential energy density:\n$$ s^2 (\\delta r)^2 \\sim \\alpha $$\n$$ \\implies \\delta r \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}}{|s|} $$\nIntroducing a macroscopic equilibrium scale length $L$ (such as the minor radius $r_s$ or the pressure gradient scale length) to ensure correct dimensions, we get:\n$$ \\delta r \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}}{|s|} L $$\nThis scale represents the width of the potential well in which an unstable mode would be forced to reside. In the stable case, it can be interpreted as the radial e-folding length of the stable eigenfunction (the least stable mode) or the penetration depth of an externally driven perturbation.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. In the limit $|s| \\gg \\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$, magnetic line-bending produces a quadratic radial barrier around $r_{s}$, leaving no classically allowed region for interchange growth; the eigenfunction becomes evanescent with a radial e-folding width $\\delta r \\sim (\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}/|s|)\\,L$, where $L$ is a macroscopic equilibrium scale, and there is no unstable interchange mode.**\n    - This statement correctly identifies that the line-bending creates a quadratic barrier ($s^2 x^2$).\n    - It correctly concludes that there is **no unstable interchange mode**, consistent with ideal MHD in the high-shear limit where the Suydam criterion is satisfied.\n    - The term \"evanescent\" is appropriate for a stable eigenfunction, which does not grow in time and is spatially localized.\n    - It provides the correct scaling for the characteristic radial width, $\\delta r \\sim (\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}/|s|)L$.\n    - The phrase \"no classically allowed region for interchange growth\" is slightly imprecise but conveys the correct outcome: the zero-point energy associated with localizing the mode within the potential well is larger than the well's depth, preventing the formation of a negative-energy (unstable) state.\n    This statement is the most physically accurate description.\n\n- **B. In the limit $|s| \\gg \\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$, the interchange drive dominates over line-bending; the growth rate increases as $\\gamma \\sim v_{A}\\,|s|$, and the radial width broadens as $\\delta r \\sim (|s|/\\sqrt{|\\alpha|})\\,L$.**\n    - This is incorrect. High shear is stabilizing, not destabilizing. The interchange drive does not dominate. The growth rate does not increase with $|s|$, and the width narrows with $|s|$, it does not broaden.\n\n- **C. In the limit $|s| \\gg \\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$, the stability is unchanged from low-shear conditions; the shear and pressure gradient enter linearly and the radial width remains $\\delta r \\sim L$, independent of $s$.**\n    - This is incorrect. Shear fundamentally alters stability. Its effect appears as $s^2$, not linearly. The radial width is strongly dependent on $s$.\n\n- **D. In the limit $|s| \\gg \\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$, unstable interchange modes persist but with a suppressed growth rate scaling $\\gamma \\propto v_{A}(\\alpha/s^{2})$; the radial width narrows as $\\delta r \\sim (\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}/|s|)\\,L$, yet the system remains interchange-unstable.**\n    - This is incorrect. While the width scaling is correct, this statement claims the system remains unstable. As established, ideal MHD predicts stability in this limit. The persistence of instability with a suppressed growth rate is characteristic of *resistive* interchange modes, which are non-ideal effects forbidden by the problem's premise of ideal MHD.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A provides the most accurate description of the physics of ideal interchange modes in the high-shear limit. The system is stable, and the characteristic length scales as predicted.",

Use the permeability of free space $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$.\n\nStarting from the ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) energy principle, and specializing to high-mode-number perturbations localized in the radial direction (interchange-like displacements), derive the local necessary stability condition for such modes in cylindrical geometry expressed by a radial parameter $D(r)$ that depends on the magnetic shear and the pressure gradient. Your derivation must be from first principles: begin with the ideal MHD energy principle, identify the contributions to the potential energy from field-line bending and pressure-gradient (interchange) drive, and reduce the result to a local criterion involving the safety factor profile $q(r)$ and the radial pressure gradient $p'(r)$, together with the magnetic field strength $B(r)$. Clearly state any assumptions used to justify the localization and the cylindrical reduction and ensure that the final expression for $D(r)$ is dimensionally consistent. Do not invoke shortcut formulas; derive the needed expression from the energy principle using well-tested facts about cylindrical equilibria and magnetic shear.\n\nOnce you have derived the expression for $D(r)$, implement the following algorithmic workflow:\n\n- Construct a uniform radial grid $r_i$ for $i=0,\\dots,N-1$ on $(0,a)$ with $N$ points, excluding $r=0$ to avoid division by zero. Use $N=51$ and $r \\in [0.01,0.95]$ meters for all test cases.\n- From the given $q(r)$, $p(r)$, and $B(r)$ profiles, compute the radial derivatives $q'(r)$ and $p'(r)$ numerically using second-order-accurate central differences on interior points and first-order-accurate one-sided differences on the endpoints.\n- Evaluate the derived $D(r)$ on the grid using the numerically computed derivatives and the provided profiles.\n- Flag all grid points where $D(r)  0$ as locally Suydam-unstable.\n- Report the unstable radii in meters, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nUnits and numerical requirements:\n\n- All radii must be reported in meters.\n- Round each reported radius to three decimal places.\n- Angles do not appear in this problem; no angle unit is required.\n- The final output must be a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to one test case and is itself a list of floating-point numbers giving the unstable radii in meters, rounded to three decimal places. For example: $[ [0.123,0.456],[],[0.789] ]$, without spaces.\n\nTest suite:\n\nEvaluate your workflow on the following three scientifically plausible equilibrium parameter sets:\n\n- Test Case A (expected broadly stable):\n  - Minor radius: $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Radial grid: $r \\in [0.01,0.95]\\,\\mathrm{m}$ with $N=51$ points.\n  - Magnetic field: $B(r) = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n  - Safety factor: $q(r) = 1.0 + 2.0\\,r$.\n  - Pressure: $p(r) = 8.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2\\right)$.\n\n- Test Case B (expected to have a substantial unstable region due to lower magnetic field and steeper pressure gradient with low shear):\n  - Minor radius: $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Radial grid: $r \\in [0.01,0.95]\\,\\mathrm{m}$ with $N=51$ points.\n  - Magnetic field: $B(r) = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n  - Safety factor: $q(r) = 1.0 + 1.0\\,r$.\n  - Pressure: $p(r) = 1.2\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2\\right)$.\n\n- Test Case C (expected to have an unstable window near a radius where $q'(r) \\approx 0$, with mild magnetic-field variation):\n  - Minor radius: $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Radial grid: $r \\in [0.01,0.95]\\,\\mathrm{m}$ with $N=51$ points.\n  - Magnetic field: $B(r) = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{T}\\,\\left(1 - 0.2\\,\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2\\right)$.\n  - Safety factor: $q(r) = 1.2 + 0.8\\,r - 0.5\\,r^3$.\n  - Pressure: $p(r) = 1.0\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2\\right)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets with no spaces. Each element of this top-level list must be the list of unstable radii for the corresponding test case, in meters, rounded to three decimal places. For example, the format must be exactly like $[[r_{A,1},r_{A,2},\\dots],[r_{B,1},\\dots],[r_{C,1},\\dots]]$ with no spaces anywhere.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\n\nThe solution to this problem involves two parts: first, the derivation of the Suydam criterion for localized interchange modes from fundamental principles of ideal MHD, and second, the numerical implementation of this criterion to test given plasma profiles for stability.\n\n#### Derivation of the Suydam Criterion\n\nThe stability of a plasma equilibrium against small perturbations is determined by the sign of the change in potential energy, $\\delta W$, associated with a displacement $\\mathbf{\\xi}$. According to the ideal MHD energy principle, an equilibrium is stable if and only if $\\delta W \\ge 0$ for all physically permissible displacements $\\mathbf{\\xi}$.\n\nWe consider a straight cylindrical plasma of length $L$ (which we can associate with $2\\pi R_0$ for a large-aspect-ratio torus). The equilibrium magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} = B_\\theta(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}} + B_z(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and the equilibrium is described by the pressure balance equation $\\nabla p = \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, which reduces to $\\frac{dp}{dr} = j_\\theta B_z - j_z B_\\theta$.\n\nWe analyze localized interchange modes. These are perturbations that are highly localized in the radial direction around a specific magnetic surface, known as a rational surface. A perturbation is described by a spatial dependence of the form $\\mathbf{\\xi}(r,\\theta,z) = \\mathbf{\\xi}(r)e^{i(m\\theta-kz)}$. A rational surface at radius $r=r_s$ is one where the helical pitch of the mode matches the pitch of the magnetic field lines, causing the parallel component of the wavevector to vanish:\n$$ \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{m}{r_s}B_\\theta(r_s) - k B_z(r_s) = 0 $$\nThis condition minimizes the large, stabilizing energy cost associated with bending magnetic field lines. The safety factor, which measures the pitch of the field lines, is given by $q(r) = \\frac{r B_z}{R_0 B_\\theta}$. In the straight cylinder notation with periodicity length $L=2\\pi R_0$ and wavenumber $k=-n/R_0$, the resonance condition becomes $q(r_s) = m/n$.\n\nWhile the parallel gradient $\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla$ vanishes on the rational surface, it is non-zero just off the surface. This residual effect is due to magnetic shear, i.e., the radial variation of the field line pitch. Expanding $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}$ about $r_s$ with $x = r - r_s$:\n$$ \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}(r) \\approx x \\left.\\frac{d(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})}{dr}\\right|_{r_s} $$\nThis term gives rise to a stabilizing contribution to $\\delta W$ proportional to the square of the magnetic shear. The shear is most conveniently expressed via the safety factor. The stabilizing field-line bending term in $\\delta W$ can be shown to be proportional to $(q'/q)^2$, where $q' = dq/dr$.\n\nThe destabilizing drive for interchange modes comes from the plasma pressure gradient. In a curved magnetic field, a plasma element moved from a region of high pressure to low pressure releases energy. In a cylinder, the curvature of the helical field lines provides an effective \"gravity\". The corresponding destabilizing term in $\\delta W$ is proportional to the pressure gradient, $p'(r) = dp/dr$. For a confined plasma, $p'(r)$ is negative.\n\nA rigorous derivation, obtained by minimizing $\\delta W$ with respect to the components of $\\mathbf{\\xi}$ or analyzing the solutions of the linearized MHD equations near $r_s$, leads to a second-order ordinary differential equation for the radial displacement. Analysis of this equation (often called Newcomb's analysis) reveals that instability (corresponding to oscillatory solutions) occurs if a specific condition is not met. This condition, for localized modes, is the Suydam criterion.\n\nThe stability criterion is given by:\n$$ \\frac{r}{4} \\left( \\frac{q'(r)}{q(r)} \\right)^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_0 p'(r)}{B_z(r)^2}  0 $$\nHere, the first term represents the stabilizing effect of magnetic shear, which is always positive. The second term represents the pressure gradient drive, which is destabilizing for a confined plasma where $p'(r)0$. For stability, the shear must be large enough to overcome the pressure gradient drive.\n\nThe problem provides the total magnetic field magnitude $B(r)$. In many cylindrical models, especially for high-field, low-$\\beta$ (where $\\beta = p / (B^2/2\\mu_0)$) plasmas like tokamaks, the axial field $B_z$ is much larger than the poloidal field $B_\\theta$. Under this common approximation, $B(r) \\approx B_z(r)$. We will adopt this assumption, as it is standard practice and necessary to proceed.\n\nThe problem asks for a parameter $D(r)$ such that $D(r)  0$ implies instability. We can thus define $D(r)$ as the left-hand side of the stability inequality:\n$$ D(r) = \\frac{r}{4} \\left( \\frac{q'(r)}{q(r)} \\right)^2 + \\frac{2 \\mu_0 p'(r)}{B(r)^2} $$\nA region is locally unstable to interchange modes if $D(r)  0$.\n\n#### Algorithmic Workflow\n\nThe numerical implementation follows these steps:\n1.  **Grid Generation**: A uniform radial grid `r` is constructed from $r=0.01$ to $r=0.95$ with $N=51$ points.\n2.  **Profile Evaluation**: For each test case, the functions $p(r)$, $q(r)$, and $B(r)$ are evaluated on the radial grid `r` to obtain arrays of their values.\n3.  **Numerical Differentiation**: A function is implemented to compute the first derivative of a function given on the grid. It uses a second-order accurate central difference formula for interior points, $f'_{i} = (f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}) / (2\\Delta r)$, and first-order accurate one-sided (forward/backward) difference formulas for the endpoints, $f'_{0} = (f_{1} - f_{0}) / \\Delta r$ and $f'_{N-1} = (f_{N-1} - f_{N-2}) / \\Delta r$. This function is used to compute the arrays $p'(r)$ and $q'(r)$.\n4.  **Suydam Parameter Calculation**: The derived expression for $D(r)$ is evaluated at each grid point using the arrays for $r$, $p(r)$, $p'(r)$, $q(r)$, $q'(r)$, and $B(r)$. The value of $\\mu_0$ is used.\n5.  **Instability Check**: The array $D(r)$ is checked at each point. All radial positions $r_i$ where $D(r_i)  0$ are identified as unstable.\n6.  **Output Formatting**: The list of unstable radii for each test case is collected. Each radius is rounded to three decimal places. The final result is a list of these lists, formatted into a single string with no spaces as per the problem specification.\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases provided.",
