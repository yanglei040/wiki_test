It presents a standard calculation in the field of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) applied to tokamak plasmas. All necessary physical parameters, constants, and simplifying assumptions are explicitly provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, to justify the definitions of the Joule heating timescale, $\\tau_{J}$, and the Alfvén timescale, $t_{A}$, from first principles; second, to compute the dimensionless ratio $\\tau_{J}/t_{A}$ using the provided data for a specific tokamak discharge.\n\nFirst, we justify the timescale definitions.\nThe Joule heating timescale, $\\tau_{J}$, represents the characteristic time over which the internal energy of the plasma changes significantly due to resistive (or Ohmic) heating. The internal energy density of a plasma is on the order of its kinetic pressure, $p$. The rate of change of energy density due to Joule heating is given by the volumetric power deposition term, $Q_{J} = \\eta J^{2}$, where $\\eta$ is the electrical resistivity and $J$ is the magnitude of the current density.\nA characteristic timescale for a process is generally defined as the ratio of a quantity to its rate of change. Therefore, the Joule heating timescale can be estimated as:\n$$\n\\tau_{J} \\sim \\frac{\\text{Internal Energy Density}}{\\text{Heating Power Density}} = \\frac{p}{Q_{J}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for Joule heating, we arrive at the given scaling:\n$$\n\\tau_{J} \\sim \\frac{p}{\\eta J^{2}}\n$$\nThe Alfvén timescale, $t_{A}$, is the characteristic time for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) signals to propagate across a characteristic dimension of the plasma. In a tokamak, the relevant length scale for phenomena occurring across the plasma column is the minor radius, $a$. The fundamental propagation speed for MHD waves in a magnetized plasma is the Alfvén speed, $v_{A}$, which is derived from the linearization of the ideal MHD equations and is given by $v_{A} = B / \\sqrt{\\mu_{0} \\rho}$, where $B$ is the magnetic field magnitude, $\\mu_{0}$ is the vacuum permeability, and $\\rho$ is the mass density.\nThe time taken to traverse a distance $a$ at a speed $v_{A}$ is, by definition:\n$$\nt_{A} = \\frac{\\text{Characteristic Length}}{\\text{Characteristic Speed}} = \\frac{a}{v_{A}}\n$$\nThis confirms the validity of the provided definitions from physical principles.\n\nNext, we proceed to compute the ratio $\\tau_{J}/t_{A}$ for the given discharge parameters.

Faraday's Law of Induction: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$\n2.  Ampere's Law (including Maxwell's correction): $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} (\\mathbf{J} + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t})$\n3.  Gauss's Law for Magnetism: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$\n4.  Ohm's Law for a stationary conductor: $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma_{\\text{wall}} \\mathbf{E}$\n\nHere $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\\sigma_{\\text{wall}}$ is the electrical conductivity of the wall, and $\\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nWe make the following physical assumptions to derive the required evolution equation:\n1.  The wall is a stationary, rigid conductor, so its bulk velocity is zero. This justifies the use of the simple form of Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma_{\\text{wall}} \\mathbf{E}$, as opposed to the more complex generalized Ohm's law for a moving plasma which includes terms like $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$.\n2.  The material properties of the wall, namely its conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{wall}}$ and magnetic permeability $\\mu_{0}$, are uniform and constant in time.\n3.  The displacement current, $\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$, in Ampere's law is negligible compared to the conduction current $\\mathbf{J}$. This is the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or quasi-static approximation, which is valid for good conductors and slowly varying fields. The ratio of the magnitudes is $|\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}| / |\\mathbf{J}| \\sim \\epsilon_0 / (\\sigma_{\\text{wall}} \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic timescale of the field variation. For the given values, this ratio is of the order of $10^{-14}$, justifying the approximation.\n\nWith the neglect of displacement current, Ampere's law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\approx \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}\n$$\n\nTo find the evolution equation for $\\mathbf{B}$, we eliminate $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{J}$. We start by taking the curl of Faraday's Law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{F}$ and commuting the time and space derivatives, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nNow we substitute the other laws. From Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{J}/\\sigma_{\\text{wall}}$.

Magnetic shielding is effective against changes in the magnetic field component tangential to the conducting surface. A changing tangential field induces eddy currents in the conductor that oppose the change. The normal component of $\\mathbf{B}$, by contrast, must be continuous across the boundary and is not shielded. Therefore, despite the problem statement's potentially confusing phrase \"magnetic field is approximately normal to the wall\", the physically relevant process to model for shielding is the diffusion of the field component tangential to the wall.\n\nLet the wall lie in the $y$-$z$ plane, with thickness $d$ along the $x$-axis (from $x=0$ to $x=d$). We consider a magnetic field component tangential to the wall, for instance $\\mathbf{B} = B_y(x,t)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. In this 1D case, $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\partial^2 B_y}{\\partial x^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

The loop voltage, $V_{\\rm loop}$, is defined as the line integral of the electric field once around the torus at the major radius $R_0$:\n$$V_{\\rm loop} = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = E_\\phi \\cdot (2\\pi R_0)$$\nFrom this, we can express the constant toroidal electric field in terms of the loop voltage:\n$$E_\\phi = \\frac{V_{\\rm loop}}{2\\pi R_0}$$\nSubstituting this back into the simplified Ohm's law gives an expression for the toroidal current density profile $j(r)$:\n$$j(r) = \\frac{E_\\phi}{\\eta(r)} = \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\frac{V_{\\rm loop}}{2\\pi R_0}$$\nThe total plasma current, $I_p$, is the integral of the current density $j(r)$ over the poloidal cross-sectional area $S = \\pi a^2$:\n$$I_p = \\int_S j(r) \\, dS$$\nSubstituting the expression for $j(r)$:\n$$I_p = \\int_S \\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\frac{V_{\\rm loop}}{2\\pi R_0}\\right) \\, dS$$\nSince $V_{\\rm loop}$ and $R_0$ are constants with respect to the integration over the area $S$, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$I_p = \\frac{V_{\\rm loop}}{2\\pi R_0} \\int_S \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\, dS$$\nIntroducing the electrical conductivity $\\sigma(r) = 1/\\eta(r)$, the expression becomes:\n$$I_p = \\frac{V_{\\rm loop}}{2\\pi R_0} \\int_S \\sigma(r) \\, dS$$\nTo find the relationship for $V_{\\rm loop}$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$V_{\\rm loop} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\int_S \\sigma(r) \\, dS}$$\nThis is the required expression relating $V_{\\rm loop}$ to $I_p$, $R_0$, and the area integral of the conductivity profile.\n\nNow, we analyze the role of the effective charge, $Z_{\\rm eff}$. We are given the classical Spitzer resistivity scaling:\n$$\\eta(r) \\propto Z_{\\rm eff} T_e(r)^{-3/2}$$\nLet the constant of proportionality be $C$. Since $Z_{\\rm eff}$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, we have:\n$$\\eta(r) = C Z_{\\rm eff} T_e(r)^{-3/2}$$\nThe conductivity is the reciprocal of the resistivity:\n$$\\sigma(r) = \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} = \\frac{1}{C Z_{\\rm eff} T_e(r)^{-3/2}} = \\frac{T_e(r)^{3/2}}{C Z_{\\rm eff}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\sigma(r)$ into our formula for $V_{\\rm loop}$:\n$$V_{\\rm loop} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\int_S \\frac{T_e(r)^{3/2}}{C Z_{\\rm eff}} \\, dS}$$\nSince $Z_{\\rm eff}$ and $C$ are uniform, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$V_{\\rm loop} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\frac{1}{C Z_{\\rm eff}} \\int_S T_e(r)^{3/2} \\, dS} = Z_{\\rm eff} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi R_0 C I_p}{\\int_S T_e(r)^{3/2} \\, dS} \\right)$$\nThis final form explicitly shows that for a fixed plasma current $I_p$ and a fixed electron temperature profile $T_e(r)$, the loop voltage is directly proportional to the effective charge: $V_{\\rm loop} \\propto Z_{\\rm eff}$.\n\nAt a fixed loop voltage $V_{\\rm loop}$, the current density profile is $j(r) = \\sigma(r) E_\\phi \\propto \\sigma(r) \\propto 1/Z_{\\rm eff}$. An increase in $Z_{\\rm eff}$ would cause the current density to decrease at every point in the plasma, thus reducing the total current $I_p$. Conversely, to maintain a fixed total current $I_p$ when $Z_{\\rm eff}$ increases (and thus resistivity increases), the driving toroidal electric field $E_\\phi$, and therefore the loop voltage $V_{\\rm loop}$, must be increased proportionally.\n\n2) Calculation of the change in loop voltage $\\Delta V_{\\rm loop}$.\n\nFrom the derivation in part (1), we established the proportionality:\n$$V_{\\rm loop} \\propto Z_{\\rm eff}$$\nprovided that the total current $I_p$, major radius $R_0$, and the electron temperature profile $T_e(r)$ are all held constant. The problem states that a feedback system holds $I_p$ fixed at $I_p=0.80\\,\\text{MA}$ and that the temperature profile is unchanged.\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the final state by the subscript $1$. We can write the relationship as a ratio:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\rm loop,1}}{V_{\\rm loop,0}} = \\frac{Z_{\\rm eff,1}}{Z_{\\rm eff,0}}$$\nThe problem states that $Z_{\\rm eff}$ undergoes a uniform step increase by a factor of $2$. This means:\n$$\\frac{Z_{\\rm eff,1}}{Z_{\\rm eff,0}} = 2$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the loop voltages must also be $2$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\rm loop,1}}{V_{\\rm loop,0}} = 2 \\implies V_{\\rm loop,1} = 2 V_{\\rm loop,0}$$\nThe initial measured loop voltage is given as $V_{\\rm loop,0} = 3.20\\,\\text{V}$.\nThe final loop voltage required to maintain the constant current is:\n$$V_{\\rm loop,1} = 2 \\times 3.20\\,\\text{V} = 6.40\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe question asks for the change in the loop voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\rm loop}$, which is defined as $\\Delta V_{\\rm loop} = V_{\\rm loop,1} - V_{\\rm loop,0}$.\n$$\\Delta V_{\\rm loop} = 6.40\\,\\text{V} - 3.20\\,\\text{V} = 3.20\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe result is required to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.20$ already has three significant figures.",
