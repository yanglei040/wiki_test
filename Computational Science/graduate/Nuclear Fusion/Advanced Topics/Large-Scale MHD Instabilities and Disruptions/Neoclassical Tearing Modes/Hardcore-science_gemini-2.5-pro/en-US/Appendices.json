            "problem": "In a large-aspect-ratio tokamak, consider a saturated magnetic island associated with a rational surface where the safety factor satisfies $q(r_s)=m/n$. In the presence of a neoclassical tearing mode (NTM), the pressure (or temperature) profile inside the island tends to flatten when parallel heat conduction along magnetic field lines outpaces perpendicular diffusion across the island. Model the electron temperature $T$ with anisotropic diffusion governed by the conservation of energy and Fourier’s law of heat conduction: \n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\chi_{\\parallel} \\, \\boldsymbol{b}\\boldsymbol{b}\\cdot\\nabla T + \\chi_{\\perp}\\, (\\boldsymbol{I}-\\boldsymbol{b}\\boldsymbol{b})\\cdot \\nabla T \\right), $$\nwhere $\\chi_{\\parallel}$ and $\\chi_{\\perp}$ are the parallel and perpendicular thermal diffusivities, respectively, $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\boldsymbol{B}/|\\boldsymbol{B}|$ is the unit vector along the magnetic field, and $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor.\n\nAssume a static island in the plasma frame and a sheared-slab representation of the magnetic field near the rational surface with shear length $L_s$, where $L_s = R q / \\hat{s}$. Let the poloidal wavenumber be approximated by $k_y=m/r_s$ at minor radius $r_s$. Let the island half-width be $w$ (so the full island width is $2w$). Use the following physical reasoning grounded in first principles:\n\n- Pressure flattening occurs when parallel conduction establishes isotherms along helical flux surfaces more rapidly than perpendicular diffusion can maintain a gradient across the island. \n- The relevant parallel connection length $\\ell_{\\parallel}$ is the distance along a field line required for the helical phase to decorrelate by order unity across a transverse scale of order $w$.\n\nStarting from the anisotropic diffusion model and the field-line shear geometry, derive an analytic expression for the critical island half-width $w_c$ at which pressure flattening sets in, by equating the characteristic parallel conduction time across the island to the perpendicular diffusion time across the island.

The parameters provided are physically realistic for a tokamak.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Critical Island Half-Width $w_c$\nThe onset of temperature flattening within the magnetic island is determined by the competition between heat diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field and heat conduction parallel to the field. Flattening occurs when the characteristic time for parallel conduction, $\\tau_{\\parallel}$, becomes comparable to or shorter than the characteristic time for perpendicular diffusion, $\\tau_{\\perp}$. The critical condition is met when these two timescales are equal:\n$$ \\tau_{\\parallel} = \\tau_{\\perp} $$\nLet $w$ be the island half-width. The perpendicular diffusion time is the time required for heat to diffuse across this width. Using the standard formula for diffusion time, $t \\sim L^2/D$, with a characteristic length $L=w$ and perpendicular diffusivity $D=\\chi_{\\perp}$, we have:\n$$ \\tau_{\\perp} = \\frac{w^2}{\\chi_{\\perp}} $$\nThe parallel conduction time is the time for heat to travel along the magnetic field lines, effectively short-circuiting the temperature gradient across the island. The characteristic length for this process is the parallel connection length, $\\ell_{\\parallel}$. The parallel conduction time is thus:\n$$ \\tau_{\\parallel} = \\frac{\\ell_{\\parallel}^2}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} $$\nTo find $\\ell_{\\parallel}$, we use the sheared-slab magnetic field model near the rational surface (located at radial coordinate $x=0$). The magnetic field is given by $\\boldsymbol{B} \\approx B_0(\\boldsymbol{e}_z + (x/L_s)\\boldsymbol{e}_y)$, where $L_s$ is the magnetic shear length. A helical perturbation with poloidal wavenumber $k_y$ has a corresponding parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$ that depends on the radial position $x$:\n$$ k_{\\parallel}(x) = \\boldsymbol{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} \\approx k_y b_y = k_y \\frac{B_y}{B_z} = k_y \\frac{x}{L_s} $$\nThe problem states that $\\ell_{\\parallel}$ is the distance along a field line required for the helical phase to decorrelate by order unity across a transverse scale $w$. This can be stated as $k_{\\parallel}(x) \\ell_{\\parallel} \\sim 1$. The characteristic radial extent of a field line within the island is $x \\sim w$. Thus, we evaluate $k_{\\parallel}$ at $x=w$ to find the relevant parallel connection length:\n$$ k_{\\parallel}(w) \\ell_{\\parallel} \\approx 1 \\implies \\ell_{\\parallel} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\parallel}(w)} = \\frac{L_s}{k_y w} $$\nNow we can express the parallel conduction time in terms of $w$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} \\left( \\frac{L_s}{k_y w} \\right)^2 $$\nThe critical island half-width, $w_c$, is found by equating the timescales $\\tau_{\\perp} = \\tau_{\\parallel}$ at $w=w_c$:\n$$ \\frac{w_c^2}{\\chi_{\\perp}} = \\frac{1}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} \\left( \\frac{L_s}{k_y w_c} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{w_c^2}{\\chi_{\\perp}} = \\frac{L_s^2}{\\chi_{\\parallel} k_y^2 w_c^2} $$\nSolving for $w_c$:\n$$ w_c^4 = \\frac{\\chi_{\\perp}}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} \\frac{L_s^2}{k_y^2} $$\nTaking the fourth root gives the analytical expression for the critical island half-width:\n$$ w_c = \\left( \\frac{\\chi_{\\perp}}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} \\right)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{L_s}{k_y}} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Major radius $R = 3.0\\,\\text{m}$\n- Safety factor $q = 2.0$\n- Magnetic shear $\\hat{s} = 0.50$\n- Poloidal mode number $m = 2$\n- Minor radius of rational surface $r_s = 1.0\\,\\text{m}$\n- Parallel thermal diffusivity $\\chi_{\\parallel} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Perpendicular thermal diffusivity $\\chi_{\\perp} = 1.0\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the shear length $L_s$ and the poloidal wavenumber $k_y$:\n$$ L_s = \\frac{R q}{\\hat{s}} = \\frac{(3.0\\,\\text{m})(2.0)}{0.50} = 12.0\\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ k_y = \\frac{m}{r_s} = \\frac{2}{1.0\\,\\text{m}} = 2.0\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nNext, we evaluate the two terms in the expression for $w_c$.\nThe ratio of diffusivities is:\n$$ \\frac{\\chi_{\\perp}}{\\chi_{\\parallel}} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} $$\nThe geometric term is:\n$$ \\frac{L_s}{k_y} = \\frac{12.0\\,\\text{m}}{2.0\\,\\text{m}^{-1}} = 6.0\\,\\text{m}^2 $$\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $w_c$:\n$$ w_c = \\left( 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\right)^{1/4} \\sqrt{6.0\\,\\text{m}^2} $$\n$$ w_c = (10^{-2}) \\times \\sqrt{6.0}\\,\\text{m} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{6.0} \\approx 2.4494897 $$\n$$ w_c \\approx 10^{-2} \\times 2.4494897\\,\\text{m} \\approx 0.0244949\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in centimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ w_c \\approx 0.0244949\\,\\text{m} \\times \\frac{100\\,\\text{cm}}{1\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 2.44949\\,\\text{cm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ w_c \\approx 2.45\\,\\text{cm} $$\nThe numerical value for the final answer is $2.45$.",

The problem instructs to construct an equation where the rate of change of the island half-width, $dw/dt$, has contributions from three effects:\n1.  **Classical Tearing Drive**: Standard theory relates this term to $\\Delta'$. Since $\\Delta' = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, this contribution is zero.\n2.  **Bootstrap Drive**: Stated as proportional to $\\beta_{p}/w$. The contribution to $dw/dt$ must have units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$. A term of the form $T_{\\mathrm{bs}} = k_{\\mathrm{bs}} \\beta_{p}/w$ requires the constant $k_{\\mathrm{bs}}$ to have units of $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$. The physical quantity $\\eta/\\mu_0$ has these units ($(\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m})/(\\mathrm{H/m}) = (\\mathrm{V/A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m})/(\\mathrm{V \\cdot s / A \\cdot m}) = \\mathrm{m^2/s}$), representing the resistive diffusion rate of the magnetic field. A term of the form $C_{\\mathrm{bs}} (\\eta/\\mu_0) (\\beta_p/w)$ is thus dimensionally consistent.\n3.  **Polarization Damping**: Stated as proportional to $\\omega w$. The contribution to $dw/dt$ must be in $\\mathrm{m/s}$. The term $\\omega w$ has units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}) = \\mathrm{m/s}$. Therefore, the proportionality constant must be dimensionless. A term of the form $-C_{\\mathrm{pol}} \\omega w$ is dimensionally consistent, where the negative sign represents damping.\n\nWhile the polarization term's dependence $\\propto \\omega w$ is a simplification of more comprehensive theoretical models (which often have different dependencies on $w$), the problem statement explicitly defines the model to be used. Since these stated proportionalities can be combined into a dimensionally consistent and mathematically well-posed differential equation using the provided parameters, the problem is valid. It constitutes a self-contained, solvable physics problem based on a specified simplified model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The validation is passed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe evolution of the magnetic island half-width, $w(t)$, is governed by a modified Rutherford equation. Based on the problem statement, we construct this equation by summing the contributions from the classical tearing drive, the neoclassical bootstrap current drive, and the rotation-induced polarization current damping.\n\nThe rate of change $dw/dt$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = (\\text{Tearing Term}) + (\\text{Bootstrap Term}) - (\\text{Polarization Term})\n$$\n1.  The classical tearing drive is proportional to the a tearing stability index, $\\Delta'$. Since the problem specifies $\\Delta' = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, this term is zero.\n2.  The bootstrap current drive is given as proportional to $\\beta_p/w$. The term must have units of velocity ($\\mathrm{m/s}$). We construct this term using the characteristic resistive diffusion rate $\\eta/\\mu_0$ (units $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$) and the dimensionless coefficient $C_{\\mathrm{bs}}$. A dimensionally correct formulation is $C_{\\mathrm{bs}} (\\eta/\\mu_0) (\\beta_p/w)$. This term drives island growth.\n3.  The polarization current term provides damping proportional to $\\omega w$. This term must also have units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$. The quantity $\\omega w$ has units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}) = \\mathrm{m/s}$. Thus, the damping term can be written as $-C_{\\mathrm{pol}} \\omega w$, where $C_{\\mathrm{pol}}$ is the dimensionless coefficient.\n\nCombining these terms, the closed evolution equation for $w(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{bs}} \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\frac{\\beta_p}{w} - C_{\\mathrm{pol}} \\omega w\n$$\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can write it in the form:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = \\frac{A}{w} - Bw\n$$\nwhere the constants $A$ and $B$ are defined as:\n$$\nA = C_{\\mathrm{bs}} \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\beta_p \\quad \\text{(units: } \\mathrm{m^2/s})\n$$\n$$\nB = C_{\\mathrm{pol}} \\omega \\quad \\text{(units: } \\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n\nTo classify the long-time behavior, we look for fixed points of the equation by setting $dw/dt = 0$. This condition corresponds to island saturation. The saturated island half-width, $w_{sat}$, is found by solving:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{A}{w_{sat}} - Bw_{sat} \\implies Bw_{sat}^2 = A \\implies w_{sat} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{B}}\n$$\nSince $A > 0$ and $B > 0$ based on the given parameters, a unique, real, and positive saturated width $w_{sat}$ exists. Therefore, the island width does not grow unboundedly but saturates at this value.\n\nThe analytic form of $w(t)$ is obtained by integrating the differential equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\nw \\frac{dw}{dt} = A - Bw^2\n$$\nLet $u(t) = w(t)^2$. Then $du/dt = 2w (dw/dt)$, which gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dt} = A - Bu \\implies \\frac{du}{dt} + 2Bu = 2A\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation in $u(t)$. The solution is:\n$$\nu(t) = \\frac{A}{B} + k \\exp(-2Bt)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is an integration constant. Substituting back $u=w^2$ and $A/B = w_{sat}^2$:\n$$\nw(t)^2 = w_{sat}^2 + k \\exp(-2Bt)\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $w(0)$ to find $k$:\n$$\nw(0)^2 = w_{sat}^2 + k \\exp(0) \\implies k = w(0)^2 - w_{sat}^2\n$$\nThus, the complete analytic solution for the island half-width evolution is:\n$$\nw(t) = \\sqrt{w_{sat}^2 + (w(0)^2 - w_{sat}^2) \\exp(-2Bt)}\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential term decays to zero, and $w(t) \\to \\sqrt{w_{sat}^2} = w_{sat}$, confirming saturation.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the saturated island half-width, $w_{sat}$.\n$$\nw_{sat}^2 = \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bs}} (\\eta/\\mu_0) \\beta_p}{C_{\\mathrm{pol}} \\omega}\n$$\nFirst, we find the value of $\\eta/\\mu_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{7.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,m}}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}} = \\frac{7.0}{4\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $w_{sat}^2$:\n$$\nw_{sat}^2 = \\frac{(20) \\left(\\frac{7.0}{4\\pi}\\right) (0.15)}{(0.50)(1.2 \\times 10^4)} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{7.0}{4\\pi}}{6.0 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{21}{4\\pi \\cdot (6.0 \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{21}{24000\\pi} = \\frac{7}{8000\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value of $w_{sat}$:\n$$\nw_{sat} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{8000\\pi}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx \\sqrt{2.7852 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.016689\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in centimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nw_{sat} \\approx 1.6689\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $1.67\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.",
