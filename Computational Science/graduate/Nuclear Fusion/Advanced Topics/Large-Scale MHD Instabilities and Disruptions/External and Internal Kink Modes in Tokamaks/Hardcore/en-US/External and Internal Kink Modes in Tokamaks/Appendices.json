            "introduction": "The stability of a magnetically confined plasma is governed by the ideal MHD energy principle, which states that an equilibrium is stable if and only if any perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ leads to a positive change in potential energy, $\\delta W > 0$. A primary stabilizing contribution to $\\delta W$ in a tokamak comes from the energy required to bend magnetic field lines. This hands-on practice isolates this crucial term, guiding you to derive its scaling from first principles . By performing this calculation for a localized perturbation, you will directly see how magnetic shear, $s$, provides a powerful restoring force, making it energetically costly for instabilities to develop.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the magnetic field line bending contribution to the ideal MHD potential energy, $\\delta W_{\\text{bend}}$, for a specific helical perturbation in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the ideal MHD energy principle, which gives the change in potential energy $\\delta W$ for a plasma displacement $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(\\mathbf{x})$. The problem specifies that we are to consider only the contribution from magnetic field line bending, in the limit of a perfectly conducting plasma and neglecting pressure effects.\n\nThe field line bending energy is given by the integral of the perpendicular component of the perturbed magnetic field squared, over the plasma volume $V$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\int_V |\\delta \\mathbf{B}_{\\perp}|^2 dV $$\nIn the ideal MHD model, the perturbed magnetic field $\\delta \\mathbf{B}$ is related to the displacement $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ by $\\delta \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0)$, where $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is the equilibrium magnetic field. For a perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}$ that is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_0$ and incompressible ($\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = 0$), the dominant contribution to $\\delta \\mathbf{B}$ for a kink-like mode comes from the term $\\delta \\mathbf{B} \\approx (\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}$. The term $|\\delta \\mathbf{B}_{\\perp}|^2$ is then approximately $|(\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2$.\n\nIn a large-aspect-ratio tokamak, the equilibrium magnetic field is approximately $\\mathbf{B}_0 \\approx B_0 \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{b}$ is the unit vector along the field. For a single Fourier mode with angular dependence $\\exp[i(m\\theta - n\\phi)]$, the operator $\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\nabla$ acting on the mode can be approximated by multiplication with $i B_0 k_{\\parallel}$, where $k_{\\parallel}$ is the parallel wavenumber. Thus, we have:\n$$ |(\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2 \\approx |i B_0 k_{\\parallel} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2 = B_0^2 k_{\\parallel}(r)^2 |\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2 $$\nThe problem provides the expression for the parallel wavenumber in the large-aspect-ratio approximation:\n$$ k_{\\parallel}(r) \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\left(n - \\frac{m}{q(r)}\\right) $$\nThe displacement amplitude $|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|$ is specified by a trial function: $|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}| = \\xi_0$ (a constant) for $|r - r_s| \\le \\Delta/2$ and zero elsewhere. The quantity $|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}|^2$ is independent of the helical phase $(m\\theta - n\\phi)$.\n\nThe integration volume element is given as $dV \\approx R_0 r d\\theta d\\phi dr$. We can now write the integral for $\\delta W_{\\text{bend}}$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\int_0^a dr \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\, (R_0 r) \\left( B_0^2 k_{\\parallel}(r)^2 |\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}(r)|^2 \\right) $$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, the angular integrations yield a factor of $(2\\pi)^2 = 4\\pi^2$.\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 R_0 B_0^2}{2\\mu_0} \\int_0^a dr \\, r \\, k_{\\parallel}(r)^2 |\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}(r)|^2 $$\nSubstituting the trial function for $|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}(r)|$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 R_0 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2}{\\mu_0} \\int_{r_s - \\Delta/2}^{r_s + \\Delta/2} dr \\, r \\, k_{\\parallel}(r)^2 $$\nThe next step is to analyze $k_{\\parallel}(r)$ near the rational surface $r_s$, where $q(r_s) = m/n$. We perform a Taylor expansion of $k_{\\parallel}(r)$ around $r=r_s$. Let $x = r - r_s$.\nAt $r_s$, $k_{\\parallel}(r_s) = \\frac{1}{R_0}(n - m/q(r_s)) = \\frac{1}{R_0}(n - m/(m/n)) = 0$.\nThe first derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dk_{\\parallel}}{dr} = \\frac{1}{R_0} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(n - \\frac{m}{q(r)}\\right) = \\frac{m}{R_0 q(r)^2} \\frac{dq}{dr} $$\nWe evaluate this at $r=r_s$ and use the definition of magnetic shear, $s \\equiv s(r_s) = \\frac{r_s}{q(r_s)}\\left.\\frac{dq}{dr}\\right|_{r_s}$.\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dk_{\\parallel}}{dr}\\right|_{r_s} = \\frac{m}{R_0 q(r_s)^2} \\left.\\frac{dq}{dr}\\right|_{r_s} = \\frac{m}{R_0 q(r_s)^2} \\frac{s q(r_s)}{r_s} = \\frac{m s}{R_0 r_s q(r_s)} $$\nSubstituting $q(r_s)=m/n$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dk_{\\parallel}}{dr}\\right|_{r_s} = \\frac{m s}{R_0 r_s (m/n)} = \\frac{n s}{R_0 r_s} $$\nTo first order in $x = r - r_s$, the parallel wavenumber is:\n$$ k_{\\parallel}(r) \\approx k_{\\parallel}(r_s) + \\left.\\frac{dk_{\\parallel}}{dr}\\right|_{r_s} (r-r_s) = \\frac{n s}{R_0 r_s}(r-r_s) $$\nNote that in this leading-order expansion, the explicit dependence on the poloidal mode number $m$ has cancelled. The scaling with mode numbers is therefore purely with the toroidal mode number $n$ (as $n^2$ in the energy) and implicitly with $m$ through the location $r_s$ and the shear $s$ evaluated at that surface.\n\nNow, we substitute this linear approximation of $k_{\\parallel}(r)$ into the integral for $\\delta W_{\\text{bend}}$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 R_0 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2}{\\mu_0} \\int_{r_s - \\Delta/2}^{r_s + \\Delta/2} dr \\, r \\, \\left( \\frac{n s}{R_0 r_s}(r-r_s) \\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 R_0 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2}{\\mu_0} \\frac{n^2 s^2}{R_0^2 r_s^2} \\int_{r_s - \\Delta/2}^{r_s + \\Delta/2} dr \\, r (r-r_s)^2 $$\nThe problem states the calculation should be to leading order in the small parameter $\\Delta/r_s$, implying the layer is narrow. We can therefore approximate the factor $r$ in the integrand as a constant, $r \\approx r_s$, over the small integration interval.\n$$ \\int_{r_s - \\Delta/2}^{r_s + \\Delta/2} dr \\, r (r-r_s)^2 \\approx r_s \\int_{r_s - \\Delta/2}^{r_s + \\Delta/2} (r-r_s)^2 dr $$\nLet $x = r-r_s$, $dx=dr$. The limits become $x = -\\Delta/2$ to $x = \\Delta/2$.\n$$ r_s \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} x^2 dx = r_s \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} = r_s \\left( \\frac{(\\Delta/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-\\Delta/2)^3}{3} \\right) = r_s \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} = \\frac{r_s \\Delta^3}{12} $$\n(Note: keeping the $r$ term inside the integral yields $\\int (r_s+x)x^2 dx = r_s \\int x^2 dx + \\int x^3 dx$. The integral of $x^3$ over a symmetric interval is zero, so the approximation $r \\approx r_s$ is exact for the value of this integral.)\n\nFinally, we assemble all the parts:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi^2 R_0 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2}{\\mu_0} \\frac{n^2 s^2}{R_0^2 r_s^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r_s \\Delta^3}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{2 \\pi^2 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2 n^2 s^2 \\Delta^3}{12 \\mu_0 R_0 r_s} $$\nSimplifying the numerical factor gives the final expression for the field line bending energy contribution:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 B_0^2 \\xi_0^2 n^2 s^2 \\Delta^3}{6 \\mu_0 R_0 r_s} $$\nThis expression provides the scaling of $\\delta W_{\\text{bend}}$ with the specified parameters. As derived, the scaling with the mode numbers is proportional to $n^2$ and independent of $m$ (i.e., proportional to $m^0$), with the influence of $m$ being contained within the definitions of $r_s$ and $s \\equiv s(r_s)$. The result is positive, indicating that field line bending is a stabilizing effect for this perturbation.",

            "solution": "The stability of a free-boundary plasma is determined by the total change in potential energy, $\\delta W = \\delta W_F + \\delta W_V$, where $\\delta W_F$ is the energy change within the plasma and $\\delta W_V$ is the energy change in the surrounding vacuum. For an external kink mode, the primary driving force comes from the strong gradient of the current density at the plasma-vacuum interface ($r=a$), which can release magnetic energy. This drive is opposed by the stabilizing energy cost of bending magnetic field lines, both within the plasma ($\\delta W_F$) and in the vacuum ($\\delta W_V$). An instability occurs if the energy released at the surface exceeds the cost of bending the field lines, resulting in $\\delta W < 0$.\n\nFor the simplified model of a straight, periodic cylinder with uniform current density and no conducting wall, the ideal MHD energy principle yields a well-known stability criterion. The plasma is unstable to the external kink mode with poloidal and toroidal mode numbers $(m,n)$ if and only if the edge safety factor, $q_a$, lies within the following range:\n$$\nm - 1 < n q_a < m\n$$\nThe upper bound, $n q_a < m$, indicates that if the current is too low ($q_a$ is too high), the perturbation's pitch does not effectively couple to the magnetic field, and the stabilizing field-line bending dominates. The lower bound, $n q_a > m-1$, reflects a more complex stabilization from line-bending within the plasma column that becomes dominant at very high currents (very low $q_a$).\n\nWe are asked to find the critical edge safety factor, $q_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, for the $m=2, n=1$ external kink mode.

In tokamak operation, the plasma current is typically increased from a low value, which corresponds to decreasing $q_a$ from a high value. The first stability boundary encountered for this mode is therefore $q_a=2$. Dropping below this value triggers the instability. This threshold is often called the \"q=2 limit\" and represents a fundamental operational boundary. The critical edge safety factor is therefore 2.",

The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe analysis begins by confirming the behavior of the radial displacement eigenfunction, $\\xi_r(r)$, as outlined in the problem. In the large–aspect-ratio, incompressible, zero–$\\beta$ limit, and away from resonant surfaces, the linearized ideal MHD equations for a single-helicity perturbation with poloidal mode number $m$ reduce to a simplified form. The problem posits that the equation for the quantity $y(r) = r\\xi_r(r)$ is an Euler-type ordinary differential equation whose solutions are power laws in $r$. The specific solutions for $y(r)$ are given as $r^m$ and $r^{-m}$. This implies that the governing differential equation for $y(r)$ is $r^2 \\frac{d^2y}{dr^2} + r\\frac{dy}{dr} - m^2 y = 0$. Given this premise, the radial displacement $\\xi_r(r) = y(r)/r$ must have the general form:\n$$\n\\xi_r(r) = C_1 r^{m-1} + C_2 r^{-m-1}\n$$\nThe first term, $r^{m-1}$, is regular at the magnetic axis ($r=0$) for $m \\ge 1$.

For this mode, $m=1$. The eigenfunction is modeled as follows:\nFor $0 \\le r \\le r_s$, the solution must be regular at the origin.

The eigenfunction is modeled as the regular solution throughout the plasma interior $0 \\le r \\le a$.\nUsing the regular form $r^{m-1}$ with $m=2$, we have $\\xi_{\\text{ext}}(r) = C r^{2-1} = Cr$.\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the normalization condition $\\xi_r(a)=1$: $Ca=1$, which gives $C=1/a$.\nThus, the model eigenfunction for the external kink mode is:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\text{ext}}(r) = \\frac{r}{a} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le a\n$$\nWe compute the intensity-weighted mean radius for this mode.\nThe numerator, $N_{\\text{ext}}$, is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{ext}} = \\int_{0}^{a} r^2 |\\xi_{\\text{ext}}(r)|^2 dr = \\int_{0}^{a} r^2 \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 dr = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\int_{0}^{a} r^4 dr\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\left[\\frac{r^5}{5}\\right]_{0}^{a} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\frac{a^5}{5} = \\frac{a^3}{5}\n$$\nThe denominator, $D_{\\text{ext}}$, is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{ext}} = \\int_{0}^{a} r |\\xi_{\\text{ext}}(r)|^2 dr = \\int_{0}^{a} r \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 dr = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\int_{0}^{a} r^3 dr\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\left[\\frac{r^4}{4}\\right]_{0}^{a} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\frac{a^4}{4} = \\frac{a^2}{4}\n$$\nThe mean radius is $\\bar{r}_{\\text{ext}} = N_{\\text{ext}}/D_{\\text{ext}}$:\n$$\n\\bar{r}_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{a^3/5}{a^2/4} = \\frac{4}{5}a\n$$\nThe dimensionless quantity is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\text{ext}}}{a} = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\nThe final answer requires both results, $\\bar{r}_{\\text{int}}/a$ and $\\bar{r}_{\\text{ext}}/a$, presented as a row matrix.",
