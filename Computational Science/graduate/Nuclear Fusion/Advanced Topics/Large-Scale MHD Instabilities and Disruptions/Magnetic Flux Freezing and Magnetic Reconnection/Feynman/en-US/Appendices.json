A minor notational inconsistency exists in the provided Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. For dimensional consistency, the coefficient of the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ should be the electrical resistivity, $\\eta_{\\text{res}}$ (units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}$), not the magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta$ (units of $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$).

We proceed by performing a correct derivation and identifying $\\eta$ with the standard definition of magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta = \\eta_{\\text{res}}/\\mu_0$, using the provided numerical value for $\\eta$.\n\nFirst, we derive the induction equation. We begin with the Faraday–Maxwell equation, Ohm's law, and Ampère's law.\nFaraday's Law:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} $$\nResistive MHD Ohm's Law (using $\\eta_{\\text{res}}$ for resistivity):\n$$ \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta_{\\text{res}} \\mathbf{J} $$\nAmpère's Law (magnetoquasistatic limit):\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} $$\nFrom Ohm's law, we express the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ as:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\eta_{\\text{res}} \\mathbf{J} $$\nTaking the curl of this expression for $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\nabla \\times (-\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\nabla \\times (\\eta_{\\text{res}} \\mathbf{J}) $$\nSubstituting Faraday's law into the left side gives:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\nabla \\times (\\eta_{\\text{res}} \\mathbf{J}) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and substituting for $\\mathbf{J}$ from Ampère's law ($\\mathbf{J} = (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})/\\mu_0$):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{\\text{res}}}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) $$\nAssuming uniform resistivity, the term $\\eta_{\\text{res}}/\\mu_0$ can be taken outside the curl operator.

The derivatives become $\\partial/\\partial t = (U/L) \\partial/\\partial t'$ and $\\nabla = (1/L)\\nabla'$. Substituting these into the induction equation:\n$$ \\frac{U B}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}'}{\\partial t'} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla' \\times \\left( U \\mathbf{v}' \\times B \\mathbf{B}' \\right) + \\eta \\frac{B}{L^2} \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{B}' $$\nDividing through by the factor $UB/L$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}'}{\\partial t'} = \\nabla' \\times (\\mathbf{v}' \\times \\mathbf{B}') + \\frac{\\eta}{UL} \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{B}' $$\nThe dimensionless coefficient of the diffusive term is the inverse of the magnetic Reynolds number, $R_m^{-1}$.

Flux freezing holds when the timescale of interest is much shorter than the resistive diffusion time, $\\tau_\\eta$.\nThe resistive diffusion time is defined as $\\tau_\\eta = L^2 / \\eta$:\n$$ \\tau_\\eta = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\text{m})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} = \\frac{0.25}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\text{s} = 250\\,\\text{s} $$\nWe compare this with the observation timescale $\\tau_{obs} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_\\eta}{\\tau_{obs}} = \\frac{250\\,\\text{s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}} = 2.5 \\times 10^5 $$\nSince $\\tau_\\eta \\gg \\tau_{obs}$, the diffusion of the magnetic field is negligible on the millisecond timescale. This means the magnetic field lines are effectively \"frozen\" into the plasma. Therefore, the ideal flux freezing approximation is valid. Based on the problem's encoding scheme, this corresponds to $X=1$.\nThe large values of both $R_m$ and $S$ corroborate this conclusion, as they indicate the dominance of the convective term ($\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$) over the diffusive term ($\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$) in the induction equation for MHD phenomena.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(R_m, S, X)$ with the calculated values rounded to three significant figures.\n$R_m = 5.00 \\times 10^6$\n$S = 3.27 \\times 10^9$\n$X = 1$",

Therefore, the quasi-steady assumption holds.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Steady-State Sheet Half-Thickness $\\delta$**\n\nAs instructed, we derive the steady-state half-thickness $\\delta$ by balancing advection and diffusion, accounting for mass continuity and assuming an Alfvénic outflow. This is the canonical Sweet-Parker model for steady-state magnetic reconnection. Let $v_{in}$ be the inflow speed into the sheet and $v_{out}$ be the outflow speed from the sheet.\n\n1.  **Induction Equation Balance:** In a steady state ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$), the induction equation requires a balance between the advection term and the diffusion term within the reconnection layer of half-thickness $\\delta$:\n    $$ \\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) \\approx -\\eta\\,\\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B} $$\n    Performing a scaling analysis on the dominant components, where the inflow is $v_y \\sim v_{in}$ and the main magnetic field gradient is $\\partial B_x/\\partial y \\sim B_0/\\delta$:\n    $$ \\frac{v_{in} B_{0}}{\\delta} \\sim \\eta \\frac{B_{0}}{\\delta^2} \\implies v_{in} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta} $$\n\n2.  **Mass Conservation:** For an incompressible plasma, the mass flux into the reconnection volume (dimensions $2L \\times 2\\delta$) must equal the mass flux out:\n    $$ \\rho v_{in} (2L) = \\rho v_{out} (2\\delta) \\implies v_{in}L = v_{out}\\delta $$\n\n3.  **Energy Conservation and Alfvénic Outflow:** The magnetic energy stored in the upstream field is converted into the kinetic energy of the outflowing plasma jet. Equating the magnetic energy density with the outflow kinetic energy density:\n    $$ \\frac{B_{0}^2}{2\\mu_{0}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_{out}^2 $$\n    This yields an outflow speed that is approximately the Alfvén speed based on the upstream magnetic field:\n    $$ v_{out} \\approx \\frac{B_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}\\rho}} = V_{A} $$\n\n4.  **Combining the Relations:** We now solve the system of three equations for the three unknowns ($v_{in}$, $v_{out}$, $\\delta$).\n    - Substitute $v_{out} = V_{A}$ into the mass conservation equation: $v_{in}L = V_{A}\\delta$.\n    - This gives an expression for the inflow speed: $v_{in} = V_{A}\\frac{\\delta}{L}$.\n    - Equate this expression for $v_{in}$ with the one derived from the induction equation:\n      $$ V_{A}\\frac{\\delta}{L} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta} $$\n    - Solving for $\\delta$:\n      $$ \\delta^2 = \\frac{\\eta L}{V_{A}} \\implies \\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta L}{V_{A}}} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values to calculate $\\delta$.\n$$ \\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}) \\times (0.20\\,\\text{m})}{4.628 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{m/s}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{4.628 \\times 10^6}}\\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ \\delta = \\sqrt{4.321 \\times 10^{-11}}\\,\\text{m} = \\sqrt{43.21 \\times 10^{-12}}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 6.573 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers ($1\\,\\text{\\mu m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\delta \\approx 6.57\\,\\text{\\mu m} $$",

This is an excellent approximation as the given electron temperature of $2\\,\\text{keV}$ corresponds to an energy far exceeding the ionization energy of deuterium. The ion mass is the deuteron mass, $m_i$.\n2.  **Quasi-neutrality**: The plasma is assumed to be electrically neutral on the macroscopic scales of interest, meaning the electron number density $n_e$ and the ion number density $n_i$ are approximately equal. Given $Z=1$, this implies $n_e \\approx n_i = n$, where $n = 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ is the given plasma density. This assumption is valid for phenomena occurring over length scales much larger than the electron Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. We will verify this condition a posteriori.\n\n**1. Inertial Lengths (Skin Depths)**\n\nThe inertial length, or skin depth, of a plasma species represents the characteristic scale at which the inertia of that species becomes important in shielding electromagnetic fields. It is formally derived from the plasma response to electromagnetic waves. The dispersion relation for transverse electromagnetic waves in an unmagnetized cold plasma is derived from Maxwell's equations, and is given by $k^2 c^2 = \\omega^2 \\epsilon(\\omega)$, where $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ is the plasma dielectric constant. For high frequencies, the dielectric constant is given by $\\epsilon(\\omega) = 1 - \\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}$, where the summation is over all plasma species $s$. The species plasma frequency, $\\omega_{ps}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\omega_{ps} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_s q_s^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_s}} $$\nHere, $n_s$, $q_s$, and $m_s$ are the number density, charge, and mass of species $s$, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nFor low-frequency phenomena where $\\omega \\to 0$, the wave number $k$ becomes imaginary, $k = i/\\delta$, indicating that the wave is evanescent and decays over a characteristic length $\\delta$. This decay length is the skin depth. In the context of magnetic reconnection, electron and ion inertia can break the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition of frozen-in flux, and the relevant scales for these non-ideal effects are the inertial lengths. The inertial length for species $s$ is defined as $d_s = c/\\omega_{ps}$.\n\nUsing the definition of $\\omega_{ps}$, the inertial length is:\n$$ d_s = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{ps}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 m_s}{n_s q_s^2}} $$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ d_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_s}{n_s q_s^2 \\mu_0}} $$\nThis form is more convenient for calculation as it does not involve $c$ or $\\epsilon_0$.\n\n**Electron Inertial Length ($d_e$)**:\nFor electrons, $s=e$, we have $n_s = n$, $q_s = -e$, and $m_s = m_e$.\n$$ d_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{n e^2 \\mu_0}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}$\n$n = 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n$\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{H\\,m}^{-1}$\n$$ d_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}}{(10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C})^2 (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{H\\,m}^{-1})}} $$\n$$ d_e \\approx 5.3164 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $d_e = 5.32 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n**Ion Inertial Length ($d_i$)**:\nFor deuterons, $s=i$, we have $n_s = n$, $q_s = e$ ($Z=1$), and $m_s = m_i$.\n$$ d_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{n e^2 \\mu_0}} $$\nSubstituting the given deuteron mass $m_i = 3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}$:\n$$ d_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}}{(10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C})^2 (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{H\\,m}^{-1})}} $$\n$$ d_i \\approx 0.032203\\,\\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $d_i = 3.22 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n**2. Ion Sound Larmor Radius ($\\rho_s$)**\n\nThe ion sound Larmor radius is a hybrid scale defined as $\\rho_s = C_s / \\Omega_{ci}$, where $C_s$ is the ion sound speed and $\\Omega_{ci}$ is the ion cyclotron frequency.\n\n**Ion Sound Speed ($C_s$)**:\nThe ion sound speed arises from electrostatic waves in a plasma where ions provide the inertia and electrons provide the restoring pressure force. We derive it from the linearized one-dimensional fluid equations, assuming cold ions ($T_i=0$) and hot, isothermal electrons ($T_e=\\mathrm{const}$), consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe governing equations are the ion continuity and momentum equations, and the electron momentum balance (assuming massless electrons, which is valid for low-frequency waves):\nIon continuity: $\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(n_i v_i) = 0$\nIon momentum: $m_i n_i \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial t} + v_i \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x}\\right) = q_i n_i E$\nElectron force balance: $0 = -e n_e E - \\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial x}$\nHere $p_e = n_e k_B T_e$ is the electron pressure. Assuming isothermal electrons, $\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial x} = k_B T_e \\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial x}$.\n\nLinearizing these equations around a stationary equilibrium ($n_i=n_e=n_0, v_i=0, E=0$) with perturbations of the form $\\tilde{f} \\propto \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]$, and applying quasi-neutrality ($\\tilde{n}_i \\approx \\tilde{n}_e = \\tilde{n}$):\nFrom electron balance: $-e n_0 \\tilde{E} - ik (k_B T_e \\tilde{n}) = 0 \\implies \\tilde{E} = -\\frac{ik k_B T_e}{e n_0} \\tilde{n}$.\nFrom ion momentum: $-i\\omega m_i n_0 \\tilde{v}_i = q_i n_0 \\tilde{E} = e n_0 \\tilde{E} = -ik k_B T_e \\tilde{n}$.\nFrom ion continuity: $-i\\omega \\tilde{n} + ik n_0 \\tilde{v}_i = 0 \\implies \\tilde{n} = \\frac{k n_0}{\\omega} \\tilde{v}_i$.\n\nSubstituting $\\tilde{n}$ into the ion momentum equation:\n$$ -i\\omega m_i n_0 \\tilde{v}_i = -ik k_B T_e \\left( \\frac{k n_0}{\\omega} \\tilde{v}_i \\right) $$\n$$ \\omega^2 m_i = k^2 k_B T_e $$\nThe phase velocity of the wave is $\\omega/k$, which is the ion sound speed $C_s$:\n$$ C_s = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}} $$\nFor an ion with charge $Z$, this generalizes to $C_s = \\sqrt{Z k_B T_e / m_i}$. For deuterium, $Z=1$.\n\nThe electron temperature is $T_e = 2\\,\\text{keV}$. The corresponding energy is $k_B T_e = 2 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{eV}$. Converting to Joules:\n$k_B T_e = (2 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J/eV}) = 3.204353 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{J}$.\n$$ C_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.204353 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{J}}{3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}}} \\approx 3.0957 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{m\\,s}^{-1} $$\n\n**Ion Cyclotron Frequency ($\\Omega_{ci}$)**:\nThe cyclotron frequency for an ion is given by:\n$$ \\Omega_{ci} = \\frac{|q_i| B}{m_i} = \\frac{e B}{m_i} $$\nUsing the given magnetic field $B=2\\,\\text{T}$:\n$$ \\Omega_{ci} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C})(2\\,\\text{T})}{3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}} \\approx 9.5836 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{rad\\,s}^{-1} $$\n\n**Calculation of $\\rho_s$**:\n$$ \\rho_s = \\frac{C_s}{\\Omega_{ci}} = \\frac{3.0957 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{m\\,s}^{-1}}{9.5836 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0032301\\,\\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\rho_s = 3.23 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n**Verification of Quasi-neutrality**:\nThe assumption of quasi-neutrality requires the physical scales of interest to be much larger than the electron Debye length $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e / (ne^2)}$.\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F\\,m}^{-1})(3.204 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{J})}{(10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C})^2}} \\approx 3.32 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe calculated lengths are $d_e = 5.32 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$, $\\rho_s = 3.23 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$, and $d_i = 3.22 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}$. All three scales are significantly larger than $\\lambda_D$ (by factors of $\\approx 16$, $97$, and $970$, respectively), which rigorously justifies the use of the quasi-neutrality assumption.\n\nThe final computed values for the three characteristic lengths, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n-   Ion inertial length: $d_i = 3.22 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Electron inertial length: $d_e = 5.32 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Ion sound Larmor radius: $\\rho_s = 3.23 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$",
