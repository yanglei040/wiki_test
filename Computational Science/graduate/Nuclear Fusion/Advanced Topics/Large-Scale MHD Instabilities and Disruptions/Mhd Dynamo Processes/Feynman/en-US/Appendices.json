            "problem": "A high-conductivity plasma relevant to nuclear fusion devices is modeled by single-fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Consider a statistically homogeneous, isotropic, parity-breaking turbulent state that sustains a scale separation between a mean magnetic field and fluctuations, so that a mean-field closure is appropriate.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the critical alpha parameter, $\\alpha_c$, for the onset of a mean-field dynamo instability in a periodic domain. The derivation proceeds in several steps: establishing the governing equation for the mean magnetic field, performing a linear stability analysis, and applying the boundary conditions to find the instability threshold.\n\nFirst, we begin with the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}_{tot}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u}_{tot} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{tot}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}_{tot}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_{tot}$ is the total magnetic field, $\\mathbf{u}_{tot}$ is the total velocity field, and $\\eta$ is the microscopic magnetic diffusivity.\n\nThe fields are decomposed into mean and fluctuating parts: $\\mathbf{B}_{tot} = \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} + \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{tot} = \\overline{\\mathbf{U}} + \\mathbf{u}'$. The problem states that the mean flow is zero, $\\overline{\\mathbf{U}} = 0$. By definition, the average of the fluctuating parts is zero, i.e., $\\overline{\\mathbf{b}} = 0$ and $\\overline{\\mathbf{u}'} = 0$.\n\nAveraging the induction equation yields the evolution equation for the mean magnetic field $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times \\overline{(\\mathbf{u}' \\times \\mathbf{b})} + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nThe term $\\mathcal{E} = \\overline{\\mathbf{u}' \\times \\mathbf{b}}$ is the mean electromotive force arising from the turbulent fluctuations. The closure of this term is the central task of mean-field dynamo theory. The problem specifies a statistically homogeneous, isotropic, parity-breaking turbulent state and invokes the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA). Under these standard assumptions, the mean electromotive force is expressed as a linear function of the mean magnetic field:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\alpha \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} - \\beta \\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is a pseudoscalar coefficient representing the $\\alpha$-effect, which arises from the lack of reflectional symmetry (helicity) in the turbulence, and $\\beta$ is a scalar coefficient representing the turbulent magnetic diffusivity. The problem provides that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are uniform, constant parameters.\n\nSubstituting this closure into the mean-field equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\alpha \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} - \\beta \\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants, we can expand the curl operation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha (\\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}) - \\beta \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$ and the solenoidal property of the mean magnetic field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} = 0$, the double curl term simplifies to $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}) = - \\nabla^2 \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha (\\nabla \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}) + (\\beta + \\eta) \\nabla^2 \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the microscopic diffusivity $\\eta$ is negligible in comparison to the turbulent diffusivity $\\beta$. Thus, we neglect $\\eta$ and obtain the final closed mean-field dynamo equation. For notational simplicity, we drop the overbar on the mean field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\beta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nNext, we perform a linear stability analysis on this equation. We consider a single spatial Fourier mode of the mean field:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\mathbf{B}_0 \\exp(\\gamma t + i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is a constant vector amplitude, $\\gamma$ is the growth rate, and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector of magnitude $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$. Substituting this ansatz into the dynamo equation, the operators transform as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\gamma$ and $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$\n\\gamma \\mathbf{B}_0 = \\alpha (i\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0) + \\beta (i\\mathbf{k})^2 \\mathbf{B}_0\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma \\mathbf{B}_0 = i\\alpha (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0) - \\beta k^2 \\mathbf{B}_0\n$$\nRearranging gives an eigenvalue problem for $\\gamma$:\n$$\n(\\gamma + \\beta k^2) \\mathbf{B}_0 - i\\alpha (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0) = 0\n$$\nThe condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ implies $i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0 = 0$, meaning the magnetic field is transverse to the wavevector. The operator $\\mathbf{k} \\times$ acting on transverse vector fields has eigenvalues $\\pm k$. More formally, we can introduce a basis of circularly polarized waves (helicity modes), which are the eigenfunctions of the curl operator. The analysis yields two dispersion relations corresponding to the two helicity states:\n$$\n\\gamma + \\beta k^2 = \\pm \\alpha k\n$$\nThis gives two branches for the growth rate:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\pm \\alpha k - \\beta k^2\n$$\nRegardless of the sign of $\\alpha$, one branch can potentially lead to growth, which is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{growth} = |\\alpha| k - \\beta k^2\n$$\nThe other branch, $\\gamma_{decay} = -|\\alpha| k - \\beta k^2$, is always negative for positive $\\beta$ and $k$, representing a decaying mode.\n\nA mode is unstable if its growth rate is positive, $\\gamma_{growth} > 0$:\n$$\n|\\alpha| k - \\beta k^2 > 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial mode with $k > 0$, we can divide by $k$ to find the condition for instability:\n$$\n|\\alpha| > \\beta k\n$$\nThe problem specifies a triply periodic domain of side length $L$. This quantizes the allowed wavenumber magnitudes. The problem statement gives the set of allowed wavenumbers as $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$ for integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nDynamo action occurs if at least one of these allowed modes is unstable. The condition becomes:\n$$\n|\\alpha| > \\beta k_n = \\beta \\frac{2\\pi n}{L} \\quad \\text{for some integer } n \\geq 1\n$$\nThe instability threshold, $\\alpha_c$, is the smallest positive value of $|\\alpha|$ that satisfies this condition for at least one allowed mode. To find this minimum value, we must identify the mode that is most easily excited. The required $|\\alpha|$ is directly proportional to $k_n$. Therefore, the smallest $|\\alpha|$ is required for the mode with the smallest possible wavenumber, $k_{min}$.\n\nGiven the set of allowed wavenumbers $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$ with $n \\geq 1$, the minimum wavenumber corresponds to the smallest integer value of $n$, which is $n=1$:\n$$\nk_{min} = k_1 = \\frac{2\\pi (1)}{L} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\n$$\nThis represents the largest scale variation of the magnetic field that can fit into the periodic box.\n\nThe critical value $\\alpha_c$ is determined by the marginal stability condition ($\\gamma = 0$) for this most unstable mode:\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\beta k_{min}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $k_{min}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\beta \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi\\beta}{L}\n$$\nThis is the minimum value of $|\\alpha|$ required to sustain a magnetic field against turbulent diffusion on the largest available scale in the domain.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe starting point is the mean-field magnetic induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{U} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\mathcal{E} - \\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}$ represents the mean magnetic field.\n\nWe apply the given conditions:\n1.  No mean flow: $\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n2.  The mean turbulent EMF is $\\mathcal{E} = \\alpha \\mathbf{B} - \\beta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$.\n3.  The magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ is a constant.\n\nSubstituting these into the induction equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\alpha \\mathbf{B} - \\beta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} - \\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\alpha \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times ((\\beta + \\eta) \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe curl of a scalar ($\\alpha$) times a vector ($\\mathbf{B}$) is given by $\\nabla \\times (\\alpha \\mathbf{B}) = \\alpha (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\mathbf{B} \\times (\\nabla \\alpha)$. Since $\\alpha$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, $\\nabla \\alpha = \\mathbf{0}$, which simplifies the first term. We also assume $\\beta$ is a constant parameter. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) - (\\beta + \\eta) \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nNext, we use the property that the mean field is a single force-free eigenmode, satisfying $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = k \\mathbf{B}$, where $k$ is a constant. We can compute the double curl term:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla \\times (k \\mathbf{B}) = k (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = k(k \\mathbf{B}) = k^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the curl terms back into the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha (k \\mathbf{B}) - (\\beta + \\eta) (k^2 \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nFactoring out $\\mathbf{B}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\left[ \\alpha k - (\\beta + \\eta)k^2 \\right] \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a vector equation for the evolution of the magnetic field. To find the evolution of its amplitude, let's represent the magnetic field as $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = B(t) \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $B(t)$ is the time-dependent amplitude and $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the normalized spatial structure of the eigenmode. Substituting this into the equation and cancelling the spatial part $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\mathbf{x})$ gives the ordinary differential equation for the amplitude $B(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\left[ \\alpha k - (\\beta + \\eta)k^2 \\right] B(t)\n$$\nThis is the requested ODE. Now we incorporate the nonlinear quenching of $\\alpha$. The problem states that $\\alpha$ depends on the mean-field amplitude, which we denote as $B$.\n$$\n\\alpha(B) = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{1 + \\frac{B^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{1 + \\frac{B^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}} \\right) k - (\\beta + \\eta)k^2 \\right] B\n$$\nTo find the nontrivial steady-state (saturated) amplitude, denoted as $B_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, we set the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$, for a nonzero amplitude, $B_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\neq 0$. This requires the term in the brackets to be zero:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{1 + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}} \\right) k - (\\beta + \\eta)k^2 = 0\n$$\nThe dynamo drive term (from $\\alpha$) must balance the total dissipation (from turbulent diffusivity $\\beta$ and microscopic resistivity $\\eta$). We solve this algebraic equation for $B_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_{0} k}{1 + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}} = (\\beta + \\eta)k^2\n$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 0$ (a necessary condition for a spatial mode to exist), we can divide both sides by $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{1 + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}} = (\\beta + \\eta)k\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the term containing $B_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{(\\beta + \\eta)k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2}{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{(\\beta + \\eta)k} - 1\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that a real, positive saturation amplitude exists, which means the right-hand side of this equation must be positive. This corresponds to the condition for dynamo growth, $\\alpha_0 > (\\beta+\\eta)k$.\nSolving for $B_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2 = B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{(\\beta + \\eta)k} - 1\\right)\n$$\nFinally, taking the square root gives the saturated amplitude. Since amplitude is a non-negative quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{sat}} = B_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{(\\beta + \\eta)k} - 1}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the saturated magnetic field amplitude in terms of the given parameters.",

Given $a = 0.60\\, \\text{m}$, $\\sigma = 1.5 \\times 10^{7}\\, \\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$, and $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\, \\text{N}\\,\\text{A}^{-2}$, we find\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma} = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})(1.5 \\times 10^{7})} = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\approx 0.0530516477\\, \\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\gamma_1 = - \\left(0.0530516477\\right) \\left(\\frac{2.404825557}{0.60}\\right)^2 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nCompute the squared factor:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2.404825557}{0.60}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(4.008042595\\right)^2 \\approx 16.06434687.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\gamma_1 \\approx - \\left(0.0530516477\\right) \\left(16.06434687\\right) \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx -0.852240064\\, \\text{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the fundamental decay rate is\n$$\n\\gamma_1 \\approx -0.8522\\, \\text{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nThis negative decay rate confirms that, under azimuthal symmetry and resistive diffusion, axisymmetric modes cannot be self-sustained or amplified by a steady axisymmetric flow, illustrating the anti-dynamo principle in this fusion-relevant cylindrical geometry.",
