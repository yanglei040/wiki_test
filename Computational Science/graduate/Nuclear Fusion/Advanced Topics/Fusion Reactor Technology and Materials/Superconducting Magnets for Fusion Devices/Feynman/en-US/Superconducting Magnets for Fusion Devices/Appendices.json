It is based on established phenomenological scaling laws for Type-II superconductors, specifically the Dew-Hughes model for flux pinning in Nb$_3$Sn. The provided parameters ($T_c$, $B_{c2}(0)$, operating conditions, and calibration data) are physically realistic for high-field superconducting magnet applications in fusion energy research. The problem is self-contained, with sufficient information provided to determine a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific fallacies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive a scaling law for the critical current density $J_c(B,T)$ and use it to compute $J_c$ at the specified operating conditions.\n\nThe bulk pinning force density $F_p(B,T)$ is related to the critical current density $J_c(B,T)$ and the magnetic field $B$ by the Lorentz force equation:\n$$F_p(B,T) = J_c(B,T) B$$\nFrom this, we can express the critical current density as:\n$$J_c(B,T) = \\frac{F_p(B,T)}{B}$$\n\nThe problem states that the pinning force follows a scaling relation, where it is a product of a temperature-dependent maximum pinning force $F_{p,\\max}(T)$ and a normalized function of the reduced magnetic field $f(b)$:\n$$F_p(B,T) = F_{p,\\max}(T) f(b)$$\nThe reduced magnetic field is defined as $b = B/B_{c2}(T)$, where $B_{c2}(T)$ is the temperature-dependent upper critical field.\n\nThe temperature-dependent terms are given by:\n$F_{p,\\max}(T) = A\\,B_{c2}(T)^{\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n$B_{c2}(T) = B_{c2}(0)\\,\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^2\\right]$, with $B_{c2}(0) = 30~\\mathrm{T}$ and $T_c = 18~\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe field-dependent term is given by $f(b) \\propto b^p (1-b)^q$, with $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $q=2$. The function $f(b)$ is normalized to unity at its maximum. The overall proportionality constant for $f(b)$ can be absorbed into the material constant $A$. We can therefore write the full expression for the pinning force as:\n$$F_p(B,T) = C B_{c2}(T)^{\\alpha} b^p (1-b)^q$$\nwhere $C$ is a new temperature-independent material constant that incorporates $A$ and the normalization factor for $f(b)$.\n\nSubstituting $b = B/B_{c2}(T)$ and the expression for $F_p$ into the equation for $J_c$:\n$$J_c(B,T) = \\frac{1}{B} \\left[ C B_{c2}(T)^{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)}\\right)^p \\left(1 - \\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)}\\right)^q \\right]$$\n$$J_c(B,T) = C B^{p-1} B_{c2}(T)^{\\alpha-p} \\left(1 - \\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)}\\right)^q$$\n\nSubstituting the given exponents $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, $q=2$, and $\\alpha=\\frac{5}{2}$:\n$p-1 = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\alpha-p = \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\nThe derived analytical scaling law is:\n$$J_c(B,T) = C B^{-1/2} B_{c2}(T)^{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)}\\right)^2$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined from the calibration data.\n\nTo find the value of $J_c$ at the operating point ($T_{\\mathrm{op}} = 4.5~\\mathrm{K}$, $B_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 14~\\mathrm{T}$), we can use the calibration point ($T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 4.2~\\mathrm{K}$, $B_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 12~\\mathrm{T}$, $J_c(B_{\\mathrm{ref}}, T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 3000~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}$) to form a ratio.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is structured to address the three tasks posed in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Definition of the Current Sharing Temperature ($T_{cs}$)**\n\nIn a composite superconducting conductor, the total transport current is carried by parallel paths: the superconducting filaments and the normal-conducting stabilizer matrix (e.g., copper). The critical current density of the superconductor, $J_c$, is a function of temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, and mechanical strain $\\epsilon$. For this problem, $B$ and $\\epsilon$ are considered fixed, so we only consider the temperature dependence, $J_c(T)$.\n\nAt an operating temperature $T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, the conductor carries a total operating current density $J$. For stable, purely superconducting operation, this current density must be less than the critical current density at that temperature, i.e., $J < J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}})$. In this state, the stabilizer carries effectively zero current due to the zero electrical resistance of the superconductor.\n\nIf a thermal perturbation causes the local temperature of the conductor to increase from $T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, the critical current density $J_c(T)$ will decrease. The current sharing temperature, $T_{cs}$, is defined as the exact temperature at which the critical current density of the superconducting filaments has fallen to a value equal to the operating current density, $J$.\n\nMathematically, this definition is expressed as:\n$$J_c(T_{cs}) = J$$\nFor any temperature $T > T_{cs}$, the superconducting material can only carry a current density of $J_c(T) < J$. The remainder of the current, corresponding to a density of $J - J_c(T)$, is forced to \"share\" the load by flowing through the stabilizer matrix, leading to resistive heating. The temperature margin, $\\Delta T = T_{cs} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, is a critical parameter for quantifying the thermal stability of the magnet against transient energy depositions.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the Relation for $T_{cs}$**\n\nWe begin with the provided scaling law for the critical current density at fixed magnetic field and strain:\n$$J_c(T) \\propto \\left(1 - \\frac{T}{T_c^*}\\right)^m$$\nLet $C$ be the constant of proportionality, which depends on the material, magnetic field, and strain, but is independent of temperature.\n$$J_c(T) = C \\left(1 - \\frac{T}{T_c^*}\\right)^m$$\nThe constant $C$ can be determined by evaluating this expression at a known state, which is the operating point $(T_{\\mathrm{op}}, J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}))$.\n$$J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) = C \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right)^m$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}})}{\\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right)^m}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general equation for $J_c(T)$ yields a normalized relation:\n$$J_c(T) = J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{T}{T_c^*}\\right)^m}{\\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right)^m} = J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) \\left( \\frac{1 - T/T_c^*}{1 - T_{\\mathrm{op}}/T_c^*} \\right)^m$$\nNow, we apply the definition of the current sharing temperature, $T_{cs}$, from Task 1: $J_c(T_{cs}) = J$. We substitute $T = T_{cs}$ into the derived expression:\n$$J_c(T_{cs}) = J = J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) \\left( \\frac{1 - T_{cs}/T_c^*}{1 - T_{\\mathrm{op}}/T_c^*} \\right)^m$$\nTo introduce the operating current density ratio, $r = J/J_{c}(T_{\\mathrm{op}})$, we divide both sides by $J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}})$:\n$$\\frac{J}{J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}})} = r = \\left( \\frac{1 - T_{cs}/T_c^*}{1 - T_{\\mathrm{op}}/T_c^*} \\right)^m$$\nThis is the relation that links $T_{cs}$ to the operating parameters. To complete the derivation, we explicitly solve for $T_{cs}$. First, we take the $m$-th root of both sides:\n$$r^{1/m} = \\frac{1 - T_{cs}/T_c^*}{1 - T_{\\mathrm{op}}/T_c^*}$$\nNext, we isolate the term containing $T_{cs}$:\n$$r^{1/m} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{T_{cs}}{T_c^*}$$\n$$\\frac{T_{cs}}{T_c^*} = 1 - r^{1/m} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right)$$\nFinally, multiplying by $T_c^*$ gives the explicit expression for $T_{cs}$:\n$$T_{cs} = T_c^* \\left[ 1 - r^{1/m} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}{T_c^*}\\right) \\right]$$\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Calculation of $T_{cs}$**\n\nWe use the formula derived in Task 2 and substitute the given numerical values:\n- $T_{\\mathrm{op}} = 4.5$ K\n- $T_{c}^{*} = 15.0$ K\n- $r = 0.60$\n- $m = 1.7$\n\n$$T_{cs} = 15.0 \\left[ 1 - (0.60)^{1/1.7} \\left(1 - \\frac{4.5}{15.0}\\right) \\right]$$\nFirst, evaluate the term inside the inner parenthesis:\n$$1 - \\frac{4.5}{15.0} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\nNext, evaluate the exponential term:\n$$r^{1/m} = (0.60)^{1/1.7} \\approx (0.60)^{0.588235...} \\approx 0.741062...$$\nNow, substitute these back into the main expression:\n$$T_{cs} = 15.0 \\left[ 1 - (0.741062...) \\times (0.7) \\right]$$\n$$T_{cs} = 15.0 \\left[ 1 - 0.518743... \\right]$$\n$$T_{cs} = 15.0 \\left[ 0.481256... \\right]$$\n$$T_{cs} \\approx 7.21884... \\text{ K}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain:\n$$T_{cs} \\approx 7.22 \\text{ K}$$\nThe temperature margin for this conductor is $\\Delta T = T_{cs} - T_{\\mathrm{op}} = 7.22 \\text{ K} - 4.5 \\text{ K} = 2.72 \\text{ K}$.",

This current is carried by the superconducting portion of the conductor, which has a cross-sectional area of $A_s = f_s A$. The volume fraction of the superconductor is $f_s = 0.3$, and the total area is $A = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{op},s} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{op}}}{f_s A} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.3 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^4}{6 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 2.5 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ by equating $J_{\\mathrm{op},s}$ to the critical current density model, $J_c(B, T)$.\nThe model is given by:\n$$\nJ_c(B,T) = J_{c0}\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{B}{B_0}\\right)^{-m}\n$$\nAt $T = T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ and for the given magnetic field $B = 12\\,\\mathrm{T}$, we have $J_c(B, T_{\\mathrm{cs}}) = J_{\\mathrm{op},s}$. The parameters are $J_{c0} = 3.0\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $T_c = 18\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $n = 2$, $B_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{T}$, and $m = 1$.\n\n$$\n2.5 \\times 10^9 = (3.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{18}\\right)^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{12}{10}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nWe can solve for the term containing $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$:\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{18}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9}{3.0 \\times 10^{10}} \\left(1 + \\frac{12}{10}\\right) = \\frac{2.5}{30} \\left(1 + 1.2\\right) = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 2.2 = \\frac{2.2}{12} = \\frac{11}{60}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and the physically meaningful positive root, since $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} < T_c$ implies $1 - T_{\\mathrm{cs}}/T_c > 0$):\n$$\n1 - \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{18} = \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{60}}\n$$\nSolving for $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{18} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{60}}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 18 \\left(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{60}}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNumerically, $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 18 \\left(1 - \\sqrt{0.18333...}\\right) \\approx 18 \\left(1 - 0.428174\\right) \\approx 10.2929\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Adiabatic Minimum Quench Energy, $\\mathrm{MQE}_{\\mathrm{ad}}$**\n\nThe minimum quench energy per unit length is given by the integral of the composite volumetric specific heat, $c_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T)$, multiplied by the total cross-sectional area, $A$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{MQE}_{\\mathrm{ad}} = A \\int_{T_0}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} c_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T)\\, dT\n$$\nFirst, we determine the expression for $c_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T)$ by the rule of mixtures:\n$$\nc_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T) = f_c\\,c_{v,\\mathrm{Cu}}(T) + f_s\\,c_{v,\\mathrm{Nb_3Sn}}(T) + f_e\\,c_{v,\\mathrm{epoxy}}(T)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions and volume fractions ($f_c=0.6$, $f_s=0.3$, $f_e=0.1$):\n$$\nc_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T) = 0.6(100\\,T + 10\\,T^3) + 0.3(60\\,T + 5\\,T^3) + 0.1(8\\,T^3)\n$$\nGrouping terms by powers of $T$:\n$$\nc_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T) = (0.6 \\times 100 + 0.3 \\times 60)T + (0.6 \\times 10 + 0.3 \\times 5 + 0.1 \\times 8)T^3\n$$\n$$\nc_{v,\\mathrm{comp}}(T) = (60 + 18)T + (6.0 + 1.5 + 0.8)T^3 = 78\\,T + 8.3\\,T^3\n$$\nNow, we integrate this expression from $T_0 = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} (78\\,T + 8.3\\,T^3)\\,dT = \\left[ 78\\frac{T^2}{2} + 8.3\\frac{T^4}{4} \\right]_{T_0}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} = \\left[ 39\\,T^2 + 2.075\\,T^4 \\right]_{T_0}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}\n$$\nThe value of the integral is:\n$$\n(39\\,T_{\\mathrm{cs}}^2 + 2.075\\,T_{\\mathrm{cs}}^4) - (39\\,T_0^2 + 2.075\\,T_0^4)\n$$\nSubstituting $T_0 = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$:\n*   $T_0^2 = (4.5)^2 = 20.25$\n*   $T_0^4 = (4.5)^4 = 410.0625$\n*   $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 10.2929\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n*   $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}^2 \\approx 105.9447$\n*   $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}^4 \\approx 11224.28$\n\nLet's compute the enthalpy change per unit volume, $\\Delta h$:\n$$\n\\Delta h_{T_0} = 39(20.25) + 2.075(410.0625) = 789.75 + 850.880 = 1640.63\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta h_{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} = 39(105.9447) + 2.075(11224.28) = 4131.84 + 23290.39 = 27422.23\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe integrated specific heat is $\\Delta h = \\Delta h_{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} - \\Delta h_{T_0} = 27422.23 - 1640.63 = 25781.6\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate $\\mathrm{MQE}_{\\mathrm{ad}}$ by multiplying by the area $A = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MQE}_{\\mathrm{ad}} = (20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (25781.6\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 0.515632\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MQE}_{\\mathrm{ad}} \\approx 0.516\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$",
