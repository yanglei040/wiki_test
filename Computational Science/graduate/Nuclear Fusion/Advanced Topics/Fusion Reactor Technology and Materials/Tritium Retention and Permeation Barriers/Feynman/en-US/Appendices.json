            "solution": "The transport of tritium through the homogeneous titanium nitride (TiN) layer is assumed to be a steady-state, one-dimensional diffusion process. According to Fick's first law, the molar flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$ J = -D_b \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_b$ is the diffusivity of tritium in the TiN barrier, and $C(x)$ is the molar concentration of tritium at a position $x$ within the barrier, which spans from $x=0$ to $x=L_b$.\n\nFor steady-state transport through a homogeneous material under isothermal conditions, both $J$ and $D_b$ are constant. We can integrate the above equation across the thickness of the barrier layer, $L_b$:\n$$ \\int_0^{L_b} J \\, dx = - \\int_{C_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{C_{\\mathrm{out}}} D_b \\, dC $$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are the tritium concentrations at the upstream ($x=0$) and downstream ($x=L_b$) interfaces, respectively. The integration yields:\n$$ J L_b = -D_b (C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nRearranging for the flux, we obtain:\n$$ J = \\frac{D_b}{L_b} (C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n\nThe concentrations at the gas-solid interfaces are related to the tritium partial pressures in the gas phases by Sieverts' law. For diatomic gases like tritium ($T_2$), which dissociate into atoms upon dissolution, the concentration of dissolved atomic tritium is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure:\n$$ C = S_b \\sqrt{p} $$\nwhere $S_b$ is the Sieverts' constant for tritium in TiN and $p$ is the partial pressure of tritium gas. Applying this relationship at the upstream and downstream interfaces, under the assumption of local equilibrium, gives:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{in}} = S_b \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{out}} = S_b \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}} $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ into the flux equation gives:\n$$ J = \\frac{D_b}{L_b} (S_b \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - S_b \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\n$$ J = \\frac{D_b S_b}{L_b} (\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\n\nThe permeability of a material, $P$, is defined as the product of its diffusivity and its Sieverts' constant: $P = D S$.

Substituting this definition into the flux equation, we arrive at the desired proportionality:\n$$ J = \\frac{P_b}{L_b} (\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\n\nThe problem defines the effective barrier resistance, $R_b$, by the relation:\n$$ J = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}}{R_b} $$\nBy comparing this definition with the derived expression for the flux, we can equate the two expressions for $J$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_b} (\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) = \\frac{P_b}{L_b} (\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\nFor a non-zero pressure difference, we can cancel the term $(\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}})$, leading to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_b} = \\frac{P_b}{L_b} $$\nTherefore, the effective barrier resistance $R_b$ is given by:\n$$ R_b = \\frac{L_b}{P_b} $$\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $R_b$ using the provided data.
