            "problem": "Consider a Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) configuration in the thin-shell and quasistatic limit: a perfectly conducting cylindrical liner of initial radius $R_{0}$ carries an axially directed current waveform $I(t) = I_{0}\\,\\sin\\!\\left(\\pi t/\\tau\\right)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$. The liner is assumed to be of uniform density and compresses uniformly along its axis with negligible axial motion, and its mass per unit axial length is $m$. Neglect resistive diffusion of the magnetic field, radiation losses, and any fuel or internal pressure, and treat the azimuthal magnetic field as determined entirely by the imposed current. The liner starts from rest at $t=0$.\n\nStarting from fundamental laws and core definitions appropriate to magnetized liner inertial fusion, including Maxwell’s equations (specifically the magnetostatic limit of Ampère’s law) and Newton’s second law, derive an analytical expression for the liner kinetic energy per unit axial length at the end of the current half-cycle $t=\\tau$ (which we take as the stagnation of the electromagnetic drive) under the additional assumption that the liner radius remains approximately $R_{0}$ during the pulse. Your derivation should explicitly connect the magnetic field, the magnetic pressure, the net inward force on the liner, and the liner’s radial velocity acquired over the drive.\n\nExpress the final energy per unit axial length in Joules per meter. No numerical evaluation is required; provide a closed-form analytical expression in terms of $I_{0}$, $\\tau$, $R_{0}$, $m$, and the vacuum permeability $\\mu_{0}$. No rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and classical mechanics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The simplifying assumptions, while idealizations, are explicitly stated and common in such physics problems to render them analytically tractable. We can therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe derivation for the liner kinetic energy per unit axial length, $K.E.'$, proceeds in several steps, starting from fundamental laws.\n\nFirst, we determine the azimuthal magnetic field, $B_{\\phi}$, generated by the axial current, $I(t)$, flowing through the liner. We apply Ampère's law in its integral form, $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, to a circular Amperian loop of radius $r$ concentric with the liner axis. For a loop at the liner's outer surface, $r=R(t)$, the enclosed current is the total liner current $I(t)$. By cylindrical symmetry, the magnetic field is purely azimuthal. Thus, the integral simplifies to $B_{\\phi}(R(t)) \\cdot (2\\pi R(t)) = \\mu_0 I(t)$. Solving for the magnetic field at the liner surface gives:\n$$B_{\\phi}(R(t)) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)}{2\\pi R(t)}$$\nInside the perfectly-conducting liner, the magnetic field is zero.\n\nSecond, we calculate the magnetic pressure, $P_B$, exerted on the liner. The magnetic pressure is the energy density of the magnetic field, given by $P_B = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$. Since the field is non-zero outside the liner and zero inside, there is a net inward pressure on the liner surface equal to the magnetic pressure from the external field:\n$$P_B(t) = \\frac{B_{\\phi}(R(t))^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)}{2\\pi R(t)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{8\\pi^2 R(t)^2}$$\n\nThird, we find the net inward force per unit axial length, $F'$, acting on the liner. This force is the magnetic pressure multiplied by the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi R(t)$.\n$$F'(t) = P_B(t) \\cdot 2\\pi R(t) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{8\\pi^2 R(t)^2} \\right) (2\\pi R(t)) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{4\\pi R(t)}$$\nThis is the characteristic compressive force of a Z-pinch. The problem states the critical simplifying assumption that the liner radius remains approximately constant at its initial value, $R_0$, during the current pulse. This is a common approximation for calculating the imparted impulse. Applying this, $R(t) \\approx R_0$, the force per unit length becomes:\n$$F'(t) \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{4\\pi R_0}$$\nSubstituting the given current waveform, $I(t) = I_0 \\sin(\\pi t/\\tau)$:\n$$F'(t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2}{4\\pi R_0} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nFourth, we apply Newton's second law to find the liner's velocity. The force per unit length is related to the acceleration, $a(t)$, of the mass per unit length, $m$, by $F'(t) = m a(t)$. The radial acceleration is thus $a(t) = \\frac{F'(t)}{m}$. The liner starts from rest, $v(0)=0$. The velocity at the end of the pulse, $t=\\tau$, is found by integrating the acceleration over the duration of the pulse:\n$$v(\\tau) = \\int_0^{\\tau} a(t) dt = \\int_0^{\\tau} \\frac{F'(t)}{m} dt = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2}{4\\pi m R_0} \\int_0^{\\tau} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right) dt$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\\int_0^{\\tau} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right) dt = \\int_0^{\\tau} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) dt$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ t - \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right]_0^{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\tau - \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi)\\right) - (0 - 0) \\right) = \\frac{\\tau}{2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the velocity expression gives the final liner velocity:\n$$v(\\tau) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2}{4\\pi m R_0} \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2 \\tau}{8\\pi m R_0}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the kinetic energy per unit axial length, $K.E.'$, at time $t=\\tau$. This is given by $K.E.' = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$.\n$$K.E.'(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2} m (v(\\tau))^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2 \\tau}{8\\pi m R_0} \\right)^2$$\n$$K.E.'(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0^2 I_0^4 \\tau^2}{64\\pi^2 m^2 R_0^2} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling one factor of $m$:\n$$K.E.'(\\tau) = \\frac{\\mu_0^2 I_0^4 \\tau^2}{128\\pi^2 m R_0^2}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the liner kinetic energy per unit axial length at stagnation, under the stated assumptions.

The axial magnetic field is initially uniform with magnitude $B_0$ at $t=0$.
