In the neighborhood of the null, introduce local Cartesian coordinates $x = R - R_{0}$ and $y = Z - Z_{0}$, and assume the vacuum approximation holds so that the local equilibrium is governed by the homogeneous axisymmetric operator acting on the poloidal flux function. The equilibrium condition is that $\\psi(R,Z)$ satisfies the magnetostatic Grad–Shafranov operator in vacuum, which in local coordinates reduces to a second-order, linear, elliptic partial differential equation.

The Grad-Shafranov equation is the fundamental equation for axisymmetric MHD equilibrium. The concept of a magnetic null, higher-order nulls, and the \"snowflake\" configuration are standard and critical topics in modern tokamak divertor physics. The use of a local Taylor expansion and dominant balance analysis is a standard mathematical physics technique. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive the requested expressions and calculate the final value. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe analysis begins with the Grad-Shafranov equation for an axisymmetric equilibrium in a vacuum. In cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, Z)$, this equation for the poloidal magnetic flux $\\psi(R,Z)$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta^* \\psi \\equiv R \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial Z^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\Delta^*$ is the Grad-Shafranov operator in vacuum.\n\nWe introduce local Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ centered at the null point $(R_0, Z_0)$, such that $R = R_0 + x$ and $Z = Z_0 + y$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Substituting these into the Grad-Shafranov equation gives the local PDE:\n$$ (R_0 + x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_0 + x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nExpanding the first term, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} - \\frac{1}{R_0 + x} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nThis is the general local equation for the flux function $\\psi(x,y)$ near the null.\n\nThe problem states that the null is of second-order (a \"snowflake\" condition). This means that all first and second partial derivatives of $\\psi$ with respect to $R$ and $Z$ (and thus $x$ and $y$) vanish at the null point $(x,y)=(0,0)$.\nLet's expand $\\psi(x,y)$ in a Taylor series around the null point, with $\\psi_0 = \\psi(R_0, Z_0)$:\n$$ \\psi(x,y) - \\psi_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!} \\left( x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\right)^n \\psi \\bigg|_{(0,0)} $$\nThe snowflake conditions are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the Taylor series for $\\psi(x,y) - \\psi_0$ has no linear or quadratic terms. The leading non-vanishing term is of cubic order. Let us denote this leading-order part of the flux function as $\\psi_3(x,y)$, which is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $3$.\n$$ \\psi(x,y) - \\psi_0 \\approx \\psi_3(x,y) = \\frac{1}{3!} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^3 \\psi}{\\partial x^3} x^3 + 3\\frac{\\partial^3 \\psi}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} x^2 y + 3\\frac{\\partial^3 \\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} x y^2 + \\frac{\\partial^3 \\psi}{\\partial y^3} y^3 \\right) \\bigg|_{(0,0)} $$\nWe substitute $\\psi = \\psi_0 + \\psi_3$ into the local PDE and perform a dominant balance analysis.\n$$ \\nabla^2 (\\psi_0 + \\psi_3) - \\frac{1}{R_0 + x} \\frac{\\partial (\\psi_0 + \\psi_3)}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\psi_3 - \\frac{1}{R_0 + x} \\frac{\\partial \\psi_3}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nThe term $\\psi_3$ is of order $r^3$ where $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\nThen $\\nabla^2 \\psi_3$ is of order $r$, because differentiating a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ twice yields a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k-2$.\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\psi_3}{\\partial x}$ is of order $r^2$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{R_0 + x} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_0}$ for $x \\ll R_0$. So, the second term $\\frac{1}{R_0+x}\\frac{\\partial\\psi_3}{\\partial x}$ is of order $r^2/R_0$.\nThe equation is $\\mathcal{O}(r) + \\mathcal{O}(r^2/R_0) = 0$. In the limit $r \\to 0$, the $\\mathcal{O}(r)$ term dominates. For the equation to hold for all small $r$, the dominant term must vanish independently. This is the justification for the reduction to the two-dimensional Laplace equation for the leading-order term:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\psi_3 = 0 $$\nThis is the required leading-order local PDE.\n\nNext, we find the most general cubic polynomial solution to $\\nabla^2\\psi_3=0$. Let $\\psi_3(x,y) = c_1 x^3 + c_2 x^2 y + c_3 x y^2 + c_4 y^3$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_3}{\\partial x^2} = 6 c_1 x + 2 c_2 y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_3}{\\partial y^2} = 2 c_3 x + 6 c_4 y $$\nThe condition $\\nabla^2\\psi_3=0$ implies $(6c_1 + 2c_3)x + (2c_2 + 6c_4)y = 0$ for all $(x,y)$. This requires the coefficients to be zero:\n$c_3 = -3c_1$ and $c_2 = -3c_4$.\nSubstituting these back, the general solution is:\n$$ \\psi_3(x,y) = c_1 x^3 - 3c_4 x^2 y - 3c_1 x y^2 + c_4 y^3 = c_1(x^3 - 3xy^2) + c_4(y^3 - 3x^2y) $$\nTo express this in polar coordinates, we use $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$. From trigonometric identities:\n$x^3 - 3xy^2 = r^3(\\cos^3\\theta - 3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta) = r^3\\cos(3\\theta)$.\n$y^3 - 3x^2y = r^3(\\sin^3\\theta - 3\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta) = -r^3(3\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin^3\\theta) = -r^3\\sin(3\\theta)$.\nSo, the general cubic harmonic solution is:\n$$ \\psi_3(r,\\theta) = c_1 r^3 \\cos(3\\theta) - c_4 r^3 \\sin(3\\theta) $$\nRelabeling the arbitrary constants $c_1$ and $-c_4$ as generic constants, the solution has the form:\n$$ \\psi_3(r,\\theta) = r^3 \\big( K_1 \\cos(3\\theta) + K_2 \\sin(3\\theta) \\big) $$\nThis confirms the form given in the problem statement. The angular dependence is a linear combination of $\\cos(3\\theta)$ and $\\sin(3\\theta)$.\n\nThe angular directions along which the level set $\\psi(x,y) = \\psi(R_{0},Z_{0})$ emanates from the null are found by setting the leading-order term to zero: $\\psi_3(x,y) = 0$. For $r \\neq 0$:\n$$ K_1 \\cos(3\\theta) + K_2 \\sin(3\\theta) = 0 $$\nThis equation defines the angles $\\theta$ of the separatrices. For a non-trivial solution ($K_1, K_2$ not both zero), there are typically $6$ solutions for $\\theta$ in $[0, 2\\pi)$, separated by $\\pi/3$, corresponding to the six \"legs\" of the snowflake separatrix.\n\nFinally, we consider the specific case provided:\n$$ \\psi(x,y) - \\psi(R_{0},Z_{0}) \\propto r^{3}\\,\\big[A\\cos(3\\theta) + B\\sin(3\\theta)\\big] $$\nwith $A = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $B = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nThe condition $\\psi(x,y) = \\psi(R_{0},Z_{0})$ becomes, to leading order:\n$$ A\\cos(3\\theta) + B\\sin(3\\theta) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the values of $A$ and $B$:\n$$ (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cos(3\\theta) + (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\sin(3\\theta) = 0 $$\nAssuming $\\cos(3\\theta) \\neq 0$, we can divide by it and by $10^{-3}$:\n$$ 3.0 + 4.0 \\tan(3\\theta) = 0 $$\n$$ \\tan(3\\theta) = -\\frac{3.0}{4.0} = -0.75 $$\nWe need to find the smallest positive angle $\\theta$. Let $\\alpha = \\arctan(-0.75)$. The range of the $\\arctan$ function is $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. Since the argument is negative, $\\alpha$ is in $(-\\pi/2, 0)$.\nNumerically, $\\alpha \\approx -0.6435011$ radians.\nThe general solution for $3\\theta$ is given by $3\\theta = \\alpha + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\alpha + k\\pi}{3} = \\frac{-0.6435011 + k\\pi}{3} $$\nWe seek the smallest integer $k$ that results in $\\theta > 0$.\n-   For $k=0$, $\\theta = -0.6435011 / 3  0$.\n-   For $k=1$, $\\theta = \\frac{-0.6435011 + \\pi}{3} = \\frac{2.4980915...}{3} \\approx 0.83269718...$ radians.\nThis is the smallest positive solution.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\theta \\approx 0.8327 \\, \\text{radians} $$",

The concepts of poloidal flux, magnetic flux expansion, and divertor configurations (including the advanced snowflake geometry) are central to the field. The provided parameters and field scalings are physically realistic and consistent with theoretical models of magnetic nulls. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary laws and data to derive the requested ratio. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the peak normal heat flux at the target for the snowflake configuration to that of the conventional single-null configuration, $q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}/q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}$.\n\nLet us begin from the principle of energy conservation along a magnetic flux tube. The power, $dP$, flowing through an infinitesimal flux tube is constant between the upstream midplane (subscript $u$) and the divertor target (subscript $t$). This power is given by the product of the parallel heat flux, $q_{\\parallel}$, and the area element perpendicular to the magnetic field, $dA_{\\perp}$:\n$$ dP = q_{\\parallel} dA_{\\perp} $$\nIn an axisymmetric system, the area element $dA_{\\perp}$ for a flux tube of width $dl_{\\perp}$ in the poloidal plane is $dA_{\\perp} = 2\\pi R dl_{\\perp}$, where $R$ is the major radius.\n$$ dP = q_{\\parallel} (2\\pi R dl_{\\perp}) $$\nThe differential of poloidal flux, $d\\psi$, across this width $dl_{\\perp}$ is given as $d\\psi = R B_p dl_{\\perp}$, where $B_p$ is the poloidal magnetic field magnitude. We can express $dl_{\\perp}$ as $dl_{\\perp} = \\frac{d\\psi}{R B_p}$. Substituting this into the power equation:\n$$ dP = q_{\\parallel} \\left(2\\pi R \\frac{d\\psi}{R B_p}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi q_{\\parallel}}{B_p} d\\psi $$\nThis gives the power per unit poloidal flux, which must be conserved along the flux tube from upstream to target:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\psi}\\bigg|_{u} = \\frac{dP}{d\\psi}\\bigg|_{t} $$\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi q_{\\parallel,u}}{B_{p,u}} = \\frac{2\\pi q_{\\parallel,t}}{B_{p,t}} $$\nThis yields a fundamental relationship for the parallel heat flux at the target, $q_{\\parallel,t}$, as a function of the upstream parallel heat flux, $q_{\\parallel,u}$, and the local poloidal magnetic fields:\n$$ q_{\\parallel,t} = q_{\\parallel,u} \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B_{p,u}} $$\nNext, we relate the parallel heat flux at the target to the normal heat flux on the target surface, $q_{n,t}$. The normal heat flux is the component of the heat flux vector, which is directed along the magnetic field, projected onto the target surface normal. This is given by $q_{n,t} = q_{\\parallel,t} \\sin\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the incidence angle of the magnetic field line with respect to the target surface.\nThe problem provides the approximation for small incidence angles and strong toroidal field ($B_t \\gg B_p$):\n$$ \\sin\\alpha \\approx \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B} \\approx \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B_t} $$\nwhere $B$ is the total magnetic field strength. Combining these, we find the normal heat flux at the target:\n$$ q_{n,t} = q_{\\parallel,t} \\sin\\alpha \\approx q_{\\parallel,t} \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B_t} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $q_{\\parallel,t}$:\n$$ q_{n,t} \\approx \\left( q_{\\parallel,u} \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B_{p,u}} \\right) \\frac{B_{p,t}}{B_t} = q_{\\parallel,u} \\frac{B_{p,t}^2}{B_{p,u} B_t} $$\nThis expression gives the normal heat flux profile on the target. The problem states that the upstream conditions are identical for both configurations, meaning $q_{\\parallel,u}$ and $B_{p,u}$ are the same for the standard and snowflake cases at any given flux surface. The toroidal field $B_t$ is also the same. The peak heat flux is evaluated at the separatrix strike point, which is located at $r=\\delta$ for both cases.\nWe can now form the ratio of the peak normal heat fluxes for the snowflake (sf) and standard (std) cases:\n$$ \\frac{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}}{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}} = \\frac{q_{n,t}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}(r=\\delta)}{q_{n,t}^{(\\mathrm{std})}(r=\\delta)} = \\frac{ q_{\\parallel,u} \\frac{(B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}(\\delta))^2}{B_{p,u} B_t} }{ q_{\\parallel,u} \\frac{(B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{std})}(\\delta))^2}{B_{p,u} B_t} } $$\nThe common terms $q_{\\parallel,u}$, $B_{p,u}$, and $B_t$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}}{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}} = \\left( \\frac{B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}(\\delta)}{B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{std})}(\\delta)} \\right)^2 $$\nWe are given the near-null scalings for the poloidal magnetic field at the target:\n- $B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{std})}(r) = a\\,r$\n- $B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}(r) = b\\,r^2$\nEvaluating these at the separatrix strike point, $r=\\delta$:\n- $B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{std})}(\\delta) = a\\,\\delta$\n- $B_{p,t}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}(\\delta) = b\\,\\delta^2$\nSubstituting these into the ratio expression gives the final analytical result:\n$$ \\frac{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}}{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}} = \\left( \\frac{b\\,\\delta^2}{a\\,\\delta} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{b\\,\\delta}{a} \\right)^2 $$\nNote that the parameters $R_u$ and $R_t$ were not required for this ratio, as their effects are implicitly contained within the measured field scalings and conserved quantities.\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Calculation\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.\n- $a = 12\\ \\mathrm{T/m}$\n- $b = 300\\ \\mathrm{T/m^2}$\n- $\\delta = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.030\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}}{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}} = \\left( \\frac{(300\\ \\mathrm{T/m^2}) \\cdot (0.030\\ \\mathrm{m})}{12\\ \\mathrm{T/m}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{9}{12} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = (0.75)^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{sf})}}{q_{n,\\mathrm{peak}}^{(\\mathrm{std})}} = 0.5625 $$\nThis value is exact and has four significant figures, as requested.

The radial strike-point heat-flux footprint at the divertor target is set by cross-field diffusive spreading at the outboard midplane followed by geometric mapping to the target along magnetic field lines.\n\nAssume the following physically motivated picture and constraints:\n- Cross-field transport of heat density at the outboard midplane is diffusive with a constant cross-field diffusivity $D_{\\perp}$, governed by the diffusion equation $\\partial Q/\\partial t = D_{\\perp} \\, \\partial^{2} Q/\\partial x^{2}$ in the radial coordinate $x$.\n- Parallel removal of heat along field lines occurs on the characteristic time $L/c_{s}$, where $L$ is the connection length from the outboard midplane to the divertor target and $c_{s}$ is the characteristic parallel evacuation speed taken as the ion sound speed.\n- The upstream heat deposition is initially narrow compared to the ensuing diffusive spreading so that the initial width can be neglected compared to the diffusive broadening over the time $L/c_{s}$.\n- The geometrical mapping from the outboard midplane to the divertor target scales radial length elements by the total flux expansion factor $f_{\\exp}$, so that the target strike-point footprint width is the mapped upstream width times $f_{\\exp}$.\n\nYou may assume that $D_{\\perp}$ and $c_{s}$ are unchanged between the two configurations, with $D_{\\perp} = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{m^{2} \\ s^{-1}}$ and $c_{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}$. The conventional configuration has connection length $L_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and total flux expansion $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{conv}} = 5$. The snowflake configuration has connection length $L_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and total flux expansion $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{sf}} = 12$.\n\nUnder the above assumptions, starting from the diffusion equation and the definition of the parallel evacuation time, derive from first principles the scaling of the target strike-point heat-flux footprint width with $D_{\\perp}$, $c_{s}$, $L$, and $f_{\\exp}$. Then compute the ratio of the snowflake to conventional strike-point heat-flux footprint widths. Express your final result as a single dimensionless number, and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a validation process.\n\nThe givens are as follows:\n- The governing equation for cross-field heat transport is the one-dimensional diffusion equation in the radial coordinate $x$: $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial t} = D_{\\perp} \\frac{\\partial^{2} Q}{\\partial x^{2}}$.\n- $D_{\\perp}$ is the constant cross-field diffusivity.\n- The characteristic time for parallel heat removal is $\\tau_{\\parallel} = \\frac{L}{c_{s}}$, where $L$ is the connection length and $c_{s}$ is the ion sound speed.\n- The initial width of the heat deposition is negligible.\n- The target strike-point width $\\lambda_q$ is related to the upstream width at the midplane, $\\lambda_{q,u}$, by the total flux expansion factor $f_{\\exp}$, such that $\\lambda_q = f_{\\exp} \\lambda_{q,u}$.\n- For both configurations, $D_{\\perp} = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{m^{2} \\ s^{-1}}$ and $c_{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}$.\n- For the conventional configuration: $L_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{conv}} = 5$.\n- For the snowflake configuration: $L_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{sf}} = 12$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing a standard simplified model for heat flux width in the scrape-off layer of a tokamak. The physical concepts, such as diffusive transport, parallel loss time, and magnetic flux expansion, are central to plasma edge physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. The provided numerical values are physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to derive the scaling of the target heat-flux footprint width, $\\lambda_q$, and then compute the ratio of this width for the snowflake configuration to that of the conventional one.\n\nThe starting point is the diffusion equation for the heat density $Q$ in the radial coordinate $x$ at the outboard midplane:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial t} = D_{\\perp} \\frac{\\partial^2 Q}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the initial heat deposition is very narrow, which can be modeled as a Dirac delta function initial condition: $Q(x, t=0) = Q_0 \\delta(x)$, where $Q_0$ is the total heat energy per unit length. The solution to this initial value problem is a Gaussian function:\n$$\nQ(x,t) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D_{\\perp} t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4 D_{\\perp} t}\\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic width of this spreading profile is its standard deviation, $\\sigma_x$. For a Gaussian of the form $\\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma_x^2))$, the variance is $\\sigma_x^2$. By comparing the exponent in our solution with this form, we identify $2\\sigma_x^2 = 4 D_{\\perp} t$, which gives the variance as $\\sigma_x^2 = 2 D_{\\perp} t$. The characteristic width is thus:\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\sqrt{2 D_{\\perp} t}\n$$\nThis represents the diffusive broadening of the heat channel at the outboard midplane. The diffusion process occurs over a characteristic time $t$ before the heat is removed by flowing along the magnetic field lines to the divertor target. This time is the parallel evacuation time, $\\tau_{\\parallel}$, given as:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\parallel} = \\frac{L}{c_s}\n$$\nSetting $t = \\tau_{\\parallel}$, the characteristic width of the heat flux channel at the outboard midplane, which we denote $\\lambda_{q,u}$, is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{q,u} = \\sqrt{2 D_{\\perp} \\tau_{\\parallel}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 D_{\\perp} L}{c_s}}\n$$\nThis upstream width is then mapped along magnetic field lines to the divertor target. The radial distance at the target is stretched by the total flux expansion factor, $f_{\\exp}$. The resulting strike-point heat-flux footprint width at the target, $\\lambda_q$, is:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = f_{\\exp} \\lambda_{q,u}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_{q,u}$, we obtain the scaling of the target strike-point width:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = f_{\\exp} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 D_{\\perp} L}{c_s}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the target width scales with the square root of the diffusivity $D_{\\perp}$ and connection length $L$, and inversely with the square root of the sound speed $c_s$. It scales linearly with the flux expansion $f_{\\exp}$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio of the snowflake strike-point width, $\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{sf}}$, to the conventional strike-point width, $\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{conv}}$. Using the derived scaling relation for each case:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{sf}}}{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{sf}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 D_{\\perp} L_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{c_s}}}{f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{conv}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 D_{\\perp} L_{\\mathrm{conv}}}{c_s}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $D_{\\perp}$ and $c_s$ are the same for both configurations. The constants $2$, $D_{\\perp}$, and $c_s$ cancel out from the ratio, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{sf}}}{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{sf}}}{f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{conv}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{L_{\\mathrm{conv}}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{sf}} = 12$, $f_{\\exp,\\mathrm{conv}} = 5$, $L_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{sf}}}{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{12}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{40}{20}} = \\frac{12}{5} \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{12}{5} = 2.4\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{sf}}}{\\lambda_{q, \\mathrm{conv}}} \\approx 2.4 \\times 1.41421356... = 3.39411254...\n$$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures as requested, we get $3.394$.\nThe snowflake configuration, with its longer connection length and much larger flux expansion, results in a significantly wider heat flux footprint at the target. This is a desirable feature for reducing the peak heat load on divertor components.",
