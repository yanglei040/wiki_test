Determine the magnetic field profile $B_{\\theta}(r)$.\n2.  Use the force balance equation to find the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}$.\n3.  Integrate the pressure gradient to obtain the pressure profile $p(r)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the magnetic field $B_{\\theta}(r)$**\n\nWe start from the given cylindrical form of Maxwell-Ampère’s law:\n$$J_{z}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0} r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\!\\left(r B_{\\theta}(r)\\right)$$\nTo find $B_{\\theta}(r)$, we first rearrange and integrate the equation with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\!\\left(r B_{\\theta}(r)\\right) = \\mu_{0} r J_{z}(r)$$\n$$r B_{\\theta}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\mu_{0} r' J_{z}(r') dr' + C$$\nThe regularity condition that $B_{\\theta}(0)$ must be finite implies that $r B_{\\theta}(r)$ must approach $0$ as $r \\to 0$. This sets the integration constant $C$ to $0$. Thus,\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{r} \\int_{0}^{r} r' J_{z}(r') dr'$$\nWe are interested in the region $0 \\le r \\le a$, where $J_{z}(r') = J_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{r} \\int_{0}^{r} r' J_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) dr'$$\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}}{r} \\int_{0}^{r} \\left(r' - \\frac{r'^{3}}{a^{2}}\\right) dr'$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}}{r} \\left[\\frac{r'^{2}}{2} - \\frac{r'^{4}}{4a^{2}}\\right]_{0}^{r}$$\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}}{r} \\left(\\frac{r^{2}}{2} - \\frac{r^{4}}{4a^{2}}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression for $B_{\\theta}(r)$ for $0 \\le r \\le a$:\n$$B_{\\theta}(r) = \\mu_{0} J_{0} \\left(\\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r^{3}}{4a^{2}}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 2: Derive the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}$**\n\nThe static MHD force balance equation is $\\nabla p = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. In this problem, the current density is $\\mathbf{J} = J_{z}(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and the magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} = B_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}$. The cross product is:\n$$\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} = J_{z}(r) B_{\\theta}(r) (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}})$$\nUsing the cylindrical coordinate relation $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, we get:\n$$\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} = -J_{z}(r) B_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$$\nFor an axisymmetric pressure profile $p(r)$, the pressure gradient is $\\nabla p = \\frac{dp}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. Equating this with the force density gives the radial component of the force balance equation:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dr} = -J_{z}(r) B_{\\theta}(r)$$\n\n**Step 3: Integrate to find the pressure profile $p(r)$**\n\nTo find $p(r)$, we integrate the pressure gradient from an arbitrary radius $r$ (where $0 \\le r \\le a$) to the edge of the plasma at $r=a$:\n$$\\int_{r}^{a} \\frac{dp}{dr'} dr' = p(a) - p(r)$$\nUsing the boundary condition $p(a) = p_{a}$:\n$$p_{a} - p(r) = \\int_{r}^{a} \\left(-J_{z}(r') B_{\\theta}(r')\\right) dr'$$\n$$p(r) = p_{a} + \\int_{r}^{a} J_{z}(r') B_{\\theta}(r') dr'$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $J_{z}(r')$ and $B_{\\theta}(r')$:\n$$J_{z}(r') = J_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)$$\n$$B_{\\theta}(r') = \\mu_{0} J_{0} \\left(\\frac{r'}{2} - \\frac{r'^{3}}{4a^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0} r'}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{2a^{2}}\\right)$$\nThe integrand is:\n$$J_{z}(r') B_{\\theta}(r') = J_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0} r'}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{2a^{2}}\\right)$$\nSo the integral for the pressure becomes:\n$$p(r) = p_{a} + \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}^{2}}{2} \\int_{r}^{a} r' \\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{2a^{2}}\\right) dr'$$\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = 1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}$. This implies $du = -\\frac{2r'}{a^{2}} dr'$, or $r'dr' = -\\frac{a^{2}}{2}du$. The term $\\left(1 - \\frac{r'^{2}}{2a^{2}}\\right)$ becomes $1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - u\\right) = \\frac{1+u}{2}$.\nThe integration limits change as follows: when $r' = r$, $u = 1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}$; when $r' = a$, $u = 0$.\nThe integral transforms to:\n$$\\int_{1 - r^{2}/a^{2}}^{0} u \\left(\\frac{1+u}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{a^{2}}{2} du\\right) = \\frac{a^{2}}{4} \\int_{0}^{1 - r^{2}/a^{2}} (u+u^{2}) du$$\n$$\\frac{a^{2}}{4} \\left[\\frac{u^{2}}{2} + \\frac{u^{3}}{3}\\right]_{0}^{1 - r^{2}/a^{2}} = \\frac{a^{2}}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{3}\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{a^{2}}{4} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{a^{2}}{4} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\left(\\frac{3+2-2r^{2}/a^{2}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{a^{2}}{24} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\left(5 - \\frac{2r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $p(r)$:\n$$p(r) = p_{a} + \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}^{2}}{2} \\left[ \\frac{a^{2}}{24} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\left(5 - \\frac{2r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$p(r) = p_{a} + \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_{0}^{2} a^{2}}{48} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\left(5 - \\frac{2r^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the pressure profile $p(r)$ in the region $0 \\le r \\le a$.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in ideal magnetohydrodynamics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and formulated objectively. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution will follow the five tasks outlined in the problem statement. We begin by deriving the local interfacial dispersion relation for the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in the presence of a magnetic field oriented perpendicularly to both the flow and the wavevector.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Local KH Growth Rate**\n\nWe consider a planar interface at $x=0$ separating two semi-infinite, ideal, incompressible magnetofluids of equal density $\\rho$. The flows are uniform in each region, directed along the $z$-axis: $\\mathbf{U}_{1}$ for $x0$ and $\\mathbf{U}_{2}$ for $x0$. A uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$ is present, oriented along the $y$-axis, tangential to the interface and equal on both sides. Perturbations are of the form $f(x) \\exp(i k_z z - i \\omega t)$, meaning the wavevector $\\mathbf{k} = k_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is parallel to the flow and perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nIn this configuration ($\\mathbf{k} \\perp \\mathbf{B}_{0}$), the magnetic field lines are bent by the interfacial displacement, creating a stabilizing magnetic tension. The shear in the flow, $\\Delta U = U_2 - U_1$, is the source of free energy for the KH instability. The dispersion relation for such an interface is a standard result in plasma physics. In each uniform region (denoted by subscript $j=1,2$), the linearized ideal MHD equations can be manipulated to yield a second-order differential equation for the total pressure perturbation $P'_{j} = p'_{j} + (\\mathbf{B}_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}'_{j})/\\mu_{0}$. For incompressible perturbations, this reduces to $\\nabla^2 P'_{j} = 0$. For solutions evanescently decaying away from the interface, we have $P'_{j}(x) \\propto \\exp(-|k_z| |x|)$.\n\nMatching the solutions at the interface $x=0$ requires two boundary conditions: continuity of the normal velocity and continuity of the total pressure. These conditions lead to the dispersion relation. For equal densities $\\rho$ and equal magnetic fields $B_0$, the relation is:\n$$(\\omega - k_z U_1)^2 + (\\omega - k_z U_2)^2 = 2 k_z^2 V_A^2$$\nwhere $V_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}$ is the Alfvén speed. Let's define the average velocity $U_{avg} = (U_1+U_2)/2$ and the velocity difference $\\Delta U = U_2-U_1$. Rearranging the dispersion relation as a quadratic equation for $\\omega$:\n$$2\\omega^2 - 2k_z(U_1+U_2)\\omega + k_z^2(U_1^2+U_2^2 - 2V_A^2) = 0$$\nSolving for $\\omega$ yields:\n$$\\omega = k_z \\frac{U_1+U_2}{2} \\pm \\frac{k_z}{2}\\sqrt{-(U_2-U_1)^2 + 4V_A^2}$$\n$$\\omega = k_z U_{avg} \\pm \\frac{k_z}{2}\\sqrt{4V_A^2 - (\\Delta U)^2}$$\nInstability occurs when the term under the square root is negative, leading to a complex frequency. The growth rate, $\\gamma = \\mathrm{Im}(\\omega)$, is non-zero only if $(\\Delta U)^2  4V_A^2$, or equivalently, $|\\Delta U|/2  V_A$. The growth rate is given by:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{k_z}{2}\\sqrt{(\\Delta U)^2 - 4V_A^2} = k_z \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{|\\Delta U|}{2}\\right)^2 - V_A^2}$$\nIf $(|\\Delta U|/2)^2 - V_A^2  0$, the system is stable, and the growth rate $\\gamma$ is $0$.

The unstable mode at $r_2$ and the stable mode at $r_1$ are not isolated.\nThe opposite signs of the velocity jumps ($\\Delta U_1  0$, $\\Delta U_2  0$) imply that the vorticity of the shear layers is oppositely signed. In a full coupling analysis, this would break the symmetry that would exist if the shears had the same sign, leading to more complex coupled eigenmodes. However, following the problem's instruction to base the risk assessment on the local growth rates, the dominant risk factor is the large, positive growth rate at the $r_2$ layer. While coupling to the stable $r_1$ layer might slightly modify $\\gamma_2$, it is unlikely to eliminate such a strong instability. The overall system is at high risk of a KH instability primarily driven by the shear at $r_2$.\n\n**Task 5: Maximum KH Temporal Growth Rate**\n\nThe maximum KH temporal growth rate is the maximum of the rates computed for the two layers:\n$$\\gamma_{\\max} = \\max(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\max(0, 4.4592 \\times 10^8) \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 4.4592 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\gamma_{\\max} = 4.459 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.",

The plasma mass density is $\\rho = n_i m_i$, where $n_i$ is the ion number density and $m_i$ is the ion mass. Assume a small auxiliary axial magnetic field $B_z$ exists such that the total magnetic field magnitude is $B = \\sqrt{B_\\theta(a)^2 + B_z^2}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as applied to Z-pinch plasmas, well-posed as a constrained optimization problem, and objectively formulated. All provided parameters are physically plausible for Z-pinch experiments. The model, while simplified, is a valid phenomenological representation for theoretical analysis.\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of edge flow velocities, $R_{\\mathrm{opt}} = V_\\theta(a)/V_z(a)$, that minimizes the effective growth rate of the $m=1$ instability, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The given model for the growth rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 = \\gamma_0^2 - \\alpha_z S^2 - \\alpha_\\theta \\Omega^2\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_0$ is the base growth rate without flow, while $S$ and $\\Omega$ are the axial shear rate and angular rotation rate, respectively. The coefficients $\\alpha_z$ and $\\alpha_\\theta$ are positive constants. Minimizing $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (or equivalently $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2$, since $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge 0$) is equivalent to maximizing the stabilizing flow-dependent term, $G(S, \\Omega) = \\alpha_z S^2 + \\alpha_\\theta \\Omega^2$, subject to a set of physical and engineering constraints.\n\nWe formulate this as a constrained optimization problem. The variables are $S$ and $\\Omega$, which must be non-negative.\n\n**1. Formulation of Constraints:**\nThe problem specifies several constraints on the flow parameters $S$ and $\\Omega$.\n\na) **Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) Instability Avoidance:** The axial shear rate $S$ must not exceed a threshold $S_{\\mathrm{KH}}$ that is proportional to $k v_A$. The axial wavenumber is given by $k = \\pi/L$. In the absence of a specified proportionality constant, we adopt the standard scaling by setting the constant to $1$. Thus, the constraint is $S \\le k v_A = (\\pi/L) v_A$.\n\nb) **Engineering Cap on Axial Flow:** The axial flow velocity at the edge of the pinch, $V_z(a) = S a$, is limited by an engineering cap proportional to the Alfvén speed $v_A$. This gives the constraint $S a \\le \\beta_z v_A$, which can be rewritten for the shear rate as $S \\le (\\beta_z/a) v_A$.\n\nCombining these two constraints, the maximum permissible axial shear rate $S_{\\max}$ is the more restrictive of the two:\n$$\nS \\le S_{\\max} = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L} v_A, \\frac{\\beta_z}{a} v_A\\right) = v_A \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}, \\frac{\\beta_z}{a}\\right)\n$$\n\nc) **Engineering Cap on Rotational Flow:** Similarly, the azimuthal flow velocity at the edge, $V_\\theta(a) = \\Omega a$, is limited. This gives the constraint $\\Omega a \\le \\beta_\\theta v_A$, which implies:\n$$\n\\Omega \\le \\Omega_{\\max} = \\frac{\\beta_\\theta}{a} v_A\n$$\nThe problem notes that the choice of solid-body rotation $V_\\theta(r) = \\Omega r$ already satisfies Rayleigh’s criterion for centrifugal stability, so no further constraints on $\\Omega$ arise from that consideration.\n\nThe feasible region for the optimization is a rectangle in the $(S, \\Omega)$ plane defined by $0 \\le S \\le S_{\\max}$ and $0 \\le \\Omega \\le \\Omega_{\\max}$.\n\n**2. Solution of the Optimization Problem:**\nWe seek to maximize the objective function $G(S, \\Omega) = \\alpha_z S^2 + \\alpha_\\theta \\Omega^2$ over the feasible region. The parameters $\\alpha_z$ and $\\alpha_\\theta$ are given as positive in all test cases. The partial derivatives of the objective function are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial S} = 2 \\alpha_z S \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\Omega} = 2 \\alpha_\\theta \\Omega \\ge 0\n$$\nSince both partial derivatives are non-negative in the first quadrant (where $S \\ge 0, \\Omega \\ge 0$), the function $G(S, \\Omega)$ is monotonically increasing with both $S$ and $\\Omega$. Therefore, to maximize $G$, we must choose the largest possible values for $S$ and $\\Omega$ within their allowed ranges. The maximum must occur at the corner of the feasible rectangle farthest from the origin, which is $(S_{\\max}, \\Omega_{\\max})$.\n\nThe optimal values for the shear and rotation rates are thus:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{opt}} = S_{\\max} = v_A \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}, \\frac{\\beta_z}{a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\Omega_{\\max} = \\frac{\\beta_\\theta}{a} v_A\n$$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Optimal Ratio $R_{\\mathrm{opt}}$:**\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the edge velocities, $R_{\\mathrm{opt}} = V_\\theta(a) / V_z(a)$. Using the optimal rates found above:\n$$\nV_z(a)_{\\mathrm{opt}} = S_{\\mathrm{opt}} a = a v_A \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}, \\frac{\\beta_z}{a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_\\theta(a)_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\Omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} a = \\left(\\frac{\\beta_\\theta}{a} v_A\\right) a = \\beta_\\theta v_A\n$$\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{V_\\theta(a)_{\\mathrm{opt}}}{V_z(a)_{\\mathrm{opt}}} = \\frac{\\beta_\\theta v_A}{a v_A \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}, \\frac{\\beta_z}{a}\\right)}\n$$\nThe Alfvén speed $v_A$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. We can also factor $1/a$ out of the minimum function:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{\\beta_\\theta v_A}{a v_A \\frac{1}{a} \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{L}, \\beta_z\\right)} = \\frac{\\beta_\\theta}{\\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{L}, \\beta_z\\right)}\n$$\nThis final expression for $R_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is remarkably simple. A key insight is that the optimal ratio is independent of the plasma parameters ($I$, $n_i$, $m_i$), the magnetic field strength (and thus $f_{Bz}$), the base growth rate parameter $c_\\gamma$, and the shear efficacy coefficients ($\\alpha_z$, $\\alpha_\\theta$), provided $\\alpha_z  0$ and $\\alpha_\\theta  0$. The solution depends only on the pinch geometry ($a$, $L$) and the dimensionless engineering caps on flow ($\\beta_z$, $\\beta_\\theta$).\n\nThe algorithm to compute $R_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ for each test case is:\n1.  From the input tuple $(a, I, n_i, m_i, L, \\beta_z, \\beta_\\theta, f_{Bz}, c_\\gamma, \\alpha_z, \\alpha_\\theta)$, extract the necessary parameters: $a$, $L$, $\\beta_z$, and $\\beta_\\theta$.\n2.  Calculate the dimensionless quantity $\\frac{\\pi a}{L}$.\n3.  Find the minimum of $\\frac{\\pi a}{L}$ and $\\beta_z$.\n4.  Compute the ratio $R_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\beta_\\theta / \\min(\\frac{\\pi a}{L}, \\beta_z)$.\nThis procedure is applied to each test case to generate the final results.",
