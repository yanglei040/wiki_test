All necessary data and physical relations are provided to derive and calculate the Hartmann number for the given conditions. The context of liquid metal divertors in nuclear fusion is appropriate and the physical parameters are realistic.\n\nThe derivation of the Hartmann number begins with the momentum balance equation for a steady, incompressible, conducting fluid, which is the Navier-Stokes equation augmented with the Lorentz force term:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the electric current density vector, and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field vector.\n\nThe electric current density $\\mathbf{J}$ in a moving conductor is given by Ohm's law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a characteristic velocity scale, the construction of a Weber number, and its numerical evaluation for a liquid lithium film subjected to a plasma pressure pulse.\n\nFirst, the problem statement must be validated.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Film thickness: $h=8.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Lithium density: $\\rho=5.20\\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Lithium surface tension: $\\gamma=3.75\\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- Peak pressure pulse magnitude: $p_{0}=8.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Pulse duration: $\\tau=3.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- Footprint characteristic lateral scale: $L=1.5\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Assumption: Viscous diffusion is negligible over the pulse duration.\n- Assumption: The film responds inertially.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, specifically the impulse-momentum theorem and the definition of the Weber number. The context, a liquid metal divertor in a fusion device, is a valid and active area of research. All provided parameters are physically realistic for liquid lithium at operating temperatures. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient data and clear objectives to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions of an inertial response and negligible viscosity over the short pulse duration are appropriate simplifications for this type of analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\nThe first step is to derive the characteristic post-impulse velocity scale, $\\Delta U$, imparted to the film. We start with Newton's second law, $F=ma$.\n\nConsider a small cylindrical element of the liquid film with an infinitesimal surface area $dA$ and thickness $h$. The mass of this element is $dm = \\rho \\, V = \\rho \\, h \\, dA$. The force acting on the top surface of this element due to the time-dependent plasma pressure $p(t)$ is $dF = p(t) \\, dA$.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, the acceleration $\\frac{du}{dt}$ of this fluid element in the direction normal to the surface is given by:\n$$dF = (dm) \\frac{du}{dt}$$\n$$p(t) \\, dA = (\\rho \\, h \\, dA) \\frac{du}{dt}$$\nThe area element $dA$ cancels from both sides, yielding an equation for the velocity $u(t)$ of the film:\n$$\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{p(t)}{\\rho h}$$\nTo find the total change in velocity, $\\Delta U$, resulting from the pressure pulse, we integrate this equation over the duration of the pulse, from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$:\n$$\\Delta U = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\frac{du}{dt} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\frac{p(t)}{\\rho h} \\, dt$$\nSince $\\rho$ and $h$ are constant with respect to time, we have:\n$$\\Delta U = \\frac{1}{\\rho h} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} p(t) \\, dt$$\nThis is the impulse–momentum relation for a unit area of the film. The term $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} p(t) \\, dt$ represents the total impulse per unit area delivered by the pulse. The problem describes an impulsive pulse of peak magnitude $p_0$ and duration $\\tau$. We can characterize the impulse per unit area as the product of these characteristic scales, i.e., $p_0 \\tau$. Thus, the characteristic velocity imparted to the film is:\n$$\\Delta U = \\frac{p_0 \\tau}{\\rho h}$$\nNext, we construct the Weber number, $We$, which is the dimensionless ratio of inertial forces to capillary (surface tension) forces. The inertial force is related to the kinetic energy of the fluid motion, while the capillary force is related to the surface energy.\n\nThe inertial stress (force per unit area) scale is given by the dynamic pressure, which is of the order $\\rho \\, (\\Delta U)^2$.\nThe capillary stress arises from the curvature of the free surface. For a surface deformation with a characteristic lateral scale $L$, the radius of curvature is also of the order $L$. The resulting Laplace pressure (a stress) is of the order $\\frac{\\gamma}{L}$.\n\nThe Weber number is the ratio of these two stresses:\n$$We = \\frac{\\text{Inertial Stress}}{\\text{Capillary Stress}} = \\frac{\\rho \\, (\\Delta U)^2}{\\gamma / L} = \\frac{\\rho L (\\Delta U)^2}{\\gamma}$$\nNow, we substitute the derived expression for $\\Delta U$ into the equation for the Weber number:\n$$We = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{p_0 \\tau}{\\rho h} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho L p_0^2 \\tau^2}{\\gamma \\rho^2 h^2}$$\n$$We = \\frac{L p_0^2 \\tau^2}{\\rho \\gamma h^2}$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the Weber number under the given conditions.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical value of $We$ using the provided data:\n- $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $p_0 = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\tau = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\rho = 5.20 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $\\gamma = 3.75 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- $h = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $We$:\n$$We = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-2}) (8.0 \\times 10^{3})^2 (3.0 \\times 10^{-4})^2}{(5.20 \\times 10^{2}) (3.75 \\times 10^{-1}) (8.0 \\times 10^{-4})^2}$$\n$$We = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-2}) (64 \\times 10^{6}) (9.0 \\times 10^{-8})}{(5.20 \\times 10^{2}) (0.375) (64 \\times 10^{-8})}$$\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling the $(8.0)^2 = 64$ term that appears implicitly in the numerator and denominator:\n$$We = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-2}) (10^{6}) (9.0 \\times 10^{-8})}{(5.20 \\times 10^{2}) (0.375) (10^{-8})}$$\nAlso, we have $(p_0/h)^2 = (\\frac{8.0 \\times 10^3}{8.0 \\times 10^{-4}})^2 = (10^7)^2 = 10^{14}$. This offers an alternative calculation path.

We will then compare this temperature to the Leidenfrost temperature $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\nThe energy balance at the surface is given by:\n$$q = h_{\\mathrm{fg}} \\dot{m}''$$\nwhere $h_{\\mathrm{fg}}$ is the latent heat of vaporization per unit mass and $\\dot{m}''$ is the mass flux due to evaporation.\n\nThe mass flux is described by the Hertz–Knudsen relation.

It follows the Clausius–Clapeyron form:\n$$\\ln p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = C - \\frac{B}{T}$$\nwhere $B = \\dfrac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}$.

We now solve it using the provided numerical values.\n\nLet's gather the numerical values:\n- $q = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.60$\n- $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 1.47 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{J/mol}$\n- $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$\n- $M = 6.94 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol}$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1.013 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1603\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{L}} = 1100\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant exponent $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R} = \\frac{1.47 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{J/mol}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}} \\approx 17681\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nNow, we can rearrange the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{req}}$ to solve it iteratively:\n$$q \\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{req}}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{B}{T_{\\mathrm{req}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} p_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi M R}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{B}{T_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right)$$\nThe right-hand side is a constant. Let's calculate it:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} p_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi M R}} = \\frac{0.60 \\times (1.47 \\times 10^5) \\times (1.013 \\times 10^5)}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (6.94 \\times 10^{-3}) (8.314)}} \\approx \\frac{8.935 \\times 10^9}{0.6022} \\approx 1.484 \\times 10^{10} $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{B}{T_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{17681}{1603}\\right) \\approx \\exp(11.03) \\approx 6.168 \\times 10^4 $$\nSo, the full constant on the right side is $(1.484 \\times 10^{10}) \\times (6.168 \\times 10^4) \\approx 9.155 \\times 10^{14}$.\nThe equation to solve is:\n$$1.0 \\times 10^9 \\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{req}}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{17681}{T_{\\mathrm{req}}}\\right) = 9.155 \\times 10^{14}$$\n$$ \\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{req}}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{17681}{T_{\\mathrm{req}}}\\right) = 9.155 \\times 10^5 $$\nThis equation can be solved numerically. An iterative solution (e.g., using a solver or by testing values) shows that the required temperature is approximately:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{req}} \\approx 1770\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe final step is to determine if film boiling will occur. The condition for the onset of stable film boiling is that the surface temperature required to accommodate the heat flux meets or exceeds the Leidenfrost temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\nThe condition is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{req}} \\geq T_{\\mathrm{L}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$1770\\ \\mathrm{K} \\geq 1100\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, under the given heat flux and physical model, the surface temperature will rise well above the Leidenfrost point, leading to the formation of a stable vapor layer and the onset of film boiling.\n\nThe problem asks for an output of $1$ if film boiling will occur and $0$ otherwise. Since the condition is met, the result is $1$.",
