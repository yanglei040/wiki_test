            "problem": "Consider an axisymmetric magnetic confinement fusion device equipped with a Super-X divertor (SXD). In the scrape-off layer (SOL), the magnetic field is well described as the sum of a dominant toroidal component and a poloidal component. Assume magnetostatic equilibrium and large aspect ratio such that the toroidal field scales as $B_{\\phi}(R) = B_{0} R_{0} / R$, and far from any X-point the poloidal field generated by a total plasma current $I_{p}$ scales as $B_{\\theta}(R) \\approx \\mu_{0} I_{p} / (2 \\pi R)$.\n\nIn the SXD leg, the local poloidal field near the divertor target is further reduced by flux flaring associated with proximity to an additional null, which we model by introducing a dimensionless reduction factor $g$ with $0 < g < 1$ such that $B_{\\theta}^{t} = g \\, \\mu_{0} I_{p} / (2 \\pi R_{t})$ at the target major radius $R_{t}$.

The concepts of toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields, magnetic flux, flux surfaces, and flux expansion are standard in this field. The model for the magnetic field is a common large-aspect-ratio approximation. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient definitions and data for a unique solution. The terminology is objective and precise. The problem statement explicitly guides the derivation by referencing \"conservation of magnetic flux\" and the \"geometric relation between spacing of neighboring poloidal flux surfaces and the magnetic field,\" which prevents ambiguity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by formalizing the definitions and hints provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe first hint is the \"conservation of magnetic flux for a thin axisymmetric flux tube.\" In an axisymmetric system, the magnetic field can be described using poloidal flux surfaces. These are surfaces of constant poloidal magnetic flux. Let $\\psi$ represent the poloidal magnetic flux per unit toroidal angle. A thin flux tube is the region between two adjacent flux surfaces, say at $\\psi$ and $\\psi + d\\psi$. The quantity $d\\psi$ is constant along the entire length of this flux tube.\n\nThe second hint is the \"geometric relation between spacing of neighboring poloidal flux surfaces and the magnetic field.\" The perpendicular distance, denoted $dl_n$, between two flux surfaces separated by $d\\psi$ at a major radius $R$ is given by:\n$$dl_n = \\frac{d\\psi}{R B_p}$$\nwhere $B_p$ is the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field at that location.\n\nThe flux expansion factor $f_X$ is defined as the ratio of areas at the target ($A'_t$) and upstream ($A'_u$). The area $A'$ is the \"cross-sectional area of a thin flux tube per unit toroidal angle\" on a surface \"orthogonal to the toroidal direction.\" A surface orthogonal to the toroidal direction is a poloidal plane (a plane of constant $\\phi$). The area of a cross-section within a toroidal wedge of $\\Delta\\phi = 1$ radian is given by the product of the arc length at radius $R$ (which is $R \\times 1 = R$) and the perpendicular width of the flux tube, $dl_n$.\nThus, the area per unit toroidal angle is:\n$$A' = R \\cdot dl_n$$\nSubstituting the geometric relation for $dl_n$ into this expression for area, we get:\n$$A' = R \\left( \\frac{d\\psi}{R B_p} \\right) = \\frac{d\\psi}{B_p}$$\nThis shows that the cross-sectional area of the flux tube per unit toroidal angle is inversely proportional to the local poloidal magnetic field strength.\n\nUsing the definition $f_X = A'_t / A'_u$, we can write:\n$$f_X = \\frac{A'_{t}}{A'_{u}} = \\frac{d\\psi / B_{p}^{t}}{d\\psi / B_{p}^{u}}$$\nSince $d\\psi$ is constant for the flux tube, it cancels out, yielding:\n$$f_X = \\frac{B_{p}^{u}}{B_{p}^{t}}$$\nThe problem provides expressions for the poloidal magnetic field at the upstream midplane ($B_{p}^{u} = B_{\\theta}^{u}$) and the divertor target ($B_{p}^{t} = B_{\\theta}^{t}$):\n$$B_{p}^{u} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi R_{u}}$$\n$$B_{p}^{t} = g \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi R_{t}}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f_X$ gives the requested analytical expression:\n$$f_X = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi R_{u}}}{g \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi R_{t}}}$$\nAs requested, this expression is in terms of $R_{u}$, $R_{t}$, $I_{p}$, $\\mu_{0}$, and $g$. Simplifying this expression by canceling the common factor $\\mu_{0} I_{p} / (2 \\pi)$ yields:\n$$f_X = \\frac{1/R_u}{g/R_t} = \\frac{R_t}{g R_u}$$\nThis simplified form shows that the flux expansion is a product of a geometric factor, $R_t/R_u$, and a magnetic shearing factor, $1/g$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $f_X$ using the given parameters: $R_u = 3.2$, $R_t = 5.6$, and $g = 0.30$. The values for $I_p$ and $\\mu_0$ are not necessary for the final calculation due to the cancellation.\n$$f_X = \\frac{5.6}{(0.30) \\times (3.2)} = \\frac{5.6}{0.96}$$\n$$f_X = 5.83333...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $5.833$.",

The parameter $T_{\\mathrm{det}}$ is given in electron-volts ($eV$), and the quantity $eT_{\\mathrm{det}}$ represents the corresponding energy in Joules.\nThe given values are:\n- $q_{u} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n- $L_{X} = 45 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $f_{z} = 0.010$\n- $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n- $\\gamma = 7.0$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{det}} = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- $m_{i} = 3.344 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the coefficients of the quadratic equation, which we denote as $A$, $B$, and $C_q$ (to avoid confusion with charge $e$ and speed of light $c$).\nThe coefficient of the $(n_{e}^{\\ast})^{2}$ term is $A = f_{z} \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} L_{X}$:\n$$A = (0.010) (1.0 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}) (45 \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 4.5 \\times 10^{-32} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{4}$$\nThe coefficient of the $n_{e}^{\\ast}$ term is $B = \\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{2(e T_{\\mathrm{det}})^{3}}{m_{i}}}$. First, we find the energy $eT_{\\mathrm{det}}$ in Joules:\n$$eT_{\\mathrm{det}} = (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (3.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}) = 4.8065299 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}$$\nNow we compute $B$:\n$$B = 7.0 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2(4.8065299 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J})^{3}}{3.344 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx 7.0 \\times \\sqrt{6.6377 \\times 10^{-29} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}^3}{\\mathrm{kg}}}$$\n$$B \\approx 7.0 \\times (8.1472 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{J^{3/2}kg^{-1/2}}) \\approx 5.703 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe constant term is $C_q = -q_u = -5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nWe now solve for $n_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{-B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC_q}}{2A}$:\n$$B^2 \\approx (5.703 \\times 10^{-14})^{2} \\approx 3.252 \\times 10^{-27}$$\n$$4AC_q = 4 (4.5 \\times 10^{-32}) (-5.0 \\times 10^{7}) = -9.0 \\times 10^{-24}$$\nSo, $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC_q} = \\sqrt{3.252 \\times 10^{-27} - (-9.0 \\times 10^{-24})} = \\sqrt{3.252 \\times 10^{-27} + 9.0 \\times 10^{-24}}$\n$$\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC_q} \\approx \\sqrt{9.003252 \\times 10^{-24}} \\approx 3.00054 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nNow, we compute $n_e^{\\ast}$:\n$$n_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{-5.703 \\times 10^{-14} + 3.00054 \\times 10^{-12}}{2 \\times (4.5 \\times 10^{-32})}$$\n$$n_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{2.94351 \\times 10^{-12}}{9.0 \\times 10^{-32}} \\approx 0.32706 \\times 10^{20} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n$$n_{e}^{\\ast} \\approx 3.2706 \\times 10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$n_{e}^{\\ast} \\approx 3.27 \\times 10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$",
