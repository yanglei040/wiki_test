The concepts of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, subcritical multiplication, and source-driven systems are central to the study of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) and fusion-fission hybrids. The scenario is physically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear and formal definition for the quantity $M$ to be derived. It provides all necessary numerical values to perform the requested calculation. The relationship between $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $S$, and the total neutron population is well-defined, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unbiased scientific terminology. It requests a derivation, a calculation, and a physically grounded explanation, all of which are objective tasks.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of M in terms of k_eff\nWe begin from first principles by tracking the neutron population over successive generations. The process starts with the injection of source neutrons, which then induce fission, creating subsequent generations of neutrons.\n\nLet $S$ be the rate of neutrons injected per second from the external fusion source. These are the \"zeroth generation\" neutrons.\nThe number of source neutrons per second is $N_0 = S$.\n\nThe effective neutron multiplication factor, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is defined as the ratio of the number of neutrons in one generation to the number of neutrons in the preceding generation.\nThe first generation of fission neutrons, $N_1$, is produced by the source neutrons. Their rate of production is:\n$$N_1 = S \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nThese $N_1$ neutrons, in turn, produce a second generation of fission neutrons, $N_2$, at a rate:\n$$N_2 = N_1 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (S \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}}) \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = S \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2$$\nThis process continues, with the rate of production of the $n$-th generation of fission neutrons being:\n$$N_n = S \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^n$$\nThe total rate of production of fission-induced neutrons, $R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$, is the sum over all infinite generations:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{fission}} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} N_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} S \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^n = S \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^n$$\nThis is a geometric series. Since the blanket is operated in a subcritical regime, we have $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}  1$. For $|k_{\\mathrm{eff}}|  1$, the sum of the infinite geometric series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} r^n$ converges to $\\frac{r}{1-r}$.\nThus, the total rate of fission neutron production is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{fission}} = S \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)$$\nThe problem defines the subcritical multiplication, $M$, as the ratio of the total neutron production rate in the blanket to the external source rate $S$. The total neutron production rate, $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is specified to include the externally injected neutrons ($S$) and all fission-induced generations ($R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$).\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = S + R_{\\mathrm{fission}} = S + S \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)$$\nFactoring out $S$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = S \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) = S \\left( \\frac{(1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}) + k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) = S \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)$$\nAccording to the problem's definition, $M = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{total}}}{S}$. Therefore:\n$$M = \\frac{S \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)}{S} = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $M$ in terms of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n### Evaluation of ΔM\nWe are asked to calculate the change $\\Delta M$ when $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases from $k_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = 0.92$ to $k_{\\mathrm{eff},2} = 0.95$.\nFirst, we calculate the initial multiplication, $M_1$, corresponding to $k_{\\mathrm{eff},1}$:\n$$M_1 = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.92} = \\frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5$$\nNext, we calculate the final multiplication, $M_2$, corresponding to $k_{\\mathrm{eff},2}$:\n$$M_2 = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff},2}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20$$\nThe change $\\Delta M$ is the difference between $M_2$ and $M_1$:\n$$\\Delta M = M_2 - M_1 = 20 - 12.5 = 7.5$$\n\n### Effect on Required Source Power\nThe fission power generated in the blanket, $P_{\\mathrm{fission}}$, is directly proportional to the total rate of fission events occurring per unit time. The rate of fission events is, in turn, directly proportional to the rate of production of fission neutrons, $R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{fission}} \\propto R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$$\nFrom our derivation, we have the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{fission}} = S \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)$$\nWe can express the term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ in terms of $M$:\n$$M = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\implies M-1 = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{fission}}$ gives:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{fission}} = S(M-1)$$\nThus, the fission power is proportional to the product of the source rate and $(M-1)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{fission}} \\propto S(M-1)$$\nIf the fission power $P_{\\mathrm{fission}}$ is to be held constant, then the product $S(M-1)$ must also be constant.\n$$S(M-1) = \\text{constant}$$\nThis implies an inverse proportionality between the required source rate $S$ and the factor $(M-1)$:\n$$S \\propto \\frac{1}{M-1}$$\nAn increase in the subcritical multiplication $M$ (which is caused by an increase in $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) means the term $(M-1)$ increases. Consequently, to maintain a fixed fission power, the required external source rate $S$ must decrease. This demonstrates a fundamental benefit of a high-multiplication blanket: it reduces the demand on the external neutron source (the fusion driver) for a given power output.",

For a control volume encompassing the coolant path through the blanket, the energy balance is:\n$$\\frac{dE_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CV} - \\dot{W}_{CV} + \\sum_{in} \\dot{m}_{in}(h + \\frac{1}{2}v^{2} + gz)_{in} - \\sum_{out} \\dot{m}_{out}(h + \\frac{1}{2}v^{2} + gz)_{out}$$\nUnder the given problem conditions (steady state, single inlet/outlet, no work, negligible kinetic and potential energy changes), this simplifies to:\n$$0 = \\dot{Q} - \\dot{m}(h_{out} - h_{in})$$\nHere, $\\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transferred to the coolant, which equals the total power generated. The change in specific enthalpy for a fluid with constant isobaric specific heat $c_{p}$ is $\\Delta h = h_{out} - h_{in} = c_{p}(T_{out} - T_{in}) = c_{p}\\Delta T$.\nTherefore, the energy balance becomes:\n$$\\dot{Q} = \\dot{m} c_{p} \\Delta T$$\nSolving for the mass flow rate, we obtain the general formula:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{c_{p} \\Delta T}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to each coolant.\n\n**Helium (He):**\nThe isobaric specific heat for helium, treated as a monatomic ideal gas, is:\n$$c_{p,\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{5}{2} R_{s} = \\frac{5}{2} (2077\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) = 5192.5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe required mass flow rate is:\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{c_{p,\\mathrm{He}} \\Delta T} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{8} \\pi\\,\\mathrm{W}}{(5192.5\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) (60\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 3630\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\n**Lead-Lithium (Pb-17Li):**\nThe isobaric specific heat is given as $c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}} = 160\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nThe required mass flow rate is:\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{PbLi}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}} \\Delta T} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{8} \\pi\\,\\mathrm{W}}{(160\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) (60\\,\\mathrm{K})} = 37500\\pi\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 1.178 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nThe intermediate mass flow rates are $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{He}} \\approx 3630\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{PbLi}} \\approx 1.178 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n**2) Volumetric Flow Rate Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ is related to the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ by $\\dot{V} = \\dot{m}/\\rho$. The dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{He}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{He}}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}}}{\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for mass flow rate, $\\dot{m} = \\dot{Q}/(c_{p}\\Delta T)$:\n$$R = \\frac{(\\dot{Q}/(c_{p,\\mathrm{He}}\\Delta T))/\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}}}{(\\dot{Q}/(c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}}\\Delta T))/\\rho_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}}$$\nThe terms $\\dot{Q}$ and $\\Delta T$ cancel, yielding a simplified expression dependent only on the coolant thermophysical properties:\n$$R = \\frac{c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}}{c_{p,\\mathrm{He}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}}}$$\nWe need to evaluate the denominator product $c_{p,\\mathrm{He}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}}$. First, we find the density of helium $\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}}$ using the provided model. The mean coolant temperature is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{m,He}} = T_{\\mathrm{in,He}} + \\frac{\\Delta T}{2} = 600\\,\\mathrm{K} + \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{K}}{2} = 630\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe helium density is calculated using the ideal gas law with the given pressure $p = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{p}{R_{s} T_{\\mathrm{m,He}}}$$\nSubstituting this and the expression for $c_{p,\\mathrm{He}}$ into the denominator product:\n$$c_{p,\\mathrm{He}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{2} R_{s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p}{R_{s} T_{\\mathrm{m,He}}}\\right) = \\frac{5p}{2T_{\\mathrm{m,He}}}$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}}{5p/(2T_{\\mathrm{m,He}})} = \\frac{2 T_{\\mathrm{m,He}} c_{p,\\mathrm{PbLi}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{PbLi}}}{5p}$$\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$R = \\frac{2 (630\\,\\mathrm{K}) (160\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) (9300\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})}{5 (8.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}$$\n$$R = \\frac{1874880000}{40000000} = 46.872$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final ratio is $46.9$.

The analysis involves deriving the governing differential equations, calculating steady-state inventories, simulating transient scenarios, and performing a stability analysis. The entire process will be conducted based on the principle of conservation of mass and first-order linear kinetics.\n\n**1. Formulation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe time evolution of the tritium inventory in each compartment is governed by the conservation of mass, expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_i}{dt} = \\sum (\\text{Inflows}) - \\sum (\\text{Outflows})\n$$\nfor each compartment $i$. The inventories are denoted by $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$ for the breeding blanket, $X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$ for the processing loop, and $X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)$ for the storage unit. All transfer and leakage processes are modeled as first-order kinetics, meaning the rate of transfer is proportional to the inventory in the source compartment. Tritium also undergoes radioactive decay with a constant rate $\\lambda$ in all compartments.\n\nThe individual ODEs are constructed as follows:\n\n*   **Breeding Blanket, $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$:**\n    *   Inflow: Tritium generation at a source rate $S(t)$.\n    *   Outflows: Transfer to the processing loop at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{BP}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$, leakage at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{BL}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$, and radioactive decay at a rate $\\lambda X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$.\n    *   The resulting ODE is:\n        $$\n        \\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{B}}}{dt} = S(t) - k_{\\mathrm{BP}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{BL}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) - \\lambda X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) = S(t) - (k_{\\mathrm{BP}} + k_{\\mathrm{BL}} + \\lambda)X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)\n        $$\n\n*   **Processing Loop, $X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$:**\n    *   Inflow: Transfer from the breeding blanket at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{BP}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$.\n    *   Outflows: Transfer to storage at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{PS}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$, leakage at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{PL}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$, and radioactive decay at a rate $\\lambda X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n    *   The resulting ODE is:\n        $$\n        \\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{BP}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{PS}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{PL}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) - \\lambda X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{BP}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) - (k_{\\mathrm{PS}} + k_{\\mathrm{PL}} + \\lambda)X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)\n        $$\n\n*   **Storage/Consumption, $X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)$:**\n    *   Inflow: Transfer from the processing loop at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{PS}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t)$.\n    *   Outflows: Removal for use or detritiation at a rate $k_{\\mathrm{Sout}}X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)$, and radioactive decay at a rate $\\lambda X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)$.\n    *   The resulting ODE is:\n        $$\n        \\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{S}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{PS}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{Sout}}X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) - \\lambda X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{PS}}X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) - (k_{\\mathrm{Sout}} + \\lambda)X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)\n        $$\n\nThis system of linear first-order ODEs can be written in matrix form as $\\frac{d\\vec{X}}{dt} = A\\vec{X} + \\vec{s}(t)$, where:\n$$\n\\vec{X}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) \\\\ X_{\\mathrm{P}}(t) \\\\ X_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\vec{s}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} S(t) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand the system matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-(k_{\\mathrm{BP}} + k_{\\mathrm{BL}} + \\lambda)  0  0 \\\\\nk_{\\mathrm{BP}}  -(k_{\\mathrm{PS}} + k_{\\mathrm{PL}} + \\lambda)  0 \\\\\n0  k_{\\mathrm{PS}}  -(k_{\\mathrm{Sout}} + \\lambda)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor conciseness, we define the total removal rate constants for each compartment:\n$\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}} = k_{\\mathrm{BP}} + k_{\\mathrm{BL}} + \\lambda$\n$\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{P}} = k_{\\mathrm{PS}} + k_{\\mathrm{PL}} + \\lambda$\n$\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{S}} = k_{\\mathrm{Sout}} + \\lambda$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Tritium Decay Constant $\\lambda$**\n\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is related to the half-life $T_{1/2}$ by $\\lambda = \\ln(2)/T_{1/2}$. We must convert the given half-life into SI units (seconds).\nGiven: $T_{1/2} = 12.32$ years, $1$ year $= 365.25$ days, $1$ day $= 24$ hours, $1$ hour $= 3600$ seconds.\n$$\nT_{1/2} = 12.32 \\, \\text{years} \\times 365.25 \\, \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{year}} \\times 24 \\, \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{day}} \\times 3600 \\, \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{hour}} = 388,799,672 \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nThe decay constant is then:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{388,799,672 \\, \\text{s}} \\approx 1.782793 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**3. Scenario A: Steady-State Analysis**\n\nAt steady state, the inventories are constant, so $\\frac{d\\vec{X}}{dt} = \\vec{0}$. The system of ODEs becomes a system of linear algebraic equations: $A\\vec{X}^{\\ast} = -\\vec{s}_0$, where $\\vec{X}^{\\ast}$ is the vector of steady-state inventories and $\\vec{s}_0 = (S_0, 0, 0)^T$ with $S_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{mol/s}$.\nThe equations are:\n1.  $-\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}} X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast} + S_0 = 0 \\implies X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{S_0}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}}}$\n2.  $k_{\\mathrm{BP}} X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast} - \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{P}} X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{BP}}}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}} X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}$\n3.  $k_{\\mathrm{PS}} X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} - \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{S}} X_{\\mathrm{S}}^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies X_{\\mathrm{S}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{PS}}}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{S}}} X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$\nThese equations are solved sequentially using the provided constant parameters to find the numerical values of $X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}$, $X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$, and $X_{\\mathrm{S}}^{\\ast}$. The final result for this scenario is the total steady-state inventory, $X_{\\text{total}}^{\\ast} = X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast} + X_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} + X_{\\mathrm{S}}^{\\ast}$.\n\n**4. Scenario B: Transient Response to a Step Increase in Source**\n\nThis scenario describes an initial value problem (IVP). The initial condition is the steady-state inventory vector $\\vec{X}(0) = \\vec{X}^{\\ast}$ computed in Scenario A. At $t=0$, the source term changes to $S(t) = S_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{mol/s}$. The governing equation is $\\frac{d\\vec{X}}{dt} = A\\vec{X} + \\vec{s}_1$, where $\\vec{s}_1 = (S_1, 0, 0)^T$. This system of ODEs is integrated numerically from $t=0$ to $t=10000 \\, \\text{s}$. The required output is the breeder inventory at the end of the simulation, $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(10000 \\, \\text{s})$. We will use a numerical ODE solver, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, for this purpose.\n\n**5. Scenario C: Transient Response to a Temporary Processing Slowdown**\n\nThis is another IVP, starting from the same initial condition $\\vec{X}(0) = \\vec{X}^{\\ast}$. The source term is constant at $S_0$, but the system matrix $A(t)$ becomes time-dependent due to the piecewise-constant nature of $k_{\\mathrm{BP}}(t)$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{BP}}(t) = \\begin{cases} 0.5 \\times k_{\\mathrm{BP}}  \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le 5000 \\, \\text{s} \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{BP}}  \\text{for } t  5000 \\, \\text{s} \\end{cases}\n$$\nWe need to find the maximum value of the breeder inventory, $\\max_{0 \\le t \\le 20000\\ \\mathrm{s}} X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$. Let's analyze the dynamics of $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$. The equation for $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$ is decoupled from the others: $\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{B}}}{dt} = S_0 - \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}}(t) X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 5000 \\, \\text{s}]$, the removal rate constant $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is smaller than its initial steady-state value. The new equilibrium value for $X_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is higher than the initial $X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}$. Therefore, $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$ will increase monotonically during this interval.\nAt $t = 5000 \\, \\text{s}$, $k_{\\mathrm{BP}}$ reverts to its original, higher value. The removal rate constant $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}}$ increases, and the equilibrium value for $X_{\\mathrm{B}}$ drops back to the original $X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}$. Since $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(5000 \\, \\text{s})$ will be greater than $X_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\ast}$, $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$ will decrease for $t  5000 \\, \\text{s}$.\nConsequently, the maximum value of $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(t)$ over the entire interval occurs precisely at $t = 5000 \\, \\text{s}$. The problem reduces to integrating the system from $t=0$ to $t=5000 \\, \\text{s}$ with the reduced $k_{\\mathrm{BP}}$, and reporting the value $X_{\\mathrm{B}}(5000 \\, \\text{s})$.\n\n**6. Scenario D: Stability Edge Case**\n\nThis scenario requires a stability analysis of the homogeneous system ($\\frac{d\\vec{X}}{dt} = A\\vec{X}$) with a modified parameter set ($S(t)=0$, $k_{\\mathrm{BP}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). The stability of a linear time-invariant system is determined by the eigenvalues of its system matrix $A$. The system is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts. The question asks for the largest real part among the eigenvalues.\nThe matrix $A$ is lower triangular:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}}  0  0 \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{BP}}  -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}  0 \\\\ 0  k_{\\mathrm{PS}}  -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{S}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries. Therefore, the eigenvalues are:\n$\\lambda_1 = -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{B}} = -(k_{\\mathrm{BP}} + k_{\\mathrm{BL}} + \\lambda)$\n$\\lambda_2 = -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{P}} = -(k_{\\mathrm{PS}} + k_{\\mathrm{PL}} + \\lambda)$\n$\\lambda_3 = -\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{S}} = -(k_{\\mathrm{Sout}} + \\lambda)$\nSince all rate constants are non-negative, all eigenvalues are real and non-positive. The largest real part is the largest (i.e., least negative) of these three values. We will compute these values using the parameters specified for this scenario and find the maximum.\n\nThe numerical implementation will follow these analytical steps, using `numpy` for vector/matrix operations and eigenvalue computation, and `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for solving the initial value problems.",
