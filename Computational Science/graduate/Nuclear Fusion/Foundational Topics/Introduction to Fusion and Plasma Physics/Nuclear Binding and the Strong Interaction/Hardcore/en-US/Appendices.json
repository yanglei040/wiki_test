            "problem": "In the framework of nuclear forces relevant to nuclear fusion, consider nucleon–nucleon interactions mediated by exchange of the lightest hadronic excitations. Starting from the relativistic Green’s function of a massive field in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and using the large-distance asymptotics of the static limit, derive the parametric dependence of the interaction’s characteristic range in terms of the mediator mass. Then, restore explicit factors of the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ to obtain a length scale.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the Yukawa theory of nuclear forces, a standard topic in nuclear and particle physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and constants to derive a unique numerical answer. The language is objective and precise, and the setup is internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to derive the characteristic range of the nucleon-nucleon interaction mediated by a massive particle, specifically the pion, and then to calculate this range numerically. The starting point is the relativistic Green's function for a massive field in the static limit.\n\nIn Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the interaction between two particles can be described by the exchange of a virtual force-carrier particle. For the nuclear force, the lightest such mediators are mesons. The simplest model involves the exchange of a massive, spin-$0$ particle (a scalar field), such as a pion. The dynamics of a free, massive scalar field $\\phi$ are described by the Klein-Gordon equation. In the presence of a source $J(x)$, this equation is:\n$$(\\Box + m^2)\\phi(x) = J(x)$$\nHere, we work in natural units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to $1$. In these units, mass $m$ has dimensions of inverse length. $\\Box = \\partial^\\mu \\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2$ is the d'Alembert operator. The source $J(x)$ represents a nucleon.\n\nThe interaction potential between two static nucleons is found by solving for the field $\\phi$ generated by one nucleon and then calculating the energy of the second nucleon in this field. For a static, point-like nucleon source located at the origin, the source term is time-independent and localized: $J(x) = g \\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $g$ is the coupling constant. In the static limit, all time derivatives vanish ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), and the Klein-Gordon equation reduces to a modified Poisson equation:\n$$(-\\nabla^2 + m^2)\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = g\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{x})$$\nThis equation describes the static field, which is equivalent to the interaction potential $V(\\mathbf{x})$, up to a coupling constant factor. To solve for $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$, we use the method of Fourier transforms. Let $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ and its Fourier transform $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{q})$ be related by:\n$$\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\int \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{q}) e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$$\nApplying the operator $(-\\nabla^2 + m^2)$ to this integral yields:\n$$(-\\nabla^2 + m^2)\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\int \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3} (|\\mathbf{q}|^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{q}) e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$$\nThe Fourier transform of the source term is:\n$$g\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{x}) = g \\int \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3} (1) e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$$\nBy equating the integrands, we find the Fourier-space solution:\n$$(|\\mathbf{q}|^2 + m^2)\\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{q}) = g \\implies \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{g}{|\\mathbf{q}|^2 + m^2}$$\nTo find the potential in position space, we perform the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\int \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{g}{|\\mathbf{q}|^2 + m^2} e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$$\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the integrand in $\\mathbf{q}$-space (for the denominator) we can orient our coordinate system such that $\\mathbf{x}$ lies along the $z$-axis. Let $r = |\\mathbf{x}|$. Then $\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} = qr\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle of $\\mathbf{q}$. We evaluate the integral in spherical coordinates ($d^3q = q^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dq\\,d\\theta\\,d\\phi$):\n$$\\phi(r) = \\frac{g}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_0^\\infty dq \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\frac{q^2 \\sin\\theta}{q^2 + m^2} e^{iqr\\cos\\theta}$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ gives a factor of $2\\pi$. The integral over $\\theta$ can be evaluated by substituting $u = \\cos\\theta$, $du = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta$:\n$$\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta e^{iqr\\cos\\theta} d\\theta = \\int_{-1}^1 e^{iqru} du = \\left[ \\frac{e^{iqru}}{iqr} \\right]_{-1}^1 = \\frac{e^{iqr} - e^{-iqr}}{iqr} = \\frac{2\\sin(qr)}{qr}$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\\phi(r) = \\frac{g}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_0^\\infty dq \\frac{q^2}{q^2+m^2} \\frac{2\\sin(qr)}{qr} = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2 r} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{q\\sin(qr)}{q^2+m^2} dq$$\nThe remaining integral can be solved using complex analysis and Cauchy's residue theorem, and has a standard result:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{k\\sin(ax)}{k^2+b^2} dk = \\frac{\\pi}{2} e^{-ab}$$\nWith $k=q$, $a=r$, and $b=m$, we have:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{q\\sin(qr)}{q^2+m^2} dq = \\frac{\\pi}{2} e^{-mr}$$\nFinally, substituting this into the expression for $\\phi(r)$:\n$$\\phi(r) = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2 r} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} e^{-mr}\\right) = g\\frac{e^{-mr}}{4\\pi r}$$\nThe potential energy of a second nucleon (with coupling strength $-g$, by convention for an attractive force) in this field is $V(r) = -g \\phi(r) = -g^2 \\frac{e^{-mr}}{4\\pi r}$. This is the Yukawa potential.\n\nThe term $e^{-mr}$ is an exponential damping factor. The characteristic range of the interaction, $R$, is the distance over which the potential's strength falls by a factor of $e^{-1}$. This occurs when the argument of the exponential is unity:\n$$m R = 1 \\implies R = \\frac{1}{m}$$\nThis derivation was in natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$). To restore the physical constants, we must construct a quantity with units of length from the mediator mass $m$, $\\hbar$, and $c$. The quantity $mc^2$ has units of energy. The quantity $\\hbar c$ has units of energy $\\times$ length. To obtain a length, we must take the ratio:\n$$R = \\frac{\\hbar c}{m c^2}$$\nThis is the reduced Compton wavelength of the mediator particle.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of this range for a charged pion mediator with mass $m_{\\pi} = 140\\ \\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$. This implies the rest energy is $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 140\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$. We are given the constant $\\hbar c = 197.3269804\\ \\mathrm{MeV\\,fm}$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R = \\frac{197.3269804\\ \\mathrm{MeV\\,fm}}{140\\ \\mathrm{MeV}} = 1.40947843... \\ \\mathrm{fm}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the range is $R=1.409\\ \\mathrm{fm}$.\n\nFor context, we compare this range to typical nuclear radii, calculated using the empirical formula $R_{A} = r_0 A^{1/3}$ with $r_0 = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{fm}$.\nFor a medium-mass nucleus with $A=56$: $R_{56} = (1.2\\ \\mathrm{fm})(56)^{1/3} \\approx (1.2)(3.826)\\ \\mathrm{fm} \\approx 4.59\\ \\mathrm{fm}$.\nFor a heavy nucleus with $A=208$: $R_{208} = (1.2\\ \\mathrm{fm})(208)^{1/3} \\approx (1.2)(5.925)\\ \\mathrm{fm} \\approx 7.11\\ \\mathrm{fm}$.\nThe interaction range $R \\approx 1.4\\ \\mathrm{fm}$ is smaller than the radii of medium and heavy nuclei.\n\nThis short range is the fundamental\nreason for the saturation of nuclear binding energy. Saturation refers to the experimental observation that for nuclei with $A \\gtrsim 20$, the binding energy per nucleon, $B/A$, is approximately constant at about $8\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$. If the nuclear force were long-range (like electromagnetism or gravity), every nucleon would interact with every other nucleon. The total binding energy would scale with the number of pairs, $A(A-1)/2 \\approx A^2/2$, and the binding energy per nucleon $B/A$ would grow linearly with $A$. This is not observed.\nBecause the force is short-ranged, a nucleon inside the nucleus only interacts strongly with its immediate neighbors within a distance of approximately $R$. The number of these neighbors is limited and does not depend on the total size of the nucleus (for large $A$). Consequently, each added nucleon contributes a roughly constant amount to the total binding energy, making the total binding energy $B$ approximately proportional to $A$. This leads to a nearly constant binding energy per nucleon, $B/A$, which is the defining characteristic of saturation.\nThe final numerical answer required is the calculated range of the interaction.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe quantum state of the system is a direct product of its spatial and spin parts. The spatial part for an $L=0$ state is spherically symmetric. Let the total state be denoted by $|\\Psi\\rangle$.\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = |R_{L=0}\\rangle |Y_{00}\\rangle \\otimes |\\chi_{S=1, M_S}\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $|R_{L=0}\\rangle$ represents the radial part of the wavefunction, $|Y_{00}\\rangle$ is the angular part corresponding to $L=0$, and $|\\chi_{S=1, M_S}\\rangle$ is the spin-triplet state.

The expectation value involves an integration over spatial coordinates (including the solid angle $d\\Omega$) and a sum over spin degrees of freedom.\n\nFor the first term, we expand the dot products in Cartesian coordinates.

It is a constant, reflecting the spherical symmetry (isotropy) of the $L=0$ state.\n$$\n\\langle Y_{00} | \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j | Y_{00} \\rangle = \\int d\\Omega \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}}\\right) \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int d\\Omega \\, \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j\n$$\nAs per the prompt, we must evaluate this integral from first principles. Let $I_{ij} = \\int d\\Omega \\, \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j$. This is a rank-$2$ tensor. Since the integration is over the entire unit sphere, which is invariant under any rotation, the resulting tensor $I_{ij}$ must also be invariant under rotations. The only rank-$2$ tensor that is isotropic (invariant under all rotations) is a scalar multiple of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\nI_{ij} = C \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nfor some constant $C$. To determine $C$, we take the trace of both sides (i.e., contract with $\\delta_{ij}$):\n$$\n\\sum_i I_{ii} = \\sum_i C \\delta_{ii} = C (1+1+1) = 3C\n$$\nThe trace can also be calculated by summing over the diagonal elements of the integrand first:\n$$\n\\sum_i I_{ii} = \\int d\\Omega \\sum_i \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_i = \\int d\\Omega (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\n$$\nSince $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is a unit vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = |\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 = 1$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_i I_{ii} = \\int d\\Omega \\, (1) = 4\\pi\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the trace gives $3C = 4\\pi$, so $C = 4\\pi/3$. Thus, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int d\\Omega \\, \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the spatial expectation value:\n$$\n\\langle Y_{00} | \\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j | Y_{00} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\delta_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nNow, we return to the first term of $\\langle S_{12} \\rangle$.\n$$\n3 \\langle (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\rangle = 3 \\sum_{i,j} \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\sigma_{1i} \\sigma_{2j} | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\delta_{ij}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\sum_{i,j} \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\sigma_{1i} \\sigma_{2j} | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle \\delta_{ij} = \\sum_i \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\sigma_{1i} \\sigma_{2i} | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle\n$$\nThis sum is simply the definition of the dot product $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$.\n$$\n= \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle\n$$\nNow we evaluate the second term in the expression for $\\langle S_{12} \\rangle$:\n$$\n- \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 \\rangle = - \\langle \\Psi | \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 | \\Psi \\rangle\n$$\nThe operator $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$ acts only on the spin part of the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$. The spatial part of the expectation value is simply $\\langle R_{L=0} Y_{00} | R_{L=0} Y_{00} \\rangle = 1$. Therefore,\n$$\n- \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 \\rangle = - \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle\n$$\nCombining the results for the two terms:\n$$\n\\langle S_{12} \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle - \\langle \\chi_{S=1, M_S} | \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 | \\chi_{S=1, M_S} \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThe expectation value of the tensor operator in a pure S-wave ($L=0$) state is identically zero. This is a direct consequence of the spherical symmetry of the S-wave state. The spatial averaging over all directions effectively \"washes out\" the directional dependence of the $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})$ term, reducing it to a term proportional to $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$ which then cancels the second part of the operator.\n\nThis result is highly significant. The tensor force, described by $V(r)S_{12}$, is known to be a crucial component of the interaction that binds the proton and neutron into a deuteron. The fact that its expectation value is zero for a pure S-wave state implies that this state cannot be the true ground state of the deuteron. If it were, the tensor force would make no contribution to the deuteron's binding energy. Furthermore, a pure S-wave state is spherically symmetric and would have a zero electric quadrupole moment, in contradiction to the experimentally measured non-zero value for the deuteron.\n\nThe resolution lies in the fact that the tensor operator $S_{12}$ can mix states of different orbital angular momentum. Specifically, the tensor operator is a rank-$2$ tensor operator in coordinate space, which means it has non-zero matrix elements between states $|L, M_L\\rangle$ and $|L', M_{L'}\\rangle$ where $|L-L'| \\le 2$. Thus, it can connect the $L=0$ state to an $L=2$ (D-wave) state. The true deuteron ground state is a superposition (admixture) of S- and D-waves:\n$$\n|\\Psi_d\\rangle = c_S |L=0, S=1; J=1\\rangle + c_D |L=2, S=1; J=1\\rangle\n$$\nWith this mixed state, the expectation value $\\langle\\Psi_d| S_{12} |\\Psi_d\\rangle$ will contain off-diagonal terms of the form $2c_S c_D \\text{Re}(\\langle L=0 | S_{12} | L=2 \\rangle)$, which are non-zero. This provides the necessary contribution from the tensor force to the binding energy and explains the non-zero quadrupole moment. The calculation aformentioned thus rigorously motivates the necessity of this D-wave admixture.\n\nThe final numerical answer for the expectation value in the specified pure $L=0$ state is $0$.",

Use $\\hbar c = 197.3269804 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$.\n- Define the central and tensor potentials by\n  - $V_c(r) = -V_0 \\exp\\left(-(r/r_0)^2\\right)$ in $\\mathrm{MeV}$,\n  - $V_T(r) = V_{T0} \\, \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-(r/r_c)^6\\right)\\right]^2 \\, \\frac{e^{-m r}}{r^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{m r} + \\frac{3}{(m r)^2}\\right)$ in $\\mathrm{MeV}$,\n  where $r$ is in $\\mathrm{fm}$, $V_0$ is in $\\mathrm{MeV}$, $r_0$ and $r_c$ are in $\\mathrm{fm}$, $m$ is an inverse range in $\\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$, and $V_{T0}$ is in $\\mathrm{MeV \\cdot fm^3}$ so that $V_T(r)$ has units of $\\mathrm{MeV}$. The regulator $\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-(r/r_c)^6\\right)\\right]^2$ ensures finiteness at $r \\to 0$.\n- Let the reduced radial wave functions be normalized as $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(u(r)^2 + w(r)^2\\right) \\, dr = 1$. The ${}^3D_1$ probability is $P_D = \\int_0^\\infty w(r)^2 \\, dr$. Compute $P_D$ (dimensionless) for each parameter set below. Report $P_D$ values rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Use the following numerical constants and units consistently: all energies in $\\mathrm{MeV}$, lengths in $\\mathrm{fm}$, and angles are not required; if any are used internally, they must be in radians.\n\nUse a stable, high-accuracy method suitable for second-order linear coupled ordinary differential equations; for example, the matrix Numerov method applied to $y''(r) = K(r) y(r)$ with $y(r) = \\begin{bmatrix} u(r) \\\\ w(r) \\end{bmatrix}$, where $K(r)$ is a symmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrix constructed from the potentials, energy, and centrifugal term.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $V_0 = 72.0$, $r_0 = 1.6$, $V_{T0} = 6.0$, $m = 0.7$, $r_c = 0.5$.\n- Case $2$: $V_0 = 72.0$, $r_0 = 1.6$, $V_{T0} = 3.0$, $m = 0.7$, $r_c = 0.5$.\n- Case $3$: $V_0 = 72.0$, $r_0 = 1.6$, $V_{T0} = 9.0$, $m = 0.7$, $r_c = 0.5$.\n- Case $4$: $V_0 = 60.0$, $r_0 = 1.8$, $V_{T0} = 6.0$, $m = 0.7$, $r_c = 0.5$.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements and boundary conditions:\n- Use a grid from $r = h$ to $r = r_{\\max}$ with $h = 0.02$ $\\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_{\\max} = 25$ $\\mathrm{fm}$. Near $r=0$, enforce regular behavior $u(r) \\sim r$ and $w(r) \\sim r^3$ to initialize the integration. You may start at $r=h$ with $u(h) = h$, $u(2h) = 2h$, and $w(h) = 0$, $w(2h) = 0$; the coupling will dynamically generate $w(r)$.\n- Construct $K(r)$ from the derived coupled equations using $\\alpha = \\frac{2 \\mu}{(\\hbar c)^2}$:\n  - $K_{11}(r) = \\alpha \\left(V_c(r) - E\\right)$,\n  - $K_{22}(r) = \\alpha \\left(V_c(r) - 2 V_T(r) - E\\right) + \\frac{6}{r^2}$,\n  - $K_{12}(r) = K_{21}(r) = \\alpha \\sqrt{8} \\, V_T(r)$.\n- Normalize $u(r)$ and $w(r)$ on $[0,r_{\\max}]$ by dividing by $\\sqrt{\\int_0^{r_{\\max}} \\left(u(r)^2 + w(r)^2\\right) \\, dr}$, and approximate the integrals by a convergent quadrature such as the trapezoidal rule. With $r_{\\max} = 25$ $\\mathrm{fm}$ and $B = 2.224575 \\text{ MeV}$, the neglected tail beyond $r_{\\max}$ is exponentially small and may be safely ignored in $P_D$ at the requested precision.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[0.045321,0.023456,0.081234,0.052198]\"). The four entries correspond in order to Cases $1$ through $4$, and each entry is $P_D$ as a decimal rounded to $6$ decimal places, with no physical unit since $P_D$ is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It represents a standard problem in computational nuclear physics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Coupled Radial Equations\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the two-nucleon system in the center-of-mass frame:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 \\mu} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $\\mu = \\frac{m_p m_n}{m_p + m_n}$ is the reduced mass, $E = -B$ is the bound state energy, and the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{r}) = V_c(r) + V_T(r) S_{12}\n$$\nHere, $V_c(r)$ is a central potential, $V_T(r)$ is the radial part of the tensor potential, and $S_{12}$ is the tensor operator:\n$$\nS_{12} = 3 (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$ are the Pauli spin matrices for the two nucleons, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{r}/r$.\n\nWe are interested in the deuteron ground state, which is a spin-triplet ($S=1$) state with total angular momentum $J=1$ and positive parity. Due to the properties of the tensor operator, it can mix states of different orbital angular momentum $L$. For $J=1$ and $S=1$, the triangle inequality $|\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}|$ allows for $L=0, 1, 2$. Parity conservation requires $L$ to be even (since the intrinsic parity is positive), so the state is a superposition of the $L=0$ (${}^3S_1$) and $L=2$ (${}^3D_1$) partial waves.\n\nThe total wave function $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is expressed as a superposition of these two channels. The spatial part is separated into radial and angular components:\n$$\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{u(r)}{r} \\mathcal{Y}_{J=1, L=0, S=1}^{M_J}(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) + \\frac{w(r)}{r} \\mathcal{Y}_{J=1, L=2, S=1}^{M_J}(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\n$$\nwhere $u(r)$ and $w(r)$ are the reduced radial wave functions for the ${}^3S_1$ and ${}^3D_1$ states, respectively. The functions $\\mathcal{Y}_{JLS}^{M_J}$ are vector spherical harmonics, which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of $J^2$, $L^2$, $S^2$, and $J_z$.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation, we operate with the kinetic and potential energy terms. The Laplacian in spherical coordinates is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) - \\frac{\\mathbf{L}^2}{\\hbar^2 r^2}$. Its action on a term of the form $\\frac{f(r)}{r} Y_{LM}$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\nabla^2 \\left( \\frac{f(r)}{r} \\mathcal{Y}_{JLS}^{M_J} \\right) = \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 L(L+1)}{2\\mu r^2} \\right) \\frac{f(r)}{r} \\mathcal{Y}_{JLS}^{M_J}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\hbar^2 L(L+1)}{2\\mu r^2}$ is the centrifugal potential. For the $L=0$ ($S$-wave) component, this term vanishes. For the $L=2$ ($D$-wave) component, $L(L+1)=6$, giving a centrifugal term of $\\frac{6\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2}$.\n\nThe potential operator $V(\\mathbf{r})$ acts on the wave function. To obtain coupled equations for $u(r)$ and $w(r)$, we project the full Schrödinger equation onto the two basis states, $\\mathcal{Y}_{101}^{M_J}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}_{121}^{M_J}$, by taking the inner product (integrating over the solid angle $d\\Omega$). This requires evaluating the matrix elements of the tensor operator $S_{12}$ between the basis states. The tensor operator $S_{12}$ is a scalar, meaning it does not change $J$ or $M_J$. It is also constructed from spin operators and does not change the total spin $S$. The only change it can induce is in the orbital angular momentum $L$. The matrix elements $\\langle J'L'S'|S_{12}|JLS \\rangle$ are non-zero only for $J'=J$, $S'=S$, and $|L-L'| \\le 2$. Using angular momentum coupling techniques (specifically the Wigner-Eckart theorem), the required matrix elements for the $J=1, S=1$ system are found to be:\n$$\n\\langle {}^3S_1 | S_{12} | {}^3S_1 \\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle {}^3D_1 | S_{12} | {}^3D_1 \\rangle = -2\n$$\n$$\n\\langle {}^3S_1 | S_{12} | {}^3D_1 \\rangle = \\langle {}^3D_1 | S_{12} | {}^3S_1 \\rangle = \\sqrt{8}\n$$\nProjecting the Schrödinger equation onto $\\langle {}^3S_1 |$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} u''(r) + V_c(r) u(r) + V_T(r) \\langle {}^3S_1|S_{12}|{}^3S_1 \\rangle u(r) + V_T(r) \\langle {}^3S_1|S_{12}|{}^3D_1 \\rangle w(r) = E u(r)\n$$\nSubstituting the matrix elements gives the first coupled equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} u''(r) + V_c(r) u(r) + \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) w(r) = E u(r)\n$$\nProjecting onto $\\langle {}^3D_1 |$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} w''(r) + \\frac{6\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2} w(r) + V_c(r) w(r) + V_T(r) \\langle {}^3D_1|S_{12}|{}^3S_1 \\rangle u(r) + V_T(r) \\langle {}^3D_1|S_{12}|{}^3D_1 \\rangle w(r) = E w(r)\n$$\nSubstituting the matrix elements gives the second coupled equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} w''(r) + \\frac{6\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2} w(r) + V_c(r) w(r) + \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) u(r) - 2 V_T(r) w(r) = E w(r)\n$$\nWe rearrange these equations to isolate the second derivatives, $u''(r)$ and $w''(r)$. Let's define the constant $\\alpha = \\frac{2\\mu}{(\\hbar c)^2} = \\frac{2\\mu c^2}{(\\hbar c)^2}$ to work with energies in $\\mathrm{MeV}$ and lengths in $\\mathrm{fm}$.\nFrom the first equation:\n$$\nu''(r) = \\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2} (V_c(r) - E) u(r) + \\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2} \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) w(r)\n$$\n$$\nu''(r) = \\alpha (V_c(r) - E) u(r) + \\alpha \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) w(r)\n$$\nFrom the second equation, gathering terms multiplying $w(r)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} w''(r) = -\\left(\\frac{6\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2} + V_c(r) - 2V_T(r) - E\\right) w(r) - \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) u(r)\n$$\n$$\nw''(r) = \\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2} \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) u(r) + \\left( \\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2} (V_c(r) - 2V_T(r) - E) + \\frac{6}{r^2} \\right) w(r)\n$$\n$$\nw''(r) = \\alpha \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) u(r) + \\left( \\alpha(V_c(r) - 2V_T(r) - E) + \\frac{6}{r^2} \\right) w(r)\n$$\nThese two equations can be written in matrix form, $y''(r) = K(r) y(r)$, where $y(r) = \\begin{bmatrix} u(r) \\\\ w(r) \\end{bmatrix}$ and $K(r)$ is a $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix:\n$$\nK(r) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha(V_c(r) - E) & \\alpha \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) \\\\\n\\alpha \\sqrt{8} V_T(r) & \\alpha(V_c(r) - 2V_T(r) - E) + \\frac{6}{r^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matches the matrix $K(r)$ provided in the problem statement, with $K_{11}(r) = \\alpha (V_c(r) - E)$, $K_{22}(r) = \\alpha (V_c(r) - 2 V_T(r) - E) + \\frac{6}{r^2}$, and $K_{12}(r) = K_{21}(r) = \\alpha \\sqrt{8} V_T(r)$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Solution\n\nThe derived system of coupled second-order ordinary differential equations is solved numerically using the matrix Numerov method, which is well-suited for equations of the form $y''(r) = K(r) y(r)$. The propagation formula is:\n$$\n\\left(I - \\frac{h^2}{12} K_{n+1}\\right) y_{n+1} = \\left(2I + \\frac{10h^2}{12} K_n\\right) y_n - \\left(I - \\frac{h^2}{12} K_{n-1}\\right) y_{n-1}\n$$\nwhere $y_n = y(r_n)$, $K_n = K(r_n)$, $h$ is the step size, and $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. This allows for step-by-step integration from the origin outwards.\n\nThe integration is performed on a discrete grid from $r=h$ to $r=r_{\\max}$, with $h=0.02 \\, \\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_{\\max}=25 \\, \\mathrm{fm}$. The boundary conditions for a regular solution at the origin are $u(r) \\propto r$ and $w(r) \\propto r^3$. We initialize the integration using the values for the first two grid points as specified: $u(h)=h, u(2h)=2h$ and $w(h)=0, w(2h)=0$. This simplified initialization implies that the D-wave component $w(r)$ is generated dynamically by the coupling term.\n\nAfter integrating out to $r_{\\max}$, the resulting wave functions $u(r)$ and $w(r)$ are unnormalized. Normalization is imposed by requiring $\\int_0^\\infty (u(r)^2 + w(r)^2) dr = 1$. This integral is numerically computed using the trapezoidal rule over the grid from $r=0$ to $r_{\\max}$, where we set $u(0)=0$ and $w(0)=0$. Let the normalization constant be $N = \\sqrt{\\int_0^{r_{\\max}} (u_{raw}(r)^2 + w_{raw}(r)^2) dr}$. The normalized wave functions are $u_{norm}(r) = u_{raw}(r)/N$ and $w_{norm}(r) = w_{raw}(r)/N$.\n\nFinally, the ${}^3D_1$-state probability, $P_D$, is calculated as the fraction of the total probability residing in the $D$-wave component:\n$$\nP_D = \\int_0^\\infty w_{norm}(r)^2 dr = \\frac{\\int_0^{r_{\\max}} w_{raw}(r)^2 dr}{\\int_0^{r_{\\max}} (u_{raw}(r)^2 + w_{raw}(r)^2) dr}\n$$\nThis calculation is repeated for each of the four parameter sets provided.",
