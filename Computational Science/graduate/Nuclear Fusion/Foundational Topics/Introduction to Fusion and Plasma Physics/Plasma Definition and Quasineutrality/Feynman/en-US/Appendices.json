This first exercise grounds the abstract principle of quasineutrality in a practical calculation relevant to tokamak operations. By analyzing a deuterium-tritium plasma with a common carbon impurity, you will connect the foundational concept of charge balance to the calculation of the effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, a key parameter that quantifies the impact of impurities on plasma resistivity and radiative losses .",

            "problem": "Consider a stationary, magnetically confined plasma in a tokamak operating with Deuterium–Tritium fuel and a trace concentration of fully stripped carbon impurities. Assume the ionic composition consists only of deuterons, tritons, and fully stripped carbon ions, with charge numbers $Z_D = 1$, $Z_T = 1$, and $Z_C = 6$, and number densities $n_D$, $n_T$, and $n_C$, respectively. Let the electron number density be $n_e$. The measured impurity concentration is $n_C / n_e = 0.01$, and the plasma is sufficiently hot that carbon is fully stripped.\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and the requirement of negligible net charge density at scales large compared to the Debye length, justify that the quasineutrality condition $n_e = n_D + n_T + 6 n_C$ holds for this mixture. Then, using the standard effective ion charge used in describing electron–ion collisional processes in fusion plasmas, compute the value of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for this composition. Express your final answer as a single exact number without units, and do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard scenario in magnetic confinement fusion plasma physics. All necessary information is provided to derive the quasineutrality condition and to compute the effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires a justification of the quasineutrality condition for the given plasma mixture, starting from fundamental principles. We begin with Gauss's law for the electric field, $\\mathbf{E}$, which in differential form is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the net volume charge density and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The net charge density is the algebraic sum of the charge densities of all constituent particle species. The plasma consists of electrons (e), deuterons (D), tritons (T), and fully stripped carbon ions (C). Let the elementary charge be $e$.\nThe charge of a single electron is $-e$. With an electron number density of $n_e$, the electron charge density is $-e n_e$.\nThe problem states the charge numbers for the ions are $Z_D = 1$, $Z_T = 1$, and $Z_C = 6$. The charge of an ion of species $i$ with charge number $Z_i$ is $Z_i e$.\nThe charge density for deuterons is $Z_D e n_D = (1) e n_D = e n_D$.\nThe charge density for tritons is $Z_T e n_T = (1) e n_T = e n_T$.\nThe charge density for carbon ions is $Z_C e n_C = (6) e n_C = 6 e n_C$.\n\nThe total net charge density $\\rho$ is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\n\\rho = -e n_e + e n_D + e n_T + 6 e n_C\n$$\n$$\n\\rho = e (n_D + n_T + 6 n_C - n_e)\n$$\nA fundamental property of a plasma is that it maintains quasineutrality on macroscopic length scales, i.e., on scales $L$ much larger than the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. Any local charge separation creates a strong electric field, which in turn drives particle motion that rapidly neutralizes the charge imbalance. Consequently, for a stationary plasma viewed on macroscopic scales, the net charge density is negligible, and we can set $\\rho \\approx 0$.\nSetting the expression for $\\rho$ to zero gives:\n$$\ne (n_D + n_T + 6 n_C - n_e) \\approx 0\n$$\nSince the elementary charge $e$ is a non-zero physical constant, the term in the parenthesis must be approximately zero. This leads directly to the quasineutrality condition:\n$$\nn_e = n_D + n_T + 6 n_C\n$$\nThis justifies the required condition based on Gauss's law and the physical principle of quasineutrality in a plasma.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, for this plasma composition. The effective ion charge is a measure of the average squared charge of the ions in the plasma, weighted by their relative abundance. It is a key parameter in calculating collisional processes, such as electrical resistivity and Bremsstrahlung radiation. The standard definition of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_i n_i Z_i^2}{n_e}\n$$\nwhere the summation is over all ion species $i$. For the given plasma, this becomes:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_D Z_D^2 + n_T Z_T^2 + n_C Z_C^2}{n_e}\n$$\nSubstituting the known charge numbers $Z_D=1$, $Z_T=1$, and $Z_C=6$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_D (1)^2 + n_T (1)^2 + n_C (6)^2}{n_e}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_D + n_T + 36 n_C}{n_e}\n$$\nTo proceed, we use the quasineutrality condition derived previously, $n_e = n_D + n_T + 6 n_C$. From this equation, we can express the sum of the deuteron and triton densities, $n_D + n_T$, in terms of the electron and carbon densities:\n$$\nn_D + n_T = n_e - 6 n_C\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $n_D + n_T$ into the equation for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{(n_e - 6 n_C) + 36 n_C}{n_e}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_e + 30 n_C}{n_e}\n$$\nWe can separate this fraction into two terms:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_e}{n_e} + \\frac{30 n_C}{n_e} = 1 + 30 \\frac{n_C}{n_e}\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured impurity concentration as the ratio of carbon ion density to electron density:\n$$\n\\frac{n_C}{n_e} = 0.01\n$$\nSubstituting this numerical value into our expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1 + 30 (0.01)\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1 + 0.3\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.3\n$$\nThe calculation does not depend on the relative proportion of deuterium to tritium, only on the concentration of the carbon impurity relative to the electron density. The final result is an exact number.",

            "solution": "A plasma is defined as a state of matter in which collective electromagnetic interactions dominate over binary neutral collisions, and in which charges are sufficiently mobile that macroscopic electric fields are typically small. The fundamental relation connecting the electric field to charge density is Gauss’s law, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho/\\varepsilon_0$, where $\\rho$ is the charge density. In a plasma, Debye shielding leads to suppression of electric fields over distances larger than the Debye length, and thus on macroscopic scales one commonly has $\\rho \\approx 0$. This condition is called quasineutrality and, for a multi-species ion-electron plasma, it can be written as\n$$\n\\sum_{i} Z_i e n_i - e n_e \\approx 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\sum_{i} Z_i n_i \\approx n_e,\n$$\nwhere $i$ sums over ion species with charge number $Z_i$ and number density $n_i$, and $n_e$ is the electron number density.\n\nIn the present plasma, the ion species are $\\mathrm{D}^+$ with $Z_{\\mathrm{D}} = 1$, $\\mathrm{T}^+$ with $Z_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1$, $\\mathrm{C}^{6+}$ with $Z_{\\mathrm{C}} = 6$, $\\mathrm{W}^{40+}$ with $Z_{\\mathrm{W}} = 40$, and $\\alpha = \\mathrm{He}^{2+}$ with $Z_{\\alpha} = 2$.

Electron-ion Coulomb collisions are governed by the long-range $1/r^2$ force and, for small-angle scattering, the electron-ion collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ scales proportionally to $Z_i^2 n_i$ for each ion species $i$ (at fixed electron temperature and Coulomb logarithm), because the squared momentum transfer and cross section enter with $Z_i^2$ while targets are present with density $n_i$. The total effective electron-ion collisionality is then proportional to $\\sum_i Z_i^2 n_i$. To represent this with a single parameter normalized to the electron density, one defines the effective charge by\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_i Z_i^2 n_i}{n_e}.\n$$\nThis emergent parameter encapsulates how impurities and multiply charged ions enhance electron-ion collisions relative to a singly ionized baseline.\n\nApplying this definition to our species set,\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1^2 n_{\\mathrm{D}^+} + 1^2 n_{\\mathrm{T}^+} + 6^2 n_{\\mathrm{C^{6+}}} + 40^2 n_{\\mathrm{W^{40+}}} + 2^2 n_{\\alpha}}{n_e}.\n$$\nGroup the fuel ions and use the neutrality-derived $n_{\\mathrm{DT}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{DT}} + 36\\,n_{\\mathrm{C^{6+}}} + 1600\\,n_{\\mathrm{W^{40+}}} + 4\\,n_{\\alpha}}{n_e} \n= \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{DT}}}{n_e} + 36\\,\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{C^{6+}}}}{n_e} + 1600\\,\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{W^{40+}}}}{n_e} + 4\\,\\frac{n_{\\alpha}}{n_e}.\n$$\nInsert the fractions $n_{\\mathrm{DT}}/n_e = 0.856$, $n_{\\mathrm{C^{6+}}}/n_e = 0.02$, $n_{\\mathrm{W^{40+}}}/n_e = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, and $n_{\\alpha}/n_e = 0.010$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.856 + 36 \\times 0.02 + 1600 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} + 4 \\times 0.010.\n$$\nCompute each term:\n$$\n36 \\times 0.02 = 0.72,\\quad 1600 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.16,\\quad 4 \\times 0.010 = 0.040.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.856 + 0.72 + 0.16 + 0.040 = 1.776.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.776$.\n\nFinally, verify quasineutrality by computing the normalized charge imbalance\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_i Z_i n_i - n_e}{n_e} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{DT}}}{n_e}\\right) + 6\\,\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{C^{6+}}}}{n_e} + 40\\,\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{W^{40+}}}}{n_e} + 2\\,\\frac{n_{\\alpha}}{n_e} - 1.\n$$\nUsing the previously computed $n_{\\mathrm{DT}}/n_e = 0.856$ and the given fractions,\n$$\n\\Delta = 0.856 + 0.12 + 0.004 + 0.020 - 1 = (0.856 + 0.144) - 1 = 1.000 - 1 = 0.\n$$\nThus the composition is exactly consistent with quasineutrality, as expected when the fuel-ion density is chosen from the neutrality constraint. The requested outputs are the dimensionless $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\Delta$.",
