This first exercise explores the fundamental relationship between electron temperature and collisionality, which governs resistivity.

For instance, it is not \"pseudo-profound or trivial\" because deriving the scaling from momentum balance, while a standard exercise, requires a non-trivial application of physical principles.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the steady-state momentum balance equation for the electron fluid. In an unmagnetized plasma subject to a steady electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, the electric force on the electrons is balanced by the frictional drag from collisions with ions. The force density on the electron fluid from the electric field is $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{E}} = -n_e e \\mathbf{E}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The frictional force density due to electron-ion collisions is denoted by $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$.\n\nIn steady state ($\\frac{d}{dt} = 0$), the momentum equation is:\n$$0 = -n_e e \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{R}_{ei}$$\n\nThe collisional friction force $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ represents the rate of momentum transfer from the electron fluid to the ion fluid. It is proportional to the relative drift velocity between the species and the momentum-transfer collision frequency. Assuming the massive ions are approximately stationary compared to the drifting electrons, the friction force density can be written as:\n$$\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{v}_d$$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the average drift velocity of the electrons, and $\\nu_{ei}$ is the effective electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency.\n\nThe electric current density $\\mathbf{j}$ is carried primarily by the electrons and is given by:\n$$\\mathbf{j} = -n_e e \\mathbf{v}_d$$\nWe can express the drift velocity in terms of the current density:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{n_e e}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$:\n$$\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{n_e e}\\right) = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{e} \\mathbf{j}$$\nNow, substituting this back into the momentum balance equation:\n$$n_e e \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{e} \\mathbf{j}$$\nRearranging to the form of Ohm's Law, $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\\mathbf{j} = \\left(\\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}\\right) \\mathbf{E}$$\nFrom this, we identify the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}$$\nThe collisional resistivity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$, is the inverse of the conductivity:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\sigma^{-1} = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2}$$\nThe temperature dependence of the resistivity is determined by the temperature dependence of the collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$. The problem specifies using the kinetic description of electron-ion small-angle Coulomb scattering. For an electron with velocity $v$ moving through a field of ions of density $n_i$ and charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e$, the momentum-transfer collision frequency scales as $\\nu(v) \\propto n_i Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 / v^3$. For a Maxwellian plasma, we average this over the electron velocity distribution. A characteristic velocity for electrons is the thermal velocity, $v_{th,e}$, which is related to the temperature by $\\frac{1}{2}m_e v_{th,e}^2 \\propto k_B T_e$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Thus, $v_{th,e} \\propto T_e^{1/2}$.\n\nThe effective collision frequency for the entire electron population will therefore scale as:\n$$\\nu_{ei} \\propto v_{th,e}^{-3} \\propto (T_e^{1/2})^{-3} = T_e^{-3/2}$$\nMore formally, the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency is given by:\n$$\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_i Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nUsing the quasineutrality condition $n_e = Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_i$, we can write this in terms of $n_e$:\n$$\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\nu_{ei}$ into the formula for resistivity:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\frac{m_e}{n_e e^2} \\left( \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{m_e^{1/2} e^2 Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln\\Lambda}{(k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nA more rigorous kinetic treatment using the Fokker-Planck equation introduces a numerical factor $\\gamma_E(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})$ that accounts for electron-electron collisions and the details of the velocity distribution perturbation. However, since $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is held constant, this factor is also constant and does not affect the scaling with temperature.\n\nThe problem states that $n_e$, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and $\\ln\\Lambda$ are held constant. All other terms ($m_e$, $e$, $k_B$) are fundamental constants. Therefore, the scaling of Spitzer resistivity with electron temperature is:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} \\propto T_e^{-3/2}$$\nThis shows that as the plasma gets hotter, it becomes a better conductor (less resistive), because faster electrons are deflected less by collisions with ions.\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities. Let $\\eta_1$ be the initial resistivity at temperature $T_1 = T_e$, and $\\eta_2$ be the final resistivity at temperature $T_2 = 2 T_e$.\n\nThe multiplicative factor by which $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$ changes is the ratio $\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1}$. Using the scaling law:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} = \\frac{C \\cdot (T_2)^{-3/2}}{C \\cdot (T_1)^{-3/2}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-3/2}$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. Substituting $T_2 = 2T_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} = \\left(\\frac{2T_1}{T_1}\\right)^{-3/2} = 2^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nThe corresponding percentage change, expressed as a decimal, is:\n$$\\text{Change} = \\frac{\\eta_2 - \\eta_1}{\\eta_1} = \\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} - 1 = 2^{-3/2} - 1$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$2^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.41421356} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.82842712} \\approx 0.35355339$$\nThe change is therefore:\n$$\\text{Change} \\approx 0.35355339 - 1 = -0.64644661$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $-0.6464$. The negative sign indicates a decrease in resistivity of approximately $64.64\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the multiplicative factor and the percentage change as a decimal.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is based on standard, verifiable principles of plasma physics. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a theoretical motivation for the dependence of collisional friction on the squared ion charge ($Z^2$) and the definition of the effective ion charge ($Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$); second, a numerical calculation of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a given plasma composition.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Motivation\n\nIn a weakly collisional, fully ionized plasma, electrical resistivity arises from the transfer of momentum from current-carrying electrons to the much heavier, and thus relatively stationary, ions. This momentum transfer occurs through long-range Coulomb collisions.\n\nLet us consider the steady-state momentum balance equation for the electron fluid in the presence of an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. The electric field exerts a force on the electrons, accelerating them. This directed motion is opposed by a frictional drag force, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{friction}}$, resulting from collisions with ions. In a steady state, these forces balance. The force on a single electron is $-e\\mathbf{E}$, where $-e$ is the electron charge. The total electric force per unit volume on the electron fluid is $n_e (-e)\\mathbf{E}$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density. The total frictional force per unit volume is the sum of momentum transfer rates from electrons to all ion species, which we denote as $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$. The momentum balance is:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{R}_{ei} = 0\n$$\nThe electrical current density, $\\mathbf{j}$, is carried primarily by the electrons, so $\\mathbf{j} = n_e (-e) \\mathbf{v}_d$, where $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the electron drift velocity relative to the ions. The frictional force $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ is proportional to this drift velocity. Specifically, for collisions with a single ion species $j$, the frictional force is $\\mathbf{R}_{ei,j} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei,j} \\mathbf{v}_d$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $\\nu_{ei,j}$ is the momentum-transfer collision frequency for electrons with ions of species $j$.\n\nThe total frictional force is the sum over all ion species present in the plasma:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = \\sum_j \\mathbf{R}_{ei,j} = -n_e m_e \\mathbf{v}_d \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j}\n$$\nThe crux of the argument lies in how the collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei,j}$, depends on the properties of the ion species, particularly its charge, $Z_j e$. The fundamental interaction is Rutherford scattering. The force between an electron and an ion of charge $Z_j e$ is given by Coulomb's law, which is proportional to the product of the charges, i.e., proportional to $Z_j$.\n\nThe scattering of an electron by an ion results in a change in the electron's momentum. The momentum transfer in a single collision depends on the scattering angle. For small-angle scattering, which dominates in a plasma, the change in perpendicular momentum is proportional to the force, and thus proportional to $Z_j$. The differential cross-section for Rutherford scattering is proportional to the square of the term describing the interaction strength:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left( Z_j e^2 \\right)^2 = Z_j^2 e^4\n$$\nThe momentum-transfer collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei,j}$, is obtained by integrating the momentum transfer over all impact parameters, weighted by the ion density $n_j$ and averaged over the electron velocity distribution. This process yields a collision frequency that is directly proportional to the ion density $n_j$ and the square of the ion charge $Z_j^2$:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2\n$$\nThe full expression for the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency for a Maxwellian electron distribution with temperature $T_e$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei,j} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_j Z_j^2 e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\ln\\Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The key dependencies are $\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the momentum balance equation:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} - n_e m_e \\mathbf{v}_d \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} = 0\n$$\nUsing $\\mathbf{v}_d = \\mathbf{j} / (-n_e e)$, we get:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} - n_e m_e \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{-n_e e}\\right) \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-n_e e \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{m_e}{e} \\left( \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} \\right) \\mathbf{j} = 0\n$$\nRearranging for Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{j}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\left[ \\frac{m_e}{n_e e^2} \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} \\right] \\mathbf{j}\n$$\nThe term in the brackets is the plasma resistivity, $\\eta$. Since $\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2$, the resistivity is proportional to the sum over all ion species weighted by their density and charge squared:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{n_e} \\sum_j n_j Z_j^2\n$$\nThis result motivates the definition of an effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We wish to describe the complex multi-species plasma as if it were a simpler plasma with only one type of ion with an effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, such that it produces the same total collisional friction. The definition that achieves this and simplifies the resistivity expression is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{\\sum_j n_j Z_j}\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\sum_j n_j Z_j$, is, by the condition of quasineutrality, equal to the total positive charge density, which must balance the electron charge density. Thus, $n_e = \\sum_j n_j Z_j$. Substituting this into the definition gives:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{n_e}\n$$\nWith this definition, the expression for resistivity simplifies elegantly. The summation term $\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2$ can be replaced by $n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The resistivity becomes:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{n_e} (n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nThus, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is a dimensionless parameter that represents the average collisionality of the ion mixture as experienced by the electrons. It directly scales the plasma resistivity and is a crucial parameter in determining plasma purity and performance in fusion devices.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$\n\nWe will now compute $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the provided data for the plasma composition. The formula is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{n_e} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{\\sum_j n_j Z_j}\n$$\nThe sum is over all ion species: Deuterium (D), Tritium (T), Helium (He), Carbon (C), and the three charge states of Tungsten (W).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number density for each tungsten charge state:\n$n_{24} = f_{24} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.20 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$n_{30} = f_{30} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.50 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$n_{38} = f_{38} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.30 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the total electron density $n_e = \\sum_j n_j Z_j$:\n\\begin{align*}\nn_e = & \\ n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}} + n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}} + n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}} + n_{24} Z_{24} + n_{30} Z_{30} + n_{38} Z_{38} \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1) + (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1) + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(2) + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(6) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(24) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(30) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(38) \\\\\n= & \\ 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 2.0 \\times 10^{19} + 1.2 \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n& + 4.8 \\times 10^{16} + 1.5 \\times 10^{17} + 1.14 \\times 10^{17} \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 + 1.2) \\times 10^{19} + (0.0048 + 0.0150 + 0.0114) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ (11.2 + 0.0312) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ 11.2312 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator, $\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2 = & \\ n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^2 + n_{24} Z_{24}^2 + n_{30} Z_{30}^2 + n_{38} Z_{38}^2 \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1^2) + (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1^2) + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(2^2) + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(6^2) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(24^2) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(30^2) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(38^2) \\\\\n= & \\ 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(36) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(576) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(900) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(1444) \\\\\n= & \\ 12.0 \\times 10^{19} + 7.2 \\times 10^{19} + 1.152 \\times 10^{18} + 4.5 \\times 10^{18} + 4.332 \\times 10^{18} \\\\\n= & \\ 19.2 \\times 10^{19} + (0.1152 + 0.4500 + 0.4332) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ (19.2 + 0.9984) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ 20.1984 \\times 10^{19}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio to find $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{20.1984 \\times 10^{19}}{11.2312 \\times 10^{19}} = \\frac{20.1984}{11.2312} \\approx 1.798418\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.798$. This value is greater than $1$, which is expected due to the presence of impurity ions with $Z>1$.",
