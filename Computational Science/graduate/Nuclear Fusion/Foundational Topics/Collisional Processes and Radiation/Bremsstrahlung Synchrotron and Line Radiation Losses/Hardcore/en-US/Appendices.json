            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The core of the problem is a standard calculation in plasma physics concerning the spectrum of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction $F$ of the total bremsstrahlung power that is emitted into photons with energy $\\hbar\\omega \\geq m_{e}c^{2}$. We start from the standard expression for the thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity (power per unit volume per unit angular frequency), $j_{\\omega}$, for a Maxwellian electron distribution in the non-relativistic limit. Under the assumption that the free-free Gaunt factor, $\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{ff}}$, is constant with respect to frequency $\\omega$, the emissivity has the form:\n$$ j_{\\omega} = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\nHere, $T_{e}$ is the electron temperature, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The term $K$ is a constant that depends on the electron density $n_{e}$, ion density $n_{i}$, average ion charge number $Z$, electron temperature $T_{e}$, and various fundamental physical constants. Since the problem requires calculating a fraction of the total power, this constant $K$ will cancel out and its explicit form is not needed, as correctly noted in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total power radiated per unit volume, $P_{total}$, by integrating $j_{\\omega}$ over all possible photon angular frequencies from $\\omega=0$ to $\\omega=\\infty$.\n$$ P_{total} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} j_{\\omega} \\, d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) \\, d\\omega $$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}$. Then $d\\omega = \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$ P_{total} = K \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\left(\\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\, du = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du $$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du = [-\\exp(-u)]_{0}^{\\infty} = -0 - (-1) = 1$.\nThus, the total radiated power is:\n$$ P_{total} = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the power radiated into photons with energy $\\hbar\\omega \\geq m_{e}c^{2}$, which we denote as $P_{high\\_energy}$. This corresponds to an angular frequency range from a minimum value $\\omega_{min} = \\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{\\hbar}$ to $\\infty$.\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = \\int_{\\omega_{min}}^{\\infty} j_{\\omega} \\, d\\omega = \\int_{m_{e}c^{2}/\\hbar}^{\\infty} K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) \\, d\\omega $$\nUsing the same substitution $u = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}$, the lower limit of integration for $u$ becomes:\n$$ u_{min} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{min}}{k_{B}T_{e}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\left(\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}} $$\nThe integral for the high-energy power is:\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = K \\int_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\left(\\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\, du = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\int_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du $$\nThe integral evaluates to $[-\\exp(-u)]_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} = -0 - (-\\exp(-u_{min})) = \\exp(-u_{min})$.\nTherefore, the high-energy power is:\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp(-u_{min}) = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\n\nThe desired fraction $F$ is the ratio of the high-energy power to the total power:\n$$ F = \\frac{P_{high\\_energy}}{P_{total}} = \\frac{K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right)}{K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}} $$\nThe pre-factors cancel, yielding the analytical expression for the fraction:\n$$ F = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this fraction for the given plasma parameters. The electron temperature is given as $T_{e}=50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, which means the thermal energy is $k_{B}T_{e} = 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_{e}c^{2} \\approx 511.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\nThe argument of the exponential is the ratio of these two energies:\n$$ \\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}} = \\frac{511.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{50\\,\\mathrm{keV}} = 10.22 $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\exp(-10.22) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ F \\approx 3.64405 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ F \\approx 3.64 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis result represents the very small fraction of the total radiated power carried by extremely energetic photons, which originate from the high-energy tail of the Maxwellian electron velocity distribution.",

The minor ambiguity in the significant figures of the given rate coefficients is superseded by the explicit instruction to round the final answer to four significant figures, a common convention in physics problems to guide the required precision of the final result.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the line-radiation power density from carbon impurities in a D-T plasma. The radiation originates from electron-impact excitation of impurity ions followed by radiative decay. The problem specifies that we only need to consider line radiation from the hydrogen-like carbon ion, $\\mathrm{C}^{5+}$, as the fully stripped ion, $\\mathrm{C}^{6+}$, has no electrons to excite.\n\nThe number density of the radiating species, $\\mathrm{C}^{5+}$, is a fraction $f_{5+}$ of the total carbon impurity density $n_Z$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} = f_{5+} n_Z$$\n\nThe problem is set in the coronal limit. In this model, it is assumed that every collisional excitation of an ion from its ground state to an excited state is followed by one or more radiative decays that return the ion to the ground state. Collisional de-excitation is negligible. This implies that the total energy radiated per excitation event is equal to the energy of the excited level relative to the ground state.\n\nThe rate of collisional excitations per unit volume from the ground state ($n=1$) to an excited state $n$ is given by the product of the densities of the colliding particles (electrons and C$^{5+}$ ions) and the excitation rate coefficient $q_{1\\to n}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{exc}, n} = n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n}$$\n\nThe power radiated per unit volume, $P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n}$, due to excitations to level $n$ is this rate multiplied by the energy released per event, $\\Delta E_{n1}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n} = R_{\\mathrm{exc}, n} \\Delta E_{n1} = n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n\nThe total line-radiation power density, $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, is the sum of the power radiated from all considered excited levels ($n=2, 3, 4$ in this case):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\sum_{n=2}^{4} P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n} = \\sum_{n=2}^{4} n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\nSubstituting $n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} = f_{5+} n_Z$, we get:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = n_e n_Z f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n\nThe problem defines the impurity cooling function, $\\Lambda(T_e)$, through the relation $P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = n_e n_Z \\Lambda(T_e)$. By comparing this with our expression for $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, we can derive the expression for $\\Lambda(T_e)$:\n$$n_e n_Z \\Lambda(T_e) = n_e n_Z f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n$$\\Lambda(T_e) = f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\nThis is the requested expression for the cooling function. Now we proceed to compute its numerical value and the corresponding power density.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy differences $\\Delta E_{n1} = E_1 - E_n$. The energy levels are given by the hydrogenic formula $E_n = -Z^2 R_\\infty / n^2$, with $Z=6$ and $R_\\infty = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe energy difference is:\n$$\\Delta E_{n1} = \\left(-\\frac{Z^2 R_\\infty}{1^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{Z^2 R_\\infty}{n^2}\\right) = Z^2 R_\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)$$\nWe calculate this for $n=2, 3, 4$:\nFor $n=2$:\n$$\\Delta E_{21} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 367.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nFor $n=3$:\n$$\\Delta E_{31} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{8}{9} = 435.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nFor $n=4$:\n$$\\Delta E_{41} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{15}{16} = 459.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNow we compute the sum in the expression for $\\Lambda(T_e)$. The energies must be converted to Joules using the elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602177 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1} = q_{1\\to 2}\\Delta E_{21} + q_{1\\to 3}\\Delta E_{31} + q_{1\\to 4}\\Delta E_{41}$.\nUsing the given rate coefficients:\n$q_{1\\to 2} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$q_{1\\to 3} = 0.7 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$q_{1\\to 4} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nThe sum in units of $\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}}$ is:\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = (2.0 \\times 10^{-14})(367.2) + (0.7 \\times 10^{-14})(435.2) + (0.3 \\times 10^{-14})(459.0) $$\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = (734.4 + 304.64 + 137.7) \\times 10^{-14} = 1176.74 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = 1.17674 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow we calculate a numerical value for the cooling function $\\Lambda(T_e)$.

The solution is:\n$$\nc_n(t) = c_n(0) \\exp(-n(n+1)Dt)\n$$\nwhere $c_n(0)$ are the coefficients of the expansion of the initial distribution $f(\\mu,0)$.\n\nThe initial condition is given as:\n$$\nf(\\mu,0) = 1 + a\\,P_{2}(\\mu)\n$$\nSince the Legendre polynomial of degree $0$ is $P_0(\\mu)=1$, we can write the initial condition as:\n$$\nf(\\mu,0) = P_0(\\mu) + a\\,P_{2}(\\mu)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the general expansion $f(\\mu,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n(0) P_n(\\mu)$, we can identify the non-zero initial coefficients:\n$$\nc_0(0) = 1, \\qquad c_2(0) = a\n$$\nAll other coefficients $c_n(0)$ are zero for $n \\neq 0$ and $n \\neq 2$.\n\nSubstituting these initial coefficients into the expression for $c_n(t)$, we find the time-dependent coefficients:\n$$\nc_0(t) = c_0(0) \\exp(-0(0+1)Dt) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\n$$\nc_2(t) = c_2(0) \\exp(-2(2+1)Dt) = a \\exp(-6Dt)\n$$\nAll other $c_n(t)$ remain zero for all time $t$.\nTherefore, the solution for the distribution function is:\n$$\nf(\\mu,t) = c_0(t)P_0(\\mu) + c_2(t)P_2(\\mu) = 1 + a \\exp(-6Dt) P_2(\\mu)\n$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the time evolution of the average of $\\sin^2\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\sin^{2}\\!\\alpha(\\mu)\\, f(\\mu,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2\\alpha = 1 - \\cos^2\\alpha = 1 - \\mu^2$, and substituting the expression for $f(\\mu,t)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-\\mu^2) \\left[1 + a \\exp(-6Dt) P_2(\\mu)\\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nWe split the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-\\mu^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu + \\frac{a \\exp(-6Dt)}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-\\mu^2)P_2(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-\\mu^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\left[\\mu - \\frac{\\mu^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nFor the second integral, we express $1-\\mu^2$ in terms of Legendre polynomials. We know $P_0(\\mu)=1$ and $P_2(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2}(3\\mu^2 - 1)$. From the expression for $P_2(\\mu)$, we can write $\\mu^2 = \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{3}$. Using $P_0(\\mu)=1$, this becomes $\\mu^2 = \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{3}P_0(\\mu)$.\nThus,\n$$\n1-\\mu^2 = P_0(\\mu) - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{3}P_0(\\mu)\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}P_0(\\mu) - \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\mu)\n$$\nNow, the second integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-\\mu^2)P_2(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}P_0(\\mu) - \\frac{2}{3}P_2(\\mu)\\right) P_2(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nUsing the orthogonality property of Legendre polynomials, $\\int_{-1}^{1} P_m(\\mu)P_n(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{2}{2n+1}\\delta_{mn}$:\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{3}\\int_{-1}^{1} P_0(\\mu)P_2(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu - \\frac{2}{3}\\int_{-1}^{1} P_2(\\mu)P_2(\\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nThe first term is zero since $0 \\neq 2$. The second term is:\n$$\n= 0 - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{2(2)+1}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{15}\n$$\nSubstituting the values of the integrals back into the expression for $\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) + \\frac{a \\exp(-6Dt)}{2}\\left(-\\frac{4}{15}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2a}{15}\\exp(-6Dt)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t)$ as a function of $t$, $D$, and $a$.\nAs a check, for an isotropic distribution ($a=0$), $\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle = 2/3$. As $t \\to \\infty$, the distribution relaxes to isotropy, and $\\langle \\sin^{2}\\alpha\\rangle(t) \\to 2/3$, which is the correct physical limit.",
